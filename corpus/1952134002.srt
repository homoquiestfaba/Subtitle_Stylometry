1
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,989
Eric, be back in a minute,
all right? Keep hitting.

2
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,834
Hey, Frank.

3
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,106
Frank, you got a minute?

4
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,645
I just got off the phone with the promoter
for the December fight.

5
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,451
- Oh, yeah? What did he say?
- Pulling you from the card.

6
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,684
- You're kidding me.
- No.

7
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,158
Why would they do that?

8
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,023
Come on, Frankie. You know why.

9
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,737
- Yeah.
- Nothing I can do.

10
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,338
Right.

11
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,306
<i>Don't worry, papi.
There'll be other fights, right?</i>

12
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,104
Hell, yeah.

13
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,988
I mean, they can't just do that.
You have a contract.

14
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,023
- They can do whatever they want.
- Well, sue them.

15
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,957
Yeah, well, who am I gonna sue?
What, who am I gonna sue?

16
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,790
I can't sue nobody.

17
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,495
- Mom, Justin hit me.
- No, I didn't, she's lying.

18
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,827
Did too!
- No, I didn't!

19
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,697
Did too!
Who was a liar?

20
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,770
- She's lying.
- Just go wash up.

21
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,736
- Dinner's ready.
But...

22
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,067
- Do you see that?
Hey.

23
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,869
You heard your mother. Get out.

24
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,012
- Well, she just hit...
Now.

25
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,203
- But she...
Now.

26
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,647
Man.

27
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,748
Can Hector do something?

28
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,015
I'm not dealing
with that parasite anymore.

29
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,924
I took all my stuff out of the gym
and out of the locker.

30
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,489
Oh.

31
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,496
"Oh," what?
What's that supposed to mean?

32
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,726
I was counting on the money.
We have no more.

33
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,564
- What am I gonna do? I'm behind bills...
- I know, I was...

34
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,673
I'm counting on it too, okay?
I'll figure something out, I will.

35
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,002
I promise you, I will. Come on.

36
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,237
- Don't be like that.
- Don't... Don't "come on" me.

37
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,114
Stop it.

38
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,213
Stop it.

39
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,253
- Go to basketball tryouts today?
- No.

40
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,194
Why not?

41
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,699
Because I don't wanna play basketball.
I wanna play football.

42
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,769
He's gonna get hurt if he plays football.

43
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,169
- Tell him he needs to play basketball.
- You need to play basketball.

44
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,310
Wow, that's just the enthusiasm he needs.

45
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,241
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to encourage him.

46
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,278
I would, but he can't shoot hoops.

47
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,473
- Why not?
Why not?

48
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,880
When he dribbles,
he looks like a retard.

49
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,519
- I can dribble.
No, you can't.

50
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,915
- I can.
- No, you can't.

51
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,956
- Yes, I can.
- I've seen you dribble. You can't dribble.

52
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,888
Your sister dribbles better than you.

53
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,219
- Can I box?
- Can you box?

54
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,592
- What are you gonna box, oranges?
No boxing.

55
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,165
- Out of your head.
- Why not?

56
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,802
Because I say so.

57
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,994
Don't look at me.

58
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,572
If you throw a punch the way you dribble,
you're not even gonna see 13.

59
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,141
I can't be worse than you.

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,540
- Hey, what'd you say?
- Nothing.

61
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,377
You said something. I wanna hear it.

62
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,416
- I didn't say anything.
What'd you say?

63
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,714
I didn't say anything.

64
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,484
- So?
- What?

65
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,791
What now? Jesus Christ.

66
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,471
- You check the fuse box?
It's not the fuse box.

67
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,611
We're the only ones out.

68
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,971
Did you pay Con Ed?

69
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,018
You wanna do this in front
of the kids right now?

70
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Can you turn on the lights?
I'm scared.

71
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,323
Oh, sweetie, don't be scared.
Come here, come here, come here.

72
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,119
There's nothing to be scared of.

73
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,455
The dark is actually a lot of fun.

74
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,724
Hey, hey, Justin, grab your plantain
and throw it at me.

75
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,125
- What?
- Come on, throw it at me.

76
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,202
I'll get in trouble.
You're not gonna.

77
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,134
- Throw it at me.
- What are you doing?

78
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,671
- What are you doing?
- Watch.

79
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,401
- Get it in my mouth.
You're cleaning this up, okay?

80
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,805
Yeah, okay, yeah. Come on.

81
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,711
- Ready? You ready?
- All right, watch your sister.

82
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,977
She's gonna outdo you.

83
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,820
One for the team!
One for the team.

84
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,189
- Guess whose turn it is.
- Mom's.

85
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,661
That's right.
- I'm not...

86
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,324
Don't you dare throw that.
Don't throw that at me.

87
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,993
You're playing this game
no matter what.

88
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,867
- That's right, that's right.
I ain't playing this game.

89
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,067
- Yes, you are.
- Come on, concentrate, woman, focus.

90
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,236
Don't throw that at me.
- Open up, Mom.

91
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,245
Come on, it loves you.

92
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,475
Wait, wait, baby,
let me do it, let me do it.

93
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,175
Let me get it, Mama.
Watch, watch.

94
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,651
Come on, open your mouth. She's right.
Come on.

95
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,847
That's right. You know how we like it.

96
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,514
Oh!
Ah.

97
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,856
You spit it out. I got it in.
I wanna demand a recount.

98
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,053
Justin.

99
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,788
Aw.

100
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,627
All right, that's enough.
No more. Come on.

101
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,962
We're not gonna waste all the food.
That was fun.

102
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,334
- You're not scared anymore, right?
No, I'm not.

103
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,841
- What was that?
Not anymore.

104
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,654
CHILDREN
Trick or treat!

105
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,763
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

106
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,496
Hey, can I help you?

107
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,606
Yeah, New York City
Department of Housing.

108
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,868
Trick or treat.
- What's going on?

109
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,738
What is this?

110
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,908
Sorry, man. You got two hours
to pack your stuff.

111
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,362
Come on.

112
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,910
All right, how much do we have?
Two hundred and twenty-nine.

113
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,706
Two hundred and twenty-nine, okay.

114
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,780
If I sell the car, we could probably get

115
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,215
what, another 800, maybe 900,
if we're lucky.

116
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,083
- I'll look for a job tomorrow.
- You can't look for a job.

117
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,487
Who's gonna take care of Tina?
Come on, we can't afford it.

118
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,595
- Where are we gonna go tonight?
- I don't know, I don't know.

119
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,358
Why don't we just go to a hotel,
sleep the night, try to figure things out?

120
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,462
Why don't we call your cousin Benny?

121
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,299
No way. We're not staying with Benny.
There's no way I'm staying with him.

122
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,107
He's been shot, like, five times.
He's a goddamn hoodlum.

123
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,509
I can call Luis.

124
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,343
What are you thinking?

125
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,453
I wasn't thinking. I mean...

126
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,921
Hey, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,857
Look, I'm fine. Just forget it.
Just forget it, all right?

128
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,002
Check, please. Check.

129
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,201
Everything okay here?
- Yeah, it's great.

130
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,365
- What's the damage?
- Uh, it's 16 pumpkins.

131
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,011
Sixteen, that's a lot of pumpkins.

132
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,579
- How much are the shakes?
Five dollars apiece.

133
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,545
- And the fries?
Three ninety-five.

134
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,618
Okay, so five and five and four is what, 14?

135
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,618
Well, there's tax too.

136
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,885
Right, right, tax.
Who can forget the government, right?

137
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,255
Excuse me. I'll give you a minute.

138
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,924
Can I get some money, please?

139
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,362
What's the matter?

140
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,197
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

141
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,601
What, what, what?
What's the matter?

142
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,467
Come on.

143
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,078
Look, this isn't easy
on either one of us, all right,

144
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,612
but we gotta be strong.
Gotta be strong, baby.

145
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,910
We've gotta make a pact, no crying
in front of the kids. You got me?

146
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,850
- I'm just tired.
- I know, I know.

147
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,150
But the best thing for us right now
is to stay together, you got it?

148
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,952
Yeah.
We're gonna make it.

149
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,958
I promise you, we're gonna make it.

150
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,391
- Okay.
- All right?

151
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,156
Yeah.

152
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,559
I love you. Now come on.

153
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,102
Let's pay the bill
and go to sleep, all right?

154
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,102
I'll take care of it.
Take the kids out.

155
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,434
- I need a moment, okay?
- All right.

156
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,076
Come on.

157
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,205
Come on, hurry up.
Put all the candy away.

158
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,742
I got it.

159
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,546
I'm not done watching.
You pick them up.

160
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,816
Why do I gotta go pick it up?
Why can't you?

161
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,983
Don't start.

162
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,755
- But we...
- I got enough things on my mind.

163
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,830
- What the hell you doing?
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,596
- I'm really sorry.
- Clean it up.

165
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,769
Help him.

166
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,612
Here you go.

167
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,277
Here you go.

168
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,314
Here you go.

169
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,392
- Don't you usually give me 75?
- What about those bricks you dropped?

170
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,429
- You expect me to pay for that?
- Come on. I broke 10 bricks.

171
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,532
How much are bricks,
50 cents each?

172
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,031
You want the 50 or not?

173
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,832
Come on, man. All I'm saying is
that 10 bricks at 50 cents is how much?

174
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,803
I mean, do the math.

175
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,435
You know what?
I don't got time for this shit. Take the 75.

176
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,046
Just don't ever expect me
to hire you again.

177
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,880
It's your choice.

178
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,417
Keep it.

179
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,886
There's a smart man if I ever saw one.

180
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,821
Hey, have you got any work
coming up in the next few days?

181
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,120
I don't know if you noticed
all the decorations

182
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,162
all over the place, but it's Christmas.

183
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,767
Thanks a lot.

184
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,575
- Ha.
- You scared me, you idiot.

185
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,040
So, what you doing?

186
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,446
Just trying to bring some
Christmas spirit to this place.

187
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,613
Oh, yeah, it's really working.
Look at that.

188
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,596
- How was work?
- I made 50 bucks.

189
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:36,733
- You usually make 75.
- Yeah, usually.

190
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,336
Look, I don't wanna talk about it,
all right?

191
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,467
Okay.

192
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,915
Where are the kids?

193
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,753
Justin's outside
playing with some friends

194
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:04,089
and Christina's on the bed playing with
some toys the Salvation Army dropped off.

195
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,640
Hey, Tina.

196
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,278
- Who's your friend?
Smiddy.

197
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,446
Hi.

198
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,119
Get the hell out of here.

199
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,311
Angie.

200
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,613
Angie. I can't find my jacket.

201
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,817
What?

202
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,254
I think somebody stole my jacket.

203
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,628
Can you believe that? Jesus.

204
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,577
Hey, excuse me,
can I talk to you for a second?

205
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,613
Someone stole my jacket last night.
I need to file a report.

206
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,411
Actually, Mr. Diaz, I was
just about to come and find you.

207
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,180
Uh, follow me. I need to talk to you.

208
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,921
Did you find it?

209
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,362
You're not gonna believe this.

210
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,762
You're not gonna believe it.

211
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,494
What? What's wrong?

212
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,195
We gotta leave the shelter.

213
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,362
What?

214
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,772
Remember that list I put us on
for the apartments a couple months ago?

215
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,744
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, they called us.

216
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,882
- You're kidding me.
- Yeah.

217
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,417
We're gonna be in our own apartment
for Christmas after all.

218
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,713
What do you think of that?

219
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,121
I'm not kidding. I gotta see
the property manager in an hour.

220
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,885
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't I tell you?

221
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,222
- Didn't I promise you?
- You did, you did.

222
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,389
- I promised you, right?
- Is Santa Claus gonna come this year?

223
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,900
There is no Santa Claus.
Really, stupid, think about it.

224
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,129
How can Santa Claus
go to everyone's house

225
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,297
in the whole wide world in one night?

226
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,672
Don't listen to your brother. He doesn't
know his ass from his mouth.

227
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,836
Sweetie, you know what?
Santa already came.

228
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:47,350
- He brought us a beautiful apartment.
- But I want my doll back.

229
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,850
Aw.

230
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,979
- Well...
You know what Papa's gonna do?

231
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,684
I'm gonna call Santa personally
and make sure that he hooks you up

232
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,556
with whatever it is you want.

233
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,663
Let me get a little giggle out of you.

234
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,025
- Nothing?
- She's tired.

235
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,963
All right. I gotta go, honey. Come on.

236
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,194
Why don't you take
the troublemaker with you,

237
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
and I'll take Tina to the clinic
and pack everything up?

238
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,672
You get the easy way out, huh?

239
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,332
- You know he can't stay here.
- I get stuck with him.

240
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,570
- Come on, Justin.
- Why can't I stay here?

241
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,477
Because you're coming with me, that's
why. Come on, bundle up, champ.

242
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,245
- Bundle up.
- You can't go out like that.

243
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,788
Come on, baby. I'm five blocks
from the subway, then a couple of blocks...

244
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,721
Just take that.

245
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,919
- See you back here in a couple of hours?
- With a key.

246
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,031
With the key to our new apartment.

247
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,204
Thank God.

248
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,070
Oh, it's freezing.

249
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,736
- Come on, let's go.
- Why can't I stay here?

250
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,543
Because you can't, that's why.
It's not safe.

251
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,649
- I can protect myself.
- Oh, yeah?

252
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,721
You can protect yourself
from a grown man?

253
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,119
Yeah, hell, yeah.

254
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,161
Yeah, let someone try something.

255
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,923
- Where the hell you get that?
- I got it from a friend.

256
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,964
Can I see it?

257
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,669
What the hell are you doing with this,
man? What's wrong with you?

258
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,362
- What?
- Carrying shit like that.

259
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,734
- What's wrong with you?
- I can protect myself.

260
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,001
- You can protect yourself from a man?
- Yeah.

261
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,236
- You think you could?
- Yeah.

262
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,278
Come on, protect yourself.
What you gonna do now?

263
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,883
What you gonna do now?
Come on, what you gonna do?

264
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,020
Protect yourself.
If you can do it, man,

265
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,088
if you can protect from me,
you can stay here all day. Come on.

266
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,152
- Ugh.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,226
Just as I thought.

268
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,991
You're an asshole.

269
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,928
Don't ever let me catch you
with a knife again, you hear me?

270
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,601
Whatever.

271
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,215
- Go under, go under.
- What?

272
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,944
Go under.

273
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,984
Go, go!

274
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,278
Hi. Merry Christmas. I'm Frank Diaz.

275
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,754
I'm here to see Carita
about an apartment.

276
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,661
Oh, Jesus.

277
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,522
Oh, look. Hey, hey, look.
Yankee Stadium, man.

278
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,956
- We can watch the game from here.
- Oh.

279
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:20,591
- That's cool.
Okay, Mr. Diaz, it's $201 a month.

280
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:25,203
And utilities included,
first and last month's security.

281
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,498
There's three bedrooms down the hall.

282
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,699
This is it. What do you think?

283
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,072
Well, it's not exactly
where God left his shoes,

284
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,680
but it'll do.

285
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,907
You can actually move in today.

286
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,382
That's great, that'd be great.

287
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,519
If you're handy, you can, mm,
fix it up, do something with it.

288
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,022
Yeah, I know. Put a little muscle to it,
maybe paint it, you know?

289
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,024
- Yeah.
- Change the floors a bit.

290
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,891
- I could do something with that.
- Yeah, well, wonderful, wonderful.

291
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,160
Um, why don't we go back to my office,
and we can get the paperwork filled out?

292
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,462
It's Christmas Eve.
I know you'd like to be in.

293
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,936
- I would love that. You saw that, man?
I know.

294
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,575
- How great is that?
Awesome.

295
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,836
Here you go. Fill this out.

296
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:13,607
- What is this?
The application. You need a pen?

297
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,816
Sir, you need a pen?

298
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,651
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, thank you.
Okay.

299
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,193
You all right?

300
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,495
Yeah.

301
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,835
You know what, do you mind
if I filled it out right outside?

302
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,669
- Be just a second.
All right.

303
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,244
Thank you. Come with me.

304
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,116
Here, fill that out.

305
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,524
- Why?
- Just fill it out.

306
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,091
Why can't you do it?

307
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,861
Because my wrist is killing me
from the last fight, that's why.

308
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,135
It is. My wrist is killing me.

309
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,605
Just fill it out, all right?

310
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,472
Then anything you don't understand,
just ask me, all right?

311
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:22,577
Here's your application,
and here's the $400.

312
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,349
Well, actually, it's $398,

313
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,052
but I'll get you the 2 bucks
in about two days, all right?

314
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,095
Okay, that's fine.

315
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,635
You didn't fill out
the employment section.

316
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,396
Right, because, uh,
I'm in between jobs right now.

317
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,062
I'm a boxer.

318
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,936
One of the requirements
in qualifying for an apartment here

319
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,839
is that you have some form of income.

320
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,572
No, I do, I do.
I just work off the books, that's all.

321
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,240
So it's, like, construction and, you know,
work hasn't been steady lately...

322
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,615
Unfortunately, I can't put down
that you work off the books.

323
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,723
Right. I'm gonna have a few jobs
lined up right after Christmas.

324
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,984
That won't work.
Management is very strict,

325
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,628
and since you don't have
a guaranteed form of income,

326
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,357
I can't process your application.
I will have to put you back on the list.

327
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,398
What are you talking about?

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,565
I can't give you the apartment unless
you are presently employed, on the books.

329
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,141
Your name will go on the list.

330
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,871
When an apartment becomes available,
I'll contact you.

331
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,413
My family's in a shelter,

332
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,143
and I can't do it anymore.

333
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,446
We just can't do it anymore.
Do you understand?

334
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
I don't know what else to tell you.

335
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,022
You can tell me the apartment is ours,
and we can move in there today.

336
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,821
I can't do that.

337
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,227
Come on, it's Christmas.
It's Christmas. Give me a break.

338
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,526
Can you cut me a break, please?
I promise you,

339
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,193
I'll have a job by the first of the year.
I guarantee.

340
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,532
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

341
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,234
I have a family too, and if I
put you down for the apartment

342
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,538
and get caught, I can lose my job.

343
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,077
Justin, wait for me outside.

344
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,183
- Give her hell.
- Yeah.

345
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,156
Let me explain something to you.
Let me explain my situation to you, maybe.

346
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,024
Maybe you'll understand, um.

347
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,058
Me and my family,
we've been having some hard months,

348
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,136
and all we want is to have an apartment
for Christmas, that's all.

349
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,739
That's all we want.
Look, I understand your position.

350
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,171
I know what you're in,
but imagine having children

351
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,810
and sleeping in a dirty shelter

352
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,105
on a cold floor for three months.
Imagine that.

353
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,579
I understand, I understand...
- No, but are you imagining that for me?

354
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,515
Yes, I understand your position.

355
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,179
Many of the tenants who live here
were in your shoes at one time or another,

356
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,884
but like I said, there's nothing I can do.

357
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,487
Right.

358
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,925
Nothing you can do.

359
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,467
You know, let me ask you something.

360
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,041
How many of those tenants
that were in my shoes

361
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,542
went into the Gulf War
and fought for this country?

362
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,738
- How many of them, huh?
- Excuse me?

363
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,578
It's a simple question.
How many of them went and fought?

364
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,414
I went and joined up
and fought for this country

365
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,522
when I was 18 years old, okay?

366
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,218
And you're telling me that it's okay
for me to risk my life,

367
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,886
risk my life for your family, but you
don't have to put anything on the line

368
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,363
- for me and my family.
- It's not like that.

369
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:27,699
Yeah. Yeah, it is like that.
It's just like that.

370
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,670
Wait, wait, uh. Come back, please.

371
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,641
Do you get a check
from the government each month?

372
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,874
I don't get anything.
I don't get a dime. I don't get nothing.

373
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,712
Look, I leave the office at 6 tonight.

374
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,320
If you can find a job by then,
the apartment's yours.

375
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,150
That's the best I can do.

376
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,986
Otherwise, and I'm sorry,

377
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,856
but I'll have to call
the next person on the list.

378
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,272
- Thank you. I know what you're doing.
- Here.

379
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,238
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hm.

380
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,490
So, what happened in there?

381
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,694
So we didn't get it?

382
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,063
No, we didn't get it, Einstein.
Not yet, anyway.

383
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,034
- Where we going now?
- To get a job.

384
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,570
Why?

385
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,732
Why? Because I need a job
to get an apartment, that's why.

386
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,970
Why didn't you tell her you already
have a job, make something up?

387
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,048
- And when she finds out I lied?
- We'll already have the keys.

388
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,480
We'll get thrown out of
another apartment. Great.

389
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,847
No. But why can't you just...?
No, you could...

390
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,218
- Actually, you could just tell her...
- Guy, you're not making sense.

391
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,723
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up. You shut up.

392
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,986
I'm just trying to help.

393
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,561
- Know how you can help?
- How?

394
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,027
By shutting up.

395
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,862
<i>MAN
Stand clear of the closing door.</i>

396
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,338
Oh, man.

397
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,179
I'm hungry.

398
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,221
Well, you should have ate
at the shelter.

399
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,087
Can we eat
when we get off the train?

400
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,229
No, no, no, all the money
I got is for the apartment.

401
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,458
Should have went with Mom.

402
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,567
Yeah, you should have.

403
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,874
Who lives here?

404
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,778
Just mind your business and
don't embarrass me, all right?

405
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,188
- How you doing?
- What are you doing here?

406
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,688
- I told you I got no work today.
- I know, I know,

407
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,918
and I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to talk to your father.

408
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,756
- About what?
- It's about...

409
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,955
Hello, Mr. Montecello,
how are you?

410
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,362
- How you doing?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

411
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,365
I know it's Christmas Eve
and whatnot,

412
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:49,131
but I got something very important
to talk to you about, if you got a minute.

413
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,706
We're a little busy right now.

414
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,469
Yeah, I realize this,
but this is really important.

415
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:59,543
- Come on, it's cold. Let him in, come on.
Thank you, thank you.

416
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,120
You're just gonna leave me out here?

417
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,749
Go over there and play with the kids.

418
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,892
- Play ball, make friends.
- Why can't I...?

419
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,721
It's freezing though. I'm cold.

420
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,990
What's this about
that you gotta come bother us today?

421
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,365
Yeah, well, this isn't easy to say,
but, uh, me and my family,

422
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,165
we're living in a shelter.

423
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,605
- What are you, homeless?
- Just about.

424
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,005
You hungry or something?

425
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,875
- Dad, give him a few meatballs and:
- That's okay, I didn't come here for food.

426
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:35,179
- I didn't come here for handouts.
- Come on, have a bite. Have a bite.

427
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,344
I'm fine. Thank you very much,
but I'm fine.

428
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,082
Come on, my wife made 200 of them.
Have a bite.

429
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,523
You know, it's an insult to turn down
an Italian woman's cooking.

430
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,596
MoNTECELLo: Come on.
- I don't wanna be insulting anybody, right?

431
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,924
MoNTECELLo: It's good.
- Sure, sure.

432
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,067
Be good for you. Have a bite.

433
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,537
- Wow. That's great stuff.
The best.

434
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,539
- You want more?
- No, I'm great. It hit the spot. Thank you.

435
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,042
Look, I know you guys are very busy,
and I don't wanna take up your time,

436
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,581
but the reason I'm here is, uh,
I'm a boxer.

437
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,742
And I was up for this big fight,
and I got taken off the card.

438
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,945
I knew I recognized you.

439
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,556
You're the guy that got his ass kicked
by Rodriguez

440
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,590
back at the Garden,
like two months ago.

441
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,854
- I lost the fight, yeah.
- You threw in the towel.

442
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,554
I saw it on ESPN.

443
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,293
You'd have had a shot if you didn't quit.
Hit him with a couple good punches.

444
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:28,337
You still would have got your head beat in,
but you would have had a shot, at least.

445
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,600
- As I was saying, um...
- How can we help you?

446
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,505
Well, that's why I'm here, sir.

447
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,169
In order for me to qualify
for this apartment,

448
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,976
we need somebody to tell the people
who are running the building, um,

449
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,309
that I work for you guys on the books.

450
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,819
- But you don't work for us on the books.
I know.

451
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,787
- You want us to lie?
- No, I'm not asking you to lie.

452
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,053
I'm not asking you that.
I just need proof of employment

453
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,220
so I can get my family out of this shelter,

454
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,663
and all I need is a W-2 form
or a paystub, anything like that.

455
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,201
- We can't do that. No way.
My family will be very appreciative.

456
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,068
I'll work it off. I'll work weekends,
I'll come here whenever you guys need it,

457
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,075
- whenever. Holidays, I don't care.
- No can do.

458
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,271
Come on, vinny. It's Christmastime.
The guy's down on his luck.

459
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,315
Let's give him a break.
Maybe we could do something with this.

460
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,918
We can't do it.
We're not hiring anyone on the books,

461
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,419
and we for shit sure
ain't lying to the government.

462
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,613
Forget it.

463
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,919
We'll lose our license. What happens
to us when we lose our license? Huh?

464
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,086
- For this?
- All right.

465
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,323
Look, I'm sorry.
My son runs the business.

466
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,459
If there was something we could do,
believe me, Frank, we'd do it.

467
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,240
Thank you, sir, thank you.
Merry Christmas. Thank you very much.

468
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,968
Thank you very much for your time.

469
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,986
- Thanks for leaving me out in the cold.
- You're welcome.

470
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,993
I wasn't really thanking you.
Now where are we going now?

471
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,996
- In the city.
- Can we get something to eat?

472
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,930
Yeah, we will, in a little while, okay?

473
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,567
What's that red stuff on your mouth?

474
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,706
What red stuff?
What are you talking about?

475
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,739
The red stuff on the side of your mouth.

476
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,343
Did you eat something
while you were in there?

477
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,539
I bet you didn't know that it's an insult
to turn down Italian cooking, know that?

478
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,584
You suck, you know that?
You really suck.

479
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,849
I can't believe...
I can't believe you ate something in there.

480
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,848
Hey! Hey, stop right there.

481
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,256
Hey, I said stop. Stop right there.

482
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,697
Yo, I said stop.

483
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,298
Police. Stop right there.

484
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,271
Stop. Police!

485
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,702
I said stop!

486
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,670
Stop.

487
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,879
What's the matter? What's the matter?
Come on. Get on my back, quick.

488
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,526
All right, let me see, let me see.
Okay, okay. All right.

489
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,323
- Oh, man.
- All right. Can you bend it back?

490
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,933
Can you? All right, so you didn't break it,
you just sprained it.

491
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,093
Look, I'm gonna have to tie this up
really tight, all right?

492
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,002
- To cut off the swelling. I got to, man.
- No, leave it. Leave it.

493
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,944
All right, see?

494
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,374
Hey, what happened to your hand?

495
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:35,543
- When I fell, I cut myself.
- Oh, Jesus Christ. Let me see it.

496
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,588
Look, we'll clean it up
when we get into the city, all right?

497
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,235
All right, stick your hand out.

498
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,642
Stick your hand out, come on.

499
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,976
It's gonna sting a little bit, all right?

500
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,917
Come on.

501
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,751
Let me see.

502
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,621
All right.

503
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,374
- Where'd you get that?
- I took it.

504
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,153
- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?

505
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,482
I can't eat it now.
It has peanuts in it.

506
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,820
- So? What's the big deal, man?
- I'm allergic to peanuts.

507
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,517
- Remember?
- Allergic to peanuts?

508
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,686
I thought you was allergic
to, uh, raisins.

509
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,661
No, peanuts.

510
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,666
Well, that's what you get
for stealing, man.

511
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,903
Hey, look, I wanna say
I'm sorry, all right?

512
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,739
It's just that...

513
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,012
Never mind. I'm sorry, man, all right?
I'm sorry.

514
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,515
Can you walk?

515
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,950
Yeah, I think so.

516
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,313
All right.

517
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:57,086
If it hurts, let me know and we'll
take a break, all right? Come on, let's go.

518
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:04,194
Excuse me, ma'am, do you know where
the Human Resources department is?

519
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,302
- It's on the third floor.
- Third floor?

520
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,735
WoMAN: Up the escalators.
Okay, thank you. Come here.

521
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,301
Hey, over there. Go.

522
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,936
Go sit down and rest your ankle. Go.

523
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,813
WoMAN: Can I help you?
- Yes, how you doing?

524
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,921
My name is Frank Diaz.
I'm here for the security guard position.

525
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,525
- I was wondering, who should I speak to?
- Sorry, they're all filled.

526
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:29,989
Oh, wow, really?

527
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,959
Well, are there any other
positions available?

528
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,530
WoMAN:
You don't look like a perfume tester.

529
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,065
Well, I can be very versatile.

530
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,429
Look, we really don't have
anything right now.

531
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,401
Try back after the New Year.

532
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,667
You know, what do you have to do
to be a perfume tester?

533
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,311
What do you do? Hold the bottle

534
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,676
and say, "Try this fragrance,
Chez Monet"? I could do that.

535
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,478
Sir, move your foot out
the door before I call security.

536
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,548
Sorry.

537
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,768
- Come on. Find something, man.
- I'm looking, I'm looking. Relax.

538
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,436
- What about this? What about that?
- No, not that.

539
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,673
What about that,
a beautician in the Bronx?

540
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,944
Oh, a beautician. Ha, ha.
That's hilarious, man. You're really funny.

541
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,111
What? How hard does it have
to be to cut someone's hair?

542
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,883
Gotta go to school for that.
You can't just cut hair,

543
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,825
- give a perm or a weave without learning.
- Don't have to go to school for that.

544
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,896
You do.
Gotta go to school for everything.

545
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,899
Not if you wanna be president.
All you have to be is 35 and a U.S. Citizen.

546
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,801
Look, just find me a job, okay?
Just find me a job.

547
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,564
Because I'm not gonna be president,

548
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,300
and I'm for sure not gonna be
a beautician in the Bronx.

549
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,806
What about painting?
- I can do paint. Where?

550
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,679
Right here, 230 East 1 st Street.

551
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,288
Good work, man, good work.
Rip it out, rip it out.

552
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,357
Hey, hey.

553
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:17,432
- Hey, Jus. Check it out.
- What?

554
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,626
- Little girly over there.
- Where?

555
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,502
Right there.

556
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,800
Oh, look at her. She's looking at you, man.
She's eyeballing you.

557
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,403
No, she's not.
Look at how she just smiled.

558
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,637
- Come on, do something, man.
- No.

559
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,713
- She's smiling at you.
- No.

560
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,782
Look at that.
You're in like Flynn, buddy.

561
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,148
Don't waste it. It's a great opportunity.
Do something. Do something.

562
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,345
- Wave at her.
- No.

563
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:42,322
She loved it, she loved it, look at her.
I'm helping you out, man.

564
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,961
- Stupid. Helping me out?
- Don't call me stupid. Let's go.

565
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,426
Let's get out of here.

566
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,394
- You're not gay, are you?
No.

567
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,431
You ever get to first base?
Second.

568
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,796
You're lying, man.
You never got to second base.

569
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,665
- Did too. Kissed a girl.
- Oh, yeah?

570
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,363
- Who was the unlucky lady?
- I ain't telling you.

571
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,409
Better not be that girl with the wooden leg
you always hang out with in the shelter.

572
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,742
Little perv, taking advantage
of the handicapped, man.

573
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,850
- You guys even touch tongues?
- None of your business.

574
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,077
When you start
hitting triples and home runs,

575
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,951
you're gonna have to bag it, all right?
Because you can't go raw dog these days.

576
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,557
"Bag it"? What, what...?

577
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,591
You never got to second base, forget it.

578
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,127
Yeah, I know, I know,
but what does "bag it" mean?

579
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,102
What's wrong?

580
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,100
Nothing, man. Come on, let's go.

581
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,077
- How's your ankle?
- It hurts even more.

582
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,011
Just put the weight on the other leg.

583
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,482
- Don't step on it.
- Can I help you?

584
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,178
Yeah, I'm here to apply
for the painting job.

585
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,984
- Come in.
- Thanks.

586
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,160
MoRRIS:
You ever work in a school?

587
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,890
Uh, no, I can't say that I have.

588
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,000
A bunch of bratty kids with no respect.

589
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,001
Yeah, it won't bother me.
I got two of my own.

590
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,105
You know how to paint?

591
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,868
Yeah, of course. You know,
I painted my own car once even.

592
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,104
It didn't come out all right,
but, hey, it saved a lot of money.

593
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,046
Good. Principal Danner wants every
classroom painted over the holiday break.

594
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,778
- Step into my office.
- Yeah.

595
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,153
Hey, hey, do me a favor.

596
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,190
Go sit by the radiator
and stay warm, okay?

597
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,923
- You smoke?
- Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

598
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,658
Thank you.

599
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,359
It sucks they got you working
on Christmas, huh?

600
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,631
Tell me about it.
All right, let's get this sucker filled out.

601
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,002
- Name?
- Frank Diaz.

602
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:44,910
- Address?
- 1873 Hunt's Point Avenue, Bronx, 11457.

603
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:51,317
- Social?
- 987-65-4320. This is on the books, right?

604
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,286
Yeah, of course it's on the books.
It's a city job. Pfft.

605
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,948
Good, good, good.

606
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,617
Where was your previous place
of employment?

607
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,424
I was working construction,
but it was off the books.

608
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,029
- Yeah, before that.
- Oh, before that?

609
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,761
- I'm a professional boxer.
- No kidding?

610
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:11,306
- Yeah, yeah. Why, you a big fight fan?
- No, no, no, bowling is my sport.

611
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,500
Bowling's cool, bowling's cool.

612
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,239
What else?
Uh, ever been convicted of a felony?

613
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,016
No.

614
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,745
Any medical condition
I should know about?

615
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,851
Not that I know of. Heh, heh, heh.

616
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,855
Any problem starting today?
It would just be till 3:00.

617
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,089
I gotta get a jump-start
on those classrooms.

618
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,756
No, yeah. I can start today, man.
Whatever you need.

619
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,903
That's what I'm here for.

620
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,371
You seem all right in my book.

621
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,030
Besides, I needed somebody yesterday,
um...

622
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,269
- The job pays $ 12.50 an hour.
- Twelve-fifty.

623
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,707
- Yeah, is that a problem?
- No, that's great.

624
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,610
Twelve-fifty's great.

625
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:56,048
- Well, Mr. Diaz...
- Hey, hey, why don't you call me Frank?

626
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,484
Just call me Frank.
It's what everybody calls me.

627
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
- Frank?
- Yeah.

628
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,325
Well, Frank,
unless you changed your mind

629
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,951
before you walked in that door,
you got yourself a job.

630
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,688
I do?

631
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,865
Merry Christmas.

632
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,631
Don't be so happy.
It sucks working here.

633
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,639
The doctor will be right in.
- Okay. Okay.

634
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,480
One, two. Good girl.

635
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,789
Relax, you're gonna get better.

636
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,017
- Hi, I'm Dr. Desai.
- Hi.

637
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,560
Hi. So what's wrong with this little cutie?

638
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,665
Oh, she's been sick for three days.
This morning she woke up with a fever.

639
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,925
Oh, flu's going around.

640
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,731
It sounds like you're coming down
with it too.

641
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,873
Everybody at our shelter is sick.

642
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,940
Oh. Which shelter is it?

643
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,339
Most Precious Host.

644
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,776
It'll be a little cold, okay?

645
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,955
There are better shelters in the city.

646
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,821
There's Safe Haven downtown.

647
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,929
That's for women who've been abused.
What are you trying to say?

648
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,190
I see a lot of women
come here in need of help

649
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,130
- and they don't like to talk about it.
- I don't need help.

650
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,601
My husband's never laid a hand on me.

651
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,707
We came here to take care
of my daughter. Can we just do that?

652
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,968
Okay. Um...

653
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,545
Can you stick out your tongue
for me for a second?

654
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,812
- Wide. "Ah. " Say "ah. "
Ah.

655
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,350
Okay, thanks.

656
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,820
I've been down that road in the past,
and I was smart enough to get out.

657
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,051
There are better shelters,
but that would mean leaving my husband.

658
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,561
I was just giving you options in case
you need them, but you don't.

659
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,463
He's out getting the keys
to our new apartment.

660
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,035
- Our last day at the shelter.
- Congratulations. Good news.

661
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,297
She's got a lot
of inflammation in her throat,

662
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,236
so I'm gonna put her on an antibiotic.

663
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,536
I'll just get the medicine and get you
something for your cough too.

664
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,475
Thank you.

665
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:11,151
Twelve-fifty an hour, man.
You know what that means?

666
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,319
You can finally get me
something to eat?

667
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,288
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get you
something to eat on the way home.

668
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,420
But it means Yankee Stadium,
baby, you and me, opening day.

669
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,328
- Sound like a plan, huh?
- Yeah.

670
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,492
I'm gonna get those seats
on the second tier

671
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,662
over first base
where all the foul balls go.

672
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,999
- Can we get hot dogs?
- We're gonna get hot dogs.

673
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,112
Hot dogs, peanuts, cotton candy...
oh, no peanuts, man.

674
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,308
- I forgot, you're allergic.
- We have to have ice cream.

675
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,214
- Yeah, ice cream.
- Lot of ice cream.

676
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,218
Tons of ice cream,
tons of ice cream.

677
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,085
Cotton candy, zeppoles...
I'm gonna give you so much candy,

678
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,486
it's gonna rot your teeth.

679
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,560
But don't think about food
right now, man.

680
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:56,324
Because it'll make you hungry.
We got two hours left, all right?

681
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,092
Oh, we did it.

682
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,965
Can you believe that? We did it.

683
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,863
We did it, little man.

684
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,233
Come on, give me five.

685
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,813
Give me five.
Uptown. Midtown. Downtown.

686
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:16,009
- Oh, man, why'd you slap the brush for?
- Come on, that's not funny.

687
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:20,846
- You see me laughing? I'm not laughing.
- Okay. We'll go cross-town.

688
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,855
That ain't right, man. That ain't right.
You think that's right?

689
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,963
I got your hand, you got my threads.
That's a whole other different story.

690
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,030
- Frank, got a minute?
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

691
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,693
I was just about to
start painting the wall right now.

692
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,567
- Look, I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure.

693
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:41,268
Keep stirring it. Get to work, man.
Help us out, all right?

694
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,178
What's going on?

695
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,909
Ran your social
through the district computer.

696
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,418
Felony charges came under your profile.
Do you know anything about that?

697
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,123
Felony charge?

698
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,354
It said you spent two years in jail.

699
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,564
Yeah, well, I...
Something did go down.

700
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,793
It did go down. I mean,
I was a young kid, man, a stupid kid.

701
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,233
Twenty-one years old.
You know how that is, right?

702
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,033
I was hanging out with the wrong crew.
And I'm with them,

703
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,735
and they go into this bodega, but I
stayed outside and they took some shit.

704
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,142
- I didn't even know they were gonna do it.
- They held up the place?

705
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,910
I don't know. I don't know. Like I said,
I stayed outside, so I have no clue.

706
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:26,112
But it was a big mess. It was a big mess,
and I was guilty by association.

707
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,917
And even the store clerk
said that I wasn't a part of it.

708
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,686
I couldn't afford a good lawyer.
You know how that goes.

709
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,026
- Frank, this is a problem.
- Mr. Morris, I'm not that guy.

710
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,997
Okay? I'm not that guy.
That was a long time ago.

711
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,865
It was a mistake, you know?
I got a wife and two kids, man.

712
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,634
That was the wrong time, wrong place,
wrong friends, you know what I'm saying?

713
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,868
- Frank.
- It happens to everybody, you know?

714
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,103
- I mean...
- Frank.

715
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:53,716
Look, I need these classrooms painted
as much as you need this job,

716
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:58,048
but the board of education has a policy:
No felons near the kids.

717
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:03,523
Now, I'm sorry,
but there is no way around that.

718
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,424
Right.

719
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,431
Justin, come here.

720
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,374
Hey, buddy, can I talk to you a second?

721
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,348
I'm looking for a guy.
Frank Diaz, a Latino guy.

722
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,818
He's a boxer.
He's about maybe your size.

723
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,856
I used to pick him up here for work.
I picked him up with you.

724
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:12,119
- Sorry, I don't know him, man.
- Whoa. It's a good thing, a good thing.

725
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,819
I'm trying to do the guy a favor.

726
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,487
I'm looking all over the place.

727
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,156
- Sorry, guy, I can't help you.
- Can you help me out?

728
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,137
Aw.
- Oh, man.

729
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,672
Come on, stay over here
till it clears up a little bit.

730
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,944
You never told me you went to jail.

731
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,815
Yeah, you never told me you
sucked face with Peg Leg Patty.

732
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,184
The things you find out
along the way, huh?

733
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,258
What you doing
listening to my business?

734
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,554
- I couldn't, I could just hear you.
- Yeah, sure.

735
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,093
Does Mom know?

736
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,598
Yeah, your mom knows.

737
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:55,226
- Did you shoot anybody?
- No, I didn't shoot anybody.

738
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,669
That's why your mom
wants you to take up a sport,

739
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,708
so you'll stop hanging on the street
or end up in trouble.

740
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,573
Matter of fact, you're signing up
for basketball next week.

741
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,944
- My ankle could be broken.
- It's gonna be better by then.

742
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,881
Now, come on, we haven't got much time.
Let's go.

743
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,248
- It's pouring.
- Put your hood up.

744
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:15,782
Find me a job.

745
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,426
You're not gonna find anything today.

746
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,618
It's Christmas Eve.

747
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,287
You want a warm apartment? You want
something to eat? Find me something.

748
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,497
- You buy the paper or you put it down.
- Relax, it's just a quarter.

749
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,934
I'm running a business here.
You look, you buy.

750
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,005
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

751
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,039
- Oh, I found something.
- What you find?

752
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,701
Look, "Stockroom employees
needed for holiday. "

753
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,073
Where at?
- Right here.

754
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,841
Oh, it's Houston Street.

755
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,448
Here, I'm putting it down. You happy?

756
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,589
There you go. You happy?
Let's go, come on.

757
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,656
Wait, you can't go like that.
- Why not?

758
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,816
Because you're wet,
you have paint on you...

759
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,586
Yeah, so what am I supposed to do?

760
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,889
- Get new clothes, that's what.
- Oh, right.

761
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,727
You wanna go to Armani's
on a shopping spree? Barneys?

762
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,630
- You don't have to spend money.
- No?

763
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,431
Because people are giving away
clothes for free nowadays.

764
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,597
- Just do what Mom does.
- What does she do?

765
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,036
Tell you when we get there.

766
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:46,475
- Are you sure your mother does this?
- Yeah.

767
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,141
And she gets on me for cursing.

768
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,981
Hey, help me pick out
a shirt for these pants.

769
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,263
- How about this one?
- What, you mean like a pimp?

770
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,423
Come on, man.

771
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,136
This is more like it. This is good.

772
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,934
All right, just stay here.
I'll be right back, all right?

773
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,574
Get your hands off!

774
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,440
Hey. Hey, relax.
Get off!

775
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,581
- Hey, what's going on?
- This your kid?

776
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,649
Yes, he's my stepson. Why?

777
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,582
- Just caught him shoplifting.
What are you talking about?

778
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,381
Hey, you, empty your pockets.

779
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,751
Empty your pockets,
or we're gonna do it for you.

780
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:05,053
Hey, kemosabe, just relax, all right?
This is a kid, man, please.

781
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,627
Empty your pockets, man.

782
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:13,962
What the hell are you doing, man?
What the hell are you doing?

783
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,469
I'm sorry.
I don't know what the hell got into him.

784
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,130
We have to take him in the back.
Gotta write this up.

785
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,300
Come on.
We all make stupid mistakes, right?

786
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:25,346
Come on, look, you got it back, right?
No harm, no foul. It's all good, right?

787
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,779
We gotta take him
in the back and write him up.

788
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,148
Look at him, he's a 9-year-old kid, man.
We all make mistakes, right?

789
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,345
It's Christmas.

790
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,888
- Want me to pay for it?
Sir, it is store policy.

791
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,583
I know it's store policy, man,
but it's not your store.

792
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,353
I'll pay. I'll give you the money.

793
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,191
Sir, what do you have on
underneath that sweater?

794
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,167
Oh, man, you know...
You know what happened?

795
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,793
We're gonna need some more assistance
down here in the men's section.

796
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:52,635
I was in the dressing room when I heard
the screaming. I didn't get a chance...

797
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,637
Go, go, go.
Meet you at the newsstand. Go, go, go.

798
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,145
- Whoa. Where's he going?
- Come on.

799
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:02,216
Let's just try to work this out, all right?
The two of us, all right? Because what?

800
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,218
Look, I'll give you the clothes,
I'll pay you back, whatever.

801
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,549
- We can work this out.
- That's not the point.

802
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:08,782
So, what is your point?

803
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,519
The point is you have on a sweater
that doesn't belong to you.

804
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,390
I told you why, man.

805
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,498
I was in
the dressing room putting it on,

806
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,690
and I heard the commotion.

807
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,425
- Relax.
- I came out to protect my son.

808
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,536
- I am relaxed.
- You don't seem relaxed.

809
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,969
- I'm just trying to work this out.
- Your voice doesn't seem relaxed.

810
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,575
I'm trying to work this out.
I said I'll pay you.

811
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,178
- Back off right now.
- You are not going anywhere.

812
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:31,813
- I'm going...
- You're coming with me.

813
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,954
What the hell is the matter with you, huh?
What the hell's wrong with you?

814
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,392
What are you, stupid?

815
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,465
You stealing jewelry for your girlfriend?

816
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,032
No, it was for Mom.

817
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,504
It's for your mom?

818
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,003
VENDoR: Two fifty.
- For your mom?

819
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,574
WoMAN:
All right, I think I'll...

820
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,406
I think I'll give you some change...

821
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,776
All right, just forget it, all right?
Forget it.

822
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,919
- At least I got the new clothes, right?
- Yeah.

823
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,188
Now, come on. Let's go look for a job.
Come on.

824
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,621
What's the matter?

825
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,460
- Tell me. What?
- Oh, man.

826
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,430
I left my money inside the pants
in the dressing room.

827
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,742
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know. I don't know.

828
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:40,007
If I go back in there,
I'm gonna get arrested.

829
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:45,314
Jesus Christ. This is great, man.
This is great.

830
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,126
- Hey, excuse me, do you have the time?
It's 2:15.

831
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,319
Two-fifteen, great.

832
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,488
Now I gotta get the deposit and a job.
That's just great.

833
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,226
- All right, come on, man. Let's go.
- No. I can't walk.

834
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,267
- What?
- I can't walk. My stomach hurts.

835
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,564
Your stomach doesn't have to do
with your legs.

836
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,300
No. I'm not going anywhere
until I get something to eat.

837
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,639
- We'll get something to eat at the shelter.
- No, no, no.

838
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,576
- Don't be a pussy, man.
- I'm not a pussy. I'm not a pussy.

839
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,774
Hey, don't do this to me now.
Come on, man.

840
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,282
No, no. I'm not... No.

841
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,852
I'm not going anywhere
until I get something to eat.

842
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,923
I've been walking miles and miles,
and my stomach is growling,

843
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:25,356
and my stomach is empty.
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

844
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,326
Justin, come on, man.
I swear to God, I...

845
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,393
- I want you to get up right now.
- No.

846
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,059
Justin, get up right now.
Right now, you hear me?

847
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,764
No. I'm done. I'm done.
I don't care what you say anymore.

848
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:41,308
Anymore. I'm hungry,
and I want something to eat.

849
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,813
All right. I'll get you something to eat.
Are you happy? Come on.

850
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,281
Finally.

851
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,750
I'm not eating shit from there.

852
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,917
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm listening to you.

853
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,755
- Why can't we go to a restaurant?
- This is a restaurant.

854
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,328
It's the back of a restaurant.

855
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,660
Try to find something that's wrapped.

856
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,631
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking, man.

857
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,796
Oh, bingo. Look.
Look what I got. Look what I got.

858
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,138
Look at this. Look at this.
A perfectly good little jelly doughnut.

859
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,074
Here you go.

860
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:21,114
- It's fricking hard as a rock.
- Yeah, it's just frozen, that's all.

861
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,213
This is disgusting.

862
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,083
Maybe if I hadn't
listened to you and stolen clothes,

863
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,019
we could have
bought something edible.

864
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,423
I've been asking to get something to eat
for the last five hours.

865
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,690
I knew I should have
left you at the shelter, man.

866
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,594
Yeah, you should.
Leave me right here.

867
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,998
- I'll get back to the shelter myself.
- Trust me, I'd like to, man.

868
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,434
- This isn't my fault.
- Whose fault is it, man?

869
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:46,131
Who got paint on my pants,
and I had to get new clothes?

870
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,870
Was that my fault, huh?
Was that my fault?

871
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,675
- It's your fault we live in a shelter.
- What?

872
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,118
What did you say?
You do this all the time.

873
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,616
What'd you say?

874
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,551
- I said it's not my fault.
- No, that's not what you said.

875
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:04,056
You said, "It's your fault
we live in a shelter. " I heard you.

876
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,024
You think I'm a loser, don't you?

877
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:12,659
You know how many families are
struggling, trying to make it? A lot, okay?

878
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,032
Wait till you have kids, boy.
You're gonna see how damn hard that is.

879
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,799
I'm not gonna have kids
unless I can afford them.

880
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,738
You got an answer for everything.

881
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,775
Yeah, I have more answers than you do.

882
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,142
You think I needed you in my life?
Think I needed the responsibility?

883
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,647
- You think I needed you?
- Yeah, you did. You did.

884
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,945
Or would you rather be with
your real pops? Huh?

885
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,088
Think you're better off with him?
Go back,

886
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,622
so he could beat you up
for no reason every day.

887
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:36,850
Shut up. Just shut up.

888
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,085
What, now you don't have an answer,
big man?

889
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,594
You had a big mouth,
but when somebody fights back,

890
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,289
- you have nothing to say?
- I'm a bigger man than you.

891
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,264
- Is that so?
- Yeah, it is so.

892
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,530
I can make more money begging
in an hour than you can in a whole day.

893
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,140
Ooh. You're a big man. Ooh.

894
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,967
I can read.

895
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,974
And I can walk all over the city
for five hours with a broken ankle,

896
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:03,380
and you can't even get out of the corner
and at least lose a fight like a real man.

897
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:12,152
Give me that. You don't want
the doughnut? You don't want it?

898
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,394
Excuse me,
can you spare some change?

899
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,580
Spare some change?

900
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,182
Excuse me,
can you spare some change?

901
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,354
Excuse me, sir,
can you spare some change?

902
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,999
Excuse me, sir,
can you spare some change?

903
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,093
I'm not talking to you, man.

904
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,897
You're not gonna get anything like that.

905
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,937
Merry Christmas. I'm not talking to you.

906
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,701
Go back to the shelter, man.
Go back to the shelter.

907
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,469
You're not gonna get anything that way.

908
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,841
Yeah? Hey, see,
I'm not talking to you, man.

909
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,482
Excuse me,
can you spare some change?

910
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,744
Excuse me, can you
spare some change?

911
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,117
Excuse me, can you spare some change?
Excuse me. Spare some change?

912
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,986
Excuse me, ma'am, can you
spare some change, please?

913
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,786
WoMAN:
Sorry.

914
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,195
Excuse me, sir,
can you spare some change, please?

915
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,764
Thank you.

916
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,401
Excuse me,
can you spare some change?

917
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,366
Excuse me, ma'am.

918
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,107
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Excuse me, spare some change?

919
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,439
Can you spare some change?
Merry Christmas.

920
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,239
Excuse me, can you spare
some change, please?

921
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,907
Excuse me, can you spare
some change?

922
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,449
- Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas.
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

923
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,060
Count your money
as fast as you can, all right?

924
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,202
Hey, look, I wanna thank you
for helping me out there, okay?

925
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,699
Whatever.

926
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,576
Remember when I was at the park
trying to tell you something this morning?

927
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,547
Yeah.

928
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,546
I'm gonna tell you...

929
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:02,088
I'm gonna tell you the most important thing
that I'm ever gonna tell you.

930
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,818
This is the secret to life.
You listening to me?

931
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,859
Like I got a choice.

932
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,732
There's nothing to fear.
Okay, come on. Say it.

933
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,060
Why?

934
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:16,000
Because I don't wanna waste my breath.
I wanna make sure that you heard me.

935
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,935
There's nothing to fear.

936
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,541
Right, because fear
is the worst weapon in the world.

937
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,541
The most powerful weapon.

938
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,476
People are gonna try to scare you
into doing a lot of things

939
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,173
that you don't wanna do, trust me.

940
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,751
I mean, look where it got me, right?

941
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,950
Look where I am today.

942
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,625
Anyway, just know people
are gonna manipulate you,

943
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,921
and that's how they're gonna do it.
You got me?

944
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:46,566
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

945
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,572
- So how much you got?
- Hundred and forty.

946
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:54,372
- Wow.
- How much you get?

947
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,540
It's none of your business.

948
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,111
- Do we have enough?
- Yeah, yeah, we got enough.

949
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,219
We got enough.
As long as I get a job, we'll be fine.

950
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,418
All right, man. Come on, let's go.

951
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,380
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic.

952
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,524
But I'm looking for a job.

953
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,183
- We're closed now.
- I know, I know, but the trains...

954
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,261
- Try another day.
- Two hours. Two hours.

955
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,263
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- Give me a chance. Come on.

956
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,554
What about the beautician job
in the Bronx?

957
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,495
It's 5:30, man.

958
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,295
By the time we go back uptown
and come back, we'll never make it.

959
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,466
Maybe we could try a few restaurants
over by the building.

960
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,969
- No, it's over.
- It's not over.

961
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,201
Why do you always do that?
You're always giving up.

962
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,809
Hey, there's no shame to losing.
I did my best, okay?

963
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,256
Come on, man.

964
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:39,327
I wanna make one more stop before
we go to the shelter, all right? Come on.

965
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,672
Hey, is this
what Christina was looking for?

966
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:52,637
You're buying her a present?

967
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,875
- Yeah, I'm buying her a present, why?
- What about me?

968
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,743
- What about you?
- I walked all over the city,

969
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,355
sprained my ankle
and starved for 10 hours,

970
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,115
and she gets a present?

971
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,819
- Look, all I wanna know is, is this what...?
- Yeah, yeah.

972
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,591
Thank you.
Now go get something for yourself

973
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,564
- and make sure it's under 20 bucks.
- Forget it. Forget it.

974
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,034
- No, go get something.
- I'm fine.

975
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:19,197
Why would you have brought it up
if you didn't want something?

976
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,866
- I don't want anything.
- Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.

977
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,308
Come on, you give me shit,
and you make me feel bad

978
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,813
for not getting you something,
not thinking about you. Go get something.

979
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,917
Go, go.

980
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,053
Did you mean what you said?

981
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,916
Said about what?

982
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,082
About you not needing me
around anymore.

983
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,524
Come on, come on.

984
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:44,325
Of course not, man.
We were just arguing, that's all.

985
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,158
What are you doing?

986
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,634
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

987
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,601
What's the matter? Is something wrong,
man? Is your ankle hurting? What?

988
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,372
- Do you love me?
- Do I what?

989
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:02,005
You always tell Christina and Mom,
but you never tell me.

990
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,516
That's because you're a man.
You're a man. Come on.

991
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,918
You're a little man,
but you're still a man. Come on.

992
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,523
You know I do, right?

993
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:12,050
So we're men, man,
and men don't do that.

994
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,457
Imagine me dropping you off
at school every day,

995
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,326
saying, "Justin, I love you.
I love you, Justin. "

996
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,730
- You would have kicked my ass, right?
- Yeah.

997
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,928
You know, when we start...
When we play-fight like this

998
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:28,270
or I pound you on the head, right?
When I pound you and give you noogies,

999
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:32,141
that's me telling you in code,
all right?

1000
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,474
I thought you knew that.

1001
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,441
No.

1002
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,949
All right, now you know, stupid.

1003
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,223
What was that? What was that?

1004
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,859
What was that?

1005
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,291
Come on. Throw a punch
like the way I taught you.

1006
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,794
That's it, that's it.

1007
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,398
That's how I used to hit
when I was your age, man.

1008
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,627
Go ahead. That's right.
That's getting good, man.

1009
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm gonna take you to the gym,
but don't tell your mother, all right?

1010
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,641
All right. No, that's it, that's it.
That's it. Hey.

1011
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,473
What are you doing? Hey, cut it out.
What are you doing, man?

1012
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,515
Hey! Come on, stop it. Stop it, man.

1013
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:13,712
What the hell's the matter with you?
People are watching. Hey, stop.

1014
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,724
Calm down, I'll let you go.
Calm down, I'll let you go.

1015
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,486
All right.

1016
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,157
Here, baby.

1017
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,392
Hey.

1018
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,802
Give me that.

1019
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,136
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1020
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:09,835
- What happened, baby?
- Oh, he's fine, baby. He's fine.

1021
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,912
Just sprained his ankle, that's all.

1022
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,049
- How are you doing, Tina?
- She's better. Her fever broke.

1023
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,775
Oh, that's good, baby. I'm glad.

1024
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,180
Hey, look, look.

1025
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,153
Wow.

1026
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,121
Look what Santa gave me.

1027
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,228
What took you so long?
I started to worry.

1028
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,692
Tell me on the way.
Let's get going. Everything's packed.

1029
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,563
We're all ready to go. You guys ready?

1030
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,532
What's wrong?

1031
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,175
Honey, you got new clothes.

1032
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,347
Yeah, it's a long story.

1033
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,577
Baby, what happened?

1034
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,516
We didn't get the apartment.

1035
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,654
What are you talking about?

1036
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,523
We didn't get the apartment.
I gotta get a job on the books

1037
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,688
to qualify, is what I gotta do.

1038
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,324
Can we call someone,
do something?

1039
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,733
Angie, I went everywhere,
and I tried everything.

1040
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,037
Okay.

1041
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,847
We'll figure it out.

1042
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,908
Let's just go and have dinner.

1043
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,077
Some Christmas dinner,
a nice-looking dinner

1044
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,884
somewhere, all right? How about that?
Let's go eat.

1045
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,092
- Yeah.
- All right?

1046
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,456
- The kid's starving, I had a long day...
- Yeah.

1047
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,394
All right. I'm gonna go wash up, okay?

1048
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,638
Hey, what happened to your hand?

1049
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,175
When I slipped, I cut myself.

1050
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,681
Oh.

1051
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,312
Okay, guys.

1052
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,749
We're just gonna go to dinner, okay?

1053
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,564
Coats on.

1054
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,838
Wanna take your doll out, baby?

1055
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,372
Come on, we'll take her out.

1056
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:27,142
<i>I wish you a merry Christmas</i>

1057
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:33,216
<i>I wish you a merry Christmas</i>

1058
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:38,519
<i>I wish you a merry Christmas</i>

1059
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:45,293
<i>And a happy new year</i>

1060
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,475
Sit over there.

1061
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,873
Thank you.

1062
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:03,040
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

1063
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,089
- What are you gonna have, pumpkin?
- Spaghetti.

1064
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,422
- All right, you got it.
- Merry Christmas.

1065
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,326
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1066
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,059
What can I get for you?
- Two sodas for the kids.

1067
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,135
- You gonna have pasta with butter?
- Yep.

1068
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,204
Pasta and butter.
What are you gonna have?

1069
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,739
- The chicken Parmesan.
The chicken papa john.

1070
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,036
I think that's what I heard him say.
I'm gonna have a steak, medium,

1071
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,578
and my wife's gonna have the lobster.

1072
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:36,343
- What's wrong with you?
- And two glasses of red wine.

1073
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,281
Very good.

1074
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:45,014
Thank you.
I'll be right back with your drinks.

1075
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:48,560
- You're a jerk, you know that?
- That's why you married me.

1076
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,197
Yeah.

1077
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,263
That's not funny.

1078
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:53,792
Sit up straight.

1079
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,796
Put your napkin on your lap.

1080
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,978
Are you gonna tell
everything that happened today?

1081
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,783
I think we should dance.

1082
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,592
- Dance?
Yeah.

1083
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,321
I don't see anybody dancing.

1084
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:26,296
- Who thinks we should dance?
- Ooh.

1085
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,959
I need a majority vote.
Who thinks we should dance?

1086
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,135
You're not gonna embarrass us?

1087
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,438
I said I need a majority vote.

1088
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,076
Thank you.
Looks like I got a majority vote here.

1089
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,505
You're gonna have to dance with me.
Come on.

1090
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,680
Come on.

1091
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,185
Come on, let's go over here.

1092
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:53,988
<i>Snowflakes are falling
Outside my window</i>

1093
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:58,531
<i>But it'd be just perfect with you</i>

1094
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:04,933
<i>Children are singing
And sleigh bells are ringing</i>

1095
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:08,770
<i>But it'd be just perfect with you</i>

1096
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,673
Ange,

1097
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,206
I'm sorry.

1098
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,474
Sorry about what?

1099
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,051
Being such a goddamn loser.

1100
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:20,950
You're not a loser.

1101
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,284
Yeah. I couldn't even get a job.

1102
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,851
- Stop it.
- Why are you even with me, huh?

1103
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,757
I mean, I had potential,
but what do I got now?

1104
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:37,331
No matter what I say right now, it doesn't
matter. You're not gonna listen to me.

1105
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,268
If somebody showed you
a crystal ball right now,

1106
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,209
and they said to you,
"This is where you're gonna end up,"

1107
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,314
would you do it again?

1108
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,010
Come on, the truth.

1109
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,517
I love you, you know that.

1110
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:58,184
And you're the best husband
and the best father in the world.

1111
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,692
But would I do it again?

1112
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:04,624
No. And neither would you.

1113
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,198
And that's just the truth.

1114
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,079
I don't feel so good.

1115
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,781
Well, you ate everything
but the breadbasket.

1116
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,824
How was everything?
It was excellent.

1117
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,360
- Great, thank you.
I'll leave this with you.

1118
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,361
- The wine is on the house.
- Thank you.

1119
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,558
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you too.

1120
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:44,294
Goddamn.
Who broke a window in here, huh?

1121
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:49,432
- I told you we shouldn't have come here.
- No, it's fine, it's fine. I got it.

1122
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,640
I got it.

1123
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,109
Man.

1124
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,082
Here, why don't you take the kids outside?
I'll take care of it.

1125
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,091
No.

1126
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:08,951
- No, I'm not doing that.
- Doing what?

1127
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,629
You don't think I know what you do?
I know what you do.

1128
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,999
Just let me pay for it, okay?

1129
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,798
That should do it.

1130
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:22,876
All right, everybody, come on.
Everybody, you ready? Bundle up.

1131
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,978
It's gonna be cold.

1132
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,119
You okay?

1133
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,951
How's your leg? What's wrong?

1134
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,988
What's wrong?

1135
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:48,593
Come on.

1136
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:49,794
Frank, what's wrong?

1137
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,132
Oh!
- Frank!

1138
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,537
No. Hey, stop!
- Frank, stop!

1139
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,605
Frank!

1140
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,414
Frank, please! Frank, stop.

1141
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,177
Oh, my God.

1142
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,646
Frank!

1143
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,651
Stop!

1144
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,826
Baby...

1145
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,471
oh, God.

1146
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,413
WoMAN:
Mr. Diaz.

1147
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,749
Yeah?

1148
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,289
Can I talk with you for a second?

1149
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,491
Yeah, sure.

1150
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,288
What happened out there?

1151
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,658
I'm sorry.
I got a little out of hand out there,

1152
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,197
but he stole my jacket.

1153
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,267
I thought you were placed
in an apartment.

1154
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,404
So did we,
but obviously we didn't qualify.

1155
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,369
- Sorry to hear that.
- What's going on? He pressing charges?

1156
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,442
WoMAN: No, but unfortunately I have
to ask you to leave the shelter.

1157
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,805
- He took my jacket...
- Excuse me, excuse me.

1158
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,780
That man stole my husband's jacket.
No, no, she's not understanding clearly.

1159
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,384
- He stole our jacket.
- Ma'am... Angie, please, okay?

1160
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,283
I had to fight him because
he took my jacket, all right?

1161
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:18,222
I'm aware of what happened, and
I will deal with him, but you've gotta go.

1162
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:21,294
You're gonna throw me out?
You're gonna throw... Me and my kids,

1163
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,023
you're gonna throw us out?
What kind of shelter is this?

1164
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,759
- You can stay and keep one bed.
- One bed?

1165
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,665
What do I do with one bed, ma'am?
I got two kids here.

1166
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,739
Can you count? One, two kids!
What do I do with that?

1167
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,704
Angela. Angie, calm down.
- Don't...

1168
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,969
Don't tell me to calm down
after what you did.

1169
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,703
Don't you tell me to calm down!

1170
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,314
What are you gonna do?
He steals my husband's jacket,

1171
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:42,814
and we get kicked out?

1172
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:48,115
- You tell me how this is fair! You're sorry?
WoMAN: I'm sorry, but this is our policy.

1173
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,382
You know what?
You leave me no choice.

1174
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:53,425
- You leave me no choice.
- Can't you just reconsider, please?

1175
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,961
- Can you think about it?
WoMAN: I'm sorry, I can't.

1176
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:58,395
He took my jacket.

1177
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,099
I'm so sorry.

1178
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,722
<i>MAN
Hello?</i>

1179
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,648
<i>Hello?</i>

1180
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,186
Hey.

1181
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,510
Where'd you go?

1182
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,145
I called Luis.

1183
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,612
Come here.

1184
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,854
What'd you do that for?

1185
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,859
- Because we got nowhere to go.
- Yeah?

1186
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,157
He's gonna pick us up,
and let us stay with him.

1187
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:07,631
- We can go to another shelter.
- The kids can't go on like this.

1188
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:10,669
You're always on me, always,
about showing them the right way,

1189
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:11,999
and then you do this?

1190
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,266
- What kind of example you...?
- You know what?

1191
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,774
I've done the right thing all my life.
I am done.

1192
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,403
I'm trying to fix this right now, please.
Please.

1193
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,979
Ready, guys?

1194
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:28,217
Is Frank gonna come?

1195
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,252
Yeah, he will.

1196
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,077
How are you?

1197
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,375
Great.

1198
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,518
You look lovely.

1199
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,115
Hey, big guy. How's it going?

1200
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,421
Sorry, can we just do this
the way we talked on the phone?

1201
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:08,391
Let's just not make it harder, okay?

1202
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,694
Yeah. Sure.

1203
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,700
Hey, man, it's all good.

1204
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,705
No, man, it's not all good,
especially what you did to her.

1205
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,172
Frank, for chrissake.

1206
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,743
Angie, go with him, all right?
Go and take the kids.

1207
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,540
I'm gonna find a shelter. I'm fine.

1208
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:39,391
Justin, grab your things.

1209
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:41,956
I'm not going.

1210
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,127
Get in the car now.

1211
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,232
No.

1212
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,064
Frank, tell him to get in the car.

1213
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,002
Hey, hey. What are you doing, man?

1214
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:54,869
What are you doing, champ?

1215
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,341
Come on, what's going on?
Come on, uptown.

1216
01:26:57,512 --> 01:27:01,608
Come on, downtown. Cross-town.

1217
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:04,274
Cross-town. Come on, man.
Don't leave me hanging.

1218
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,947
- I'm not going.
- You gotta go, man. You gotta go.

1219
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,990
Gotta take care of your mother
and sister when I'm not around.

1220
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,618
- You're the big man now.
- I'm not going without you.

1221
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:19,398
Yeah, it's big of you, all right,
but you got no choice.

1222
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,627
I have a choice.
If you don't go, I don't go.

1223
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,011
- What the hell's going on here?
- Just a minute, okay?

1224
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,776
Justin, you can't stay with Frank.

1225
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:41,615
He's gonna go to another shelter.
It's gonna be too dangerous, okay?

1226
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:51,429
Justin, why don't you listen to your mom
and come with us?

1227
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:53,829
You can see Frank tomorrow.

1228
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:59,940
How about you go in the car
and leave me and Frank alone?

1229
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,708
I'm your father.
You don't talk to me that way.

1230
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:28,665
What's this?

1231
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,407
What is this?

1232
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,248
I'm sorry I called,
and I dragged you out here, okay?

1233
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:50,482
Yeah, you're sorry, all right.

1234
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:55,118
Look at what you're putting yourself and
these kids through. For what? For him?

1235
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,231
This is the man you keep
my son away from me for?

1236
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,524
You're pathetic.

1237
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,567
Pathetic.

1238
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:33,393
Oh, man, look at that.

1239
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:38,598
Okay, why don't you guys wait right here?
I'm gonna go in.

1240
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,744
WoMAN: You're all gonna have to
step back a bit.

1241
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,348
I'm sorry, we have no room
for the rest of the night.

1242
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,348
I've been here all night.
I understand.

1243
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:54,386
There's nothing I can do.
You're gonna have to step back, sir.

1244
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,785
I have no room for you. I'm sorry.

1245
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:59,153
There's absolutely... No.

1246
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,759
Let me stay.

1247
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:08,029
It's beyond my control.
Can I have you all just step back, please?

1248
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,602
I'm completely full for tonight.
I'm sorry.

1249
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,036
- I have to ask you to step back.
- Sorry, sorry.

1250
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:14,731
I gotta talk to somebody, please.

1251
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,776
WoMAN: Can you please clear
this walkway? Can you please...?

1252
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:20,004
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
- How you doing?

1253
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,513
- I need two beds.
- We're at capacity right now.

1254
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,548
I'm sure you are,
but I got two children.

1255
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,153
Sir, we're completely full for the night.
I'm sorry.

1256
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:29,812
- Two little kids.
- Can we please clear this walkway?

1257
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,118
- I'm sorry, we have no room.
- I know, I know.

1258
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,487
Can you recommend a place?

1259
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:37,222
- You can try Most Precious Host, maybe.
- You know, we just came from there.

1260
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:39,923
WoMAN: There's nothing else.
There's nothing else in the area.

1261
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,693
Try, uh, Brooklyn.
I hear they have beds

1262
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:44,235
out in Fort Greene,
but they might be full by now.

1263
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:46,498
It's the busiest night of the year.
I'm sorry.

1264
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:49,472
Everybody, please,
can I please have you clear this walkway?

1265
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,408
We are completely full.
We have no beds.

1266
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:07,389
It's totally full.
I don't know what the hell to do.

1267
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:49,633
<i>WoMAN
Stand clear of the closing door.</i>

1268
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:37,341
- What the hell you doing?
- Playing a game.

1269
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,678
Don't play.

1270
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,455
Try me.

1271
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:52,190
Aw.

1272
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,960
Too low, too low. My bad.
One more try, one more try.

1273
01:33:01,342 --> 01:33:02,832
Aw.

1274
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:04,944
See, you can't throw, man.
You got no aim.

1275
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,706
- I wanna try it. I wanna try.
- Let her try.

1276
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:12,951
A small piece, baby.

1277
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,353
Wait, wait, wait.

1278
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,859
That has peanuts in it. I'm allergic.

1279
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,926
- No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

1280
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,861
I just told you that because
you'd stuff your face and get yourself sick.

1281
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:27,157
Hey.

1282
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:30,669
Hey, don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with that.

1283
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:33,197
That is not right.

1284
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:38,177
- Your mom's slick, isn't she?
Yeah.

1285
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,740
Yes.
- Mmm. She got it!

1286
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,615
- Who's the best? It's you.
- I did it.

1287
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,483
You're the champ.

1288
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,858
I can't believe you did that to him.

1289
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:02,194
- Not the worst thing.
- You're too much.

1290
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:24,547
<i>I love you.</i>
