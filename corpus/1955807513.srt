00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,302
All right, I'm in. I just
have to locate the intel

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,933
and I'll be out
in less than five.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,687
You know, as long as
no one stops...

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,769
Uh-oh.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,351
How y'all doin'?
( nervous laugh )

7
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:23,314
I was just here to, you know,
pay my electric bill.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,486
Can you guys, um, direct me
to Accounts Payable?

9
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,528
Okay, chill.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,029
Chill, all right?

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,032
I was only a few days late.

12
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,076
MEN: ( groan )

13
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,458
Oh, look at that.
Now your lights are out.

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,047
Oh, man, did the DVR cut out?
I hate when that happens.

15
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,053
All right, fine.
Okay, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,176
They were on to me,
I had no choice but to bolt.

17
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,888
How could you completely
fail your mission?

18
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:59,350
Uh, wait. I'm still alive.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,353
So, technically,
I didn't completely fail.

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,734
I only half-failed.

21
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:06,397
Which means I also
half-succeeded.

22
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,899
So, if you round up,
one could argue that

23
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,112
I completely succeeded.

24
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,575
I want answers, KC.
This was a simple mission.

25
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,248
Says the guy who hasn't
been on a field mission in,
what, 50 years?

26
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,121
Forty years?

All I'm saying is
it wasn't my fault.

29
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,707
- They knew I was coming.
- How could they have known?

30
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:29,170
This was a top secret mission.
It was off the books!

31
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,471
Off the books?!

32
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:32,513
I swear they were
reading a book called:

33
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,386
KC Will Be Here At 6:15.

leaked information?

Glad that's over.

00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:44,985
Not you. You stay.

a mole inside the Organization

No, you're suggesting

My suggestion is next time
you do an interrogation,

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,393
you might wanna floss,
'cause you got enough
spinach in your teeth

64
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,764
to bake a quiche,
my friend.

65
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,607
Yeah.

66
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,689
Noted.

67
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,521
I'm putting you in charge
of finding the mole.

68
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,902
Wait, me?

69
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:13,694
Yep, you better
get on it right away.

70
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,655
Okay, you got it, sir.

71
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,698
But remember,
trust no one.

72
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,121
All right, but if
I can't trust anyone,

73
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:23,083
then how do I know
I can trust you?

74
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,745
- You can trust me!
- Oh, really?

75
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,917
'Cause that sounds
like something a mole would say.

76
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,499
KC, do I look like a mole?

77
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,961
I don't know.
I've never seen one before.

78
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,713
Or have I?

79
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,674
Get out.

80
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,466
Yes, sir.

81
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,178
Or, yes, mole.

82
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,938
( groans ) Agent Johnson
just assigned me

83
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,811
another top secret case.

84
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:54,234
Guess I'll be doing
all the work around here.

85
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:59,660
I'm kidding. We all play
an equally important role.

86
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,911
All right?

87
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,363
What would we do without Ray

88
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:03,994
ruining our coffee
every morning?

89
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,576
Give it up for Ray,
everybody!

90
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:06,917
Yeah! Ray!

91
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:09,249
Whoo!
All right, well,

92
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,793
I'm gonna head down to
the Olive Pit all by myself

93
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,756
and look over these
highly-classified

94
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,259
sought-after files.
All right.

95
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,554
Oh, um, Ray, that's actually
a soil sample from
the Fresno mission.

96
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,187
It's not ground coffee,
just... ground.

97
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,446
Hey, Ernie.
Not that you asked,

98
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:37,608
but I'm working at the school's
pop-up clothing sale.

99
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,741
We are selling
gently used clothes
to raise money for charity.

100
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:42,743
Hmm. It's cool you
decided to volunteer.

101
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:46,206
Volunteer?
More like volun-told.

102
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,579
Vice Principal Wysocki
is making me do it.

103
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,752
- Why?
- I don't know, something about
not paying attention in class.

104
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,334
Honestly,
I wasn't listening.

105
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,338
Anyway, we need more
guys' clothes

106
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,340
and I don't wanna ask
anyone I'm dating,

107
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,221
have dated
or might date,

108
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:03,183
so that leaves... you.

109
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,845
Um... what do you got?

110
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:08,599
Well, since it's for charity,
help yourself.

111
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,892
Oh.

112
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:16,607
Attention, everyone.

113
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,280
Don't bother bringing anymore
clothes to the pop-up sale,

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,744
we now have Ernie's
sweaty gym shorts!

115
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:27,247
No need to get any closer,

116
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sure you can smell them
from where you are.

117
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:33,293
Point taken!

118
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,626
I'll check my dad's closet.

119
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,297
He's got a couple coats
he never wears.

120
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:40,050
Okay, good. Oh, and since
we need more menswear,

121
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,302
you might wanna check
KC's closet, too.

122
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,395
( glasses beep )

123
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,779
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.

124
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,651
Agents McKenzie and Garcia.

125
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,484
- Oh, hey, girl.
- Hey.

126
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,075
I'm on to you.

127
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,448
Do us a favor, KC,

128
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,540
don't tell anyone you saw
us here, we could get fired.

129
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,832
Oh, no, no, no, you guys are
gonna get more than fired.

130
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,044
You two are going to prison,
you lowlifes.

131
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:16,667
Prison? Sure, agents aren't
supposed to date each other,

132
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,959
but what Johnson doesn't know
won't hurt him.

133
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,881
It's not like what
we're doing is illegal.

134
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,763
No, no, no.
You two are here

135
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:25,385
because I planted a seed that
I had sensitive information

136
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,508
and you two moles
took the bait.

137
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,269
The only crime
committed here

138
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,932
was when Agent McKenzie
stole my heart.

139
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,606
- Uh-uh-uh! Uh!
- Oh!

140
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,228
I don't believe
any of that for a second!

141
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:40,691
Now...

142
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,284
can you explain to me
why $20,000

143
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:47,237
would be wired to your account
and then withdrawn the next day?

144
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:49,079
Yeah, that's right. I got
information, my friend.

145
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:52,453
Are you laundering money?

146
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,874
Maybe funding a terrorist
organization?

147
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:56,457
Or perhaps you guys are lighting
the cash on fire

148
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,589
because you two
are a couple of maniacs!

149
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,340
Maniacs!

150
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,804
( sarcastic ) Yeah,
we're the maniacs.

151
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,886
Not that it's any
of your business,

152
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,548
but my grandmother
loaned me the money.

153
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,761
And why would your grandmother
loan you $20,000?

154
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,312
( sighs ) To buy this.

155
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:15,816
Was gonna wait
till after dinner, but...

156
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:19,610
Lori... will you marry me?

157
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,943
No!

158
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,737
You had to borrow money from
your grandmother to buy a ring?

159
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,620
Get back to me when you
open a savings account.

160
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,414
Hey, look, man, um...

161
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,837
just for future reference,
pizza place?

162
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,710
Not really the best place
to pop the question.

163
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,348
CRAIG: Kira!

164
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,800
KIRA: What?!

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,972
CRAIG: Have you seen
my brown coat?

166
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,644
( mouthing )

167
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:55,015
KIRA: What brown coat?

168
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,977
CRAIG: My brown spy coat.

169
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,650
The one with the built-in
laser doohickey.

170
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,191
KIRA: It's in with
your spy gear.

171
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,983
CRAIG: I'm looking
in my spy gear!

172
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,655
I don't see it!

173
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:08,198
KIRA: Well, did you look
on your stationary bike,

174
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:12,613
or as I like to call it,
"the pants tree"?

175
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:14,785
CRAIG: ( laughs sarcastically )
It's not there.

176
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,707
KIRA: That coat better not
be lost, Craig.

177
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,959
It's a two-million-dollar
gadget.

178
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,831
Two-million-dollars?!

179
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:23,924
Hey, son!
Where you going?

180
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:25,836
Uh... school.

181
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,387
It's 6:00.

182
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,089
Never too late to learn.

183
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,017
Kira!

184
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,809
KIRA: What?

185
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,061
I love you, baby.

186
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,813
Yeah, I'm still not helping
you find that coat, Craig.

187
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,814
Oh!

188
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:50,240
I cannot sell you these jeans,
Mrs. Crowmise.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,862
They are a crime
against fashion

190
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:53,203
and I will not be
your accomplice!

191
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,829
You shouldn't talk to your
math teacher like that!

192
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,830
Oh, it's okay, we're close.

193
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,251
I've had her
two years in a row.

194
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,874
So far.

195
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,048
Anyway, remember the brown coat
I donated?

196
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,551
I need it back. That coat is a
two-million-dollar spy gadget.

197
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,845
Seriously? Your dad owns
a two-million-dollar coat?

198
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,978
And he keeps a drawer full
of old soy sauce packets?

199
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,180
- Where is it?
- I'm so sorry.

200
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,062
I sold it
to some guy this morning.

201
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,354
Okay, I'm gonna need
your security tapes.

202
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,857
Entrances, exits, any
surveillance you might have.

203
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,899
Ernie, this is a pop-up sale.

204
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,241
The only surveillance we have
is Mrs. Eaton,

205
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,533
who keeps browsing
and never buys!

206
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,961
Well, at least tell me
what the guy looked like.

207
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,663
( scoffs ) I don't know.

208
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:45,335
He was-- He was round,
he was wearing a red shirt.

209
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,047
And, like, eating
something sweet.

210
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,920
You just described
Winnie the Pooh.

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,474
No... I don't think
that was him.

212
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,771
KC: I'm telling you, it's
the only way to find the mole.

213
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,684
If you wanna know how evil
thinks, you gotta talk to evil.

214
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,936
Fine, I guess
we have no choice.

215
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:08,438
To get inside, you're gonna need
the access code.

216
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:13,323
( clears throat )
11B4J27QR9TT.

217
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,324
( stammers )

218
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,949
Dang, if you were that hungry
I would've given you

219
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,331
some peanut butter crackers
from my backpack.

220
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,584
KC, it's too important
to have a paper trail.

221
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,296
You need to memorize it.

222
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:30,340
11B4J27QR9TT.

223
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,252
Okay. Yeah, no.
I got it.

224
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:37,057
Good, because it's far too
sensitive to keep repeating it.

225
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:39,019
You need me to say it again,
don't you?

226
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,560
( scoffs ) No.

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,473
I am a professional
international spy.

228
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:44,644
All right. I think
I can handle a code.

229
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,566
Okay, then what's the code?

230
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:50,110
- I know it starts with a one.
- ( groans )

231
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,364
No, no, I'm kidding.
Kidding, all right?
I got this.

232
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:57,237
( keypad beeps )

233
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,331
-9TS?
-GT! 9GT!

234
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,339
Hello, Zane.

235
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,560
Long time, no see.

236
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,144
Bernice, I'm glad
they let you visit me.

237
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:26,146
How's life?

238
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,438
Must not be easy
being stuck with KC's face.

239
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,571
I am KC.

240
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,194
Oh, yes. I see that now.

241
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,447
Still, must not be easy
being stuck with your face.

242
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:42,122
What brings you
all the way down here?
Let me guess.

243
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:45,035
You came to ask my permission
for Brett's hand in marriage?

244
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,827
( chuckles ) You're so
old-fashioned.

245
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:49,089
( sarcastic chuckle )
You're so delusional.

246
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,171
Look, I came here
'cause I need information.

247
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:53,593
And I need a bathroom
with a door.

248
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,335
I guess we're both
out of luck.

249
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,717
No, what you need
is a better attitude,

250
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,181
Mr. Stuck-in-the-poke-and-
never-seen-the-light-of-day-
the-rest-of-your-life.

251
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,104
Fine. I would be happy to give
you the information you require,

252
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:08,438
Miss Disappointingly-average-
teenage-spy-gotta-ask-her-
family-nemesis-for-help.

253
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,023
- Provided you
give me something.
- Sure. What is it?

254
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,196
Paint supplies, so I can paint
myself something to look at.

255
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,028
( scoffs ) Really?

256
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,489
I would have given you anything
and that's what you choose?

257
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,071
- And my freedom.
- No, no, no. Too late.

258
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,863
You already chose paints.

259
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:28,208
Now, look. Someone
is stealing information
from the Organization,

260
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,579
and I need to know
how you would do it.

261
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,043
Perhaps...
it's not being stolen.

262
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,175
Perhaps you shared it
with the wrong person.

263
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:37,878
What are you talking about?
No one even knows that
I'm a spy.

264
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,050
What about your blonde friend?

265
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,262
The one who talks faster
than she can think.

266
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,054
Marissa? No. No.

267
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,886
All of my secrets
are safe with her.

268
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:48,018
I mean, she never
told anyone that I practiced
kissing on my pillow.

269
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,152
You didn't hear that.

270
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:54,274
Think about it, KC.

271
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,447
It's always the people
that we trust the most.

272
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:59,489
Husbands betray wives.

273
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,242
Children lie to their parents.

274
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:05,996
Friends spread rumors
behind each other's backs.

275
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:09,119
Maybe Marissa is selling
your secrets for profit.

276
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,175
( inaudible dialogue )

277
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,928
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
how are you?

278
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,190
( chuckles ) Marissa, can I talk
to you in private for a second?

279
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,105
KC, what are you
doing here?

280
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,776
Zane was right,
I can't trust you.

281
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:39,149
Who is that guy and are you
selling him my secrets?

282
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,321
- He is my date.
- Your date?

283
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,703
Oh, so all of a sudden you
have a boyfriend that you
never even told me about?

284
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:46,286
I didn't tell you because
he's a freshman in college

285
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:50,120
and I knew you'd give me
a hard time 'cause
I'm still in high school.

286
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,002
No, Sean, Sean, Sean.
Don't leave.

287
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,084
I'm only technically
in high school

288
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,546
and I'm barely ever there!

289
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,088
Thanks a lot, KC.

290
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,260
Why are you spying on me?

291
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,512
There's a mole
in the Organization

292
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:06,596
and sometimes I tell you
highly classified information.

293
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,309
You actually thought that
I was selling your secrets?

294
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,601
For your information, when
you're telling me spy stuff,

295
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,813
most of the time I'm just
standing there quietly

296
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,606
waiting for you to stop talking
so I can start talking
about myself again.

297
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,569
I can't believe you.

298
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:22,152
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry, okay?

299
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,034
It was wrong, I should've
never suspected you.

300
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,156
But I am not sorry
for ruining your date,

301
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,949
because that guy's too old
for you. I do not approve.

302
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,791
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna have a little chitchat
with a criminal.

303
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,754
Oh, so I can't date someone
a tiny bit older than me,

304
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,377
but you can go hang out
with criminals?

305
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,209
That is a double standard,
missy.

306
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,801
Hey, at least
I have standards.

307
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,763
Well, she got me there.

308
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:51,721
Ah, KC, what do you
think of my painting?

309
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:53,773
Well, it's a pretty good alien.

310
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,605
It's a kitten.

311
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,607
In that case, it stinks.

312
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:01,982
You lied to me.
Marissa isn't the mole.
I'm taking the paints back.

313
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,614
I didn't lie to you. I was
simply illustrating a point.

314
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,117
Well, you illustrate points
about as well as you
illustrate kittens.

315
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,291
Now I need information.
How do I find the mole?

316
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,083
( clicks tongue )

317
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,035
Poor KC.

318
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:18,248
She's not asking
the right question.

319
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,000
I meant what I said.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,423
It's always the ones closest
to us that hurt us the most.

321
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,257
So ask yourself, KC,
who's closest to you?

322
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,309
I don't know.

323
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,011
Yes, you do.
Think, KC.

324
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,143
Who do you see every day?

325
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,224
I don't know.

326
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,226
Who knows your every move?

327
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,607
I don't know!

328
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,359
Who knows you better
than you know yourself?

329
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,902
Who knows you so well
that you'd never suspect them?

330
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,485
Even though they're
right under your nose.

331
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,567
My family! Okay? My family!

332
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,779
I said it, but why
would someone in my family

333
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,451
want to sell me out?

334
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,373
Well now...

335
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,915
you're finally starting
to ask the right questions.

336
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,928
KC, you okay, honey?

337
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,141
You've hardly said a word
since you got home.

338
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:15,265
Yeah. I'm sure you'd
love it if I just spilled
all my secrets to you.

339
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,268
Yes, I would. I mean, I like our
mother-daughter talks.

340
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,900
In fact, I like talking
to everyone in this family.

341
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,312
CRAIG: Kira!

342
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,364
What do you want
from me now?!

343
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,320
I searched this house
from top to bottom,
somebody took my coat!

344
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,282
Coat? Is there
a coat missing?

345
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,324
( nervous chuckle )
That's weird.

346
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:40,210
Craig, nobody took your coat.
Obviously, you lost it.

347
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,172
I didn't lose it.
The only thing I've ever lost

348
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:45,965
was my place in line for those
New Edition reunion tour
concert ticket.

349
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,927
'Cause somebody didn't
feel like standing anymore.

350
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:50,970
My water broke, Craig.

351
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,844
You know, if you didn't
lose the coat, where is it?

352
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,726
I mean, it's not like it
just up and disappeared.

353
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,938
Maybe it did!

354
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:00,440
It is a spy jacket!

355
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,522
You're right, Craig.

356
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,445
And maybe it went
on vacation.

357
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:09,739
Maybe it booked a flight
to Aruba for some R&R!

358
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:12,072
Ohh! And we were fourth in line
when your water broke.

359
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,575
If you could've waited
ten more minutes,
I'd have had my tickets!

360
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,500
Why are you staring at me?

361
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,333
Because you're sweating.

362
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,215
- What do you have to hide?
- I didn't do anything!

363
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:28,258
Oh, really? Then why do you
look so guilty?

364
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,590
All right, I admit it!

365
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,722
I knew it!
My own brother, the mole.

366
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,434
Mole?!

367
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:37,227
I'm no mole.
I took Dad's coat.

368
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:40,730
I gave it to Marissa for
a stupid charity pop-up sale.

369
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,442
Wait, so you're
not the mole?

370
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:45,485
No. I'm a two-million-dollar
coat stealer.

371
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:47,237
And I have no idea
where it is.

372
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:49,689
You do know that coat has
a tracking device, right?

373
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:53,323
What? I had no idea.

374
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,365
Yeah, good luck with that,
computer guy.

375
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,248
( door slams )

376
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,830
CRAIG: Kira, I got my hand stuck
in the toilet.

377
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,543
KIRA: What the heck was your
hand doing in the toilet?

378
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,465
CRAIG: I already looked
everywhere else.

379
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:10,210
What was I thinking?
Of course none of these
chuckleheads could be the mole.

380
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,523
( gasps ) Winnie the Pooh!

381
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,896
Thanks, tracking device.

382
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,327
Those cannolis,
best in the city.

383
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,765
Thank you, thank you.

384
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,066
And for my next trick,

385
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,359
I will make this jacket
disappear.

386
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,778
CRAIG: I'm telling you
the coat wasn't there before.

387
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:21,491
KIRA: Oh, so it just magically
appeared in your closet?

388
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,123
CRAIG: No, I bet you put it
there to make me look stupid.

389
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,586
KIRA: Craig, you do not need
my help to look stupid.

390
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,128
You do that all on your own,
baby.

391
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,468
KC: Hey, Brett. A kiss?

392
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,970
I don't see why not.

393
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:49,148
11B4J27QR9TT.

394
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,651
You're a liar, Zane!

395
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:56,366
11B4J27QR9TT.

396
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,197
You'll never get out of here!

397
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,452
- 11B4Q...
- KC. KC.

398
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,703
You're talking in your sleep.

399
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,585
What was I saying?

400
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:06,916
You kept talking about Zane

401
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,538
and then saying a bunch
of nonsense numbers.

402
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:10,670
What numbers was I saying?

403
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,793
I don't know.
11B4-something.

404
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,546
The code!

405
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:19,469
It's in here!
It's gotta be in here.

406
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,682
Uh, hate to break it to you,

407
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:24,844
but you made more sense
when you were sleep talking.

408
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:27,727
( groans ) They're bugging me.
They're bugging me!

409
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,520
Yes, and you're
starting to bug me.

410
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,733
Ah! I got it.

411
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,697
Ooh!

412
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,659
Ow! Whoo!

413
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:40,660
Ow.

414
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:45,034
Well, I found the mole.

415
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,667
Excellent, I can't wait to get
a hold of that slimeball.

416
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,869
I'll make him wish
he'd never been born.

417
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,582
Or, we could
forgive and forget.

418
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,714
What are you
talking about?

419
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,507
Well, technically,
the mole is me.

420
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,928
You?

421
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:01,551
Yeah, um, I've been
talking in my sleep.

422
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,262
Remember that code
that you ate for lunch?

423
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,345
Oh, yeah.
( grunts )

424
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:08,558
Well, let's just say I've
been practically singing
that code in my sleep.

425
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,310
So whoever bugged my room,

426
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,352
will have that tune stuck in
their head for quite a while.

427
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:13,983
Wait, if the code
has been leaked,

428
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,194
that means...

429
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,489
Oh, move!

430
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,783
No, no, no!

431
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,366
How could this
have happened?

432
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,460
Hey, look at this.

433
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,835
"Hello, KC.
If you're reading this,

434
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:37,467
then I have successfully
escaped.

435
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,759
That, or I tried to escape
and you caught me

436
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,803
and now you're reading this back
to me just to tease me.

437
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,635
I'd like to thank you, KC.

438
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:49,098
Without your help,
I never would have been able
to leave this place.

439
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,690
Thanks to your stay
in my barn,

440
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,603
I learned that when you're
stressed you sleep talk."

441
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,435
ZANE: "Thanks to the bug
 I planted,

442
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:56,606
it was only a matter of time

443
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,608
before you let
 the access code slip

444
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,990
and one of my people
 came to bust me out.

445
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,863
Oh, and thanks
 for the paint supplies.

446
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:05,615
It's amazing
 what you can accomplish

447
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,077
with a nice, sharp brush

448
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,829
and a dull guard.

449
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,832
I guess this is farewell.

450
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,626
But don't be sad, I'm sure
 we'll see each other soon."

451
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,632
Zane's out there.

452
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,174
He hates my family
more than ever,

453
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:27,016
and it's all my fault.

454
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,684
Rob, your name's on TV.
