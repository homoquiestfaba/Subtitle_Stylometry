- Congratulations.

00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:31,351
- Act of revenge
for what he did?

9
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,830
- You have nothing on me.

10
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,353
- We've got plenty.

11
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,727
- If he's dead, I had
nothing to do with it.

12
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:01,032
- Bullshit.

13
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:06,340
You left him to die.

But life changes in a second.

17
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,542
- [Tom] You come
from the province.

18
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,024
- I grew up there
with my sister Jinky.

19
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:42,506
We were happy there,
for the most part.

20
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:43,202
Papa drank too much.

21
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,077
And when he's drunk,

22
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,647
well, it wasn't that pretty.

23
00:03:58,347 --> 00:03:59,652

that baby crying?

I'm gonna give you all of this.

00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,538
You have to be able to run it.

Being old Nelly

00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,195
is not gonna get it done.

29
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,284
- [Das] Okay, Pops, okay.

30
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:25,199
- [Pierre] If there was
a family in the province,

31
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,333
and you know their
name, that was late,

32
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,595
could you figure out
what to do on your own?

33
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,205
- Yes.

That's not enough money!

Don't gamble what
you can't afford.

[melancholy music]

39
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,038
- [Sandra] So Jinky decided
to go to Manila and find work.

40
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,561
You don't wanna go, do you?

41
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,127
- No.

42
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:34,003
But someone has to work
to pay off Daddy's debts.

doing it again.

- Yeah, she's so beautiful.

46
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,498

- Hm?
- Take me with you.

49
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:01,247
- No.

50
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:02,247
You finish your studies first.

51
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,555
- But Manila's so beautiful.

52
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:06,251
You get a lot of opportunities
there, the job the money--

53
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:06,512
- No.

[solemn music]

55
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,309
- [Sandra] And she
was the oldest,

56
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:22,049
so the responsibility fell
on her to pay off the debt.

[baby cries]

58
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,145
I wish she had never gone.

59
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,329
Life in the province was hard,

60
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,289
but it was nothing
compared to the city.

61
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,209
[police sirens blare]

62
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,705
My mother found Jinky a job.

63
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:15,099
She got an old friend who work
as a cleaner in a hospital.

64
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,928
The pay was poor,

65
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,801
but it was more than we
could earn in the province.

66
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,725
- We'll just file this, and
we'll just call you, okay?

67
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,214
- [Sandra] But she made friends.

68
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,391
She told me about this
guy, a real nice guy.

69
00:07:57,182 --> 00:07:58,402
- Hey, do you need help?

70
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:01,361
- No, it's okay.

00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,278
- I'm Edward.

72
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,281
- I'm Jinky.

73
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:11,328
- Are you new here?

74
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:18,334
- Yes, I've been living
here for a week now.

75
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,597
I work as a cleaner
in the F wing.

76
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:23,208
- I work there too, as a porter.

77
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,296
I've seen you around.

78
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,607
- I'm really lucky
to have this job.

79
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,521
My family needs money.

80
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:40,310
- Look, if you're not,

81
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,921
if you don't have a boyfriend
and you need someone

82
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,010
to take you around the city--

83
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,402
- It's okay.

84
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:48,493
I have to go.

85
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:51,931
My shift starts in 10 minutes.

86
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:02,158
- Hey Jinky.

87
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:09,644
You wanna pay back the
money your father owes,

88
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,385
you're not gonna make
it working that job.

89

00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,506
- The money wasn't enough.

93
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,162
Cleaners don't earn much.

94
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,816
So she needed to
find a second job.

95
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,567
Once she decided
she'd become a dancer,

96
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,612
her mind was made up.

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,615
Jinky's always like that.

98
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:13,444
Very stubborn.

99
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,363
The second job meant
working at nights.

101
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,133
That's when she saw the fat man.

102
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,313
To work in the clubs,

103
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,015
every girl has to
see the fat man.

104
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:15,372

Off.

106
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:46,054
Okay, you'll work
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

107
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,068
- So what was it like
being a celebrity?

108
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,419
- I wasn't a celebrity, just
an up-and-coming TV host.

109
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:08,467
- You still think you're a star.

110
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,643
- [Che] It was a previous
life, previous time.

111
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,254
- And what happened?

112
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,690
I'll tell you what
happened, you were set up.

113
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,563
At a Christmas party.

114
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,089
All the executives there,

115
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,311
they raped your friend,

116
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,531
each and every one of them.

117
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,755
And then they just left her
there, just lying there.

118
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,541
You threatened to expose them,

119
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,283
threatened to go to the press.

120
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,720
I bet they didn't like
that very much, did they?

121
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,117
- That night it all changed.

122
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:52,596
They acted quickly.

123
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,338
They froze my bank accounts.

124
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:57,862
Give me my son.

125
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:00,211
They paid my husband.

126
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,734
I want my son.

127
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:02,692
They took my son.

128
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,363
I lost my child, my career.

129
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:27,629
I was homeless.

130
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,552
- [Lara] So where's
your son now?

131
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:38,422
- [Che] They took him away.

132
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:41,120
Okay, I'll do it.

133
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,645

She stays here and works for us.

She's fucked.

It is a beautiful country,

where women and children
are cheaper than cigarettes.

refused to help.

that was stationed here.

the same time as Jinky,

so we traveled home together.

00:46:17,203 --> 00:46:19,901
Oh, hi!
- Hey.

546

- How are you?

Someone left the door open.

time, a drunken footballer?

556

- You're not helping, Michelle.

557
00:47:41,283 --> 00:47:43,154
- I keep telling
her to be upfront.

558

- Really, Michelle, really?

559
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:51,161

was a tranny, she'd be fine.

more sympathetic, Che?

fucking bitch sometimes.

- What's your problem, Jinky?

565

Honesty is the best policy.

566

Be honest, get the money,
fuck them, and then get out.

wonder if you're even human.

it's too late to do anything.

Now maybe we can come up with
some kind of arrangement.

Who cares about a

So he beat her up.

He still paid.

longer than bruises.

hospital, I was working.

Rule number one.

- Never ask if they are
married or have kids.
