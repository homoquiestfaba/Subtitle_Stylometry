1
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,510
Huh?

2
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,724
- Kenji. Kenji.
- Aah!

3
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:28,269
I'm paying you to clean the floors,
not stare off into space.

4
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,534
I am sorry, Takagawa san,
but I got distracted.

5
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,871
Sadly, that is why no one comes
to the museum anymore.

6
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,478
Too many distractions. No discipline.

7
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,952
No respect for the old ways.

8
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,148
Come with me. I will show you.

9
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,919
But I saw...

10
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:09,741
Behold, the Black Samurai.

11
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,844
The Black Samurai.

12
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,319
Never heard of him.

13
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,789
The most fearsome warlord
in the history of Japan.

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,952
Do you see what I am getting at,
Kenji?

15
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:28,988
Uh...

16
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,156
Yes, Takagawa san.

17
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,427
You want me to mop in here.

18
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:39,166
No, that this exhibit
could save the museum.

19
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:49,974
What is happening?

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,740
I live.

21
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,573
Kenji, do something.

22
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,045
<i>Bonsai!</i>

23
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,086
Uh?

24
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:50,412
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

25
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,128
<i>Welcome to Shibuya Station.</i>

26
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,595
<i>Now arriving on Track 5.</i>

27
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,998
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

28
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,524
Wow, we made it, gang.

29
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,031
Shibuya Station.

30
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,034
The most popular meeting place
in all of Tokyo.

31
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,569
And I can see why.

32
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,139
Everyone in Japan is already here.

33
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,400
But, like, wouldn't you know it?

34
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,478
We're all out of Scooby Snacks.

35
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,591
Scooby Snacks. Scooby Snacks.

36
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,562
Way to go, Scoob.
A Scooby Snack vending machine.

37
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,732
Like, it's the wave of the future.

38
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,841
Hey, I've got a text message
from Miyumi.

39
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:39,675
She says,
"Meet me at the statue of Hachiko. "

40
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,716
Any idea what this Hachiko person
looks like?

41
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,911
Let's see. Hachiko. Hachiko.

42
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,057
Hachiko. Take a picture.

43
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,355
Hachiko.

44
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,123
Like, check it out, Scoob.

45
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,598
Hachiko's not a person, he's a pooch.

46
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:00,793
Here it is.

47
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,599
Hachiko used to greet his master every
day when he came home on the train.

48
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,071
One day his master died...

49
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,472
...and Hachiko
spent the rest of his life...

50
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,875
...waiting at the station
for his master to return.

51
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,942
Wow, sounds like
he was one cool canine.

52
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:20,385
Heh, heh. Hey, Scoob. Like, maybe
they'll put up a statue of you some day.

53
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,751
Me? Oh, boy.

54
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:28,821
Ta-da. Bow-wow. Ruff.

55
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,727
Look at Scooby. What a ham.

56
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:41,565
- It's going to take more than that.
- Huh?

57
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,178
If you want to have a statue
of your own in Japan...

58
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:47,077
...you must first become a legend.

59
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,241
Just like Hachiko.

60
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:51,978
Today, in honor of his great loyalty...

61
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:57,491
...his statue serves as a special place
for faithful friends to meet.

62
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,185
Uh, I'm sorry, but have we met?

63
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,263
Huh! You must be Miyumi.

64
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,922
And you are Miss Daphne Blake.

65
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,264
I have heard all about you
and the Scooby gang.

66
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:09,927
What do you know, Scoob?

67
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,633
Looks like our reputation precedes us.

68
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,276
Like, I hope that's a good thing.

69
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,845
Heh-heh-heh. Of course it is.

70
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,482
Can I tell you a secret?

71
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,609
I sometimes wish I could be a member
of the Scooby gang too.

72
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:25,879
Like, tell you what.

73
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:30,355
Next time there's a gruesome ghost
up in our grill, you've got first dibs.

74
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,460
Uh-huh.

75
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,323
Hey, don't worry, guys.

76
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,863
We're not here to solve any mysteries
this time.

77
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,799
We're here to watch Daphne compete
in the big martial-arts competition.

78
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,803
I'm so honored
to be invited to the tournament.

79
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,406
And so should you be.

80
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:50,478
Miss Mirimoto runs the most exclusive
martial-arts academy in all the world.

81
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,047
Only the most exemplary students
are accepted by her.

82
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,381
But first,
you must survive the tournament.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,882
Survive?

84
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:06,822
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say "survive"?
Ha, ha. I meant "win. "

85
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,055
First, you must win the tournament.

86
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,908
Wow, what a sweet ride.

87
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,279
All it needs
is a groovy green paint job.

88
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,386
Uh, not quite, Freddy.

89
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,613
I can think of one more thing it needs.

90
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,223
Like, how about a pilot?

91
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,122
- Huh?
- Don't worry. We're perfectly safe.

92
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:44,891
The hover jet is the world's first
fully functioning robotic plane.

93
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,432
That's amazing.

94
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,695
I've studied mechanical engineering...

95
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,305
...but I've never heard
of anything this advanced.

96
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,204
Here in Japan,
technology is taking over everything...

97
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,904
...while many of the old traditions
are fading away.

98
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:24,464
Please, Miss Mirimoto,
you must believe me.

99
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,905
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

100
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:31,843
Soon, he will come
for the Destiny Scroll.

101
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:39,077
A very entertaining story,
Mr. Takagawa.

102
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:44,420
I am sure that it will bring
many new visitors to see your exhibit.

103
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:48,927
Now, as you can see,
our grand tournament is about to begin.

104
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,795
We would be most pleased
to have you join us.

105
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:59,931
Sojo, please show our honored guest
to his seat.

106
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,633
You must listen.

107
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,045
The scroll...

108
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:09,848
...must be protected.

109
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,385
I can assure you, Mr. Takagawa...

110
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,216
...ghost or no ghost...

111
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:19,520
...the Destiny Scroll
will be quite safe behind these walls.

112
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,858
If you say so.

113
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,230
Sojo. Release him.

114
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,173
You must forgive poor Sojo.

115
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,639
He does only as he is told.

116
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,211
His loyalty to me is unquestioned.

117
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,316
The plane.

118
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,510
The plane.

119
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,855
Ah, the last of our guests to arrive.

120
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,760
Have them report
to the staging ground immediately.

121
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,027
We shall have a demonstration.

122
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,211
Wow, what a beautiful airport.

123
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,541
It's not an airport, Freddy.

124
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,549
This is a traditional Japanese garden.

125
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:23,283
Can't you just feel the peace
and tranquility?

126
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,459
Oh, yeah.

127
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:33,796
Scoob, old buddy, like, from here on out,
no matter what happens...

128
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,767
...I'm just gonna go with the flow.

129
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,102
Go with the flow.

130
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,800
All must wear uniform.

131
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,971
Gulp! Like, my go-with-the-flow
just got up and went.

132
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,616
Zoinks!

133
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,822
No, Sojo. Bad, Sojo.

134
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,894
Not them. Her.

135
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,554
All must wear uniform.

136
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,461
- Hyah!
- Aah!

137
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,667
Sorry, Sojo,
but I handle my own wardrobe.

138
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,015
Ha-ha-ha. Check it out, Scoob.

139
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,116
Like, it's a carnival of karate.

140
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,979
Ooh! Uh-huh.

141
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,781
The competition this year is fierce.

142
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:31,484
That's Kerry Kilpatrick,
the Irish national champion.

143
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:36,454
MIYUMl:
He's a two-fisted demolition dynamo.

144
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,325
Hyah!
MIYUMl: Sapphire Sonja.

145
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:43,996
The only thing deadlier than her kick
is her beauty.

146
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,334
Rah!
Zoinks!

147
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,874
MIYUMl: And that's Japan's own
Mad Dog Masimoto.

148
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,979
A favorite to win this year.

149
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:55,378
Once he's off his leash,
you're really in the doghouse.

150
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,218
Huh!

151
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,631
Gee whiz.

152
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,798
Like, talk about a creep
with a canine complex.

153
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

154
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,319
Most honored participants...

155
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:36,720
...welcome to Mirimoto Academy's
Tournament of Champions.

156
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:39,656
The finest martial artists
in all the world...

157
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:44,390
...have gathered here today
for one single purpose:

158
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,367
To prove that they are the best.

159
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,741
By this time tomorrow...

160
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:58,540
...most of you will be sent home
in humiliating defeat.

161
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,678
But there is one among you...

162
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:07,845
...who has already displayed
the heart of a champion.

163
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:10,651
Miss Daphne Blake?

164
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,059
Um, over here.

165
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,788
Hello.

166
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,593
Can this be?

167
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,598
The tournament has not yet begun...

168
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,138
...and already you have defeated
the mighty Sojo.

169
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,743
I didn't mean to. It's just that... Eh...

170
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,936
This is most impressive.

171
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,910
Perhaps you would honor us...

172
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:36,813
...with a demonstration
of your superior skill.

173
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,147
As in right now?

174
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,985
Your opponent will always attack
when you least expect it.

175
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:15,851
Huh?

176
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,697
Like, meow.
Talk about a kung-fu catfight, ha.

177
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,997
Uh-huh. Meow.

178
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:54,621
My hair band. I can't see.

179
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,962
Hey, that was a dirty trick.

180
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,399
The first rule of Mirimoto Academy:

181
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:03,629
If you want to win...

182
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:07,902
...you must be willing to do
that which others are not willing to do.

183
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,908
Most impressive, Miss Blake.

184
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,741
You lack proper training...

185
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:17,579
...but I see in you much potential.

186
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,549
The tournament begins tomorrow
at sunrise...

187
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:27,924
...but tonight,
a feast has been prepared in your honor.

188
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:31,992
Hear that, Scoob?

189
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,691
Like, a feast in our honor.

190
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,268
Oh, boy.

191
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:40,608
Finally, something worth fighting for.

192
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,332
Boy, the service here is great...

193
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,108
...but, uh, our waitress
sure could use a suntan.

194
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,407
She's not a waitress, Freddy.
She's a geisha girl.

195
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:25,076
Geisha, the ancient Japanese tradition
celebrating exquisite beauty.

196
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:28,087
Speaking of beauty,
check out the buffet table.

197
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,281
Oh, ho, ho!

198
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,417
It's like there's a party in my stomach
and everything's invited.

199
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:34,619
Yeah.

200
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,727
Hyah!

201
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,477
Ha-ha-ha. Like, you must be
a black belt in kung food.

202
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,905
Yeah.

203
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:59,748
Forget the karate chop.
Like, check out my karate chomp.

204
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,159
Huh?

205
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,186
Huh! Ninjas!

206
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:23,544
Wow, real-life ninjas. How cool.

207
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,907
I don't think these guys
are part of the act.

208
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,008
Watch out.

209
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,710
If it's a fight you be looking for...

210
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,481
...then you've found the bloke
to oblige you.

211
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:41,993
Out of my way.

212
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:45,656
Let Sapphire Sonja
show you how to kick it.

213
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,639
Hmm?

214
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:18,096
We're surrounded.

215
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,274
Who's that?

216
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,248
- Gulp! Who cares?
- Not me.

217
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,517
Let's get out of here.

218
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,356
Huh?

219
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,632
Huh?

220
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,407
Yipes!

221
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,873
Like, I almost forgot.

222
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,479
We're afraid of heights.

223
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,692
Shaggy, look.

224
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,926
At long last...

225
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:09,695
...the Destiny Scroll is mine.

226
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,141
Stop, thief.
- Huh?

227
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,446
You will not be allowed to escape.

228
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:26,046
You are too late.

229
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,054
We shall let steel decide.

230
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,297
Yipes!

231
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:01,820
The Black Samurai will live again...

232
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,322
...forever!

233
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:11,990
So it is true.

234
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,636
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

235
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:18,739
Gulp! Ghost?

236
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,000
It just doesn't add up.

237
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,906
The artwork in this collection
must be worth a fortune.

238
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,641
So why go through all that trouble
just to steal one scroll?

239
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,808
Well, gang,
it looks like we've landed...

240
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:34,149
...smack dab
in the middle of another mystery.

241
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:36,950
It is no mystery.

242
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:42,957
The legend of the Black Samurai
has been told for centuries.

243
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,861
May I present Mr. Takagawa...

244
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:51,233
...most honored curator from
the Tokyo Museum of Cultural History.

245
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,674
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Takagawa.

246
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,366
You'll have to excuse us.

247
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:58,308
We don't really know much
about Japanese folklore.

248
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,539
But ghosts are kind of our specialty.

249
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,478
Speak for yourself.

250
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,950
My specialty is a triple-decker
Scooby Snack-and-ice-cream...

251
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:07,645
...with-chocolate-sauce sandwich.

252
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,983
Ha, ha. Mine too.

253
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,182
Yum, yum, yum.

254
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,522
The legend began
hundreds of years ago...

255
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:18,132
...when fierce warriors
known as the samurai...

256
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,363
...served the warlords of Japan
with absolute loyalty.

257
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,064
<i>The most fearsome of all...</i>

258
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,732
<i>...were the ronin,
the samurai who had lost his master.</i>

259
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:34,314
<i>Set adrift,
like a wave on the open sea.</i>

260
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:41,645
<i>One ronin sought out
the master swordmaker Masamune.</i>

261
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:45,657
<i>The legendary master agreed
to forge the samurai...</i>

262
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:48,887
<i>...a sword of great mystical power...</i>

263
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:54,400
<i>...but it would take an entire year
to complete the work.</i>

264
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,936
<i>The master's evil-minded apprentice,
Muramasa...</i>

265
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:05,035
<i>...offered to forge him another sword,
but in only half the time.</i>

266
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,748
<i>The samurai returned...</i>

267
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,721
<i>...and upon drawing the blade...</i>

268
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:22,056
<i>...felt a surge of uncontrollable dark power.</i>

269
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,532
<i>The evil spirit of the apprentice
had passed into the blade itself.</i>

270
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:29,932
<i>It was a sword of hatred.</i>

271
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,970
<i>A sword of darkness.</i>

272
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,200
<i>A Sword of Doom.</i>

273
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:41,475
<i>And in that moment was born
the Black Samurai.</i>

274
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:49,389
<i>Finally,
the master's blade was complete.</i>

275
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:53,152
<i>He named it the Sword of Fate...</i>

276
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:59,231
<i>...and entrusted its mystical power
to a fearsome green dragon.</i>

277
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,667
<i>Heaven and earth trembled
as the two great swords clashed.</i>

278
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,438
<i>Until, using his sacred magic...</i>

279
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:15,276
<i>...the Green Dragon
defeated the Black Samurai...</i>

280
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,979
<i>...imprisoning him forever
within the Sword of Doom.</i>

281
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:25,320
BLACK SAMURAl:
No!

282
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:33,596
Centuries passed,
and the story faded into legend.

283
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:37,169
Wow, Mr. Takagawa,
that's some story.

284
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:42,170
Like, story nothing.
That sounds more like a nightmare.

285
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,312
Yeah.

286
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,116
But what does all of this
have to do with the Destiny Scroll?

287
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:52,481
The Destiny Scroll
holds the only clue...

288
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:56,454
...to the secret location
of the Sword of Doom...

289
00:27:56,624 --> 00:28:00,185
...in the form of an ancient riddle.

290
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,956
If the ghost can solve
the riddle of the scroll...

291
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:05,122
...he will reclaim the Sword of Doom...

292
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,701
...and free his evil spirit.

293
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,338
If only we'd gotten a good look
at that scroll...

294
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,906
...maybe we could have solved
the riddle first.

295
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,408
Yeah, like, too bad the scroll is gone.

296
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,047
Aw, too bad.

297
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:23,309
Heh-heh-heh.
Guess that's the end of this mystery.

298
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:27,353
No, my friends,
the mystery has only begun.

299
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:37,858
Huh! The Destiny Scroll.

300
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,068
So the other scroll was a fake.

301
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:43,864
Ha, ha. Psyche.

302
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,202
Yes, but the Black Samurai
will soon realize the deception...

303
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,469
...and return.

304
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,040
I will translate the inscription.

305
00:28:55,216 --> 00:29:01,212
"The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

306
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,552
The paper dragon shows the way. "

307
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:07,286
The journey of a thousand miles...

308
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,055
Begins with a single step?

309
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:13,632
The paper dragon shows the way.

310
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,736
I've got it.

311
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,428
Like, check it out, Scoob.

312
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:20,870
An origami octopus. Beat that.
Ha-ha-ha.

313
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,509
Hmm...

314
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,805
Look. Snowflakes.

315
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:36,088
That's it. The paper dragon
must be a reference to origami...

316
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:38,623
...the Japanese art of folding paper.

317
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:40,556
Velma's right.

318
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:46,166
Okay, guys, give us an origami dragon
but this time use the scroll.

319
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:47,828
No.

320
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,430
Just a little tuck here, a fold there.

321
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:55,337
This goes under, that goes over.

322
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,408
Ta-da!

323
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,347
The words have been rearranged.

324
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,781
Yes. It now reads:

325
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:10,618
"The journey begins
with a thousand steps. "

326
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,659
The journey begins
with a thousand steps?

327
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,193
How is that any different?

328
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:18,662
Hang on, gang.
I think I've got something.

329
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,563
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

330
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:23,565
Huh?

331
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:29,266
An ancient ruin located on a remote
jungle island in the South Pacific Ocean.

332
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,105
Yes. I've got it too.

333
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,679
The island temple is devoted to...

334
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,847
...the Green Dragon.

335
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,455
The Sword of Doom
must be hidden in the temple.

336
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:45,024
Then we've gotta find a way
to get to that island.

337
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,661
<i>- Sojo, ready the hover jet.
- Hai.</i>

338
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:53,028
Miyumi will accompany you
on your journey as my representative.

339
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,192
Huh! Thank you, sensei.

340
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,535
Mr. Takagawa, you will go along
as the team's translation expert.

341
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,973
I will serve with distinction.

342
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:07,012
A tropical-island vacation
in the sunny South Pacific?

343
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,709
Like, now you're speaking
our language.

344
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,352
Uh-huh.

345
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:22,924
We should be getting close.

346
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,929
I've uploaded the coordinates
into the navigation system...

347
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,898
...using my laptop's
wireless interface.

348
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,339
It's very exciting for me
to join you on this mystery.

349
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:35,670
I'm usually not allowed
to venture so far from Miss Mirimoto.

350
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,676
She seems like a really great sensei.

351
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:39,870
She is...

352
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:43,779
...but she demands absolute loyalty,
like that of a samurai.

353
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,010
Indeed.

354
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,519
Someone who still cares
for the old ways.

355
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,920
Yeah, like, the good old days...

356
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,027
...when people chased each other around
with big swords.

357
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:58,291
Pardon my saying so,
but that puts the mental in sentimental.

358
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,933
Uh-huh.

359
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:05,699
Here we go, gang.

360
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,108
I can't see anything.

361
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,216
It's like the whole world
just disappeared.

362
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,718
Zoinks! Like, so much
for our sunny South Pacific vacation.

363
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:23,948
The island should be right
in front of us.

364
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,125
Whoa!

365
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,968
Look, gang. There it is.

366
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,999
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

367
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:45,109
Nine hundred and ninety-seven.

368
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,509
Nine hundred and ninety-eight.

369
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,979
Nine hundred and ninety-nine.

370
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,083
One thousand.

371
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,278
Phew! We made it, Scoob.

372
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:59,115
Like, in your face,
Temple of a Thousand Steps.

373
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:02,456
<i>Thousand Steps.</i>

374
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,791
Yeah.

375
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:09,426
Scooby-Dooby... I'm pooped.

376
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,196
We made it, gang.

377
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:14,671
And check out that
stone carving above the temple door.

378
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,340
The Green Dragon.

379
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:26,146
Check out the size of that disco ball.

380
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,981
That's no disco ball, Shaggy.

381
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:30,056
It's a Japanese lantern.

382
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,887
Hey, maybe that's got something to do
with the next clue.

383
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:39,227
Or maybe we should just say we tried
and, like, call it a day.

384
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,061
Zoinks!

385
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,237
Jinkies.

386
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:56,383
- Shaggy, you did it.
- I did?

387
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:58,519
I mean, I did.

388
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,821
Like, what did I do, Scoob?

389
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,684
I don't know.

390
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:06,588
It looks like some kind of treasure map.

391
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,262
Showing the whole island.

392
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,364
Is that the Sword of Doom?

393
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,763
Huh! Yes, it must be.

394
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,370
But it's on the other side of the island.

395
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:20,029
I will translate the inscription.

396
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:25,612
"The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon. "

397
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,371
Another dragon riddle?

398
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,209
Uh, speaking of riddles...

399
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:33,820
...like, does this mean
there's a cafeteria on this island?

400
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:43,124
No. We must get out of here.

401
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,295
Like, why?

402
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,263
Hurry, before they catch us.

403
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,788
Okay, everybody just stay calm...

404
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,482
...and let me do all the talking.

405
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:16,325
Hello there. Heh.

406
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,897
We're from America.

407
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,669
Like, how do we get ourselves
into these things?

408
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:31,169
<i>...Droo-ga-ga.</i>

409
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:35,643
<i>Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.</i>

410
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,350
"Droo-ga-ga"?

411
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:40,510
It must be their name
for the Green Dragon.

412
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:43,486
They are going to offer us
as a sacrifice.

413
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:50,023
And I think we're going to be married
to that icky tribal chief.

414
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,130
Ew.

415
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,464
Not if I can help it.

416
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,799
Miyumi, if you can reach my bag...

417
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,636
...I've got a plan to save all our skins.

418
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,300
Okay.

419
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,519
Boy, you guys really know
how to cook...

420
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:27,062
...hmm, but there's something
still missing.

421
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,502
Huh?

422
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,669
Mmm. Hey, now that's more like it.

423
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,512
Here, taste.

424
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:51,849
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on in, the water's fine.

425
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:56,094
Like, now we're cooking.
Right, Scoob?

426
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:57,322
Yeah.

427
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:12,679
I mean, mmm! Yummy.

428
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:15,338
Okay, that should do it.

429
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:18,781
Now, just cover and simmer
for one hour.

430
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,613
Huh?

431
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:28,521
Zoinks!

432
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:32,028
Ha, ha. That's the problem
with gourmet cooking nowadays.

433
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,997
Like, everyone's a critic.

434
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:42,240
<i>Huh! Droo-ga-ga!</i>

435
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,045
Huh! You did it, Velma.

436
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:57,281
Lucky for us
the plane's robotic navigator...

437
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,722
...is still connected
to my wireless interface.

438
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,795
The villagers must think
the hover jet is the Green Dragon.

439
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,262
So, like, what are we dragging
our feet for?

440
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,661
Come on.

441
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,294
Look, how magnificent.

442
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:38,189
The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon.

443
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,166
MIYUMl:
The riddle is pointing to the waterfall.

444
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,770
So, like, what do we do next?

445
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,706
We go in for a closer look.

446
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:51,606
Like, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

447
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,332
Weird.
Check it out.

448
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:18,296
Huh?

449
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:26,170
Come on, Scoob.

450
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,178
There's nothing to be afraid of.

451
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,373
Yeah, see?

452
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,916
Like, they're only statues.

453
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,485
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

454
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:37,179
Would you come with us
for a Scooby Snack?

455
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,422
Nope.

456
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,426
Would you do it
for two Scooby Snacks?

457
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,064
Uh-uh.

458
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,097
How about 10 Scooby Snacks?

459
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:56,265
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

461
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:04,575
Wow, look at this place.

462
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,946
We've found it at last.

463
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,886
The Sword of Doom.

464
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,727
So, like, what are we waiting for?

465
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:21,299
Let's grab the sword
and blow this pop stand.

466
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,369
Uh-huh.

467
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,061
I don't know, guys.

468
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:28,803
Something doesn't feel right
about this.

469
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:33,310
But Miss Mirimoto is expecting us
to bring the sword back to Japan.

470
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:36,443
If you want to win...

471
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:40,986
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

472
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,089
Zoinks! That did it.

473
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,698
Run for it!

474
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:21,323
Huh? Yikes!

475
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,256
Foolish mortals.

476
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,330
Return the sword to me
and I shall destroy you quickly.

477
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:36,271
Return the sword and be destroyed?

478
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:40,341
Like, I'd hate to hear
option number two.

479
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,836
Hey!
Oof!

480
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,865
My glasses.

481
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,031
Oh, I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

482
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,743
That's funny,
I can't see a thing with your glasses.

483
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:54,053
Zoinks!

484
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,420
Run!

485
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:08,835
Huh?

486
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:13,873
Sojo?

487
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:21,571
It's all very simple.

488
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:25,378
Sojo has been behind
these samurai shenanigans all along.

489
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:28,453
He stole the Black Samurai's armor
from the museum.

490
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:33,218
And he used this high-tech mini jetpack
to fly around like a real live ghost.

491
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,555
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

492
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:40,928
Sojo's master plan was to bring
the legend of the Black Samurai to life...

493
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:43,592
...and scare everyone away
from the tournament.

494
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:47,099
<i>That way he could steal
the Destiny Scroll...</i>

495
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:50,732
<i>...then search for the Sword of Doom
on his own.</i>

496
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:55,145
Once we set out
to solve the mystery...

497
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:58,444
...his only hope was to steal
the sword from us.

498
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,247
Like, talk about a sneaky samurai.

499
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:04,619
Yeah, sneaky.

500
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:05,850
Yes.

501
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:08,119
And he would have gotten away
with it too...

502
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,763
...if it weren't for you meddling kids.

503
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:12,193
Sojo!

504
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:22,268
- Zoinks!
- Yikes!

505
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,344
- Jeepers!
- Jinkies!

506
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,545
Dang, I still don't have a catch phrase.

507
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,344
We must protect the sword.

508
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,490
Huh! They're robots.

509
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:39,023
Ninja robots!

510
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,490
Double cool!

511
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:43,221
Uh, sorry, I...
I geeked out there for a sec.

512
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,160
So, like, the ninjas
were your own robots?

513
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,824
Huh? I don't get it.

514
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,335
The tournament was just an excuse...

515
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:58,069
...to gather the greatest martial artists
from around the world.

516
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,843
<i>Using computer analysis...</i>

517
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:10,012
<i>...their various fighting styles
were digitized...</i>

518
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,715
<i>...into my ninja robots.</i>

519
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:17,155
After that, all I needed
was to find someone...

520
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:20,357
...who could solve
the riddle of the Destiny Scroll.

521
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:24,595
And who better than the world's
greatest teenage detectives?

522
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:26,000
Come on, Miyumi.

523
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:28,505
We can fight them together.

524
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:30,710
Miyumi?

525
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:33,870
Huh! You're one of them.

526
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:38,177
I'm sorry,
but I must remain loyal to my sensei.

527
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:40,582
Tomorrow night,
when the moon is full...

528
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:44,690
...I will resurrect the Black Samurai
from the Sword of Doom.

529
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:50,023
Once I have freed his spirit,
he will call me master.

530
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:51,755
No.

531
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:53,422
This is madness.

532
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,693
Once the Black Samurai
has returned...

533
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:58,463
...I will order him
to lead my robot ninjas...

534
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,972
...against the ignorant forces
of this modern age.

535
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:04,610
Then the ancient world
of the samurai...

536
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:06,905
...and the new world of technology...

537
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,449
...shall exist in perfect harmony.

538
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:14,553
- Oh.
- Hmm, it could work.

539
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:18,054
- Miyumi, did you know about this?
- No.

540
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:20,591
My only instructions
were to earn your trust...

541
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:22,956
...by becoming your friend.

542
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,928
The first rule of Mirimoto Academy.

543
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,760
If you want to win...

544
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:32,998
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

545
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,801
But if you do things
that a winner wouldn't do...

546
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:38,467
...that automatically
makes you a loser.

547
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:40,237
Hyah!

548
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,581
Huh?

549
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:44,781
- Zoinks!
- Uh-oh!

550
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:46,483
Whoa!

551
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,861
Like, all aboard
the Samurai Sword Express.

552
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,191
Shaggy and Scooby got away.

553
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:03,462
But you will not be so fortunate.

554
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,370
Miyumi, Sojo, come.

555
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,134
I hope you will enjoy your new role...

556
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:15,145
...as part of the museum's
permanent collection.

557
00:47:57,691 --> 00:47:59,056
Shaggy?

558
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:17,743
Zoinks!

559
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:24,577
Way to go, Scoob.
I think we lost them.

560
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,412
Huh?

561
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,453
Gulp! Speaking of losing,
like, we're losing altitude.

562
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:35,961
Ungh!
Phew.

563
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:38,964
Huh?

564
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:58,077
Welcome to Green Dragon Sushi.
You sit.

565
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:01,084
Eat sushi. Good for you, eh?

566
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:04,314
Like, you got anything back there
without a head on it?

567
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,224
Ew.

568
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:12,262
You like miso soup?

569
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:15,333
Miso soup? Sounds perfect. Ha, ha.

570
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:17,333
Like, me so hungry.

571
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:21,099
Yeah. Me so hungry too.

572
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,443
Ah! Like, that really hit the spot.

573
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,446
Yum, yum.

574
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:35,944
I am Matsuhiro.

575
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:37,454
Menu?

576
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,852
Hey, check it out, Scoob.

577
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:43,656
Like, it's our old friend,
the Green Dragon.

578
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,664
Ah! So you know the legend.

579
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,261
You could say that.

580
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:52,632
Do you know what I like most
about legends?

581
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:56,333
New chapters are being written
all the time.

582
00:49:57,778 --> 00:49:59,803
You never know
what is going to happen next.

583
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:06,747
Zoinks!
Yipes!

584
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:11,117
Gulp! Like, Sword of Doom,
don't fail us now.

585
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,385
Eh? The Sword of Doom?

586
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,153
But how?

587
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:17,660
Like, we'll tell you later.

588
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:21,824
Right now, we've got a serious case
of the robot ninjas.

589
00:50:22,002 --> 00:50:23,867
Robot ninjas?

590
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,338
Hyah!

591
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:32,137
Now we will have some fun.

592
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,387
No! The Sword of Doom.

593
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:57,364
They are gone.

594
00:50:57,537 --> 00:50:59,869
Gee whiz, for a sushi chef...

595
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,032
...you're no cold fish
with a samurai sword.

596
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,580
That is because I am samurai.

597
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:19,924
Give it up, Freddy.
Those doors must be 3 feet thick.

598
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:23,355
We gotta get out of here somehow.

599
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,260
I'll chop away all night if I have to.

600
00:51:28,135 --> 00:51:30,763
We do not have all night.

601
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:36,035
I should not have been so critical
of this modern age.

602
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:39,237
If only I had one more chance...

603
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:45,408
...I would fight to save this world
like a modern-day samurai.

604
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:47,811
Huh?

605
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:02,891
You've freed us, Kenji. You're a hero.

606
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,600
Takagawa san?

607
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:09,071
Why did you lock yourself
in the vault?

608
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,005
There is no time to explain.

609
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:17,679
There will be more than one samurai
brought back to life.

610
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:25,448
How could we let those rotten robots
take the Sword of Doom?

611
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,149
What are we gonna do now?

612
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:29,586
I don't know.

613
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,787
Look there.

614
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:35,025
The great mountain, Fuji san.

615
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:41,038
Sacred training ground
for generations of samurai.

616
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,505
Samurai?

617
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:46,112
But, like, we don't know anything
about being samurai warriors.

618
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:47,610
Mm-mm.

619
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:50,715
Do not be afraid.

620
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,182
A samurai must overcome his fear.

621
00:52:54,354 --> 00:52:55,878
When fear is gone...

622
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:58,650
...the mind will be empty.

623
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,994
Ha, ha. Like, an empty mind?

624
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,562
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Ha-ha-ha.

625
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,892
Now, that's something
I've got already.

626
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:09,035
Uh-huh. Me too.

627
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,699
The samurai never hesitates.

628
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:14,534
He acts, he fights, he wins.

629
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:18,303
Without fear, without anger,
without mind.

630
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:20,412
And without lunch breaks.

631
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,380
Like, I'm ready to trade in
this samurai sword for a shish kebab.

632
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,577
Oh, shish kebab.

633
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:29,847
Yum, yum.

634
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:38,524
That's it, Scoob. We did it.

635
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:43,563
<i>Well done, tomodachi.</i>

636
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:45,602
You are ready to begin.

637
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:48,036
Gulp! Begin?

638
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:50,199
The last chapter has ended.

639
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:53,972
The next is yet to be written.

640
00:53:57,884 --> 00:54:00,352
These are the four gates:

641
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:03,082
Earth, Air...

642
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,588
...Fire and Water.

643
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:08,626
Passing through each,
you will be purified.

644
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:11,855
You have already found
the Gate of Earth.

645
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:13,260
Huh?

646
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,800
All you must do now is pass through.

647
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:21,397
Ha, ha. Like, that was easy.

648
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:23,439
The journey has begun.

649
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,307
There can be no going back now.

650
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,744
Okay. Like, where to next?

651
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,214
The legend tells of two swords...

652
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:36,719
...the Sword of Doom
and the Sword of Fate.

653
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:42,058
Pass beyond the four gates
to the lair of the Green Dragon.

654
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:44,992
Wake him from his ancient slumber...

655
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:48,225
...and seize the Sword of Fate.

656
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:52,770
Gulp! Like, any chance you'd throw in
a couple of Scooby Snacks for the road?

657
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,775
Like, Scoob, old buddy...

658
00:54:56,943 --> 00:55:00,435
...remind me again
how we got talked into this.

659
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:04,174
I don't remember.

660
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,684
There it is.

661
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:09,617
That must be the Gate of Air.

662
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:13,960
Like, last one there
is a rotten samurai.

663
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,490
Ha, ha. We made it.

664
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,134
Huh?

665
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:23,359
Yipes!

666
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:28,836
Gulp! Like, whatever you do, Scoob,
don't look down.

667
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,476
Yikes!

668
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,612
Phew! Like, that was a close one.

669
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,814
Huh?

670
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,895
Like, check us out, Scoob.
We're hanging 10.

671
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,701
Gulp! Ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit,
that is.

672
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:11,117
There it is, Scoob. The Gate of Fire.

673
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:22,319
Whoa!

674
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,865
The Gate of Water.

675
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:33,096
Water.

676
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:41,537
Huh?
Ooh!

677
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,615
We made it, Scoob.

678
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:46,911
This must be the Green Dragon's
groovy grotto.

679
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:51,751
Like, not bad for a mystical dragon
who probably doesn't even exist.

680
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:57,056
Who dares enter my sacred grove?

681
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,764
Be ye samurai?

682
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:05,899
You bet. Like, I'm Shogun Shaggy...

683
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:10,236
...and this is my faithful companion,
Samurai Scooby-Doo.

684
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,139
Gulp! Hello.

685
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:16,578
O Great Green One,
we come bearing rotten news.

686
00:57:16,749 --> 00:57:21,777
The Sword of Doom is back
and the Black Samurai is on the attack.

687
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:27,556
Impossible.

688
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:33,398
Ages ago,
the Sword of Doom was hidden away...

689
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:39,095
...protected by guardians of stone,
high atop a secret mountain...

690
00:57:39,272 --> 00:57:45,302
...on a savage island surrounded
by an impenetrable fog.

691
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:51,677
Yeah, funny story about that.

692
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,448
But, like, that's all ancient history.
Tonight, the modern world is in danger...

693
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,457
...and we need your help.

694
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:05,622
There is no place left
in the world for dragons.

695
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:09,792
What are you?

696
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:14,497
A big green dragon
afraid of a little sword fight?

697
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:22,946
You don't look like samurai.

698
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:29,155
- Tell him, Shaggy.
- Gulp!

699
00:58:29,322 --> 00:58:30,687
Like, the truth is...

700
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,391
That's better.

701
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:42,994
Like, wow. Ha, ha.

702
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:47,367
Check it out, Scoob.
We're rolling old-school, samurai-style.

703
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,168
Yeah, old-school.

704
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:55,540
For centuries,
I have guarded the Sword of Fate...

705
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:59,173
...awaiting the day when its service
would again be needed.

706
00:58:59,352 --> 00:59:02,788
That day has finally come.

707
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:13,258
The legend must end
where it all began.

708
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:16,834
Like, up, up and away we go.

709
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:19,062
Whee!

710
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:31,247
Sojo, come.

711
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:32,907
It is time.

712
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:48,757
The Destiny Scroll
still holds one last secret.

713
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:53,698
"Standing on the bridge of his defeat...

714
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:57,206
...hold the Sword of Doom
to the rising full moon.

715
00:59:57,377 --> 00:59:59,538
The spell will be broken...

716
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:02,237
...and the spirit of the Black Samurai...

717
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:05,782
...shall be set free. "

718
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:09,822
Sojo, walk to the bridge.

719
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:13,220
Sojo walk to bridge.

720
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:19,456
Miyumi, do not fail me this night.

721
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:23,898
Your loyalty shall be rewarded
in the coming new world.

722
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,368
Yes, sensei.

723
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,237
Okay, gang, get ready.

724
01:00:34,781 --> 01:00:37,773
I can't believe Miyumi's
really going through with this.

725
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,647
Ohh! With friends like her,
who needs enemies?

726
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:48,519
Miyumi, sword.

727
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:50,526
Huh? Huh?

728
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,794
The treacherous little fool. Ugh!

729
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:59,665
Yahoo! Way to go, Miyumi.

730
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,670
I knew you were one of us.

731
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,835
- Oops!
- Now, Velma.

732
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,539
Hit it, Kenji.

733
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,054
Magnetic pulse away.

734
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:31,035
The magnetic pulse is
knocking out their electrical systems.

735
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:35,035
It worked.

736
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:58,562
Hmm. Maybe it worked
a little too well.

737
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:04,093
Ungrateful child.

738
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:09,435
I was blinded by my loyalty to you,
but now I can see clearly.

739
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:12,772
How dare you disobey me?

740
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:22,854
Huh! The sword!

741
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,124
<i>Bansai!</i>

742
01:02:57,323 --> 01:03:02,818
The Black Samurai lives again.

743
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:08,063
No, samurai.

744
01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:09,997
I am the master here.

745
01:03:10,169 --> 01:03:12,103
Bow before me...

746
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:15,263
...and I will give you the world.

747
01:03:18,478 --> 01:03:20,639
Foolish one.

748
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:29,317
It is you who shall call me master.

749
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,058
Bow before me, mortals.

750
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:41,824
Unh!
Unh! Whoa!

751
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,470
KENJl: Unh!
Unh! Whoa!

752
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,808
All shall serve me...

753
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,710
...forever!

754
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:02,978
Shaggy, look.

755
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:13,489
At last, freedom is mine.

756
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,896
Oh, no. Like, we're too late.

757
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,160
Fear not.

758
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:20,499
Shogun Shaggy, Samurai Scooby...

759
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:23,233
...you must carry on the fight.

760
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:25,809
Unsheathe the Sword of Fate...

761
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:29,880
...so that my spirit
may enter the blade.

762
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,847
I shall be with you always...

763
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:38,047
...guiding the sword from within.

764
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:50,525
Guys, look.

765
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:52,568
Huh! It's Shaggy and Scooby.

766
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:54,228
Ow! My neck.

767
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:58,735
Like, right on time, late as usual.

768
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:14,890
Who dares challenge
the Black Samurai?

769
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:17,222
Zoinks! Like, here we go, Scoob.

770
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:20,126
Remember what they taught us
in samurai school.

771
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:23,234
Uh... Uh, I forgot.

772
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:33,973
Huh?

773
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:37,477
The Sword of Fate?

774
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,911
Impossible.

775
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,883
Like, you think that's impossible...

776
01:05:42,054 --> 01:05:45,490
...try flying into Tokyo
on a green dragon sometime.

777
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:33,737
Hyah!

778
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:50,019
Fools. You are no match for me.

779
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:54,455
Aah!
Yipes!

780
01:06:57,563 --> 01:07:01,021
A samurai must overcome his fear.

781
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,638
When fear is gone,
the mind will be empty.

782
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:08,706
Like, did you hear that, Scoob?

783
01:07:08,874 --> 01:07:11,172
Yeah, I did.

784
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:13,834
It's that sushi sword master,
Matsuhiro.

785
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,207
He's in my head.

786
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,508
No, I'm not. I'm over here.

787
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:20,846
The samurai acts without anger.

788
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,682
He fights without mind.

789
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:29,653
Yikes!

790
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,820
Don't think, Scoob. Just let it go.

791
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:34,022
Like, no mind.

792
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,327
Oh, yeah.

793
01:07:37,703 --> 01:07:43,198
The Sword of Doom
shall be your destroyer.

794
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:54,743
Hyah!

795
01:07:58,557 --> 01:08:02,823
No!

796
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:19,972
Ha, ha. Like, that psychotic samurai
forgot one thing.

797
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:23,445
When it comes to no mind,
we've got everybody beat.

798
01:08:23,616 --> 01:08:25,584
Like, our minds are always empty.

799
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:27,412
Yeah.

800
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:32,622
Scooby, Shaggy, that was amazing.

801
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:37,920
Huh?

802
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,403
Like, it's just a little old man.

803
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:48,938
Thank you...

804
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:52,737
...most honored friends.

805
01:08:52,912 --> 01:08:54,971
You have released my spirit...

806
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:59,584
...from the evil power
of that cursed sword...

807
01:08:59,752 --> 01:09:02,619
...and saved your world.

808
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:07,748
I shall be eternally grateful.

809
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:11,761
You are indeed samurai...

810
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:15,423
...and your legend shall be told...

811
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:18,831
...forever.

812
01:09:22,274 --> 01:09:23,332
Wow.

813
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:24,942
He disappeared.

814
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,941
Well, you gotta hand it to him.

815
01:09:27,112 --> 01:09:29,945
He went out in real samurai-style.

816
01:09:32,184 --> 01:09:33,515
Congratulations...

817
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,688
...samurai.

818
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:41,893
The last chapter of the legend
has finally been written...

819
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:44,723
...by you.

820
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,365
<i>Welcome to...</i>

821
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:50,661
<i>...the new Tokyo Museum
of Cultural History...</i>

822
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:54,567
<i>...and the grand opening
of our most legendary exhibit...</i>

823
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:59,074
<i>...the ghost of the Black Samurai.</i>

824
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:03,148
And so,
it is with great honor that I present...

825
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:08,753
...for loyal service to his friends,
to Japan and to all the world...

826
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,388
...this statue...

827
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:15,753
...in honor of Scooby-Doo.

828
01:10:20,866 --> 01:10:23,892
<i>Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.</i>

829
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,533
Scoob, you really did get
your own statue.

830
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:33,371
Ha, ha. And, like,
they even got your good side.

831
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:34,773
Yeah.

832
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:39,014
MIYUMl:
Ha, ha. Congratulations, Scooby.

833
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:43,619
Now Japan will remember you forever.

834
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:46,280
Are you sure
you won't come with us, Miyumi?

835
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,052
There's bound to be other mysteries
that need solving.

836
01:10:49,228 --> 01:10:51,890
And there's always room for one more
in the Mystery Machine.

837
01:10:52,064 --> 01:10:54,760
Yeah, like, you could sit
in the back with me and Scooby.

838
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,993
Yeah, sit with me.

839
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,130
You're all very sweet...

840
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:01,466
...but solving mysteries
is what you do best.

841
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,803
Now I need to figure out
what it is that I do best.

842
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,238
Then maybe someday...

843
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:09,108
...I will have what it takes
to become a legend too.

844
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:11,078
Just like you, Scooby.

845
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:14,609
Aw...

846
01:11:22,428 --> 01:11:24,487
Heh, heh. Oh, brother.

847
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:25,891
This could take a while.

848
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:30,599
We may just have to leave Scooby here
and take the statue home.

849
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:40,408
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
