1
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,648
Right.

2
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,681
When can I start, Captain?

3
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:49,821
We got two towers on the perimeter.

4
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,622
One on the inside.

5
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:54,524
Basically, guys who poke their eyes
out, secure our guys

6
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,426
and then we hightail it back to Turkey.

7
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,460
Any questions?

8
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,931
There was two of us behind enemy lines.

9
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:04,933
DOD let us rot.

10
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:08,502
What's that, Sergeant?

11
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,535
Nothing, Captain.

12
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,775
Based on the latest satellite pass,

13
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:19,244
Saddam is sending
reinforcements down to defend..

14
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:20,812
So he's falling for our bluff.
- Right.

15
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:23,481
And while he's looking down South,
Delta will swoop in from the North

16
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,216
and grab our boys at Amadiya.

17
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:28,518
Are you confident that Lang's
ODA can handle this alone?

18
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,551
Based on the Intel, yeah, I am.

19
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,498
Heckers, take point.

20
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,945
Looks like we spoke too soon.

21
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,978
We got motion sensors here.

22
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,460
This is great.

23
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,364
Because we trusted intel,
we've got no other option.

24
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,868
Falcon One this is Jackknife.

25
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,369
Do you copy?

26
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:15,504
This is Falcon One.

27
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,472
Jackknife, go ahead.

28
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:19,473
Patch me through to command.

29
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,275
We got a major problem here.

30
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:24,444
Will do, Captain.

31
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,645
Jackknife,

32
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,447
this is Mercury Leader.

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,681
What's going on there?

34
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:29,648
Over.

35
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,517
Intel was for shit, sir.

36
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,552
We lost the element of surprise
and we're still in the bush.

37
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,321
Do you still have a shot

38
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,055
at opening the objectives?

39
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,957
Over.

40
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,858
Hutch?

41
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,394
Mercury Leader, do you copy?

42
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:47,428
Mercury Leader, do you copy?

43
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,364
Falcon One, do you copy?

44
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,873
You got to be fucking kidding me.

45
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:04,309
Captain, this place is sewn
up tighter than Fort Knox.

46
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:05,911
Falcon One, do you copy?

47
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:06,912
Dammit!

48
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,579
We lost contact.

49
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,082
Christ.

50
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:18,721
OK.

51
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,754
This way.

52
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,626
I know Mike Lang.

53
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,593
Didn't even request backup.

54
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,728
I don't care, Norm.

55
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,029
Just pull the plug on it before it
becomes a major embarrassment.

56
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,664
I agree.

57
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,697
The last thing we need is
another goddamn Tehran.

58
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,578
Take that bunker there.

59
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,845
Aw, fuck that, Captain.

60
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:50,580
If we don't extract now, we're history.

61
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,848
Did I ask you for your
assessment, Sergeant?

62
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,349
No, but...

63
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:56,383
Then save it for your report.

64
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:07,760
I have them It's a minefield.

65
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:10,796
Falcon One,
you in for of little mine sweeping?

66
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,766
Bloom's on the way, Jackknife.

67
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,000
All right, Begs.

68
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,034
Bring her in, baby.

69
00:06:58,934 --> 00:06:59,935
We got a smokescreen.

70
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,968
Party time, gentlemen.

71
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,774
Let's party.

72
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,090
Vickers, right flank.

73
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,661
In position.

74
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,999
Cap, two bogey, 6 o'clock.

75
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,449
Hutch, take him with you.

76
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,818
I got him, Cap.

77
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,696
Hutch, behind you.

78
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,729
Get your ass down.

79
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:24,803
We got a heavy.

80
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:25,837
10 o'clock, Cap.

81
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:26,772
Bunker's clear.

82
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,805
Lombardi, let's move.

83
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,080
Second bunker clear, Mac.

84
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:38,147
Go! Go!

85
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,081
Go!

86
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:40,048
We're on the move.

87
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:42,082
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

88
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:47,686
More company, 11 o'clock, Cap.

89
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:15,844
Jackknife, we've reestablished the.

90
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,878
Jackknife, what's going on?

91
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:20,614
Mercury Leader, we still have a shot
of fulfilling the objective.

92
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:21,816
Over.

93
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:22,949
Jackknife,

94
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:23,983
this is Mercury Leader.

95
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:25,618
Pull the plug, Mike.

96
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,187
Over.

97
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,557
Jackknife to Mercury Leader, come in.

98
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,824
We got our orders, Cap.

99
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:34,225
Let's get the hell out of here.

100
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:35,860
That's enough, Lombardi.

101
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:37,893
They could have moved the pilots by now.

102
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:50,672
Jackknife, this is Falcon One.

103
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,639
Proceeding to the primary LZ.

104
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:53,640
Negative, Falcon One.

105
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,108
Maintain your position.

106
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:57,211
I repeat, hold your position.
- What are you doing?

107
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,778
We've been ordered to abort?

108
00:09:58,811 --> 00:09:59,946
Then you abort.

109
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,615
The rest of us have got a job to do.

110
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,183
Could we make up our minds?

111
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,217
We're not leaving here without our guys.

112
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,623
What's the call, Cap?

113
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,159
We take that bunker, we're in.

114
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,227
Then let's fucking do it.

115
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,160
Mac, take point.

116
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,061
Move!

117
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,963
Go, go, go!

118
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,931
I've got cover, go!

119
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,965
Cap, we got more trouble.

120
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,344
Like the 4th of July, guys.

121
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:53,069
Mac, take your position.

122
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:55,004
All right, it's now or never, boys.

123
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,038
Mac, Hutch, let's go get our guys.

124
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,013
In position.

125
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,047
Third bunker secured, Cap.

126
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:18,890
Now!

127
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,923
Come on!

128
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:28,263
Curve ball.

129
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,885
Morning, boys. Delta Force.

130
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,820
Someone call for a taxi?

131
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:58,088
Stand back, man.

132
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,857
Falcon One, proceed to the secondary LZ.

133
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,890
This is Falcon One.

134
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,343
I got it.

135
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,249
Let's go.

136
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,192
Vickers, now.

137
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,394
Come on, Doc. Let's go.

138
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:47,794
Vickers, copy.

139
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,827
On my way.

140
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,769
Vickers, abort.

141
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,802
Get the hell out of there.

142
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,782
Go, go, go, go go!

143
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:22,755
Lombardi, come in.

144
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,525
Lombardi, do you copy?

145
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,527
Lombardi?

146
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,527
Lombardi, do you copy?

147
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Lombardi, come in.

148
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,065
Lombardi, do you copy?

149
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,067
Your guy's probably dead, Captain.

150
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,068
We need to mosey now.

151
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,802
No fucking way!

152
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,938
You get us close to that bunker,
we're going in after him.

153
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,238
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

154
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:44,373
It would be suicide.

155
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:45,307
Then get out of the fucking seat.

156
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,275
I will fly the chopper.

157
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,308
I can't.

158
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,813
Do it!

159
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:53,846
Do it!

160
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,125
Shit.

161
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,358
Man.

162
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:51,391
You guys are fucking great.

163
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,363
You're gonna be fine?

164
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,331
Yeah, I've earned it.

165
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:58,364
He's gonna be fine.

166
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,906
Mercury Leader, this is Jackknife.

167
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,907
We're on our way home...

168
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,940
All of us.

169
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,377
Hi, sweetheart.

170
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,146
Well, there's the two most
beautiful women in the world.

171
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,446
Are you ready for dinner?

172
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,381
I'm famished.

173
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,382
You?

174
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,583
I could eat.

175
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,616
Let's go.

176
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,222
Annie, honey,
you still wish you'd stayed home?

177
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,057
No, I'm glad I came.

178
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,358
Just tell me those
backwater dolts from Alabama

179
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:14,960
aren't sitting with us again tonight.

180
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,995
Aw, Ruth, you didn't tell her.

181
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,430
Those people walked
the plank this morning.

182
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,665
Listen, you two go on head.

183
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:21,966
I've got to go up to the bridge room.

184
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,899
See you soon.

185
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,933
See you soon.

186
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:47,620
After all these years of service,

187
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:50,488
the Kursk is not going
to rot in dry dock?

188
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:53,524
Yes, it makes us all very sad, Captain.

189
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,458
Da.

190
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,693
Da.

191
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,361
We're approaching the final leg, sir.

192
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,363
Very well.

193
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:03,332
Make our depth 35 meters and..

194
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,404
Depth, 35 meters.

195
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,438
All ahead two terms.

196
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,719
Cap, I don't know what the hell
happened back there, but I owe you one.

197
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,053
You owe nothing, Lombardi.

198
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:31,455
I just wanted you to know.

199
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,456
Let's just get this thing over
with, all right?

200
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,559
I mean, we bust our asses for these
people and this is the thanks we get?

201
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,226
A court martial.

202
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,461
Look it's not a court
martial, it's just a hearing.

203
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,729
Yeah, well, it's still bullshit.

204
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:42,762
Watch, it's going to be fine.

205
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,398
Excuse me. Is everything all right?

206
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,266
The rest of your table
will be here shortly.

207
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,201
OK.

208
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,169
Good evening, ladies.

209
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:35,072
How's the champagne?

210
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,574
Did you hear Admiral Henshaw's
order to abort, Sergeant?

211
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,276
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,111
Then didn't it strike you as odd

213
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,746
that Captain Lang chose
to ignore that order?

214
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,684
No, sir.

215
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:51,652
Command wasn't in full
possession of all the facts,

216
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:53,686
sir.

217
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:58,424
In case you've forgotten,
Malcolm and Hoskins

218
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,457
are now safely at home
with their families.

219
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,698
Do you have families, sirs?

220
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,034
Thank you, Sergeant.

221
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,436
That will be all.

222
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,469
Yes, sir.

223
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,784
The ship's first ladies.

224
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:33,218
This way, please.

225
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,053
Where's Gregory tonight?

226
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:37,756
He came down with a sudden condition.

227
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,491
But my name is Tuck,
and I'll be your host for the evening.

228
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,126
Thank you, Tuck.

229
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,327
I'd say you ladies look lovely.

230
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,262
That's so kind of you.

231
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,197
Mrs. Lang...

232
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,132
Thank you very much.

233
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,467
Hello.

234
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,434
Hello.

235
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,401
Ms. Lang.

236
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,402
I'm Ruth Lang.

237
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,437
This is my daughter, Annie.

238
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,472
Golder and Hiriam Lifschitz.

239
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:01,341
Nice to meet you.

240
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,476
If you would need
anything, just let me know.

241
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,645
Thank you.

242
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,313
Are you enjoying the cruise?

243
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,346
I just love the ocean.

244
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:51,346
Everything set?

245
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,186
Where's Mikhail?

246
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:06,493
OK, boys.

247
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:10,797
Time to load and lock, and rock and roll.

248
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,304
Sergei, you secure port.

249
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:22,337
Mikhail, go starboard.

250
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:36,684
Tell me, Master Sergeant
Lombardi, as second in command,

251
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:39,252
did you have any problem
with your captain's decision

252
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:42,322
to ignore a clear order?

253
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:43,589
No, sir.

254
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,725
I didn't consider the order valid, sir.

255
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,294
Even though Captain
Lang's insubordination

256
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:53,163
resulted in injury to yourself?

257
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,398
Yes, sir.

258
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:57,734
The fact that mine was the only injury
supports my belief that Captain Lang

259
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:00,570
made the right decision, sir.

260
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:05,173
Thank you, Master Sergeant Lombardi.

261
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,809
You may step down.

262
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:18,684
So did you have a chance to talk to dad
about Michael last night?

263
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:19,785
I tried, Annie.

264
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:23,921
But he just kind of tuned out.

265
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:26,724
Listen, Hiriam,
they're playing your favorite piece.

266
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,363
This whole thing has
gone on way too far, mom.

267
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,199
It's beyond ridiculous.

268
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,934
I know.

269
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,968
Yeah.

270
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:46,338
Ma'am...

271
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:02,653
Hey, what you doing, man?

272
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:03,987
Get out of here.

273
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,357
Aw, madame, sir, I apologize.

274
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,392
I'll get someone to come
clean this up right away.

275
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:12,425
Sorry.

276
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:37,606
Nobody move, not even a twitch.

277
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:42,552
Who are you? What is this?

278
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,731
Who's next?

279
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,770
We're having a sales this week.

280
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,803
Buy one get one free.

281
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,341
Nobody?

282
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:12,742
That's good.

283
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:18,279
Now, get on back in the passage way.

284
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,948
Not you two shit for brains.

285
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:22,450
Get down there and fly the god damn boat.

286
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,924
Go, into the salt. Shut up!

287
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:43,465
That means you too, Captain.

288
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,549
You must understand, Captain,
this way the Kursk will

289
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,582
not be so easily forgotten.

290
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,919
You sure that's everyone?

291
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:16,758
Right on schedule.

292
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,859
Mr. Wilkins,
have we made our starboard...

293
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:16,841
Sorry, folks.

294
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,109
It seems that that was the last concerto.

295
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:34,722
Security, this is the captain.

296
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:39,492
Lay to the bridge, on board emergency.

297
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:42,595
Now, if you'll all kindly
get out of your seats,

298
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,797
and lay flat on the floor, we can

299
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,433
carry on with this evening's festivities.

300
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,441
All the joking aside,
ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:00,576
allow me to introduce the first violin.

302
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:30,533
You get the fuck down!

303
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:55,653
Now, get on the fucking floor
and don't make me say it again.

304
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:03,526
If we all remain calm and follow
instructions, no one will be hurt.

305
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,559
Hiriam?

306
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,866
Hiriam?

307
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,468
Hiriam, don't.

308
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,737
But you get up, you get dead.

309
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:17,638
Simple.

310
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:19,172
Hiriam, please.

311
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,074
Now, I personally have
other matters to attend to,

312
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:24,109
but I've given my men full authorization

313
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:26,879
to execute my wishes...

314
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,912
No pun intended.

315
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,083
Never again.

316
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:43,725
Hiriam, please don't go.

317
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:45,760
Never again.

318
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:55,032
Never again.

319
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,979
Mister, you don't look
too long for this world

320
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:14,216
as it is, but you don't get back
down on that floor immediately,

321
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,294
you're going to be meeting the
grim reaper ahead of schedule.

322
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:17,686
For god's sake.

323
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:20,087
Listen to him, Hiriam.

324
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,121
Hiriam, get down.

325
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:47,210
Now shut up.

326
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:52,113
One last time, folks, disobedience
is severely frowned upon.

327
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:55,115
It will not be tolerated.

328
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:57,149
Good evening.

329
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,127
Hello, Captain.

330
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,161
Turn around slowly please.

331
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:24,639
Mayday, Mayday, this is Captain.

332
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,607
Lang of the "Northern Star."

333
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,741
Any station this net.

334
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:27,709
Unfortunately, we need him alive.

335
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:29,276
You know that.

336
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:30,644
This is Captain Lang of the
"Northern Star," I say again,

337
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:32,677
mayday, mayday, may...

338
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,082
Listen, pal.

339
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:39,951
You son of a bitch.

340
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:43,787
It was self defense.

341
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:50,627
But that, that was to make a point.

342
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,896
You need to find a less
lethal way of communicating.

343
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:55,163
Maybe so, Captain.

344
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:57,032
But as long as we understand each other.

345
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,145
You want to tell me what
the hell this is all about?

346
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:08,641
Attention "Northern Star"
passengers and crew,

347
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:12,811
as of this moment, my men and I
are in control of this vessel.

348
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:14,845
If you're in your cabin...

349
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,316
if you are in an unsecured common area,

350
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,386
you have one minute to
return to your cabin

351
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:24,820
in an orderly fashion.

352
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:28,223
Anyone spotted in an unsecured
common area one minute

353
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:30,392
after the conclusion of this message,

354
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:34,695
will be considered a
threat and shot on sight.

355
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:39,132
This is mos definitely not a
drill, ladies and gentlemen.

356
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,165
So have a nice day.

357
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,271
Let's go.

358
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:49,773
Listen, I don't know what your plan is,
but it's not going to work.

359
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,710
Yes it will, Captain.

360
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,779
And you're going to
play a large part in it.

361
00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:08,956
Admiral?

362
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,291
This just came in from
the Alaskan Coast Guard

363
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,126
station on St. Lawrence Island.

364
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,795
How many passengers on board?

365
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,330
2,842.

366
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,899
We should have a complete passenger
manifest in 30 minutes, tops.

367
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,801
Hijackers making any demands?

368
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,868
No, not so far.

369
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,804
Give me the manifest and
crew list as soon as you can.

370
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,204
Certainly, sir.

371
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,006
Patch me through to Lawrence Island...

372
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,907
Yes, sir.

373
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
As soon as you can.

374
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:51,757
We got a ping.

375
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,458
Mikhail, reduce speed, one third.

376
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:54,392
Aye, aye, sir.

377
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,327
Reduce speed one third.

378
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:58,361
Sergei, get me a signature
on that contract.

379
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:04,834
Single surface contact
at 3,200 meters, bearing

380
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:07,103
zero, three, three and turning.

381
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:08,770
That's got to be them.

382
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:11,139
Mikhail, bring me the periscope depth.

383
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:12,173
Yes, sir.

384
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,207
Bring us up to periscope depth.

385
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:32,354
At periscope depth, sir.

386
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,335
Hot damn and he got her jacked.

387
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:51,071
Stage two complete.

388
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:55,174
Mikhail, bring us to
surface, come alongside,

389
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,243
and coordinate a full stop.

390
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,276
Yes, sir.

391
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:07,084
Will you get these
fucking stiff out of here.

392
00:35:07,117 --> 00:35:10,420
They're bleeding all over the place.

393
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:12,722
We wouldn't want to upset set our guests.

394
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,102
Tuck my man, what's your 20.

395
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:32,337
Reading you loud and clear, friend.

396
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:34,172
Any problems in your end?

397
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:35,773
No, nothing.

398
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,341
Out-fucking-standing.

399
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,142
The cap?

400
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,877
Standing by.

401
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:42,446
Get him ready for transfer.

402
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,479
Lukash out.

403
00:35:56,523 --> 00:36:01,861
Sir, voice print analysis just came
back, 98% probable.

404
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:02,562
What do you know?

405
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,229
Flint Lukash.

406
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,798
Jack, one of the most
cunning, criminal masterminds

407
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,042
in the world is not dabbling
in a straightforward hostage

408
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,234
scenario.
- I know.

409
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,569
Doesn't make any sense.

410
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,870
Run it again.

411
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,803
Yes, sir.

412
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,506
OK, run it again.

413
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:52,869
Welcome aboard the Kursk, Captain Lang.

414
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:54,902
Quite a vessel, isn't she?

415
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,909
Come on, don't look so glum.

416
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,844
We're professionals.

417
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,346
You ought to thank me.

418
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:10,482
I'm about to put you with the
Khan, of a typhoon class

419
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,618
nuclear submarine, and I guarantee you,

420
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:16,254
it's gonna be a hell of a ride.

421
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,121
So cheer up.

422
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,024
Besides, it will help you
take your mind off Peter.

423
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,402
Gertrude operational?

424
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:38,137
Yes, sir.

425
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:39,138
Tuck?

426
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:41,172
I'm about to make the move.

427
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,643
Mikhail, if you will.

428
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:46,578
I still don't think this is necessary.

429
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,145
I agree.

430
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,580
Why should we call
attention to ourselves when

431
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:52,483
we could proceed undetected?

432
00:37:52,516 --> 00:37:56,152
Because we have a deadline to meet.

433
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:59,521
And at this stage of the game we don't
have time to sprint and drift.

434
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:02,224
We have to sprint, period.

435
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:03,891
You understand?

436
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:05,925
Then shut the fuck up and do your jobs.

437
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:20,471
Lukash controls a ballistic
missile submarine?

438
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:24,541
For a man like him,
no problem stepping aboard.

439
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:27,077
So where does the "Northern
Star" fit into this?

440
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,011
Coming to that right now.

441
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,446
There's the Kursk.

442
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:33,548
There's a "Northern Star."

443
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:34,916
Of course.

444
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,419
A human shield.

445
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,535
Admiral?

446
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:01,504
Here's the crew list you asked for.

447
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,272
Halsey Lang?

448
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:05,040
Skipper of the "Northern Star."

449
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:07,343
Retired quietly from active service

450
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:10,979
when his son was killed in Lebanon.

451
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:14,147
The skipper of a cruise ship ever since.

452
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:15,983
I don't believe it.

453
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,985
Traded in a nuclear attack
sub for the "Love Boat."

454
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:18,684
No, no.

455
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,152
Not exactly.

456
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:21,487
He was a landlubber for a while.

457
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,622
It didn't suit him.

458
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:26,191
Saltwater in the veins.

459
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:27,559
You know the type?

460
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:28,525
Yeah.

461
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,559
I know the type.

462
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:43,404
It's time to face the music.

463
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:45,437
More like a slap on the wrist.

464
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,616
Captain Lang, would you please rise?

465
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,985
If I might speak off
the record for a moment.

466
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,021
I've known your father for 30 years.

467
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:06,123
A model military man in
every possible respect.

468
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,156
Truly one of this country's finest.

469
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:15,497
I can only imagine the
distress this incident

470
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,365
must be causing him.

471
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,568
With all due respect, sir,
you don't know my father as I do,

472
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,602
so could we please just get on with it?

473
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:49,324
By order of the Supreme
Commander of USS SOCOM

474
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:51,426
this hearing is adjourned
until further notice.

475
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:57,397
Captain Lang, sir,
would you follow me please?

476
00:40:57,431 --> 00:41:00,066
Admiral Henshaw is waiting
for you on Vid Link.

477
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,111
Mac?

478
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:16,245
What the hell was all that
shit about his father?

479
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:18,279
I don't know.

480
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,588
Christ, Captain, how did you spend 30

481
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:30,621
years in these miserable tubes?

482
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,528
You'll think miserable,
about the first time

483
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,663
a torpedo locks onto us.

484
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,298
That ain't going to happen.

485
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,266
Not as long as we're
under the "Northern Star."

486
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,268
And once we split off
with you with the CON,

487
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,504
they ain't gonna find us.

488
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:50,473
Pigs will fly out of your ass before
you get any help from me, Lukash.

489
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:52,174
Halsey, Halsey, Hal...

490
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:55,310
You gotta think about your
beautiful wife and daughter.

491
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:57,479
Now, how many torpedoes
do you think it would take

492
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:59,580
to sink the "Northern Star?"

493
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:02,216
My guess would be about three.

494
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:03,449
You wouldn't do that, Lukash.

495
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:06,185
There's 3,000 souls aboard that ship.

496
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,320
Are you kidding me?

497
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:15,659
Just the idea of sending 3,000
complacent overweight Americans

498
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:18,728
to the bottom of the Bering Strait

499
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:21,664
just makes me.

500
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,465
Now, you got to look on the bright side.

501
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,401
Maybe your wife and daughter
will be one of the lucky ones

502
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:28,336
blown apart by the blast. Shit, no.

503
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:30,538
They're in top cabin.

504
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:31,706
No, nope.

505
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:33,240
They're going to go into that water.

506
00:42:33,273 --> 00:42:37,244
Ew, going in 40 degree
water's gotta be bad.

507
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Standing by.

508
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,821
You copy, Flint?

509
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:52,556
Start the broadcast.

510
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:54,589
Broadcasting now.

511
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,600
Well, boys and girls, you must be
wondering now what is Flint up to.

512
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:09,769
Well, here's your
helpful hint for today...

513
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:14,907
Mountains topple ever more
into seas without a shore.

514
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,939
Seas that restlessly aspire,
surging in disguise of fire...

515
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,882
Poe.

516
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:31,554
Now, hear this you
overpaid stuffed shirts,

517
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:34,722
any action taken against the
Kursk or the "Northern Star"

518
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:39,793
will leave me no choice but to sink her.

519
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:43,629
That's it for now, ladies,
but don't touch that dial.

520
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,598
I'll be back.

521
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:49,367
Now what's the bastard's agenda?

522
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,904
What's Moscow's position on the Kursk?

523
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:57,908
Captain Belov of the Bremov
has been issued a kill order.

524
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,409
What?

525
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:00,777
There's close to 3,000
American citizens...

526
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,313
I understand Mr. Sunland,
please believe me.

527
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:07,483
Moscow's response would be the
same, even if "Northern Star"

528
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:12,320
were carrying 3,000 Russians.

529
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:18,224
Certainly you must realize that
the Bremika type of vessel,

530
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:22,428
even without it's missiles,
is a very formidable weapon.

531
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:24,195
Look, we will work with you on a way

532
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,965
to neutralize it so it wouldn't
put American lives at risk.

533
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,433
Our worst case projections, put

534
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:35,238
the casualties on the "Northern
Star" at less than 15%.

535
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:36,973
That is awfully optimistic.

536
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:38,373
Not at all.

537
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:41,643
We have already transferred to the area

538
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,612
some rescue vessels in case of need.

539
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:48,648
Bremov will certainly not strike
until those vessels are in place.

540
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,717
That's still unacceptable, Ambassador.

541
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,318
Look, let's put our heads together...

542
00:44:52,352 --> 00:44:56,388
I haven't requested or respectfully
declined any such offer.

543
00:44:56,421 --> 00:45:00,491
How also want your supply
ships be positioned.

544
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:03,226
If Lukash maintains his present course,

545
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,963
approximately 16 hours.

546
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:11,967
We can land a team on the ship,
we take control, veer off course.

547
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:16,471
And Bremov can fire on the Kursk
without endangering innocent lives.

548
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:20,240
I see no reason why Moscow should
object to that, Mr. Ambassador.

549
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:23,342
I will contact the Kremlin immediately.

550
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,376
Get the ball rolling, Norm.

551
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:44,793
Sir, I have the Kursk
and the "Northern Star"

552
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:48,763
at 6,000 meters, bearing
zero, one, four, 33 knots.

553
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,264
Very well.

554
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:52,298
Now, we wait.

555
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,741
That's my father's ship.

556
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:04,676
My mother and Annie we're planning on...

557
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:06,978
They're on the ship too, Michael.

558
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:09,880
I'm sorry.

559
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:11,782
The fact that your mother
and sister were on board

560
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:15,051
is probably just shitty luck.

561
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:19,354
But your father probably
figured into Lukash's plans.

562
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,456
The odds are,
he's not on the line at this point.

563
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,591
I'm sorry.

564
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:25,025
I understand.

565
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,628
We are evaluating options as we go along.

566
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,862
We'll know more by the
time you reach the..

567
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,803
So that's the situation.

568
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:42,039
Cap, if we don't pull this off,
what happens to your father?

569
00:46:42,073 --> 00:46:46,576
Man, if that was my dad on that sub,
I'd have a tough time focusing.

570
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,711
Yeah, me too.

571
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,645
Come on, nothing gets in the way.

572
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:52,648
I mean, if that doesn't underlie
all our training, what does?

573
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,082
Yeah, you're right, Hutch.

574
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:57,385
But this situation is a
little out of the ordinary.

575
00:46:57,418 --> 00:47:00,754
This is Cap's business, so let's
just let him deal with it, all right?

576
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:03,023
It's a variable we have no control over.

577
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:06,826
My thoughts are not going to be
on my father's safety, believe me.

578
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:09,928
If he knew I was part of this mission, I
don't think his would be on mine either.

579
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:11,529
It's a long story, guys.

580
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:13,931
Basically,
my father and I... we don't talk.

581
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,400
15 minutes to target.

582
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,434
Somehow he just can't
believe that Pete's decision

583
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:22,538
to go into the special forces wasn't
somehow influenced by me.

584
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,045
After Pete was killed
during an op in Lebanon,

585
00:47:31,078 --> 00:47:33,078
my father made a choice.

586
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:42,454
He's an irrational, stubborn son of
a bitch, but he's still my father.

587
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:45,755
It's not that I don't care about him,
I just sort of put him out of my mind.

588
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:50,894
10 minutes to target.

589
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:55,564
So, in the heat of an op,
there's so much going on,

590
00:47:55,598 --> 00:47:58,899
so much to think about, believe me,
it's not going to be a problem.

591
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,470
All right?

592
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:06,874
Yes, sir.

593
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:07,841
All right?

594
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,875
All right.

595
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:56,011
Everyone on the upper deck,
check out the chopper.

596
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,755
3, 2, 1, jump.

597
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:16,696
Dock, this is coming about.

598
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,730
Lombardi, Hutch, lower deck.

599
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:57,694
Everyone, to go.

600
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:25,217
Give it up, asshole.

601
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:26,485
I've got you surrounded.

602
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:27,987
You got no way out.

603
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,020
Come and get me.

604
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,290
Cocky son of a bitch.

605
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:45,865
Right on the side on three.

606
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:50,771
I'm losing my patience here, pocky.

607
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:52,873
Not now.

608
00:50:52,907 --> 00:50:54,907
Don't get testy, soldier.

609
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:08,552
Set

610
00:51:08,585 --> 00:51:11,855
1, 2, 3.

611
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,060
Dining room... let's go.

612
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:47,183
Support ships report they're
in position, Captain.

613
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:51,253
6,350 meters of target,
bearing zero, zero, two.

614
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:54,188
Fighting solution is ready.

615
00:51:54,222 --> 00:51:56,624
Make tubes one and four ready
and open the outer doors.

616
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:03,662
Room reports tubes one and four
ready, and outer doors are open.

617
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:05,696
Yes, sir.

618
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,606
We give them 15 minutes,
and then we fire.

619
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:23,677
Smoker's in.

620
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,651
Everyone, stay down!

621
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:43,594
Clear.

622
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,364
All right, everyone, you're safe now.

623
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,397
Michael.

624
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,310
Bastards.

625
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:09,814
Just lean on me.

626
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:14,653
It's all over now.

627
00:53:14,686 --> 00:53:16,054
Where's your father?

628
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:17,689
I think he's been moved
to a hijacked Russian sub.

629
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:19,290
It's running beneath the liner.

630
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:20,925
You're going to go there, aren't you?

631
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,726
I'll be OK, Annie.

632
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,727
As soon as I find out something,
I'll get word to both of you.

633
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:26,396
OK?

634
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:27,664
Be careful.

635
00:53:27,697 --> 00:53:30,799
I will.

636
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:31,934
You take care of each other.

637
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:32,868
All right?

638
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:33,868
I gotta go.

639
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:35,901
I'll be fine.

640
00:53:57,754 --> 00:53:59,754
"Northern Star" is slowing, sir.

641
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:07,395
Turning hard to port.

642
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:10,264
Kursk?

643
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:12,297
Maintaining course and speed, sir.

644
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,270
"Northern Star" is to port.

645
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:19,303
Son of a bitch.

646
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:25,108
Tuck, come in.

647
00:54:31,414 --> 00:54:33,414
Fire tubes one and four.

648
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,989
Tubes one and four
fired electrically tuck.

649
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:47,361
Tuck?

650
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:50,429
God dammit!

651
00:54:50,463 --> 00:54:53,199
High speed screw noise, incoming.

652
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:55,400
Target the "Norther Star" and sink her.

653
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:58,369
Lukash, for Christ sake, don't do this.

654
00:54:58,402 --> 00:55:00,037
Why not, captain.

655
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,740
What's in it for me?

656
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:06,376
My help.

657
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:10,412
Two torpedoes, bearing one,
seven, two, one, seven, six.

658
00:55:10,445 --> 00:55:13,248
Range... 4,100 meters and closing fast.

659
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,485
Solution on "Northern Star" ready.

660
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:21,721
Provided you give me your solemn word
you'll spare the "Northern Star."

661
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:23,856
You have it as a professional.

662
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,357
Captain Lang, you have the COM.

663
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:28,260
Sergei, find out where
those torpedoes came from.

664
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:30,161
Are there countermeasures aboard?

665
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,062
Yes, sir.

666
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,730
Very well.

667
00:55:32,764 --> 00:55:34,831
Set one to simulate evasive maneuvers.

668
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,933
Torpedoes at 2,200 meters.

669
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,967
Get it in the water.

670
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:46,107
Firing solution on
unidentified contact... ready.

671
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,742
Blow it out of the water.

672
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:49,776
Firing tubes two and three.

673
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:57,450
Lukash, I've got the deck and the COM.

674
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,954
Torpedo one is changing course.

675
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:06,223
It's honing in on the decoy.

676
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:08,391
Classification of new
contact confirmed, sir.

677
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:11,494
It's the Bremov, the Bass class.
- Range to the incoming.

678
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:18,299
Torpedo two at 600 meters, 500, 450...

679
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:21,235
Helm, stand by to come hard
starboard on my command.

680
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:22,370
Sir.

681
00:56:22,403 --> 00:56:24,137
300 meters.

682
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:25,272
250.

683
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:26,940
Helm. Hard starboard.

684
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:28,973
All ahead blank.

685
00:56:31,243 --> 00:56:33,243
Fire the port-side countermeasures.

686
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:37,882
Torpedo two is maintaining course.

687
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:40,017
It's going for the countermeasures.

688
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,926
High speed screw north port side.

689
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:54,562
Bearing, zero, eight,
zero, zero, eight, four.

690
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:58,565
And make your depth 300 meters.

691
00:56:58,598 --> 00:57:00,900
Power maximum, depth 300 meters.

692
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:02,934
Depth, 300 meters.

693
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:25,820
Getting hull break up
noises from the Bremov.

694
00:57:25,854 --> 00:57:27,956
She's going down.

695
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:30,591
Well, this time we were lucky.

696
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:33,826
Now, let's just disappear while we can.

697
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:37,830
Maintain present course,
maximum prudent speed.

698
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:39,864
Happy?

699
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:45,536
That was outstanding work there, cap.

700
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:50,573
Lukash, you gave me your word.

701
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:51,941
Yeah. That I did.

702
00:57:51,975 --> 00:57:52,909
That I did.

703
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:55,410
And I'll hold to it, too.

704
00:57:55,444 --> 00:57:59,547
On one condition.

705
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:04,518
And that is that you'll take the COM
again, if the situation arises.

706
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:10,155
Very well.

707
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,099
Still no sign of the Kursk?

708
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:23,866
Realistically, if she's running deep,

709
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,369
then our chances of finding
her are slim to none.

710
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,303
Great.

711
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,104
Now what?

712
00:58:29,137 --> 00:58:32,340
We sit around jerking off until
Lukash decides to show himself?

713
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:33,941
Good question.

714
00:58:33,974 --> 00:58:36,377
What's our involvement going
to be from here on out?

715
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,878
Nothing active for the time being.

716
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:40,912
It's Russia's problem now.

717
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:59,227
Roipren, what are you doing?

718
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:25,249
How much longer... the final leg?

719
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,351
Another five hours.

720
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:29,319
And then the?

721
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:31,352
Another four at least.

722
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,227
Great.

723
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,630
Tuck's fuck up has put us
four hours behind schedule.

724
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,364
Four fucking hours.

725
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:48,334
There is a way we could save some time.

726
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:51,303
How much time are we talking about?

727
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,504
Probably close to three hours.

728
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:00,377
Would you like to explain
to me why we weren't going

729
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,546
this way in the first place?

730
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,081
It's risky.

731
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:07,216
The water is quiet
shallow at several points.

732
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,652
Our heat signature could be
picked up by the satellite.

733
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:12,954
Could be.

734
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:16,957
Look, we are trying to slip
through a very narrow window

735
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:20,526
here that is slowly closing.

736
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,329
I don't want to get caught
with my pants down in Europe.

737
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:32,470
Captain, what would you do?

738
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,503
Definitely go the short route.

739
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:49,583
We'll go that way.

740
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:55,154
Course 233, all ahead, flank speed.

741
01:00:55,187 --> 01:00:57,187
Yes, sir.

742
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,364
Gentlemen,
Lukash is headed for the sub base

743
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,400
at Port Yeramin.

744
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,734
Yeramin?

745
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:16,505
I have been authorized to tell you
of a code red situation at Yeramin.

746
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:19,707
During the night,
soldiers serving as security

747
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:23,410
took control of the base
just hours before a shipment

748
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:29,515
of ballistic missiles were to be moved
to the dismantling facility at Markovo.

749
01:01:29,548 --> 01:01:34,085
You wouldn't be telling us this
if you'd retaken that base.

750
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:35,353
True enough.

751
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:39,323
Ambassador, what measures has Moscow
have already implemented?

752
01:01:39,356 --> 01:01:42,259
We have already sent a force to Yeramin.

753
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,160
Will they get there before Lukash?

754
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:47,129
We're not sure yet.

755
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,230
If he leaves that base, they'll

756
01:01:49,264 --> 01:01:52,600
be able to target the whole
of the Western seaboard.

757
01:01:52,634 --> 01:01:55,703
Not to mention mainland Russia.

758
01:01:55,736 --> 01:01:58,738
Ambassador, it's in the best
interest of both our countries

759
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:02,675
that we cooperate on this.

760
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:04,376
My government agrees with you.

761
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:06,409
Good.

762
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:11,048
We have a unit within
striking distance of Yeramin.

763
01:02:13,717 --> 01:02:15,717
One of the very best.

764
01:02:23,225 --> 01:02:29,096
,, get the video phone system online.

765
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:31,264
It's time to let Washington and Moscow

766
01:02:31,298 --> 01:02:33,799
know what their peace
dividend's going to cost them.

767
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:56,318
Think it would be colder here.

768
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:57,819
I mean, this is Alaska.

769
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:00,721
Come back in January and
you'll freeze your ass off.

770
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:02,289
I'm looking for a warmer climate.

771
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:07,127
Speaking of which, boys,
tomorrow morning we wake up in Hawaii.

772
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,295
Two weeks of nothing but
sun, fun, and waves.

773
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:13,332
Don't forget the most
important thing here...

774
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,365
Chics.

775
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,444
Do you actually think you're
going to get laid this time?

776
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:21,705
I'm going to make getting
laid my first priority, sir.

777
01:03:21,738 --> 01:03:24,306
You'll pop that cherry
one of these days, cousin.

778
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,708
Never.

779
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:27,243
Never.
- I think it will happen.

780
01:03:27,276 --> 01:03:28,210
Yeah, yeah.

781
01:03:28,244 --> 01:03:29,144
It'll happen.

782
01:03:29,177 --> 01:03:29,844
Ha, ha.

783
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:31,413
Very funny.

784
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,148
As you were, gentlemen.

785
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:34,481
I just spoke with Admiral Henshaw.

786
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:37,418
Lukash finally laid his
cards out on the table.

787
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:41,421
He's giving Washington 36 hours
to come up with $25 billion.

788
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:43,122
Otherwise, he's going to
launch a nuclear missile

789
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,257
attack against the West coast and Russia.

790
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,292
He's not supposed to have nukes.

791
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,627
Yeah, well, situation's changed.

792
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,430
A renegade security unit seized
control of a Russian sub base

793
01:03:52,463 --> 01:03:54,130
at Port Yeramin.

794
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,433
On the base was a load of
SSM 20s due to be scrapped.

795
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,834
And a few hours ago,
Russian Norsat picked up the Kursk

796
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,602
entering Yeramin harbor.

797
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:03,172
The Russians are mobilizing, but they
won't arrive soon enough to prevent.

798
01:04:03,205 --> 01:04:04,739
Lukash from loading the birds.

799
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:06,707
And that's where we come in, gentlemen.

800
01:04:06,741 --> 01:04:08,775
We're taking Bertha here, so gear up.

801
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:09,676
Double time.

802
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:11,645
Let's move.

803
01:04:11,678 --> 01:04:12,612
There goes Hawaii.

804
01:04:12,646 --> 01:04:14,646
Yep.

805
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:40,614
Brake, now.

806
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,827
Stop at the Western inlet.

807
01:06:58,477 --> 01:07:00,279
I want a closer look.

808
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:02,313
Mac, Vickers, get wet.

809
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,375
Cap, you were right.

810
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:02,778
There's a net down here
hooked up to dozens of mines.

811
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:04,811
Can you take care of it?

812
01:09:57,221 --> 01:09:59,221
There is activity at the Minet.

813
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,128
Handle it.

814
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:08,430
That was the arrangement.

815
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:01,969
Steblin?

816
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,003
Ivan.

817
01:13:03,036 --> 01:13:04,003
Two small gun ships approach.

818
01:13:04,036 --> 01:13:06,036
I count six men.

819
01:13:35,128 --> 01:13:36,696
Shooters at 10 o'clock, Captain.

820
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,098
Take 'em out.

821
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:40,699
Doc, Hutch, to the attack.

822
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:41,667
I got him...

823
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,700
10 o'clock.

824
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:48,104
Bogey at 12 o'clock.

825
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:40,347
Ivan, can you hear me?

826
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,316
Ivan, come in.

827
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:44,116
What's the story?

828
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,361
I can report that the six men
just coming through the inlet

829
01:14:46,385 --> 01:14:47,954
on two small gunboats.

830
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:50,956
They must have gotten past my divers.

831
01:14:50,989 --> 01:14:53,791
They got past him too
from t he sound of it.

832
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:56,660
I thought you said your people
knew what they were doing.

833
01:14:56,694 --> 01:14:59,729
They do, my friend.

834
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:02,966
It's all right.

835
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,235
They that have power to hurt
and will do none that do not

836
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:12,106
do the thing they most do
show, who moving others,

837
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:14,908
are themselves as stone.

838
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:20,279
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow.

839
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:25,450
Shakespeare.

840
01:15:25,483 --> 01:15:28,086
Do you know what it means?

841
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,087
No.

842
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:37,193
Well, if you and your
people don't hold the line,

843
01:15:37,226 --> 01:15:39,260
I'll fucking explain it to you.

844
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:55,440
Your attention.

845
01:15:55,474 --> 01:15:57,009
We have got visitors.

846
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:59,777
I repeat, we have got intruders.

847
01:16:47,215 --> 01:16:48,183
Go, go, go.

848
01:16:48,216 --> 01:16:50,216
Go, go, go go, go, go!

849
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,905
Mac, Vickers, cover us on go.

850
01:17:15,938 --> 01:17:16,906
Ready?

851
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:19,507
Go!

852
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:38,054
Cap!

853
01:18:14,885 --> 01:18:17,254
There she is.

854
01:18:17,287 --> 01:18:20,256
You want to go first?

855
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:22,058
No.

856
01:18:22,091 --> 01:18:23,059
Final positions.

857
01:18:23,092 --> 01:18:25,092
Go.

858
01:18:33,367 --> 01:18:34,334
Duck!

859
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:36,936
Coming through.

860
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,004
Hold!

861
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:40,037
Now!

862
01:18:45,343 --> 01:18:48,579
Michael, can you hear me?

863
01:18:48,612 --> 01:18:50,612
Dimitri, do you copy me?

864
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:02,321
You ought to read more.

865
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:35,950
On pause.

866
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:37,983
Race ya.

867
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,590
Baseball.

868
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:35,364
All right, guys.

869
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,234
Mac and I are going in.

870
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,162
Go, go, go, go!

871
01:21:26,171 --> 01:21:27,640
Drop the gun, Lukash.

872
01:21:27,673 --> 01:21:29,540
All right.

873
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:30,642
Drop it now.

874
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:31,576
OK.

875
01:21:31,609 --> 01:21:32,477
OK.

876
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:34,510
Just... just relax.

877
01:21:42,184 --> 01:21:45,620
Get your hands in the air, slowly.

878
01:21:45,654 --> 01:21:51,592
As the poet says, so sweet to live...

879
01:21:56,763 --> 01:21:58,763
magnificent to die.

880
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,532
Mac!

881
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:02,100
The bullets in the vest.

882
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:03,135
I'm all right.

883
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,168
Let's get this son of a bitch.

884
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:24,651
Hurry, Vick. You got to breathe.

885
01:22:24,685 --> 01:22:26,253
Cap? Vic's been hit.

886
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,254
All right.

887
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:28,422
Do what you can.

888
01:22:28,455 --> 01:22:30,222
As soon as the Russians
that we're on the Kursk.

889
01:22:30,256 --> 01:22:31,257
Breathe.

890
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,792
Cap, we're not going to make it.

891
01:22:32,825 --> 01:22:34,025
We're not going to make it.

892
01:22:34,059 --> 01:22:34,726
You got to do this without us.

893
01:22:34,759 --> 01:22:37,195
I got to stay with him.

894
01:22:37,228 --> 01:22:41,532
Well, get it through that missile too.

895
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:43,565
All right, boys,.

896
01:23:00,413 --> 01:23:02,048
Do a compartment search.

897
01:23:02,082 --> 01:23:05,784
We've got intruders in the VLS tubes.

898
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:08,354
Take me to a full stop.

899
01:23:08,387 --> 01:23:10,387
Bring me to missile launching depth.

900
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:16,293
We'll launch number one as
soon as power up is complete.

901
01:23:30,504 --> 01:23:32,206
Breathe. Come on.

902
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,073
Your mom's going to be real
pissed I don't get you home.

903
01:23:34,107 --> 01:23:36,107
Come on, breathe.

904
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:47,385
Mac, upper level.

905
01:23:47,418 --> 01:23:48,486
Everyone else take your positions.

906
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:50,519
Go.

907
01:23:51,855 --> 01:23:54,790
Hey, Captain.

908
01:23:54,823 --> 01:23:57,626
I've got good news and bad news.

909
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:02,630
The good news, is there's a
squad of special forces up there.

910
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,831
Gotta be Delta boys.

911
01:24:04,865 --> 01:24:06,865
Weren't both of your sons in that outfit?

912
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:15,306
The bad news is,
I just dropped their leader.

913
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,209
Nah, they wouldn't send your son.

914
01:24:18,243 --> 01:24:21,745
Then again, you never know.

915
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:25,848
Lukash, that's a load
of crap and you know it.

916
01:24:25,882 --> 01:24:29,351
I don't know that is back
aft, but it's not my boy.

917
01:24:29,384 --> 01:24:31,384
If it was him, you'd be a dead man.

918
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,831
Excuse me.

919
01:24:54,805 --> 01:25:00,443
Lang the younger,
sorry about that screw up

920
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:02,511
we're doing back there.

921
01:25:02,545 --> 01:25:07,549
Now, because of that,
thousands and thousands and thousands

922
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:09,650
of people are going to die.

923
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:44,444
Winger?

924
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,712
Lukash.

925
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:48,381
One, two, and three are online.

926
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:50,583
We'll have launch
capability on number one

927
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:53,285
in plus or minus two and a half minutes.

928
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:54,619
Beautiful.

929
01:25:54,652 --> 01:25:56,621
Listen, there's been a
slight change in plans.

930
01:25:56,654 --> 01:25:59,723
I want you to reprogramm
Merv on number three

931
01:25:59,756 --> 01:26:02,559
for St. Petersburg.

932
01:26:02,593 --> 01:26:06,229
After that bullshit at Yeramin, it looks
like the world needs a little lesson.

933
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,763
They're not calling my bluff.

934
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:10,797
So long, St. Pete's.

935
01:26:19,372 --> 01:26:21,841
It's got to be similar to overriding
the primary firing system.

936
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:24,409
This thing would be my guess, but I'm
not familiar with this system.

937
01:26:24,443 --> 01:26:26,443
Do your best, Sergeant.

938
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,417
Jesus.

939
01:26:34,451 --> 01:26:36,451
Make it happen.

940
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,938
No, hold your fire.

941
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:01,773
I might need them later.

942
01:27:01,806 --> 01:27:04,341
Well, listen, just don't stand there
with your dick in your hands.

943
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,375
Go get him and bring him back here.

944
01:27:38,835 --> 01:27:41,738
"Full fathom five, your father lies.

945
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:44,273
Of his bones are coral made."

946
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:48,277
Now, loosely translated,
that means you move against my boat

947
01:27:48,311 --> 01:27:51,713
or my men, and I will
spray daddy's teeth, hair,

948
01:27:51,746 --> 01:27:55,316
and eyes all over the bulkhead.

949
01:27:55,349 --> 01:27:58,319
Let's get something straight, Lukash,
you're the dead man here.

950
01:27:58,352 --> 01:28:02,522
I'd love to chat with you, Lukash,
but I'm a little busy right now.

951
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:04,489
Well, why don't you relax?

952
01:28:04,523 --> 01:28:06,792
Because number one flies in 75 seconds

953
01:28:06,825 --> 01:28:09,560
and there's not a goddamn
thing you can do about it.

954
01:28:25,807 --> 01:28:27,375
Good god.

955
01:28:27,408 --> 01:28:29,376
There's not even enough
time for them to evacuate.

956
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:31,311
You're both forgetting one thing...

957
01:28:31,345 --> 01:28:32,679
Delta.

958
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:35,815
What if they've been killed or captured?

959
01:28:35,848 --> 01:28:37,848
No chance.

960
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,059
We're stationed at fighting depth, sir.

961
01:28:50,093 --> 01:28:50,994
Door is open.

962
01:28:51,027 --> 01:28:51,928
"Fan-fucking-tastic."

963
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:53,961
It's showtime.

964
01:29:00,534 --> 01:29:02,837
Could be a trick.

965
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:03,803
It's not.

966
01:29:03,837 --> 01:29:04,904
On three.

967
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:07,040
1, 2, 3.

968
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:15,947
You haven't called me
that since I was a kid.

969
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,980
Artillery fire control,
should be back this way.

970
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:34,528
Good bye.

971
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:36,561
Launch enabling key, Michael.

972
01:29:38,931 --> 01:29:39,832
What's wrong?

973
01:29:39,866 --> 01:29:41,866
There's no ignition.

974
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,072
There's no problem here.

975
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:49,473
Navy people know about these things.

976
01:29:49,507 --> 01:29:50,741
Well, if I'd got into the Navy,

977
01:29:50,775 --> 01:29:53,843
I wouldn't be here right now.

978
01:29:53,877 --> 01:29:55,645
The must have removed the firing trigger.

979
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,013
Well, can we override it?

980
01:29:57,047 --> 01:29:58,847
Without the firing
trigger, the only chance

981
01:29:58,881 --> 01:30:01,850
we have of overriding is
to destroy the console

982
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:03,885
in the VLS compartment.

983
01:30:03,918 --> 01:30:05,119
You stay on this panel.

984
01:30:05,153 --> 01:30:08,022
As soon as you get a green, you launch.

985
01:30:08,056 --> 01:30:09,623
This is Lukash.

986
01:30:09,656 --> 01:30:13,060
Everyone, seal off the VLS
console compartment now.

987
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:16,762
How's your mom and Annie?

988
01:30:16,796 --> 01:30:18,664
They're fine.

989
01:30:18,698 --> 01:30:22,167
Sailed on to Anchorage.

990
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,835
Mike, your people have
done a great job up to now,

991
01:30:24,868 --> 01:30:27,171
but we're still skating on thin ice.

992
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:29,706
Lukash gets a hold of this
console and destroys it,

993
01:30:29,739 --> 01:30:31,574
fire control reverts to the bridge.

994
01:30:31,607 --> 01:30:34,443
You've got to defend
this piece of equipment.

995
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:37,112
I'll be up on the catwalk.

996
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,145
Perimeter defense, move.

997
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:59,730
Suna, what do we got?

998
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:01,131
Nothing, sir.

999
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:03,567
If the Kursk is within
range of our sensors,

1000
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,102
it's either drifting or
running too quiet to detect

1001
01:31:06,135 --> 01:31:08,135
with our passive equipment.

1002
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:15,876
Go!

1003
01:31:15,909 --> 01:31:17,578
Get your heads and asses wired together.

1004
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:19,611
Now, let's go!

1005
01:31:37,761 --> 01:31:39,795
Use the active system.

1006
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:42,765
But, sir...

1007
01:31:42,798 --> 01:31:44,798
Yes, I know the danger, Dimitri.

1008
01:31:50,837 --> 01:31:54,907
Attention all stations,
we are going active.

1009
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,940
We are going active.

1010
01:32:08,785 --> 01:32:10,253
You all right, dad?

1011
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:13,256
Yeah, he's just fine for
the present time, sonny boy.

1012
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:15,190
You don't put those
weapons down right now,

1013
01:32:15,223 --> 01:32:16,725
I'm going to give him a tracheotomy.

1014
01:32:16,758 --> 01:32:17,959
Michael, don't worry about me.

1015
01:32:17,993 --> 01:32:19,993
Shoot this bastard!

1016
01:32:24,264 --> 01:32:26,232
Drop them.

1017
01:32:26,266 --> 01:32:27,934
Very good.

1018
01:32:27,967 --> 01:32:30,235
You're so stupid.

1019
01:32:30,269 --> 01:32:31,870
I need him.

1020
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:33,904
I don't need you.

1021
01:32:48,617 --> 01:32:50,952
Michael!

1022
01:32:50,985 --> 01:32:51,986
Michael?

1023
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,954
My god, son, are you all right?

1024
01:32:52,987 --> 01:32:56,190
I'm fine.

1025
01:32:56,223 --> 01:32:58,625
Let's get to the COM.

1026
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:00,659
Wait, wait.

1027
01:33:02,829 --> 01:33:06,698
I don't who that is pinging us
with sonar, but they're close.

1028
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:08,731
Go easy.

1029
01:33:14,003 --> 01:33:14,971
Clear!

1030
01:33:15,004 --> 01:33:17,004
Clear!

1031
01:33:20,909 --> 01:33:23,878
Michael, there's two of them
in there... port and starboard

1032
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:24,779
side of the scopes.

1033
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:26,848
Both got Uzis.

1034
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:30,784
Hutch, Lombardi, take him out.

1035
01:33:30,817 --> 01:33:32,786
Mac, sweep out, both sides.

1036
01:33:32,819 --> 01:33:34,819
Check all compartments.

1037
01:33:44,795 --> 01:33:47,097
Cap, it seems we still
got a few stragglers.

1038
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,935
Got us forward, Michael, let's go.

1039
01:34:01,876 --> 01:34:03,244
Thanks for that, boy.

1040
01:34:03,277 --> 01:34:05,277
Well done.

1041
01:34:18,723 --> 01:34:20,723
Clear!

1042
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,631
Clear!

1043
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,705
Captain, I have a faint contact

1044
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:40,172
bearing, two, nine, three.

1045
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:42,241
Not strong enough for accurate ranging.

1046
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:45,810
Fire control,
make ready tubes one and three.

1047
01:35:01,823 --> 01:35:04,258
Sergeant McKinney, United States Army.

1048
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:06,260
Captain Lazarev.

1049
01:35:06,294 --> 01:35:08,162
This is my boat.

1050
01:35:08,195 --> 01:35:11,932
Captain Lazarev, it's an honor, sir.

1051
01:35:11,965 --> 01:35:13,166
Come with me.

1052
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,935
We're going to get you your boat back.

1053
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,968
Da.

1054
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,918
This is Hutch. Maneuvering room is clear.

1055
01:35:48,027 --> 01:35:51,196
Scuttle, scuttle, little roach.

1056
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:53,699
How you run when I approach.

1057
01:36:03,473 --> 01:36:06,008
Captain?

1058
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:09,077
This is Captain Lazarev.

1059
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,211
It's an honor, sir.

1060
01:36:10,244 --> 01:36:12,347
Thank you for taking back my boat.

1061
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,181
It was a pleasure.

1062
01:36:14,214 --> 01:36:15,716
Mac, let's go.

1063
01:36:15,749 --> 01:36:18,251
Captain Lazarev...

1064
01:36:18,285 --> 01:36:20,285
Anatoly Lazarev?

1065
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:28,391
Captain Halsey Lang, no?

1066
01:36:31,095 --> 01:36:33,464
1978, under the Aegis.

1067
01:36:33,497 --> 01:36:36,399
It was me pinging you.

1068
01:36:36,432 --> 01:36:38,334
And in 1981, I spent three very

1069
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:41,470
frustrating weeks chasing you
through the Baltic approaches,

1070
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:44,372
captain.

1071
01:36:44,405 --> 01:36:46,707
You know this Russian radar
a lot better than I do.

1072
01:36:46,741 --> 01:36:49,009
Are we in range of their active array?

1073
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:50,944
Captain, it would be an honor
if you would take the com,

1074
01:36:50,977 --> 01:36:52,977
please, and I'll take this over.

1075
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:58,950
Captain, what's the range of
your underwater telephone?

1076
01:36:58,983 --> 01:37:00,785
Depends on the type of submarine.

1077
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:08,817
But give or take, 3,000 meters.

1078
01:37:10,226 --> 01:37:13,129
Single contact, bearing one, one, three.

1079
01:37:13,162 --> 01:37:15,430
Range... 18,000 meters.

1080
01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:17,463
I see it.

1081
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,037
I've got no control over power.

1082
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:26,305
What the hell's happening
in the engine room?

1083
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:28,339
He's overriding you.

1084
01:37:30,108 --> 01:37:32,108
Lukash, you son of a bitch.

1085
01:37:38,182 --> 01:37:39,082
God dammit!

1086
01:37:39,115 --> 01:37:41,115
He's cut the power.

1087
01:37:43,386 --> 01:37:47,756
Petition the Lord with prayer.

1088
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:52,093
All bribing with gold.

1089
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:57,030
For I am Lord now.

1090
01:37:57,064 --> 01:38:00,332
And nuclear winters are cold.

1091
01:38:16,879 --> 01:38:19,481
Increased flat noise bearing
two, nine, three.

1092
01:38:19,514 --> 01:38:21,483
Range... 18,000 meters.

1093
01:38:21,516 --> 01:38:22,818
Twin screws.

1094
01:38:22,851 --> 01:38:24,851
It must be the Kursk.

1095
01:38:44,901 --> 01:38:48,038
That sonar bearing.

1096
01:38:48,071 --> 01:38:50,071
We have a match.

1097
01:38:52,908 --> 01:38:54,908
Fire 1 and 3.

1098
01:39:00,314 --> 01:39:03,484
High speed cruise in the
water, bearing one, one, three.

1099
01:39:03,517 --> 01:39:09,955
Range... 17,800 meters.

1100
01:39:25,267 --> 01:39:27,970
Two torpedoes.

1101
01:39:28,003 --> 01:39:29,303
Bearing one, one, six.

1102
01:39:29,337 --> 01:39:37,336
Range... 15,000 meters.

1103
01:39:41,247 --> 01:39:42,181
Come on!

1104
01:39:42,214 --> 01:39:44,214
Let's get down.

1105
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:24,181
Lukash is dead.

1106
01:40:24,214 --> 01:40:26,550
Talk to me.

1107
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:29,151
I got ya.

1108
01:40:29,185 --> 01:40:31,185
That's it?

1109
01:40:35,557 --> 01:40:36,558
All right, boys.

1110
01:40:36,591 --> 01:40:38,591
I'm coming back.

1111
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:45,331
Torpedoes range 8,000 meters,
and close at 50 knots.

1112
01:40:45,364 --> 01:40:47,500
Monitor and standby.

1113
01:40:47,533 --> 01:40:49,134
Michael and Akeem,
you guys may have given us

1114
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:50,368
a fighting chance here.

1115
01:40:50,402 --> 01:40:52,037
Can you get us out of this mess?

1116
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,071
I'll do my damnedest.

1117
01:40:53,104 --> 01:40:54,104
Captain?

1118
01:40:54,138 --> 01:40:55,673
Cycle range still powered up?

1119
01:40:55,706 --> 01:40:56,674
Da.

1120
01:40:56,707 --> 01:40:58,142
Bearing on it's own?

1121
01:40:58,175 --> 01:41:00,310
Zero at six and holding.

1122
01:41:00,343 --> 01:41:01,544
Keep an eye on it.

1123
01:41:01,578 --> 01:41:03,578
Blanes, hold your depth.

1124
01:41:05,347 --> 01:41:08,417
Helm, come right... zero, eight, six.

1125
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:11,152
Now monitor the screen.

1126
01:41:11,185 --> 01:41:14,955
Captain, how's your Morse?

1127
01:41:14,988 --> 01:41:17,157
It's all right.

1128
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:18,058
Good.

1129
01:41:18,091 --> 01:41:19,225
Let's go active.

1130
01:41:19,258 --> 01:41:21,258
I want to ping a message to that sub.

1131
01:41:25,063 --> 01:41:27,098
Kursk changing course, sir.

1132
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:29,131
Heading straight for us.

1133
01:41:34,537 --> 01:41:38,407
Sir, that's Morse code.

1134
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:41,409
Could be a trick.

1135
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:43,612
Then why haven't they fired, sir?

1136
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:45,645
They've had the chance.

1137
01:41:51,384 --> 01:41:54,019
Torpedoes have just gone active.

1138
01:41:54,052 --> 01:41:55,587
Range... 2,500 meters.

1139
01:41:55,621 --> 01:41:57,055
You're cutting it pretty close.

1140
01:41:57,089 --> 01:41:58,557
Yeah, that's the idea, son.

1141
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,524
1,900 meters.

1142
01:42:00,558 --> 01:42:01,959
20 degrees down bubble.

1143
01:42:01,993 --> 01:42:03,027
20 degrees down bubble.

1144
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,060
Easy.

1145
01:42:06,396 --> 01:42:08,298
The Kursk is diving, sir.

1146
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:10,032
Course unchanged.

1147
01:42:10,065 --> 01:42:12,735
Has the Kursk flooded any
tubes, or opened outer doors?

1148
01:42:12,768 --> 01:42:14,602
Negative, sir.

1149
01:42:14,636 --> 01:42:16,636
Make ready tubes, two and four.

1150
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:21,375
Slight elevation angle on torpedo one.

1151
01:42:21,408 --> 01:42:23,644
That means two, still locked.

1152
01:42:23,677 --> 01:42:24,543
Polarize on the planes.

1153
01:42:24,577 --> 01:42:26,577
Helm hard approach.

1154
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:37,054
With counter measures.

1155
01:42:37,087 --> 01:42:39,455
Captain Lazarev,
start with counter measures.

1156
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:42,425
Counter measures ready.

1157
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:44,026
Strike for the counter measure.

1158
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:46,059
It will be closed.

1159
01:42:48,463 --> 01:42:50,965
All hands, brace for impact.

1160
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:08,079
Gents, we need to make a
statement of intent here.

1161
01:43:08,112 --> 01:43:10,112
Captain, let's blow all tanks.

1162
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:21,656
The Kursk has blown her tank, sir.

1163
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:24,391
She's going to the surface.

1164
01:43:24,425 --> 01:43:27,027
Close all the torpedo doors.

1165
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:30,029
Take us to periscope depth.

1166
01:43:30,063 --> 01:43:32,063
Yes, sir.

1167
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:36,499
Close torpedo doors.

1168
01:43:43,207 --> 01:43:46,309
Michael, congratulations to you
and your men.

1169
01:43:46,343 --> 01:43:48,144
Job well done, captain.

1170
01:43:48,178 --> 01:43:49,745
Thank you, sir.

1171
01:43:49,778 --> 01:43:52,258
By the way, there's someone here
who'd like to speak with you.

1172
01:43:54,148 --> 01:43:55,683
Admiral?

1173
01:43:55,717 --> 01:43:59,586
You didn't expect anything less out
of my son and his team, did you?

1174
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:01,188
Halsey, old salt.

1175
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:03,256
Good to hear your voice.

1176
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:05,825
Norm, can you get word to Ruth
and Annie that we're both OK?

1177
01:44:05,858 --> 01:44:08,794
It would be my pleasure, Halsey.

1178
01:44:08,828 --> 01:44:11,696
Mike, we've been in
contact with Port Yeramin.

1179
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:15,332
Sergeant Spars and Sergeant
Vickers is gonna pull through.

1180
01:44:18,302 --> 01:44:19,535
That's great news, Admiral.

1181
01:44:19,569 --> 01:44:20,737
Please give him our best.

1182
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:23,272
Lang out.

1183
01:44:23,306 --> 01:44:26,575
Gentlemen, hospitality?

1184
01:44:26,608 --> 01:44:28,976
A little Russian cure for stress?

1185
01:44:32,847 --> 01:44:37,250
To Delta force,

1186
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:54,830
You know there's something
else I'd like to drink to?

1187
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:03,369
You, son.

1188
01:45:09,642 --> 01:45:11,642
Family.
