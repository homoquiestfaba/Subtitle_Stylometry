1
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:05,866
Ew!

2
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,867
l didn't see anything!

3
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:27,201
They were yelling.
They're always yelling.

4
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,634
All l wanted was
some peace and quiet.

5
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,802
Relax, man.
You just hit a moose.

6
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,367
A moose?

7
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,833
Are you sure?

8
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,401
Yeah, man, l see this kind
of shit all the time.

9
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,665
ln fact, this ain't shit
compared to what just happened

10
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,300
on l-95 recently.

11
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,498
l mean, a lady hit a moose
and the motherfucker

12
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,634
went right through
the windshield, man.

13
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,716
No.

14
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,267
Yeah.

15
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,267
l was partying
with my cousin.

16
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,134
- You know...
- What kind of partying?

17
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,133
- ...partying like...
- Okay.

18
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,601
...getting some hair pie
like the man from Nantucket

19
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:02,102
whose dong was so long them
bitches couldn't even fuck it?

20
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:05,235
And this fucking moose pissed
on my pussy parade, man.

21
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:08,134
l had to come down on
a Sunday because he's sitting

22
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,200
in the front seat of
a Volvo wide awake

23
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:13,935
with his head sticking out
the cracks in the glass and shit, man.

24
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,268
Poor guy.

25
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,768
- l had to put him down.
- Whoa.

26
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,901
But l got
a picture of it.

27
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:28,798
l carry this shit with me now 'cause
every time l'd tell that story

28
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,268
nobody would believe me.

29
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,533
- Laugh it off, man.
- Okay.

30
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,967
- This ain't shit.
- Okay.

31
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:38,131
All right?
Just get the kids to school, all right?

32
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,133
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

33
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,499
Thank you.

34
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,667
Stop!

35
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,966
Winston, do you copy?

36
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,502
Winston, do you copy?

37
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,733
Yes, sir, l'm here.

38
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,501
Where the hell are you?

39
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:41,832
Smith Bridge Road. l'm still clearing
the scene from that bus accident.

40
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,235
l don't give a shit
if it's a handicapped bus

41
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,898
and there's a bunch of
retards splattered all over the road.

42
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,600
l need you
back here now.

43
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,266
There's a bunch
of suits up here

44
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,498
asking a whole lot of big-city questions
about the way we do things.

45
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,198
They were
up at the cabin this morning

46
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,098
and l need to make sure
that your stupid ass

47
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,067
is on the same page.
Do you get me?

48
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,100
Yes, sir, l'm on it.

49
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:57,801
Sandy Taylor's
fucking ridiculous.

50
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,932
Yo- yo, John, you were
just asleep at the wheel

51
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,398
for the hottest girl
in school.

52
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,167
Yeah, not my type.

53
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,434
Wait, Sandy is
not your type?

54
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,900
What does that even mean?

55
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,398
Does that mean you're gay?
Did you tell your dad?

56
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,733
Was he bummed, or-

57
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:17,136
Dude, you see her every day.
You know she's a nightmare.

58
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:18,633
No, l don't know that.

59
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,965
ln fact, neither do you.
You don't even have a type,

60
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,901
John, you have an obsession.

61
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,469
'Cassie!
Cassie, l love you!

62
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:29,168
Would you kiss me?
Would you-'

63
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:35,865
Seriously, man, don't take your fucking
blue balls out on me, man.

64
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,865
Don't think you're the only
dude here thinking about

65
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:40,268
taking Miss Gorgeous
to Boomtown.

66
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,567
l actually know you are
the only person here

67
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,168
dumb enough to take
a girl out whose ex-boyFriend

68
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,801
does have a fucking black belt
in kicking teeth in.

69
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,401
Look, man, l told you-

70
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,231
there's no way that she's
gonna go with me

71
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,665
just days after breaking up with him.
Why do you care anyway?

72
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,467
You hate the prom,
so drop it.

73
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:58,064
l know, prom blows.
But this is a whole different thing.

74
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:00,167
This is important for you.

75
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,900
You know what l mean?
This is like...

76
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,631
Besides, it really just proves how little
you know about girls anyway.

77
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:07,768
So- hey, l'm fucking talking.
Come on.

78
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,999
lf she broke up with him,
it's 'cause she finally realized

79
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,469
how big of a fucking
douchebag the guy is.

80
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,369
And going to prom with you, that's like
the ultimate power move, all right?

81
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,367
You're the smartest dude
in school,

82
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,331
you've fucking known
the girl your whole life,

83
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,365
and you're head over heels
in love with her.

84
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,434
All right?
l mean, come on.

85
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,770
Spite is almost as important
to those bitches as- as money.

86
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,201
You know what l mean?
She knows all this.

87
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,064
l mean, now that Marc
is out of the picture,

88
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,866
revenge is exactly
what she needs.

89
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,898
For every single girl
in this building,

90
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,234
that is the priority-
revenge.

91
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,798
l mean, look at those two
fucking savages right there.

92
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,334
Hey.
Oh, that's how it is-

93
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,398
All right, all right,
l'll think about it.

94
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,431
Just fucking do it.
Shave your pussy, get it over with.

95
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:53,331
l'm rallying for your fucking cause.
You need to do this thing.

96
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,932
All right,
l'm thinking about it.

97
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,801
You'll regret it
if you don't.

98
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,834
Oh, fuck.

99
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,734
l gotta get my goggles
from the car.

100
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,031
- Will you cover for me?
- What do you want me to say?

101
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:05,202
l don't know-
l'm on my fucking period, man.

102
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,900
Gotta get tampons.

103
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,367
All right,
well, hurry up.

104
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,367
Whatever.

105
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,569
Ha!
Shut up. Don't say a word.

106
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,567
Listen, people are talking.

107
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,631
And how they're talking so soon when
it's none of their fucking business,

108
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,134
l don't know.
But l hear things.

109
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,799
l don't like
what l hear.

110
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,735
So you and your
bullshit friends

111
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,034
better stay the hell
away from my girl.

112
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,200
Do you understand me?

113
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,300
Look, man...

114
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,901
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

115
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,001
Listen, l don't care
what she tells you

116
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,000
or what you think
you know, she's mine.

117
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,867
Do you get it?

118
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,300
lt's cool, man.

119
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,933
lt's cool?

120
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,567
- Yeah.
- Really?

121
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,934
You're dead.

122
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,333
lt's frustrating. It's frustrating.

123
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:16,769
You- l'm frustrating to you.
l understand that.

124
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,636
Honey? Honey?
Sweetie, listen to me.

125
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,268
Angel, please
listen to me.

126
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,167
Don't hang-
don't hang-

127
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,223
You have anything to say for
yourself before l launch into my tirade?

128
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,533
Nothing?

129
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,901
There are five weeks
Ieft in school.

130
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,101
Count them-
five weeks.

131
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,700
And you're a smart kid.

132
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,002
You got good grades.
You're going to college in the fall.

133
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:58,834
Why would you go and do
something so stupid

134
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,301
like start a fight?
Why?

135
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,766
l didn't start it.

136
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,568
l'm sorry, l didn't hear you.
What?

137
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,701
l said l didn't start it.

138
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,367
Mm-hmm.

139
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:16,368
Where are you supposed
to be right now?

140
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,833
Biology.

141
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,234
Biology.

142
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,000
Miss Hawker
or Mrs. Jennings?

143
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:22,800
Hawker.

144
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,570
Well, you better get
your little butt down there.

145
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,635
Not even l can
spare you from that.

146
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,367
Mmm.

147
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,802
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

148
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,235
l don't want to see you
around here again, mmm?

149
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,066
Capisci?

150
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,601
Now get out.

151
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:04,101
Hi. l'm-

152
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:08,836
Place the scalpel at
the base of the throat

153
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,002
and carefully
make a slit

154
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:15,602
all the way down
the front

155
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,734
of the frog's belly.

156
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,334
Now...

157
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,836
Got in trouble for
being late, by the way.

158
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,001
Yeah, well, so did l.

159
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:26,600
...and tack it down...

160
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,999
l can't believe l missed
you getting your ass kicked.

161
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,431
That was, like, right after
l talked about her too.

162
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,500
Like telekinesis-

163
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,700
wait, telepathy or
teleki- which one?

164
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,702
You know, l don't really
want to talk about it, Alex.

165
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:42,169
l wonder if we would wait
till l left until he kicked your ass.

166
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,869
Somehow l don't think
it would have mattered.

167
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,965
Yeah, you're right. l don't even know
where l was going with that.

168
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,268
- Alex Hicks!
- Yes, ma'am?

169
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,833
Quiet!

170
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:58,101
- Sorry.
- That's strike two!

171
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,734
One more strike and you're
headed to the office.

172
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,567
- Mean old hag.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:14,334
Now make an incision

174
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,634
through the muscular
tissue.

175
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,567
Hey.

176
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,634
No way.

177
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:47,801
You think what they say
about Mary is true,

178
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,298
- that she's pregnant?
- Shhh!

179
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,466
What?

180
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,498
Miss Hawker just told
you guys to shut up,

181
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,101
so shut up.
l'm trying to learn.

182
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,233
There's your prom date.

183
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, dude,
you know what?

184
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,982
Fuck what l said about taking
Cassie to the prom, man.

185
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,068
Serious ramifications
involved.

186
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,533
Big fucking problem.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,335
Now set the heart aside.

188
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,500
Next is the liver.

189
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,966
Oh.

190
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:25,666
Aw .

191
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,268
Marc's a fucking
douchebag.

192
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,167
Mmm.

193
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:34,803
Think if our dads were millionaires,
we'd be douchebags too?

194
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,634
l don't know.

195
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,933
You would be.

196
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,368
You little shit.

197
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,434
Hey, are you all right?

198
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,067
Yeah.

199
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:01,166
No.

200
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,733
What's the problem?

201
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,001
l got dumped.

202
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,900
Ungrateful shit.

203
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:24,168
l don't know the guy,

204
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,501
but anybody that
would do that to you

205
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,367
is a fool, in my opinion.

206
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,769
l mean, if he didn't realize
how lucky he was,

207
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,202
then he's, like,
the stupidest guy on earth.

208
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:36,600
Really?

209
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:37,866
Really.

210
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,269
Wait wait.
Wait.

211
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,833
What's wrong?

212
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,334
Nothing.

213
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,101
Nothing.

214
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:27,034
Oh, ow!

215
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:30,168
- Ow!
- Sorry, it's the braces.

216
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,433
lt's cool.

217
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,235
Uh, hey.
Hey, uh...

218
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:06,669
So what's the deal?
We gonna go to prom together or-

219
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,700
ls that cool?

220
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,834
No.

221
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:15,536
OH, well, l just-
l just assumed...

222
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,035
Look, kid,

223
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:21,435
you're real nice
and sweet and everything.

224
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:25,503
But this wasn't about
you and me, okay?

225
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:28,768
This was about revenge.

226
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,834
Re- revenge.

227
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,067
Yeah.

228
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,201
Besides, l work
for a living.

229
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,434
Wha-

230
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:41,270
Would you- would you please
go to prom with me? l mean-

231
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:46,203
lf l can get one of the other
girls to cover my shift,

232
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:49,268
maybe l'll meet you there.

233
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,900
How's that?

234
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:54,202
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
that's awesome.

235
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,331
That- l mean, that actually
works better for me

236
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,634
in the long run.
That's cool. Okay.

237
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,101
l will see you- prom.

238
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:03,000
See you there.

239
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,601
Good afternoon,
Jonathan.

240
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,467
Hey.

241
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,900
Daryl, Dane.

242
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,932
We heard about you
getting your butt kicked.

243
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,934
Heard you cried like
a little pussy.

244
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:22,134
Yeah, that's not
exactly what happened.

245
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,732
That's not how we
were informed.

246
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,668
Yeah, Alex said that
your little-

247
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:28,301
So is it now safe
to assume

248
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:30,767
that you will be coming over
tonight after all?

249
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,536
Uh, l don't know, you guys.
It's prom night.

250
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,435
News flash, John-
prom blows.

251
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,368
How you gonna pass up
'Bride of the Cannibals 2:

252
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,768
The Director's Cut'
for a gay dance?

253
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,569
lt's the most insane sequel ever made;
it's banned in over 26 countries.

254
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,832
Can you even begin to
comprehend that awesomeness?

255
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,665
Yeah, we heard there's
this one part

256
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,231
where the broad with the piranha
teeth bites the guy's dick and balls.

257
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:55,601
John, you see it
in a close-up.

258
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,200
That does sound good.

259
00:22:58,232 --> 00:22:59,866
Yeah.

260
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,435
But l'm still not sure
what l'm doing tonight.

261
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:05,631
What do you mean you don't
know what you're doing?

262
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,300
Prom's in, like,
five hours.

263
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:09,365
Who are you gonna ask
at this point, your mother?

264
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,898
lf Mom would let me go
to the dance,

265
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,565
l'd be fucking so much
pussy tonight.

266
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:14,768
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Cassie.

267
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,264
Hey, do you want to
walk with me?

268
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, sure.

269
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,566
Yeah?

270
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,834
l'll catch you guys later.
Cool?

271
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,267
Oh my God,
those two are so funny.

272
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,633
- D8D?
- Yeah.

273
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,898
Oh my God, l heard Dane
scored 1500 on his SATs.

274
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:41,533
- 1 550.
- What?

275
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:43,367
- Yeah.
- No way. How old is that kid?

276
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,933
- Like 12.
- Oh my God.

277
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:46,698
Yeah, but l think he's
living proof

278
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:49,234
that you can be smart
and stupid at the same time.

279
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:51,365
You should see when he
and Alex get together.

280
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:53,732
Oh, Alex- l haven't talked
to him in, like, forever.

281
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,434
lt's so weird.
How is he?

282
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,534
He's good, you know?

283
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,935
- He's still Alex.
- Yeah?

284
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:02,264
Yeah, l think we're gonna
go over to their house later

285
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:04,667
and watch some movies
or something.

286
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,389
Okay. So you're not
going to prom?

287
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,067
Nah.

288
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,235
Yeah, me neither.

289
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,064
Well, you'll probably
be disappearing

290
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:14,999
to some amazing medical
school soon, right?

291
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,601
l did get into Adams.

292
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:18,233
- You got into Adams?
- Yeah.

293
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:21,835
- Oh my God, why didn't you tell me?
- l'm telling you now.

294
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:25,069
Well, congratulations. That's awesome.
That's what you wanted.

295
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,767
Yeah, l guess it is.

296
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,800
- Wow.
- Thanks.

297
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:33,333
So how are you doing?

298
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:36,035
- What?
- Everything.

299
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:38,031
l don't know.
l mean, it's okay. l don't know.

300
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:40,598
l'm fine, l don't know.
Like, relationships are hard.

301
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,934
What can you do?
Yackety schmakety.

302
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,735
lt was the right
decision, though.

303
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,868
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,932
You know, you're probably
the only person l know

305
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,965
who's actually going to do
something with their life.

306
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,234
- Oh, come on, that's not true.
- No, it's true.

307
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,665
Seriously, like, l have no
clue what l'm gonna do.

308
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,933
Nobody does, you know?

309
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:00,031
Oh my God, everybody's going
to be so super jealous

310
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,368
when you come back to town
and you're this really famous doctor

311
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,402
and they're all a bunch of fat
townies with ugly babies.

312
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,298
l'm serious. Like, even Marc was
jealous of you, you know that?

313
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,635
Come on, Cassie,
all these compliments you're paying me

314
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,531
are making me
a little uncomfortable.

315
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,598
Well, you know, today's the only day
you're gonna get 'em, so enjoy.

316
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,201
Cassie, Mom's looking for you!

317
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:23,767
- Okay.
- l guess you better get going, huh?

318
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,868
Yeah. Well, it was
nice talking to you, John.

319
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,268
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.
- Bye.

320
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:38,067
Hey, Cassie, wait up!

321
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,668
Hey, do you want to
go to prom with me?

322
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:46,702
Look, l know you've been through a lot-
things are a mess...

323
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,501
but it's prom,
you know?

324
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:52,698
l don't know, it's the last
few weeks of high school,

325
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:57,036
and l just figure it'd be the kind of
thing that we'd regret not having done.

326
00:25:57,065 --> 00:25:59,033
Look, l really
want to go.

327
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:03,302
And you're the only person
l could see myself going with.

328
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,500
So how about it?

329
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:09,602
l can't, John.
l'm sorry.

330
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:13,602
Look, if you're worried about
me getting beat up or anything,

331
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:16,031
- don't worry about it.
- No, l'm not worried about that.

332
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,231
Like, l- it's just like my brother's sick
and l've got all this stuff to do.

333
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:20,933
And it's just, like,
l don't know.

334
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,001
lt's just too much,
you know?

335
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,933
- l understand.
- Yeah?

336
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:27,601
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Well, call me later.

337
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,434
- Bye.
- Bye.

338
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:44,101
'Bride of the Cannibals'
it is.

339
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,333
Stupid.

340
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,368
Here's your pancakes,
sweetie.

341
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,734
Oh, Lucille.

342
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:09,336
l've been dreaming about
your pancakes all day.

343
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,468
l know, baby.

344
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,635
That's what all
the young boys say.

345
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,501
Oh, what the fuck, man?

Breathe. Breathe.
In the name of all that is holy,

00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:13,869
Bill, you're in trouble!
Oh! Bill!

Shit.

This is bad news.
This is real bad news.

363
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,766
Yeah?

364
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,934

365
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:46,302
The entire team is going

Oh, so there's an 'l'

367
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:51,334
John, don't try to be funny.
You're not good at it.

368
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:53,701
You're just not good at it.
Hey, don't hang up.

369
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,868
l didn't mean that.
No no no no no no.

370
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:57,433
John? John?

371
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:01,336
- Spit it out.
- Funny you should say that actually.

372
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,135
All you need to know is
that l have a date for prom.

373
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:16,634
You need to get your ass
out of fucking bed,

374
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,435
get on a suit and tie,
and that's it.

375
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:22,298
You know, after listening to you
rag on prom for the last week,

376
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,434
l think l finally
came around.

377
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:26,201
Prom blows.

378
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,534
That was a lot of rings.

379
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,535
- l'm gonna go now.
- No no, dude, come on.

380
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,434
Dude, please.

381
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:02,468
Please? You can't let me
go to this by myself.

382
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,198
You're my best friend. You can't do that.
It's not in the book.

383
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,334
You can't do this.
Please, man.

384
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,034
Please.

385
00:31:09,065 --> 00:31:11,233

Come on.

392
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,700
Hey, look,
she said she was 18.

393
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,465
l always believe what
children say.

394
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,498
No, man, l need to see
your delivery schedule.

395
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,567
- Open the fucking gate. Come on.
- Oh, okay.

396
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,801
Okay, all right.

l got the key right here.

398
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,133
- No, wrong key.
- Come on, man.

399
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,865
- It's a fucking emergency.
- l found it.

400
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:27,235
No.
Maybe it's this one.

401
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,367
Son of a bitch.

402
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,000
Looks like that one.
Here it is.

403
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,134
Gross.

404
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,333
Hey.

405
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:20,001
Sorry.
l didn't mean to scare you.

406
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,299
Rick.

407
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:23,267
What are you
doing here?

408
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:26,035
What do you mean?
l came to see you.

409
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,600
Me?

410
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,834
Yeah.
Is that not okay?

411
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:34,436
No. l mean, yes.
l mean, what about Sandy?

412
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:38,169
Oh, she's busy preparing
her prom queen speech.

413
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,867
Couldn't take it.

414
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,335
Plus l wanted
to talk to you.

415
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:45,000

You do great work.

00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,367
You think so?

420
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,100
Oh, yeah.

421
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:56,867
lt's beautiful.

422
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:18,003
Ungrateful little shits.

423
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,467
Come on.

424
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,668
- What if the teachers show up?
- To the pool?

425
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:33,768
Get 'em off.

426
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:58,468
Come on!
It's beautiful!

427
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:11,235

429
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:15,301
Wait, do you

430
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,934
l'll pull out.

431
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:22,968

Oh, are you

What the fuck?

437
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,400
Oh my God,

Frederica?

446
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,669
Frederica, stop it!

447
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:26,567

Where did you get that?

454
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,101
Um, my mom got it down
from the attic.

455
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,767
Well, it's very dapper.

456

Dapper?

457
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:22,866
Whoo.

458
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:25,001
So should we just call it?

459
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:27,064
Head over to D8D's and
watch movies all night?

460
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,533
Yeah, we should.

461
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,701
Mm-hmm.

462
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,901
Well, fuck that,

We're gonna get laid tonight.

00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:38,334
Come on.
This is it, baby-

465
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,264
one last night to hate your life just
a little bit fucking more.

466
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:42,699
This is it, motherfucker.

467
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:46,803
Two men going to prom together.
It's exactly as it should be.

468
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,435
Shit, man. Paperwork's
never been my thing.

469
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:59,969
Hey, careful with
those files.

470
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,569
Hey, uh,
l'm just the night guard.

471
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,798
l don't know anything about
any of that stuff.

472
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:08,669
lf this is about some kind
of bookkeeping cover-up or whatever,

473
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,400
l don't know nothing
about that.

474
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:11,966
Just, you know,
say no.

475
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,968
Hey, you haven't seen
my application

476
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:16,064
floating around at the station,
have you?

477
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,033
l sent one in like six months ago.

478
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:21,034
- Hey, what's today?
- Friday.

479
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,599
No, the fucking date, man.

480
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:24,667
Um...

481
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:27,168
Jesus! Shit!

482
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:33,101
Oh, Daddy.

00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:34,932
You got another
fucking beer, man?

484
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,135
Shh.

485
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,400
Oh, yeah.

486
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:42,866
Yeah.

487
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,634
Can l use your phone?

488
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,467
Yeah, just dial 9,

489
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:51,869
then you'll hear a dial tone,
then you dial the area code

490
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,598
and then your number.
It's different than a regular phone.

491
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,334
- Is it working?
- Herman.

492
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,534
lt's me, Winston.

Now do me a fucking favor,
Man.

00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,768
You gotta tell

that the water coming out
of here is bad news.

504
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:29,235
They cannot deliver it.
Do you understand me?

505
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:30,566
Why do l gotta tell them?

506
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,934
Man, it's jurisdiction
bullshit, you know?

507
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:35,535
Ah, beaurocracy. Okay.

508

Look, man, you're gonna be
a fucking hero for this.

509
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,100
Oh.

Hnow what kind of pussy

511
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,467
Oh, man,

512
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:46,933
What's that?

So where is
your hot date?

519
00:42:58,632 --> 00:43:00,633
She's late.

Or not fucking coming.

521
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:09,268
l'm gonna go get
some punch.

522
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:11,901
Do you want some more?

523
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,902
No, it tastes like
someone pissed in it.

524
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,635
l'm gonna go
Iower my standards.

525
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,600
l can't find Rick!

526
00:43:31,632 --> 00:43:33,934
l am not gonna be
embarrassed on that stage!

527
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:35,434
l am the prom queen

528
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:37,167
and he's the prom king!

529
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,200
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

530
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:42,101
Sandy, nobody's trying
to ruin your life.

531
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,765
Perhaps he's just
in the boys' room.

532
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:46,001
Just calm down.

533
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:48,000
Miss Hawker?

534
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:49,233
Ow!

535
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,967
Guess who.

536
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,368
Cassie?

537
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:58,601
- It's me!
- Cassie!

538
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:00,500
- You're here!
- l'm here!

539
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:03,001
- Yeah, l changed my mind.
- Have some punch.

540
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,601
Thanks. Yeah, l thought
about what you said today.

541
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:08,901
l don't know, l just thought,
you're right. You know? It's prom.

542
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:11,935
That's so great.
l'm so glad that you're here.

543
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:14,268
- Great.
- Hey, baby.

544
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:18,069
Hey, John. Sweetheart, do you think you
can give John and l a minute?

545
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,535
Because l would really like
to apologize to him too.

546
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:23,367
- l'll just be a minute.
- Okay.

547
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:24,466
- Okay?
- Yeah.

548
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:26,133
l'll bring you
a fresh cup.

549
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,499
Bye, John.

550
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:37,234
Are you trying to
be an asshole?

551
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:40,635
l told you to
stay away from her.

552
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,064
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

553
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:46,368
Could you?

554
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:49,765
You want to know something about
the girl of your dreams over there?

555
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:52,869
Not only is she
here with me and not you,

556
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,934
but l'm gonna be
fucking her tonight.

557
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:57,064
l'm gonna take her home
and l'm gonna fuck her

558
00:44:57,065 --> 00:44:59,100
every which way l want
because l can.

559
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:02,301
And no matter what l do,
she's always gonna come back to me.

560
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,534
What do you think
about that?

561
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,069
What?
Oh, do you like that, faggot?

562
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:14,867
Stop this!
Stop this!

563
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:17,701
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!

564
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,501
- Fuck you!
- What did you do?

565
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:21,631
- Cassie, l didn't do anything.
- That's a lie!

566
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:24,267
You did something.
Why do you always have to fight?

567
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:25,700
Asshole!

568
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:27,901
You hit like
your fucking boyFriend.

569
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,333
l didn't fucking
do anything!

570
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:35,735
This is bullshit!
He fucking started it!

571
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,832
Watch your mouth!
This is the second time today

572
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,365
l've had to deal with
this nonsense from you.

573
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:41,999
You're out of here. l will not tolerate
this barbaric behavior-

574
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,036
- Are you fucking blind? He started it!
- Out out!

575
00:45:45,065 --> 00:45:48,968
l am out!
l can't get any more out than this!

576
00:45:50,232 --> 00:45:53,034
School sucks!

577
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:55,434
John, wait!

578
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:57,534
Will you wait?
Wait!

579
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,166
Jesus Christ.

580
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:51,902
John!
John, will you wait?

581
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:54,335
Will you just wait?
John!

582
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:56,901
What, Cassie?
What? What do you want?

583
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:58,565
- l'm just sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

584
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,631
You're sorry for what?

585
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:01,631
You're sorry that l get
blamed for everything

586
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:03,631
or you're sorry that your
boyFriend's a fucking asshole?

587
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:06,665
Or you're sorry that
you're too stupid to tell the difference?

588
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,968
ls that it?
Huh?

589
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,999
You gotta be a little
clearer with me tonight

590
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,798
because l've got
a bit of a headache!

591
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,434
- John!
- Fuck you!

592
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:19,203
He is the worst human being
in this fucking school,

593
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:22,201
and you are the best.

594
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,701
Now how does that work?
Huh?

595
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:27,133
Hmm?

596
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:29,333
No, l want to know
about that process-

597
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:30,967
what goes
through your head.

598
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,403
How you can not like me, someone
you've known for your entire life,

599
00:47:34,404 --> 00:47:36,631
someone who would treat you
like an absolute queen,

600
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:39,835
and instead go for
that piece of shit back there.

601
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,701
Why?

602
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,235
Because he's rich?
Because he's popular?

603
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:47,534
l mean, Jesus, Cassie,
you're not even poor.

604
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,868
l mean, how obvious
does it have to be?

605
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:52,301
You would have to be
practically retarded

606
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:54,534
not to see that
l'm in love with you.

607
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:56,200
Everybody sees it.

608
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:59,001
Marc sees it.

609
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:02,735
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?

610
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,467
No.

611
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,834
No, of course you don't.

612
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:09,235
l'm done with it.
It's over.

613
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:12,101
l can't take it anymore,
Cassie.

614
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:21,101
Hey, kids, you're gonna
have to get back inside.

615
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:23,264
Yo, we're having
a conversation here, asshole.

616
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:25,100
Not anymore.
It's over.

617
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:27,631
You need to get your girlfriend
and take her back inside.

618
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:30,231
That's not my girlfriend, all right, man?
l'm going home.

619
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:33,068
Stop!

620
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:35,234
Get inside now!

621
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:36,699
All right.

622
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,700
- What the hell was that?
- l don't know.

623
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:48,202
l have a bad feeling.
We gotta get out of here.

624
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:49,633
Go.

625
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:42,567
Who are they?

626
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:51,368
l don't know.

627
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:54,702
But l don't think
that they're cops.

628
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:57,869
Now l need you to go
in there and get Alex, okay?

629
00:49:57,899 --> 00:50:00,568
No matter what he says,
you get him out of there.

630
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:02,598
You drag him by the hair
if you have to, okay?

631
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,467
Okay. But what about
everyone else?

632
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,498
l'm gonna tell Principal
St. Clair what's going on,

633
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:08,598
but l'm not staying here
any longer than that.

634
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:10,798
No matter what he says,
we're getting out of here, okay?

635
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,133
Okay.

636
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:24,501
- Alex! Alex!
- Cassie, have you seen John?

637
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:27,701
You've got to come outside
with me right now, okay?

638
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,503
You just fucking
cockblocked me.

639
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:42,934
Okay. Don't get kicked out of prom.
Just come with me.

640
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:44,801
- All right.
- God!

641
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:02,335
Well well well.

642
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:04,334
lt is time

643
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:06,634
to announce
the prom king

644
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,168
and the prom queen!

645
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,268
Freak!

646
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,433
God, what is
taking him so long?

647
00:51:28,434 --> 00:51:32,064
So what are you talking about?
There's dead bodies in here or something?

648
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:34,066
You're not listening to me!

649
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:35,565
l've had more than enough
of this from you!

650
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,200
- l told you to go home.
- Back off!

651
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:40,001
All right?
Now there's a dead body in the pool

652
00:51:40,002 --> 00:51:42,064
and there's people
surrounding the school!

653
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,566
All right?
Do something!

654
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,465
Come on, boy, what kind
of fool do you take me for?

655
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:47,498
Principal St. Clair, there are people
with guns outside-

656
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:49,131
men in vans with guns!
Will you just look?

657
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:50,433
All right, wait a minute.

658
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:52,568
Stay right here.
Do not move.

659
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,367
Go!

660
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:58,268
What the hell
is going on?

661
00:51:58,299 --> 00:52:00,801
They locked the doors!

662
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:03,068
Wait, what?
We're fucking trapped?

663
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,267
What's going on
out there?

664
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:10,434
l'm the principal
of this school!

665
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:12,501
l demand to know
what's going on.

666
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:35,802
Who is that girl?
Why is everyone looking at her?

667
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,935
This is supposed to be
my big night!

668
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:29,135
Help me.

669
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,866
Help me!

670
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:34,400
Help.

671
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,698
What, is this fucking
terrorism or something?

672
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,167
Why'd they lock us in?

673
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:10,549
We just need to find
a phone- we need to get help.

674
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,631
No, we need to get out of here before
they can lock all the doors.

675
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:14,333
Art room has
outside doors.

676
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,365
No, the auditorium's way better
'cause it leads out back.

677
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:19,769
What, is this contagious?
Did you see that guy's fucking face?

678
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,164
l don't know, man.
You don't look sick. Neither do you.

679
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:23,266
What the fuck?

680
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:26,298
Last time l checked kids were
taking trench coats to school,

681
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:28,267
not fucking biological
weapons!

682
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:49,233
- My back.
- Okay, all right.

683
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:52,367
We need to get out of here.

684
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:54,400
They're here!
They're here!

685
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:15,200
- Look.
- What?

686
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:27,536
No no no no.
Oh, fuck.

687
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:30,368
No no no no.

688
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,801
Stupid fucking bitch.

689
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,134
That fucking bitch.

690
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,066
No no no. Oh oh!

691
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,668
Fucking bitch.

692
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,700
Fucking...

693
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:41,900
Fuck.

694

chick magnet, man.

00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:06,431
And this fucking world's

They're not even gonna know
l was ever here, man.

729
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:28,131
Yeah, well, l hate to rain
on your parade-

730
00:58:28,132 --> 00:58:30,898
you just don't quit the police force
without somebody noticing, man.

731
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:32,131
You ever think
about that?

732
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:34,465
Up until this afternoon
l was a fucking cop, remember?

733
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,501

bullshit works.

734

Shit! He's not here!
He's in the library.

754
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:14,264
He's sick, all right?
Whatever it is, he's got it

755
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:16,732
and he's convinced that he can
save himself if he knows what it is.

756
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,932
He thinks l can help him.
l can't fucking help him!

Fuck! l never should
have let him go!

You know l can't leave him?
You know that?

01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,935

No one's being allowed through.
The road's closed.

l didn't mean it.

815
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:20,900

You think you can just
drop me because you fucking feel like it?

825
01:08:53,099 --> 01:08:55,734
What about my feelings?

826
01:08:55,766 --> 01:08:59,336
