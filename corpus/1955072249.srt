1
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,243
My goals are to excel

2
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,015
in my field of study
and become the best...

3
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,652
no, the greatest,

4
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,022
no, no, the best.

5
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,694
To excel and become the best...

6
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
<i>The best at...</i>

7
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,598
<i>I don't know,
that doesn't sound right.</i>

8
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,479
<i>To excel and become...</i>

9
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,548
<i>A viable asset to my family</i>

10
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,017
<i>and the community.</i>

11
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,386
<i>Ah, is that lame?</i>

12
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,074
All right,
listen up, here it is!

13
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,909
This one here.

14
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm looking for
what is the value

15
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:32,217
of a times b in this equation.

16
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,854
This is a good one, who wants to
take a crack at this bad boy?

17
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,429
Someone other than Alex?

18
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,035
Chris!

19
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,904
What do you think?

20
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,573
Eh...

21
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,944
I don't know, eight?

22
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,848
No, no, not eight.

23
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,685
I'm looking for 12 team, 12.

24
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,087
Okay?
This is not rocket science.

25
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,123
Yet.

26
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,227
Okay Alex.

27
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,296
Tell us what we're all missing.

28
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,966
Well, if you want
the value to be 12,

29
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,736
then I think you'd have to
change the exponent from 1/4

30
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,838
to 1/2.

31
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,854
You are correct.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,392
Very good.
Score one more for Alex.

33
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,228
Ok, that's it,

34
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,462
have a great weekend!

35
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,498
You may want to open your books,

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,767
you'll find some
amazing things inside.

37
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,402
Letters and numbers.

38
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,637
- I'm should be there at six.
- Oh really?

39
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,005
Yeah, I may just take the bus.

40
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,506
Hey Alex,
can I have a word with you?

41
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,475
Yeah sure, I'll catch up
with you right now.

42
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,876
Yup.

43
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,516
I've been hearing
some good things.

44
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,719
Very good things indeed Alex.

45
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,256
Wow, that's... that's awesome.

46
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,858
Thanks Mr. Tillison,
to be honest,

47
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,194
I was getting kinda worried.

48
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,595
What?

49
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,098
What are you worried about?
You've got the goods.

50
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,133
You're the kind of kid
they're looking for.

51
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,202
You have nothing to worry about.

52
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,474
I don't know how
you manage to resist the urge

53
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,143
to do some of that stupid stuff
Mike was talking about.

54
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,679
You know, the stuff
that kids our age do.

55
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,881
Yeah I guess some of it
is fun, right?

56
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,018
Some of it
is pretty stupid though.

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,819
Like, I've heard of these kids

58
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,890
were drinking hand sanitizer
because of the alcohol content.

59
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,427
That is definitely not bright.

60
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,999
You're gonna go do
those runs for your ma'?

61
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,801
Yeah, mhm.

62
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,038
She must be proud of you, huh?

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,806
Yeah, I guess so.

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,043
What do you mean you guess?

65
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,046
Yes, she's proud.

66
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,181
I mean,

67
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,649
she didn't really
graduate high school,

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,886
so I'd be the first one in the
family to go to college.

69
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,087
Oh.

70
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,357
- Well, what are you doing later?
- Me and Marcy

71
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,591
are going to the mall.

72
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,995
Ah, cool, cool. Well, I'll shoot
you a call then?

73
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,830
- Alright.
- Bye

74
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,837
and my goal is to pursue
<i>the dual majors of math</i>

75
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,505
<i>and physics.</i>

76
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,409
<i>- My...
- Where are you going homeboy?</i>

77
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,347
- I don't want any problems man.
- Who said anything about problems?

78
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,283
We're just talking,
you know what I'm saying?

79
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,785
So where are you headed to,
church boy?

80
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm just going home, man.

81
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,589
I like your bike.

82
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,092
Yeah, I like it too. -Oh so,
you're a smart ass, huh?

83
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,194
I never did like your punk ass.

84
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,296
- What's up Alex?
- Hey.

85
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,898
Stop messing with him, man.

86
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,467
I said let it go.

87
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,205
Keep hitting them books, Alex.

88
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,407
Why are you always backing
that chump up, dog?

89
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,676
Because he's smart,
unlike your dumb ass.

90
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,129
<i>I've been in love with
mathematics since I was a child.</i>

91
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,065
<i>My dad gave me an abacus
for a birthday present</i>

92
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,733
<i>when I was four.</i>

93
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,970
<i>And ever since then...</i>

94
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,174
<i>I intend to dedicate my time...</i>

95
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:54,746
<i>intellect and energy
to the pursuit of um...</i>

96
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,815
<i>The pursuit of what? Of...</i>

97
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,885
<i>The pursuit of uh...</i>

98
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,333
Mom, what is she saying?

99
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,737
She wants to pair you up
with her niece.

100
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,107
Oh.

101
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,178
Um...

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,548
Well, I dropped the gowns off
at Ms. Mendoza's.

103
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,686
Can I get 20 bucks?

104
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,889
For a book, I need a book.

105
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,891
Another book?

106
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,128
Yeah mom, another book.
I like books.

107
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,199
- Thanks.
- And now go.

108
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,067
Go okay? Because
I have lots of work to do.

109
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,969
Okay.

110
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,331
I know, that was so cool.

111
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,765
I know...

112
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,634
- Shit, I have to go.
- Flora.

113
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,572
Flora open the door.

114
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,942
Flora open the damn door!

115
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,782
What are you doing?

116
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,354
You know? I pride myself
a pretty smart guy.

117
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,889
But when it comes to you, these
days

118
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,757
I have no clue
what you're doing.

119
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,359
You know?
We don't ask you to do much!

120
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,128
The day you make your own money
is when you call your own shots!

121
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,930
But until then
you're under my roof!

122
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,999
This is the ultimate low!

123
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,139
- He's just telling me to do...
- Look at it!

124
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,941
Shores, to pick up
after my brother, to pick up...

125
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,943
- Go on, look at it!
- To be home by 11...

126
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,578
You chose...

127
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,647
<i>God, he is so annoying,
I just hate hearing his voice.</i>

128
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,916
To put the
family's private affairs online

129
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,251
so everybody can comment on it!

130
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,220
He never listens to me,
he just tells me

131
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,288
to do stupid shit!

132
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,662
You don't have any idea
how serious this is, do you?

133
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,163
I'm talking to you, flora!

134
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,332
I hear you, I hear you.

135
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,902
- Well, then say something.
- I ain't got nothing to say.

136
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,671
That's the best you can do?

137
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,750
We've given you
everything you want.

138
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,321
And you thank us by putting
this crap

139
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,089
on the Internet.

140
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,326
I don't understand you.

141
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,130
Yeah, I know, you don't

142
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,499
and the drugs.

143
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,969
If I catch you coming home
wasted,

144
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,037
one more time...

145
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,643
You're grounded flora.

146
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,379
Have fun spending the next
few days without these.

147
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,140
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,351
Got anything else?
I'm ready to party.

149
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,255
- Uh!
- Are we ready for this?

150
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,991
Yeah - let's do this thing.

151
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,699
His ways are not our ways.

152
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,669
His thoughts are not our
thoughts.

153
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,205
But as the heavens are above us

154
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,408
his wisdom is high.

155
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,845
And his will at the end is
always

156
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,682
full of goodness and grace.

157
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,886
Joseph, the son of Jacob
in the old testament reading,

158
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,690
had to suffer for a long time

159
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,292
as a slave in a foreign land.

160
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:40,498
He had to wait for god to decide for
him to be the second man of Egypt.

161
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,868
He had to wait

162
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,870
to understand.

163
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,906
His wisdom.

164
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,275
At times,

165
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,578
we can only discover and
appreciate

166
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,949
his boundless wisdom and love

167
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,953
through the gift of hindsight.

168
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,022
This is the word of the lord.

169
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,791
Amen.

170
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,836
Hey

171
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,170
good to see you again.

172
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,941
- Hey, how is it going?
- Good, good.

173
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,843
How many did we serve today?

174
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,180
168. I'll double check though,
if you want.

175
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,915
Wow, we just keep getting

176
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,684
more and more people
every week, don't we?

177
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:33,952
Yeah.

178
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,854
We're going to have to ask god
to figure out

179
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,856
how to expand this program,
I think.

180
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,731
So, how's the college hunt
going?

181
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,935
So far so good. Yeah.

182
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,938
I'm just waiting on my letter to
confirm my interview to Cal tech.

183
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,707
- That's really fantastic.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,443
Cal tech would be be
a great school for you.

185
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,712
I mean, it should have
been here by now, but...

186
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,782
- I'm just going to...
- Oh come on, be patient.

187
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,284
Your dad would be very proud
of you.

188
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,554
- I know your mom is.
- Yeah, I think she is.

189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,323
Well, if you need anything more
from me, you know,

190
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,825
like another letter of
recommendation.

191
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,860
- Anything.
- Thanks father.

192
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,431
I think this looks good.

193
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,434
Mrs. Rosa,

194
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,171
oh my goodness.

195
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,174
This is so beautiful,
I don't even know what to say.

196
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,708
Oh, you're welcome.

197
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,343
Thank you, thank you so much.

198
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,313
You and Alex are going to
look just perfect.

199
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,248
You need to look good for your
prom.

200
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,552
But maybe fix this a little bit.

201
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,154
There, so it doesn't fall off.

202
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,356
Mom, guys. Guys it came!

203
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,091
- Hey knock.
- I'm sorry.

204
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,860
There's a young lady
getting undress here.

205
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,263
I'm sorry. I'm just a little
excited.

206
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,999
- It came.
- Ok, now you could look.

207
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,002
The letter. It came,
the interview letter, I got it.

208
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,610
Oh, that took forever.

209
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,111
It did.

210
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,081
I wasn't that nervous...

211
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,084
You were too, you were
terrified.

212
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,053
Ok.

213
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,289
All right, I was slightly
terrified.

214
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,191
That's it.

215
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,194
Wow, Cal tech.

216
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,998
You're gonna be...
You're gonna be really busy.

217
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,203
I probably won't even see
you much once you enroll.

218
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,138
No, not at all,

219
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm sure I'll be down every
weekend.

220
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,380
It's a big week for you next
week.

221
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,117
Yes it is.

222
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,821
I'm looking forward to every
minute of it.

223
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,789
I know you are.

224
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,830
My dad should be here for this,
you know?

225
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,234
He was just a poor
construction worker.

226
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,305
He worked so hard
for everything that he had.

227
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,809
I want to be more like him,
you know?

228
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,015
It would be great
if he was here, that's all.

229
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,683
Hey.

230
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,552
He is here, Alex.

231
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,258
That's my sister.

232
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,560
- Alright.
- Ok.

233
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,364
- I'll talk to you later, all right?
- Yeah.

234
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,700
- Congrats again.
- Thanks.

235
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,596
Ok, ok.

236
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,732
Damn it Lacey!

237
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,334
- This better not be...
- Raj, what's up bro?

238
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,237
Hi.

239
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,539
What are you doing in Denver?

240
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,808
Just came to camp out for
a few days on our way to L.A.

241
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,212
What?

242
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,913
Yeah, you heard me.
Me and the crew

243
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,050
stopped here to pay you
a visit. It is ok, right?

244
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,352
- Let me talk to you a minute.
- I'll be right back.

245
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,222
This is nuts.

246
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:08,192
- Man, I'm so hungry.
- Me too and I have to pee.

247
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,629
I'm so fucking exhausted. -God,
hype better not fuck this up.

248
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,464
This is complete bull shit.

249
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,104
Alright look, we are allowed
here for a few days

250
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,939
but I mean,
we got to keep quiet.

251
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,208
- They got a new kid and...
- Fuck that, I've got to pee.

252
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,277
I'm hungry.

253
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,781
I'm hungry too.

254
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,553
<i>This I believe is
an opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

255
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,289
<i>And I intend to make
the most of it.</i>

256
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,259
And finally
I'd like to state that my

257
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,995
academic interests
are foremost in my mind.

258
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:50,301
My desire is to dedicate
everything I have

259
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:54,605
to the pursuit of a doctorate
in the field of physics.

260
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,107
Thank you.

261
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,614
It was a very impressive
presentation Mr. Reyes.

262
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,150
Thank you sir.

263
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,152
Do you have any more
questions for Mr. Reyes?

264
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,154
I have a couple of questions.

265
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,223
Your father's occupation is...

266
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,992
He's deceased.

267
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,596
He was in um... development.

268
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,032
Construction.

269
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,601
- Architecture.
- I see.

270
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,270
Sorry for your loss,
and your mother?

271
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,274
She's in the fashion industry.

272
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,343
Thank you.

273
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,126
Mr. Reyes! Mr. Reyes!

274
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,695
Mr. Reyes.

275
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,066
Mr. Reyes. I am so glad
I caught up with you.

276
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,968
- Is there a problem?
- No, no problem.

277
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,570
We just need one more thing
for your application.

278
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,372
Okay, what's that?

279
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,974
Proof of U.S. citizenship,

280
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,742
a birth certificate, a passport?

281
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,043
Either one.

282
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,581
Eh, ok, I'll get that to you.

283
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,252
Yes, just send me an email

284
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:18,389
and by the way,
you did great in there.

285
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,158
It's looking really good.

286
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,226
- I have to go.
- Ok.

287
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,673
It went well.

288
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,123
I am so proud of you.

289
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,193
I know.

290
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,937
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.

291
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,077
Mom, they want us
to get proof of citizenship.

292
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,413
They need to see a birth
certificate.

293
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,481
Do I have one?

294
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,717
Because I've never seen it.

295
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,656
I knew this day would come.

296
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,159
What day mom?
What are you talking about?

297
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,994
Your father and I,

298
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,363
we brought you when you were
just a couple of months old.

299
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,370
Alex, I prayed for you everyday.

300
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,608
I prayed that this
won't get in your way.

301
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,879
Don't cry mom, please.

302
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,853
English mom, English.

303
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,660
His company, they were
going to sponsor him and us.

304
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,596
And then he just died so
suddenly

305
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,765
and it just never happened.

306
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,746
It's going to be alright mom.

307
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,548
I'll think of something.

308
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,518
A birth certificate?

309
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,288
Mom...

310
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,724
I'll get around all of it, ok?

311
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,394
It's just frustrating when you
think one thing the entire time...

312
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,463
- Calm down.
- I'm calm, aren't I?

313
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,768
Look, this birth certificate
issue

314
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,371
could become a major roadblock.

315
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,506
Yeah, yeah, I know.

316
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,676
Immigration,

317
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,578
being undocumented,
birth certificates

318
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,247
it's all I've thought about
for the past 24 hours now.

319
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,987
I just assumed that I was born
here.

320
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,025
Now finding out
that none of us are legal.

321
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,895
We're going to have to
figure out your options.

322
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,164
They're offering me a full ride.

323
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,436
I told them that my father
was an architectural engineer.

324
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,739
That my mom was a...

325
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,975
Designer in the fashion
industry. You know my parents.

326
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,710
I do.

327
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,947
And your father was a proud
construction worker

328
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,215
who loved you.

329
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,886
And Rosa, your mom is a...

330
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,955
Proud seamstress?

331
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,824
I was going to say "Saint".

332
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,965
I lied about who my parents are.

333
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,237
That's how bad that I wanted
this thing.

334
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,305
Don't ever do that again.

335
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,176
Ok?

336
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,412
Yes sir.

337
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,352
Hi.

338
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,020
Do you guys have any
spare change?

339
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,922
We're just trying
to get some food.

340
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,764
Thank you so much.
Thank you, have a good one.

341
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,436
How come they keep
giving you money?

342
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,504
Girl, it's the innocent face.

343
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,409
Alright, let's call it a day,
I'm tired

344
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,746
alright.

345
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,560
God, I hate this begging shit.

346
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,728
It's what we gotta do?

347
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,699
I'm just saying, it was a lot
easier when I was back home.

348
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,367
Duh!

349
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,207
I like you flora.
How old are you?

350
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,975
18 April third.

351
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,344
No shit, really?

352
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,346
I thought you were like 20 or
21.

353
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,081
Not yet.

354
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,750
- What about you Gloria?
- I just turned 23.

355
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,387
How long have you been living
in Venice beach?

356
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,523
Just a year.

357
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,859
It's alright most of the time.

358
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,027
Before that I was in east L.A.

359
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,463
But I'm from a small town
outside Jalisco, Mexico.

360
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,435
I have never been to Mexico.

361
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,904
I wish I could go sometimes.

362
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,973
I really miss
my grandmother's cooking.

363
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,078
It sounds like an adventure.

364
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,014
We've got an adventure right
here.

365
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,750
I don't know.

366
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:24,255
Sure, California it's warm
and the beaches are beautiful

367
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:27,791
but we're not doing anything.

368
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,560
What is there to do

369
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,897
I mean, we hang,
we party, we get loaded.

370
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,798
That's what we do.

371
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,504
I don't know.

372
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,948
Yo.

373
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,400
Where's all the food?

374
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,670
We need more supplies,
we're running short.

375
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,239
No shit, anybody got any money?

376
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,674
No.

377
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,208
No, we're broke.

378
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,121
Get more beer

379
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,823
lots of beer.

380
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,214
My sister says she will gladly
drive us wherever we want to go.

381
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,851
It's prom night,
she knows what that means.

382
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:04,388
And she thinks you're cool.

383
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,823
She does?

384
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,392
Yes silly.

385
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:11,195
We like smart guys over here.

386
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:14,198
So, I guess I'll be seeing you
at 7:00 tonight?

387
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,468
Yeah, I just have to pick up
your corsage and I'll be there.

388
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,370
Ok, great.

389
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,038
We're going to look so cool.

390
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,140
Yeah, I can't wait.

391
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,975
Alright, see you tonight.

392
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,107
What's up Alex?

393
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,777
It's my bike man, someone took
it.

394
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,345
What happened?

395
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,349
I went in the house for 2
seconds and my bike got jacked.

396
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,419
I don't know man, I wasn't gone
for more than five seconds.

397
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,589
We'll get your bike back.

398
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,625
You think so? You can do that?

399
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,360
Maybe.

400
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,263
I need to ask you a favor, man.

401
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,231
I'm supposed to pick up
a corsage at the flower shop

402
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,701
down on central, before they
close.

403
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,469
I was going to take the bike,
but...

404
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,073
- Corsage?
- Yeah, tonight's my prom.

405
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,108
Oh yeah, prom night.

406
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,210
Yeah man, you should've
told me. Come on in.

407
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,722
Thanks, I'll be right back.

408
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,472
- Got it.
- Alright, you ready?

409
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:04,308
Yeah man.
I appreciate this so much.

410
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,643
Don't worry about it.

411
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,647
How's your mom?

412
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,850
She's good.

413
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,018
She must be really proud of you.

414
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,456
Everybody keeps saying that, man
I...

415
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm just trying to make,
the best of myself, you know?

416
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,763
Give me a second. Hello?

417
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,232
What's up dawg?

418
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,236
Yeah actually, you know what?
I'm pretty close.

419
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,707
Ah okay. Yeah, don't trip.

420
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,442
Yeah, that's cool.

421
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,546
Hey um, I'm going to make
a quick pit stop.

422
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,848
- It's on the way.
- Yeah, no problem.

423
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,517
Alright.

424
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,871
- I'll be right back.
- Alright.

425
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,704
- Sorry for the delay, dawg.
- That's all good.

426
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,006
I'll get you back home
in no time, just a few minutes.

427
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,428
Why do you think those guys
always pick on me, man?

428
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,165
You know what?
You know what it is?

429
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,768
I think they're jealous of you,
Alex.

430
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,437
I think they're envious.

431
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,140
I think they hate what they
can't be, you know what I mean?

432
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,211
Maybe they wish they were
as smart as you.

433
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,647
Deep inside, you know?

434
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,651
- It just sucks, man.
- Yeah, you know.

435
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,820
It's part of growing up.

436
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,067
Oh shit.

437
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,062
That's all? Check this.

438
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,568
Let's go.

439
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,323
Detective, I promise.
I had no idea about any drugs.

440
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,994
I was getting a ride
to the florist for prom and...

441
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,930
and that's it. -We've been
through that already Mr. Reyes.

442
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,833
The fact is that the car

443
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,701
you were driving
contained drugs.

444
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,104
Okay? And that makes you
an accessory.

445
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,139
I'm sorry to say.

446
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,142
I was just getting a lift.

447
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,880
Yeah, so you say.

448
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,916
Actually your buddy, Jose.

449
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,985
Jose Quintero, right?

450
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,422
He backs up your story.

451
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,258
He said that you had no knowledge
of the drugs and that they were his

452
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,694
and that he was giving you
a ride to the flower shop.

453
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,865
It appears that we have

454
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,533
a bit of a problem
in our hands Mr. Reyes.

455
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,370
See, you're not showing up
in any of our data bases.

456
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,607
Is almost as if you don't exist.

457
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,409
On paper, anyways.

458
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:08,712
They, that can't be right, eh...

459
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,948
What does that mean?

460
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,652
That means we're going to be holding
you over for immigration services.

461
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,854
What? That's not fair.

462
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,993
Yeah, I'm sorry kid. You won't
be getting out tonight.

463
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,578
Gloria Hernandez.

464
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,715
Gloria Hernandez.

465
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,784
- That's you right?
- Yeah, that's me.

466
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,119
Up!

467
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,622
Am I getting out?

468
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,397
- This way.
- Where are we going?

469
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,135
This officer is from
immigration.

470
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,370
Immigration? -You're now
remanded to their custody.

471
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,372
- Have a good day.
- No, there has been a mistake.

472
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,673
You're Gloria Hernandez, right?

473
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,842
Wait, wait, there has just been
a huge mix-up.

474
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,177
- Come on, let's go.
- There is a huge mistake.

475
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,812
- Have a good day.
- Come on, let's go.

476
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,814
No, please.

477
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,760
Hello.

478
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,829
Alex?

479
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,565
Slow down Alex,
just slow down, slow down.

480
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,100
Tell me that again.

481
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,868
<i>I was arrested
for possession of drugs.</i>

482
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,005
I was just getting a ride
from this guy that I know.

483
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,741
<i>I had no idea about
any drugs, I swear to you.</i>

484
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,776
I believe you.

485
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,280
They're give me
to immigration services today.

486
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:26,716
I don't know what to do.
Father, I'm scared.

487
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,886
<i>We're going to get through
this together, okay?</i>

488
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,056
Please let my mom know
that I'm alright.

489
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,525
And I'll see her soon.

490
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,127
I hope.

491
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,795
You will

492
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,631
<i>you will see her soon,
I promise you that.</i>

493
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,800
Don't let her come see me
either, because...

494
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,404
well they could take her too.

495
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,139
Yeah.

496
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,640
Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.

497
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,676
Thank you father.

498
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,466
Sit down.

499
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,768
Listen to me.

500
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,237
We're trying to help you,

501
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,939
we want what's going to work out
best for both of us.

502
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,675
Read the form before you sign
it.

503
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,746
You can read it, right?

504
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,188
No, I'm not going to sign this.

505
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,523
I can't voluntarily deport
myself, there's no way.

506
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,459
You don't have a choice!

507
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,662
You were caught with a substantial
quantity of narcotics.

508
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:48,598
I keep telling you guys,
they were not mine!

509
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,867
You were in the car with drugs!

510
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,469
They may as well
have been in your pockets.

511
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:55,939
Listen, we don't have a lot of
time to screw around with this.

512
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,275
You're either going to be
incarcerated here,

513
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,777
or walk free in Mexico.

514
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,679
Your home.

515
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,648
This is my home.

516
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,716
Not anymore pal.

517
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,653
I want a lawyer then.

518
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,554
You want a trial?

519
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,457
We're gonna you a speedy one.
Get him out of here.

520
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,593
- Here your honor.
- Thank you Julie.

521
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,665
Excuse me.

522
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,034
- Are Mr. James Epian?
- Yes sir.

523
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,469
Sir, I'm father Roberts... -You're
gonna need to step behind...

524
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,506
I understand that, I was told to talk
to you in regards of Alejandro Reyes.

525
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,508
- He had a 2:00 hearing.
- I'm sorry, you're late.

526
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,343
He has been deported.

527
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,645
He's been what?

528
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,649
Mr. James, please take your
conversation out into the hall.

529
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,252
Yes, your honor.
Let's step outside.

530
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,920
Alejandro Reyes

531
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,488
had a 2:00 hearing.

532
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,257
That's 40 minutes from now.

533
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,426
So, let me get this straight.
You're telling me that

534
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,395
for some unexplainable reason
his hearing got moved up?

535
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,264
And for some
other unexplainable reason

536
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:57,267
he is now on
a deportation bus to Mexico?

537
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,302
Do I have that right?

538
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,105
That is correct.

539
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,542
That's all you have to say?

540
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,178
Mr. James,
how the hell did this happen?

541
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,613
Shit happens, padre.

542
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,183
Our docket's overbooked.

543
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,218
Work load is crazy. There's...

544
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,520
Too few people here
doing too many things.

545
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,556
So?

546
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,958
So, sometimes things
slip through the cracks.

547
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,594
Which is what happened
with your Mr. Reyes.

548
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,598
Sorry, we're not dealing
with the perfect system here.

549
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
Slipped through the cracks?

550
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:35,438
Ok, the fact remains, this kid,
this very good, very loving kid

551
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,407
is right now on a bus to Mexico.

552
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,743
A country he's never been to,
by the way.

553
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:42,879
Without having any due process,
without having a lawyer!

554
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,815
You're the a.D.A. Mr. James! What the
hell are you going to do about it?

555
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:49,953
I'm going to go back into that
court room and do my job.

556
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,488
Sorry about the screw up, padre.

557
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,824
- Don't you walk away from me.
- Get your hands off me.

558
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,893
You don't want
an assault charge, do you?

559
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,132
Look, getting mad at me is not
going to solve your problem.

560
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,568
You have a lawyer?

561
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,339
Yes, we do now.

562
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,641
Well I suggest you file an
appeal.

563
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,343
- We will.
- Well good luck with that.

564
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:16,312
Look father, your job is saving
souls.

565
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,748
Mine is deporting people.

566
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,017
So far I think I'm winning on
points.

567
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,555
And by the way, this was a drug
case.

568
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,658
Your guy got off easy.

569
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,295
Yeah, I'll pray for your soul
Mr. James!

570
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,696
Have a nice day!

571
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,301
Watch your step.

572
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,953
<i>Hi, you know what to do...</i>

573
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,055
Hype, call me back,
I'm in fucking Mexico

574
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,690
and this shit is not cool!

575
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,796
Hey, my name is Alex.

576
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,698
We were on the
same bus together.

577
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,767
Lucky you.

578
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,803
I just heard you speaking
English.

579
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,106
It was nice to hear,
my Spanish is horrible.

580
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,174
Yeah, so is mine.

581
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,311
Well, what's your name?

582
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,446
My name is Gloria, what's up?

583
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,816
What are you doing down here?

584
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:36,219
It's a long story,
and I'd love to tell you

585
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,388
but I'm trying to get up out of
here.

586
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,290
So, bye.

587
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,981
Eh...

588
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,083
Alex Reyes.

589
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,118
Alex Reyes.

590
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,857
I'm sorry, I don't speak
Spanish.

591
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,694
Okay.

592
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,863
The dormitory is at the end.

593
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,299
We serve two meals for three
days.

594
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,935
After three days, you're on
your own.

595
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,203
You cannot stay here.

596
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,806
I don't speak...

597
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,576
Hey, how's it going?

598
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,077
Oh just wonderful. How
do you think I'm doing?

599
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,646
- Stuck here in hell.
- Woah.

600
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,582
It's a question, alright?

601
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,252
Forget it.

602
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,756
Wait.

603
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,194
It's just been a rough day.

604
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,230
What's up?

605
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,932
Not much.

606
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,702
I'm just going to get some money
exchanged so I can call my mom.

607
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,006
What about you?

608
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,108
My friends are coming for me,
though.

609
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,613
That's great.

610
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,548
I'm not worried.

611
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,391
Okay, maybe I'll see you later
then.

612
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:46,169
- What?
- That guy, he...

613
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,104
is making trouble to you?

614
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,873
Oh no.

615
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,710
Good.

616
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,680
What's your name.

617
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,149
- Glo.
- Glo?

618
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,084
Beautiful name Glo.

619
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,189
Hey.

620
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,324
You wanna go hang out
with my friends?

621
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,262
Sure.

622
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,562
Come on mom, pick up.

623
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,798
Come on, pick up mom.

624
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,472
Mom, it's me.

625
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:02,011
I'm in Mexico. I'm ok though.

626
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,281
Don't worry, ok?

627
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,977
Hello? Hello?

628
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,913
<i>- Mom?
- Alex!</i>

629
00:49:43,915 --> 00:49:45,414
Alex, how are you?

630
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,316
I'm ok.

631
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,151
Where are you Alex?

632
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,188
<i>I'm staying in a shelter.</i>

633
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,858
- A shelter?
- I'm alright, ok?

634
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,662
No mom, not at all.

635
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,832
I want you to go
and stay with my sister.

636
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,500
Your sister?

637
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,603
Your Tia Perlita.
Remember I told you about her?

638
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,573
She lives in Juarez, I want you
to go and stay with her.

639
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:13,576
- No, I should be ok here.
- No, no.

640
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:16,178
You won't be ok, I want you to
go and stay with Tia Perla...

641
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,247
Mom, a bus ride to Juarez...

642
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,417
It's a long way.

643
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,285
I don't have much money, so...

644
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:26,255
I'll send you the money.
<i>I'll send you her address</i>

645
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:30,059
and the money in western union,
<i>ok?</i>

646
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,727
It will make me feel much
better.

647
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:35,197
Stop worrying about me, ok?
I can take care of myself.

648
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,233
I miss you so much.

649
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:40,202
I want you to let
father Roberts and the attorney

650
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,405
take care of everything.

651
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,240
Alright?

652
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:47,209
Just stay out of it
as much as possible, ok?

653
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,782
I love you too.

654
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,154
Thank you.-

655
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:10,459
<i>this is the worst place
in the world, it's horrible.</i>

656
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,028
Father, I'm loosing it out here.

657
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,897
I understand son.

658
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,466
No, I don't think you do, okay?

659
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:21,537
You're not the one getting jumped out
here in the middle of the street.

660
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,205
I'm...

661
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,909
I'm sorry.

662
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:30,579
<i>I've got a top notch immigration
attorney</i> working on this.

663
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:33,883
He's a...
He feels pretty good about it.

664
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:36,051
<i>A lot of grandstanding</i>

665
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:38,120
but again, he feels confident.

666
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,657
Father, there's something else.

667
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,660
<i>I'm going to need a couple of
bucks</i>

668
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,729
<i>to go to my aunt's house
in Juarez.</i>

669
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,832
<i>Of course.
I'll send you some tonight.</i>

670
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,433
Thank you father.

671
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:27,336
I got to ask, what
the hell are you doing here?

672
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,207
- It's kind of a long story.
- Aren't they all?

673
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,745
- Did you get into a fight there Rambo?
- It wasn't much of a fight.

674
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:39,648
They got me coming out
of the western union building.

675
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,483
It figures.

676
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:43,552
They spot you guys a mile away,
huh?

677
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,156
You're lucky they just took
your money.

678
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:50,593
- So, tell me Marron.
- My name is Alex,

679
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,861
so, tell me Alex.

680
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,397
What are you going to do?

681
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,800
I think I'm going to stay with my
mom's sister in Juarez, but...

682
00:53:57,802 --> 00:54:01,604
Juarez? No cabron.
That's even worse.

683
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:04,240
When you're down here in Mexico,

684
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:07,176
you have to be extra careful
to everything you do here.

685
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,679
Unfortunately it's being overrun
right now by

686
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:14,149
evil dangerous people who will kill you
just for stepping on their shadow.

687
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,684
And they're not fucking around.
Listen,

688
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,456
I've seen kids from the states
come down here and get stuck

689
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:24,193
chewed up, spit out in a matter
of days.

690
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:26,528
- Be very careful Alex.
- I will.

691
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,924
Hi, is Perla Ortiz, does she
live here?

692
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,402
I'm looking for my aunt Perla
Ortiz.

693
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,072
She moved out.

694
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,909
So, do you know where she lives
now?

695
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,150
Thank you.

696
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,845
I was just visiting my aunt.

697
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,790
That's all I have.

698
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,591
I don't understand what you're
saying.

699
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,302
I was just in Juarez to visit
my aunt.

700
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,476
Excuse me, can I stay here
tonight?

701
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,712
We're all filled up tonight,
man.

702
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:08,750
I don't have any
other place to go, though.

703
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:11,920
Lo siento Marron, but that's how
it is tonight, can't help you man.

704
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,828
Mira, come back tomorrow.

705
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,599
I'll see what we can do, but
I'm not making any promises.

706
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,133
Ok?

707
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,270
- Thank you sir.
- Rudy.

708
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,172
Call me Rudy.

709
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,084
What?

710
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,724
Hey, you didn't
come to kill us, did you?

711
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,794
No.

712
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:35,864
Get in man, it's cold here.
Come on, sit down.

713
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,736
Sit down, sit down.

714
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:47,876
Good you don't come to kill us
because I'm just too tired

715
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:52,514
to deal with life and the
struggles tonight, yeah.

716
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:54,650
But I had to ask you, you know?

717
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,786
Yeah.

718
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,056
Here, this will take the chill
down.

719
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,326
So,

720
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:09,131
did you get lost or something?

721
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,370
I guess you could say that.

722
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:19,141
Relax, huh? We don't get
too many visitors here.

723
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,077
Yeah.

724
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,614
We were just talking about
going across the border.

725
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:28,717
Just to kill a vato.

726
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,324
Let me guess, you're hungry,
huh?

727
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,043
Thank you.

728
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,354
So, Alex.

729
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,694
How the hell did you end up
down here with us?

730
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,837
I was on my way to my senior
prom,

731
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,908
next thing you know
I'm getting deported.

732
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,011
Well,

733
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,614
being deported

734
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,683
is a peach.

735
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,287
I know about that first hand.

736
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,523
I just got to get back home.

737
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,529
I've been across three times.

738
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,967
Three times, really?

739
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:54,603
I crossed over in a train once.

740
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,043
In a train? How?

741
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,280
The trains that go out of
Nogales,

742
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,785
they've got these sleeve-like
things,

743
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,387
in the undercarriage, right?

744
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:15,323
A man can squeeze himself
into that thing.

745
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:18,660
And take a 35-mile ride
into the U.S.A.

746
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,228
Woosh.

747
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,134
Is it dangerous?

748
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:33,041
Is it dangerous?

749
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,313
Damn right it's dangerous.

750
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:42,184
If you slip, just one tiny
little bit.

751
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,352
You can...

752
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,488
You can kiss your ass goodbye.

753
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,763
I wouldn't recommend it.

754
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,951
I don't even look
like the same guy anymore.

755
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,191
That's because you're a
different guy.

756
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,033
No, I don't drink.

757
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,806
I think you're doing a lot
of things you never did before.

758
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:39,875
Come on.

759
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,828
Welcome to the club, kid.

760
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,678
Hey.

761
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,614
Thanks for being...

762
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,683
Just friendly and nice.

763
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,054
Why not?

764
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,357
All the rough.

765
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,661
This world's a rough place.

766
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,699
No need for everyone
to be an asshole.

767
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,372
You should get some rest, kid.

768
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,542
You've got lot ahead of you.

769
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,435
I used to work in a kitchen
in California.

770
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,906
- Yeah, yeah, what else?
- Well, you're shorthanded

771
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:26,975
I can help out where you need
it.

772
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,079
I don't have any money,
I cannot pay you.

773
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:34,416
I just need a place to crash
for a few more days.

774
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:38,086
It's free labor,
I'll help out both meals

775
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:40,922
take some pressure off of you.

776
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:42,390
I don't have to be on the count

777
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,459
I'll sleep in the closet
if that's what you need.

778
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,797
Ok, look, we'll talk later.

779
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,633
- Ok?
- Ok, I'll be back.

780
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,835
Oh, I know you will.

781
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:07,849
So, you're still here?

782
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,918
It looks like it.

783
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,355
- So are you.
- Yeah.

784
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,197
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Why are you judging me?

785
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,798
No, I'm not. I was just...

786
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,835
What do you or anybody else
care about what happens to me?

787
01:08:26,837 --> 01:08:30,238
Look, I'm sorry ok?
If you think I offended you,

788
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,508
but I care alright? I do care.

789
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,711
You like me,
we don't belong in this place.

790
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,313
We could die at any minute and
no one

791
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,782
this side of the border
would give a damn, ok?

792
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,623
Look I got jumped last time that
I saw you.

793
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,360
Alright?

794
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,663
I just thought that maybe...

795
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,399
We watch each other's back so...

796
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:00,668
How are you going to watch my
back?

797
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,036
You can't even
look after yourself.

798
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,475
- I'm just saying...
- Look.

799
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:11,246
I don't need you or anybody
else worrying about me.

800
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:13,882
I can take care of myself.

801
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,490
Thank you.

802
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,926
Save your breath, Marron.

803
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,928
A girl like her,

804
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,930
she has all the answers.

805
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,965
You know?

806
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,269
I've seen it over and over
before.

807
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:41,776
Worry about yourself. Worry
about yourself.

808
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,579
Alright.

809
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,221
We're at the court house now.

810
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:55,123
So how does it look?

811
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:58,293
The president signed
a new executive order

812
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,795
<i>we got a petition, we've got
your academic records,</i>

813
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:04,732
<i>we got the letter
of intent from Cal tech.</i>

814
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,135
So how soon do we think?

815
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,637
I don't know kid.

816
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:12,907
<i>The government is really
playing hard ball here.</i>

817
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,544
They uh, they seem to think you're
some kind of a career criminal

818
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,480
they're acting like we're crazy
cuz we're standing up for you.

819
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,316
I just don't know what to do.

820
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,084
<i>Look, just know that we are
doing</i>

821
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,054
everything that we possibly can
to bring you home.

822
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,956
I know, I know.

823
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,928
Look, Paul Tillison is here
speaking on your behalf,

824
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:37,165
he'd like to...
He'd like to talk to you.

825
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,199
Ok?

826
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,169
- Here he is.
<i>- Hey Alex.</i>

827
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,204
<i>So sorry this is happening to
you.</i>

828
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:48,109
You, I just want you to know
that we're all pulling for you.

829
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,779
The petition has almost
400 names on it so far, so...

830
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,548
That's great.

831
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,151
Yeah, uh...
You know, don't give up.

832
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,321
Hang in there.

833
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,178
Welcome home. Next!

834
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,749
Hi, I came down here with a couple
friends last week to party and...

835
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:05,253
We got separated and they ended
up coming back without me.

836
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:07,388
People that I was staying with
stole my wallet or something

837
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,693
so I don't even have my ID on
me, but I live in Los Angeles

838
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,728
and I'm gonna graduate
in a couple of weeks or so...

839
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,064
- What's your name?
- Alex Reyes.

840
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,946
I thought you had crossed
back over or something,

841
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,748
not yet.

842
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,816
I'm working on it, though.

843
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,420
Man you...

844
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,422
you look like you've been...

845
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:16,491
through it, huh?

846
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,327
Yeah, I have.

847
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,599
I tried to cross and ended up
in the detention center.

848
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,240
I was able to take a couple
showers,

849
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,543
toothpaste and deodorant.

850
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,781
The one thing that...

851
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:42,150
food here at the shelter
is way better than over there.

852
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,520
I find that hard to believe,
huh?

853
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,588
No, seriously.

854
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,395
Do you think that I may
be able to work in the kitchen?

855
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,935
Sure, why not. Come on in.

856
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,381
Now don't touch anything, I know
where everything is at, ok?

857
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:14,849
Ok.

858
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:16,617
You can sleep over there.

859
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,453
Thanks Rudy, I appreciate this.

860
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,154
No problem, kid.

861
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:23,724
Oh, you know that girl you were
having the argument with?

862
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:25,126
We're not arguing.

863
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,361
No cabron,
you were arguing. Anyway

864
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:29,697
she's been staying at the
shelter for the past few nights.

865
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,700
Really?

866
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:36,571
I think Mexico is beginning
to wear her ass out.

867
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,673
That's not good.

868
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:40,308
The kitchen opens in two hours.

869
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,309
Yeah, I'll be there.

870
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,878
- Hey Rudy.
- Yeah.

871
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,680
How do you speak English so
well?

872
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:47,748
I'm from Tijuana, cabron.

873
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:54,248
Take that and bring some
tortillas.

874
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,183
Take that and come back soon.

875
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,978
You did alright today, huh?

876
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,982
Everything moved just perfect.

877
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,422
Eh, and the line...

878
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,160
the line moved fast.
You were right.

879
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,697
Oh no.

880
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:58,212
Oh...

881
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:04,619
I think that was the first cigarette
I've had since I was like 12.

882
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,053
Ah?

883
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,057
My mom caught me,
she made me eat it.

884
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:11,626
What?

885
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:13,294
Yeah, it was disgusting.

886
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:17,131
Oh cabron, my mother

887
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,533
my mother would give me
cigarettes

888
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:22,370
so she wouldn't have
to smoke alone.

889
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:24,238
She did?

890
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,209
- She was like that, you know?
- Oh man.

891
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,380
And then,

892
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:33,881
with the Tequila shots.

893
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:35,950
No...

894
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,288
That's too much.

895
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,829
I think that's the first time
I've laughed in 2 weeks.

896
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,004
I just hope I don't get stuck
here forever, you know?

897
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,476
You won't.

898
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,608
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi.

899
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,685
- So we're both still here.
- It looks that way.

900
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,058
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

901
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,393
- Got you some water.
- Thanks.

902
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,166
Hey...

903
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,670
I'm sorry about the other night,

904
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:38,706
I didn't mean to bother you.

905
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,609
That's alright.

906
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,614
I thought you were working on a
scheme to get you back home.

907
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,716
No.

908
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,985
No, I...

909
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:53,721
Tried to cross the border,

910
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:55,823
they didn't buy it.

911
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:57,625
Bummer.

912
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,095
Yeah.

913
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,131
How about you? And your people?

914
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,802
No.

915
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:09,870
What are you going to do?

916
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,874
I don't know.

917
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,711
- What are you going to do?
- Something.

918
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:20,815
I've got to get out of here.

919
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,752
Your folks miss you, huh?

920
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,923
My mom does.

921
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:34,161
My dad passed away
when I was pretty small.

922
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,166
It's been me and my mom
for a while.

923
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,169
And you?
I bet your family misses you.

924
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,938
I don't know, I guess.

925
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,073
Can we talk about something else

926
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,274
yeah, sure.

927
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:50,177
I didn't mean to pry.

928
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:54,648
Alex, we need to set up for
dinner.

929
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,119
Are you going
to stay here tonight?

930
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,524
Okay.

931
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,926
I better get back to work, ok?

932
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,557
<i>You have reached</i>

933
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,459
<i>father Roberts' voicemail</i>

934
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,561
<i>he's not available
to take your call right now</i>

935
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,096
<i>please leave a message</i>

936
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:43,938
<i>and he'll return your call
as soon as possible.</i>

937
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,180
I want you to go inside
and meet this guy.

938
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,216
I don't want to go inside.

939
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,987
I take care of you
all this time, now go inside!

940
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,793
Nogales is another one of those
puertas that is out of control.

941
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,362
The cartel has got
that place by the huevos.

942
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:17,031
There is a lot of killing
going on over there.

943
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,999
I'm not going down there
to mess up with the cartel

944
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,201
- i...
- You asked for my advice.

945
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:23,938
I think your scheme is crazy
and is going to get you killed.

946
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,181
If that's what you have to do...

947
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:37,851
Eh?

948
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,689
Think about it very carefully
before you jump.

949
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,163
Hey Rudy.

950
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:51,198
Can I get one more cigarette?

951
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,616
You should've killed me.

952
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:55,796
I'm so sorry.

953
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:01,668
It's my fault.

954
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,239
No.

955
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:09,076
This is all my fault.

956
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,513
My name's not Gloria.

957
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,183
It's flora.

958
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:18,251
I was born in Missouri.

959
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,522
I'm an American citizen.

960
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:29,429
Why?

961
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,968
You're really a citizen?

962
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,607
I just want to go home.

963
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,111
I just really,
really want to go home.

964
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,683
Please, I just want to go home. I
just really, really want to go home.

965
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,058
Let's get you home.

966
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:15,735
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Hendrix?</i>

967
01:31:15,737 --> 01:31:18,138
<i>- Flora's father?
- Yes, who's this?</i>

968
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,608
<i>My name is Alex, I'm calling
you from Tijuana, Mexico.</i>
