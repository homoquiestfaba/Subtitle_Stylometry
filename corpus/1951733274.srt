1
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,760
The peaceful moment.

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,360
It doesn't really exist.

3
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,440
By the time I finish this sentence...

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,160
about seven people around the
world will make a huge mistake.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,800
They call them the Darwin Awards.

6
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
In the late '70s, they started
giving out an award each year...

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,040
for the person who died
in the most idiotic way.

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,080
The idea being, these people's
actions are so moronic...

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,840
they're actually improving the gene
pool by removing themselves from it.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,960
For instance, Trip Hansen, an ad executive...

11
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,440
was showing off his new penthouse office.

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,440
Oh, man. Instant fuck pad.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,360
You lucky bastard.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,960
That glass? Four-ply.

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,880
- Bulletproof.
- Bullshit.

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,600
All right.

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,160
What are you doing?

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,280
Walkin' the talk.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
- No, no, no, no!
- He runs at the window.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
You know, to prove it was shatterproof.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Holy shit!

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Turns out it wasn't.

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,960
Everybody's gotta have a hobby.
For me, it was the Darwin Awards.

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,880
There we are.

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,760
Okay, I guess you could say it
was actually more of an obsession.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,320
But I just couldn't help trying to imagine...

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,760
what type of personality it would
take to meet such strange fates.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,160
Why am I so obsessed with
analyzing personalities?

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
Well, that's my dayjob.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm a criminal profiler
for the S.F.P.D., Homicide.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Hey. Hey. Hey. Stay on
the other side of the tape.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,480
Oh, you got it. You got it.
Behind this tape. Perfect.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,280
That numb-nuts have
clearance to be here?

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,080
The chief said I'd been selected to be
followed around by this documentary filmmaker.

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,560
Said it would be good for P.R.

36
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
Truthfully, hejust seems
like some kid out of college.

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
You know, originally when
you asked about filming me...

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,160
I thought you meant a couple of hours.

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,080
It's been two days.

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,880
Just keep going about your
job as if I'm not here.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Just pretend I'm invisible.

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
This guy was starting to get on my nerves.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,520
What are you eating?

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
- You still here?
- What were you dreaming about?

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Why liquid soap?

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm considered the best profiler on the force.

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
It's a talent that began back in fourth grade.

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
I see a couple problems with your story.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,760
What problem?

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,120
First, you had to have been
in the liquor store alone.

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,720
Second, he was a Seventh-day Adventist...

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,760
so why would he be in the liquor store?

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,040
It's not fair we have to do recess
inside all year 'cause of you.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,680
- Who says I did it?
- You have a problem with authority.

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,600
Miss Fong flunked you in math.

56
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,960
And... the wood chips on the strongbox
matches your Louisville Slugger exactly.

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
You tell Miss Fong, and
it's your ass, Burrows!

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Fourth grade was also the beginning
of another lifelong condition.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,760
- Hematophobia. Fainting
response to the sight ofblood.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,200
My ability to connect the facts...

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,160
never really helped my popularity...

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,080
but at least it provided a job.

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,600
- We got plenty of Polaroids.
- These are digital.

64
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm takin' a extra set. You know, for Burrows.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,560
If that little shit wants to help
out with this investigation...

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,000
let him get his ass down
here just like everybody else.

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
He did. He's outside.

68
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,440
So...

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,320
what made you choose me
for this project anyway?

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,840
You were the only one on the
force who agreed to do it.

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,760
Oh.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,880
Five dead in four weeks.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,320
It seemed like a serial case,
and no one could solve it.

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,760
That meant it fell in my lap.

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,280
- Hi, Bill.
- Okay.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,400
Give me perps under six
feet with size 14 shoes.

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,880
Check the clothing records
at Quentin and Folsom.

78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,560
S.F.P.D. here. Working overtime.

79
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Just ignore the camera.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,400
- It's not all doughnuts and broads.
- Oh, please. Don't encourage him.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Nobody under six feet's gonna have size 14...

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,240
Whoa! Look at this.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,240
At least 378 people do.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,200
Those footprints were
half as deep as the others.

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,760
Guy couldn't have weighed more than 140.

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,920
- Isolate for guys with some college. Lit majors.
- Why?

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Locations of the attacks...
Hughes Laundromat...

88
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
Gates Apartments, Eliot Business College...

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
They're all names of poets.

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,360
Here's your short lit
major cons with big feet.

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
I'd suggest you bring all five of'em in.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,520
This perp's gonna be in deep hiding.

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Criminology 101. Serial killers always
follow the investigation of their crime.

94
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,560
"Hematophobia. Debilitating
disorder, unresponsive to treatment."

95
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,840
Another fuckin' useless book.

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,640
You should leave. Now. Leave.

97
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Police! Follow my command!
Move down here nice and slow.

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Nice and slow. That's it.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,400
- What is this? Cops?
- Get down on your knees!

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,640
Get on your knees! Interlace
your fingers behind your head!

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,400
- Call 911.
- I can't interfere. I have to keep filming.

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,760
- What?
- It's part of the documentary process, man.

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,640
- You have to remain an objective observer.
- You're fucking useless.

104
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,560
Yeah. This is Officer Burrows.

105
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,520
I need immediate backup on
Columbus and Kerouac. Yeah.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Am I gonna have to sign a release?

107
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,640
Shut the fuck up!

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,280
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

109
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,840
"This is the way the world ends.
Not with a bang but a whimper."

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,640
That is the most over-quoted
poem in modern lit.

111
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,560
What? Did you have to memorize that
for your 11 th grade English class?

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,480
Fuck off.

113
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Well, then.

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, my God.

115
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
- Turn it off. Turn it the fuck off!
- Please don't. No, please don't.

116
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,800
Isn't this over? I'm not a cop anymore.

117
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,360
- There's nothing left to film.
- A documentary is like a river.

118
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,280
You follow its natural course until it's...

119
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Oh, just shut up and give
me back the apartment keys.

120
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,320
What are you doin'?

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,760
- If I tell you, will you go away?
- For tonight.

122
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm looking at all the bills I can't pay...

123
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,400
Rent, Visa, electricity, insurance.

124
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay, what's goin'on?

125
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
What's that?

126
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,280
What are you doin'? What's that?

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,880
You can't follow me.

128
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,600
- What did you say this was for?
- Student film.

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,360
It's also a helpful research tool.

130
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Mr. Burrows...

131
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,320
First Fidelity Life and Casualty already has
the most complete profiles in the business.

132
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah, you've got risk profiles for heart
disease, cancer, even drunk driving.

133
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,360
But nothing for these Darwin Award types.

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,240
But you have no experience
in insurance profiles.

135
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
I was the best on the force at personality
profiles... Predicting people's behavior.

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Yeah, but we already have
a full staff of actuaries...

137
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,400
I can tell you what kind
of underwear you're wearing.

138
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,320
- Excuse me?...
- Bikini-cut briefs.

139
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,760
Color? Probably red.

140
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,240
- No, make that black.
- How do you...

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
If that were the case, how would you...

142
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,400
You have pictures of your wife
on your desk, but not of children.

143
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,600
Bikini-cut briefs drastically
reduce a man's fertility.

144
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,280
Being in the insurance industry,
my guess is you're aware of this...

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,120
and your fertility restriction is by design.

146
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,520
Probably 'cause you're having an affair.

147
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Given your age andjob status, there's a
62% chance you're having an affair anyway.

148
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
But the two gifts in your
office make it a certainty.

149
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,440
One from Gump's, obviously for your wife...

150
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,400
probably bought out of guilt.

151
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,920
The other, from Sugarpuss on Haight Street...

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,600
which, let's just say, is not
where one shops for their wife.

153
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,920
According to psychological studies...

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,920
black is the color chosen by men
in midlife crisis trying to rebel...

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,680
but who, in fact, are
simply... terrified of death.

156
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
Damn.

157
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
- Could you turn the camera off, please?
- You got it.

158
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Why...

159
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,160
Why should First Fidelity
care about these Darwin cases?

160
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,600
The cases I describe in my report cost
your company $22 million per annum.

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,520
- That's last year alone.
- Jesus.

162
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,840
- You said there's no profile.
- Right.

163
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,600
Well, we create one.

164
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,120
You can predict a person's
fate based on three traits.

165
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
For instance, if you weigh over 250
pounds, use bar soap rather than liquid...

166
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,040
and don't have a nonskid surface in
your shower, you have a 2.2% chance of...

167
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
That's worldwide.

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Sad thing is, 90% of these
accidents are preventable.

169
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Just requires a little precaution.

170
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
Get someone to study
these Darwin Award types...

171
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,320
find three common risk
factors, you got your profile.

172
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,760
Screen against this profile,
you'll save $22 million per annum.

173
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,960
Okay. Okay. You begin immediately...

174
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,800
and, um, you start with... with those.

175
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,320
These cases are all over the
country. See, I don't travel.

176
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,920
- I've never been out of San Francisco.
- Well, that's a deal-breaker.

177
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,400
You have four weeks to prove your theory.
If you're right, you have a job. If not...

178
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Four weeks isn't nearly enough time.

179
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm gonna pair you with a claims investigator.

180
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,160
And she specializes in, um, unusual cases.

181
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,680
Jim, you mind?

182
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,600
Zippy Cola is a client of First Fidelity.

183
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,400
They've got a potential wrongful
death suit on their hands.

184
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,560
You nervous?

185
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,480
No. Feels good to be working again.

186
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,480
That's a lot ofblood.

187
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,600
Ugh. Gross.

188
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,600
Could you please not... Oh, my God.

189
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah. I've got enough for now.

190
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,120
Has anybody checked the coins?

191
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Who the hell's this guy?

192
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,640
Who the fuck is this guy?

193
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,560
I have everything I need. Thank you.

194
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,040
I just noticed his right sleeve is ripped.

195
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,760
Seriously. Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck is this camera doing here?

196
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Hello? Can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

197
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,040
Are you crazy?

198
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,000
My name is Burrows and...

199
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,440
Are you all right?

200
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,920
Of course. Just a little light-headed.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Listen.

202
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm Siri Taylor. I'm the claims investigator.

203
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,560
And, uh, you are here only to observe.

204
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,040
So if you get another theory
about our client's liability...

205
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Well, I do have a theory
regarding your client's liability.

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
People think motive analysis is unimaginative.

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
It's actually the opposite.

208
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,200
If you imagine all the possible scenarios...

209
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,880
you'll find the one most likely.

210
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,640
Who... is in fact... your daddy?

211
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,600
I am.

212
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Come on!

213
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,400
Piece of shit!

214
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,240
You like that? Come to papa.

215
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
Come to papi.

216
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,080
Oh. Oh, shit.

217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,840
Any second now you can go ahead
and... wipe that smile off your face.

218
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Hello?

219
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,040
I'm actually originally from South Bend.

220
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,840
I moved here for love. I know. It's,
like, the oldest story in the book.

221
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,240
I needed my space, and much like you...

222
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,840
she, uh, wouldn't let me go.

223
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey. Hey!

224
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,280
Hey! Hey! I'm in here!

225
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,960
Hey! Hello!

226
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,240
You minimum-wage asshole!

227
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm in here! Motherfucker.

228
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,800
Oh, shit.

229
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,680
The building will be
closed till Monday morning.

230
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,120
Have a nice weekend.

231
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,360
That's great.

232
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

233
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,600
Guys like Emile here...

234
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,400
they spend their whole
lives testing the system.

235
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,880
Sooner or later, it's gonna catch up with 'em.

236
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,800
This is the way the world ends.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
First of all, theories are bullshit.

238
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,560
"B", the legs on that machine, they failed.

239
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,080
So we have liability. Thirdly,
this dickhead has to go.

240
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
- It was criminal tampering.
- We only deal in hard proof.

241
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,800
Open up the machine. Check
the inside for his prints.

242
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
Okay. You want enough rope
to hang yourself? Fine.

243
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,120
One condition. You're wrong, and
you get some other investigator.

244
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,560
All right. All right.

245
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,080
But if I'm right, we investigate
my bullshit theories on these cases.

246
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,240
Hmm.

247
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,600
The deceased's prints coat
the inside of all the machines.

248
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,520
You on the job?

249
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,280
Used to be. S.F.P.D.

250
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,720
Also seems I've saved Zippy Cola
from a multimillion-dollar suit.

251
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,440
There's a non-tampering clause. See?

252
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,160
- Does that help Emile Travers?
- No.

253
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,120
But he was clearly in the wrong.

254
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Oh, God. What the hell are you doing?

255
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,040
Just analyzing motivation.

256
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,720
Analyzing motivation.

257
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,440
It's simple. Greedy
bastard didn't want to pay.

258
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,560
Got his hand caught in the cookie jar.

259
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
It's not a question of greed.
Travers made over six figures.

260
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,600
He could afford cheese
crackers. He did it to win.

261
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,520
- To feel like he was beating the system.
- Fascinating.

262
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,360
So, tell me. Why are we going all
the way to fucking Minnesota...

263
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,120
for a simple stolen car claim?

264
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
I picked Minnesota...

265
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,840
- 'cause the town hasn't had a stolen car in 42 years.
- So?

266
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,040
So, the chances of a
brand-new car being stolen...

267
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,680
in a town that hasn't had a
theft in 42 years is 3,000-to-1.

268
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,520
Oh, thank you.

269
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,880
- Thank you.
- I ordered steamed vegetables.

270
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Yeah, you know, hot dish is
all we have after breakfast.

271
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,320
- What is that?
- A spork.

272
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
A spork.

273
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Combination of spoon and fork.

274
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
Right.

275
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,160
Of course. Of course.

276
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,120
For an ex-cop, you're kind
of a pussy, aren't you?

277
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm not used to traveling. So what?

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm not talking about that. The cashier.

279
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
You've been checking her
out for, like, 20 minutes...

280
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,360
but you haven't said anything.

281
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,040
I don't have time to...

282
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
- I'm here to concentrate on work.
- Right.

283
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Okay, listen, Casanova.

284
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,040
When we go to interview this car
claim, just let me do the talking.

285
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,960
All right?

286
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Spork.

287
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,360
First rule of investigation:
Notice everything.

288
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,400
- Would you like a cookie?
- Oh, no, thank you.

289
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,760
Um, according to the form here, Mr. Sparrow...

290
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,360
it says the men took the car
from you at gunpoint, correct?

291
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,840
- Yeah, that's how Bob got shot.
- How completely terrifying.

292
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,160
Um, could you, for the record, just
repeat the description of the men?

293
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
Oh, well, they were, uh, bad guys.

294
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,840
They were definitely, uh,
you know, from the city there.

295
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,760
They weren't from around
here. I would have known 'em.

296
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, so, bad men from the city.

297
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you, Mr. Sparrow. We're done.

298
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
- We're what?
- Done.

299
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,400
Oh, I don't want any trouble. I just...
I want the money back for my truck, is all.

300
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,400
Why are you making it so complicated?

301
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,920
I go through a hundred cases a year.

302
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,040
Ninety-nine percent of them
are just plain accidents.

303
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,960
I mean, if he was lying...
The things, they just happen. It's fate.

304
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,080
I believe in behavior, not fate.

305
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,120
So lightning comes shooting out of the sky...

306
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,520
and you're gonna blame the
poor slob who got hit by it?

307
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,800
If he's playing golf
during a thunderstorm, yes!

308
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720
God.

309
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,160
Well, so what if I just decided to walk
out here on the oh-so-dangerous ice.

310
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,400
No, no. I wouldn't do that if I were you.

311
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,720
Yeah, you probably wouldn't unzip your
fly without assessing the risk first.

312
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,880
You know, you're being
stupid. You're not being funny.

313
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,520
And 20% of back injuries occur on...
Siri!

314
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm coming! Shit.

315
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,640
You all right?

316
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,840
No. Yeah. I mean... It's just the fish.

317
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
Oh, Jesus. Sounds like you have a concussion.

318
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,840
No. No, dummy. The fish in the trees.

319
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,600
The fish in the...

320
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,520
Everywhere.

321
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
They have carbon burns on them.

322
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,520
In this culture, the number
40 takes on an ominous tone.

323
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,120
There's a rise in recreational accidents
for men between the ages 40 and 42.

324
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Probably because men of that age can afford
the recreational equipment to do the damage.

325
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
Damn.

326
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,320
- Goddamn.
- That's right. Goddamn.

327
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,600
- Uh, what's she get per gallon?
- Who gives a shit?

328
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,760
- Ow!
- Watch the tire.

329
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Oh, yeah!

330
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,400
- Ten cylinders, fuel injected!
- Fuck you!

331
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
Okay? Fuck you for having
this truck before I did!

332
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,600
Yeah, fuck me is right, eh?

333
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,760
Sparrow had been in three vehicular accidents.

334
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,760
- Ready, Max?
- But other than that, his record was clean.

335
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,400
Come on, boy. Come on.

336
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,640
Max! Good boy, Max.

337
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
This lake sucks. All the ducks are gone!

338
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,360
- Let's get some fish.
- Yeah! Ice fishin'!

339
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,840
- This is gonna take an hour!
- I got a better idea.

340
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,840
Recreational use ofhigh explosives
is illegal in all 50 states.

341
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,480
But about 3,000 times a year, men
like Tom Sparrow seem to find them.

342
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,680
- Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got this from Wally down at the plant.

343
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, I figure instead of busting our asses...

344
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,360
diggin' a hole in there, we'll just use this.

345
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,960
Hey, shit. Be careful with that.

346
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,280
Relax, it's got an extra-long fuse.

347
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
Besides, I almost made
quarterback in high school.

348
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,000
- Jesus Christ!
- What are you doin'?

349
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
Stop fuckin' around! Throw it!

350
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,680
Man.

351
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,240
- This is what it's all about.
- I guess.

352
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,200
Heel, Max!

353
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,840
- You know, Max could get hurt.
- Heel, Max! Heel!

354
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
He's fetching! Drop it!

355
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,640
Drop it, Max! Drop it!

356
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,720
Tom, what do we do now?

357
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,360
Run!

358
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,280
Run!

359
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
- Whoa! Fuck.
- We gotta shoot!

360
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,160
No, Max!

361
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,880
- No!
- Fuck!

362
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh!

363
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,240
Bob! It's freezing!

364
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,800
- Hold up! Hold up!
- One thing I've learned studying people.

365
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,120
Bravery and stupidity aren't
mutually exclusive traits.

366
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,480
In fact, you might argue
they're one and the same.

367
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Bob! Oh! Bob!

368
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,640
Hey. You're zoning out again.

369
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,280
I want to go to the hospital.
Visit the one who was shot.

370
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
Oh, come on. Come on. We're
behind schedule already.

371
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,640
Besides, the case is closed.
You didn't learn anything.

372
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Correction. We learned he had
a history of military surplus...

373
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,320
car accidents, and he's a second child.

374
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,120
Just like Emile Travers.

375
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,760
Hey, you just hate the fact
that the rookie solved the case.

376
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,480
- Hey! Who found the fish?
- You fell.

377
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,800
It's not like you thought, "I'm gonna
lie down and look for fish in the trees."

378
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,320
- You fell.
- Fine, yeah, I fell. Falling.

379
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,680
Something you wouldn't have thought to do...

380
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,800
because you're too chickenshit to
go out on the ice in the first place.

381
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,640
Laughing is not objective.

382
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,400
Before, these Darwin cases
werejust a puzzle to solve.

383
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,640
Now I was connecting them to names and faces.

384
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,760
I wasn't satisfiedjust studying
these accidents anymore.

385
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,280
I wanted to find a way to prevent them.

386
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,800
Sorry. Nurse!

387
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Can you speed up a little bit?

388
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
Two-lane highways with broken
lines are the most dangerous roads.

389
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,960
Seventy percent of accidents
occur over the speed limit.

390
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,040
You're going 35 in a
45-mile-an-hour zone.

391
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,320
Most studies have a plus or minus 10% error.

392
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm correcting for that.

393
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
- What is this?
- The Piano Man.

394
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,240
He rocks. He's a musical genius.

395
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,320
It's been proven that
soft music reduces stress.

396
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,240
- Lost your crazy mind.
- Too hard-core for you?

397
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Fuck.

398
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,920
What's so unusual about
this life insurance claim...

399
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,040
that we're driving all the way to Nevada?

400
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,960
There's no body. No leads.

401
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,280
Except for one unusual piece of evidence.

402
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,960
Forget it. Got nothin'.

403
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,320
No wreckage.

404
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,400
How far do the skid marks extend?

405
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,360
Uh, 2.8 miles.

406
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,880
No. You didn't look far enough.

407
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,760
Listen, buddy, it's over.

408
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,960
We've got a million-dollar life
insurance claim and no body.

409
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,560
How do you explain these?

410
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,800
You know what? It's not my
job to, unless there's a body.

411
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,800
Didn't you stop to think something
leaving a 2.8 mile skid mark...

412
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,040
was going inexplicably fast?

413
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,080
Listen, we searched a hundred-yard radius...

414
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,800
on both sides of the skids and found nothing.

415
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,920
No. I mean really fast.

416
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,360
There's metal in the skid
marks melted to the pavement.

417
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,400
From what?

418
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,720
Melted wheels.

419
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,640
When a man oflimited means...

420
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,680
has a million-dollar life insurance
policy, it raises questions.

421
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,160
Foul play by the beneficiary
must always be considered.

422
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,520
Suicide, if proven, is cause for cancellation.

423
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,400
You like her, don't you?

424
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,920
That's a bullshit question.

425
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
Now why is it a bullshit question?

426
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,720
You see, your whole "film school"
objective observer theory is bullshit.

427
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,520
You're trying to get me to say certain
things to create some kind of story.

428
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Hey, it's all real footage, man.

429
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,240
No. It's the 90 minutes of footage you're
gonna choose from hundreds of hours of tape.

430
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,120
Then you're gonna edit it to make
someone look like the bad guy...

431
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,600
or someone look like the hero.

432
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,640
The only problem is, there are no heroes here.

433
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,720
Ow!

434
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,480
Harvey! Will you cut that racket out?

435
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,480
In many ways, Harvey was
a model X-factor candidate.

436
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,160
He had the classic
second-child personalities.

437
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Stan, do you ever get the feeling
there's a whole other world out there?

438
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,800
What? Like Europe?

439
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
On the surface, a second
child is a responsible citizen.

440
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,320
Premium, right?

441
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,920
No. Mid-grade's fine. Thanks.

442
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,880
This has got fuel injection.
You want it to run clean.

443
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,320
Just mid-grade.

444
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,280
But boiling just below the
exterior of the second child...

445
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
is a competitive risk
taker who craves attention.

446
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,120
Been working on my own car a bit.

447
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,640
She ain't much, but she's
got a hell of a lot of torque.

448
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
Keep the change.

449
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,640
Oh, faster!

450
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,560
You can go faster, baby.

451
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,640
Oh, as fast as you can. Come on.

452
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,640
Oh! Go as fast as you can, please?

453
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,840
No, faster! You can go faster, baby, please?

454
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,080
All right, I'll go as fast as I can.

455
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,040
- That's it.
- What's it?

456
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,400
One of the largest safety risks...

457
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,320
is the unregulated sale of military surplus.

458
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,560
Whoa. Whoa.

459
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,480
Man. Huh. You guys are mad at somebody.

460
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Hey, Harvey, grenades.

461
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,360
Oh, I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

462
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,440
- Why? Is it live?
- Legally, we can't give you an answer to that question.

463
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
- That's pretty cool.
- How many of these do you have?

464
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,120
Well, how many do you need?

465
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,040
Hey, Harvey. Look at that.

466
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,720
Am I good? Or am I bad?

467
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't know. Somewhere in between, probably.

468
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
- What the hell is that?
- Ain't for sale.

469
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,680
- Not for sale?
- Barry, you know I've been saving that thing.

470
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
- For what?
- I don't know.

471
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,040
- How much?
- I got that from one of those boys on the military base.

472
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,360
What in God's name you wanna
do with that thing, Harvey?

473
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,880
Joleen, are you proud of me?

474
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,560
Like on TV, when you see
someone do something incredible.

475
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,160
Think I could be someone like that?

476
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,080
I don't know. I've never met
anybody incredible before.

477
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,360
Stan, this is your station.

478
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm gonna go a mile back up the road.

479
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,200
Well, how can I film it?

480
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Don't worry. I'll be
coming by in no time at all.

481
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,880
As soon as you hear the
ignition, start filming.

482
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,200
Okay. Harvey, you know, if we film
this we're not gonna get in trouble?

483
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,600
- 'Cause I'm on that probation.
- No, Stan.

484
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,360
We're not gonna be in
trouble. We're gonna be on TV.

485
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,080
Okay.

486
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,920
Harvey, you're not gonna
get yourself hurt, right?

487
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,040
Nah, don't worry. I'm not
gonna let anything happen.

488
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Harvey. Am I good, or am I bad?

489
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,840
You're just a little bit bad.

490
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
But what's wrong with that?

491
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,080
- The JATO rocket is designed to add thrust...
- Careful.

492
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,320
...to overloaded transport planes like C-130s...

493
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,200
which, fully loaded, weigh
in excess of 200 tons.

494
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,080
Harvey's Chevy weighed less than two.

495
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Harvey accelerated to 50 miles per hour
before he began the ignition sequence.

496
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,840
The first two switches mixed the fluids.

497
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,120
Once mixed, they become one of the
most potent rocket fuels on earth...

498
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,160
unleashing a force beyond the
imagination of Harvey Wedstone.

499
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,040
Okay. Harvey should be
here in about five minutes.

500
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm not sure if this is gonna work.

501
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,280
By the time Harvey hit the brakes...

502
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,320
the car was already going 250 miles per hour.

503
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
Then the peak burn hit.

504
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,960
Oh, my God!

505
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,680
Harvey managed to pull the parking brake.

506
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,080
This would have been of no use...

507
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,560
because at 300 miles per
hour the tires melted.

508
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,760
Tellis Pearlman saw his fate coming
from the east at 400 miles per hour.

509
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:31,360
Forces usually reserved for wind tunnel
tests were now ripping the car apart.

510
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,480
The more I learn about this man,
the more I feel a strange admiration.

511
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
Harvey made a brave decision.

512
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,400
With three seconds ofburn left, Harvey
veered out of the Pearlmans'way...

513
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,440
hitting the sloped shoulder.

514
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,200
The trajectory sent Harvey
to an apex of 300 feet.

515
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,600
I did it! I fucking did something!

516
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
What happened?

517
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,160
Nothing. I fell asleep at the wheel.

518
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,560
Kids, kids. Quiet.

519
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,520
Your father's lost his mind again.

520
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,200
Two days later, Pearlman
reported to the air force...

521
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,400
a U.F.O. that came and
went in the blink of an eye.

522
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
Mama!

523
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,320
- Stan, reverting to his criminal instincts, ran.
- Mama!

524
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,480
Okay, well, um, it was coming toward...

525
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,480
It was like a flashlight,
and there was an explosion.

526
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,360
It was going about 3,000 miles an hour.

527
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,720
- 3,000 miles an hour?
- At least 3,400 miles.

528
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,640
Very fast.

529
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,040
Mr. Pearlman, could it
have been your imagination?

530
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,040
He has no imagination! He's completely insane.

531
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,120
He ordered 22 cases of paper towels.
Had them shipped to the house.

532
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,600
And you don't have a history of narcotics.

533
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,120
It happened. I was driving
with my family in the car.

534
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
I had my children in the
back, and it happened.

535
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,400
One more second and we would
have just been in an accident.

536
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,560
Siri, he saved the Pearlmans'lives.

537
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,480
He's actually kind of a hero.

538
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,400
What? Listen.

539
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Two years ago in Louisiana...

540
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,400
a single mother and her three
kids lost their house in a flood.

541
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,000
I had to look her in the
eyes and deny that claim.

542
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,680
I am sure as hell not gonna
give a million dollars...

543
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
to some idiot who strapped a JATO
rocket to the back of his Chevy.

544
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,440
Look at the trajectory. He was home free.

545
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,880
The rocket was burned out, then he swerved.

546
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,320
- The claim is rejected.
- What?

547
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,600
Man, you are losing it. We've
got, like, 20 minutes. Come on.

548
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,680
Jesus.

549
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,040
Don't you have to go back
to school at some point?

550
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,680
- This is my thesis project. I can take as long as I want.
- Great.

551
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,400
Could you be any louder and more obnoxious?

552
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,320
"You can't beat me, but
keep fishing for clues."

553
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,280
God, don't you ever stop?

554
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,520
If I don't meet this deadline...

555
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,280
my life, the one I was planning for, is over.

556
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,720
It's just that it's always
steamed vegetables...

557
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,400
and safety belts with you.

558
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Doing the right thing.

559
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,520
It's like you're... you're
punching a clock 24-7.

560
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, the world's a dangerous place 24-7...

561
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,760
and if you're weak or you make a mistake
at a wrong moment, somebody gets hurt.

562
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,960
Somebody maybe even dies.

563
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,240
And it doesn't help when someone won't
make a lousy cell phone call for you...

564
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,160
at a critical moment.

565
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,120
Burrows. So what is it? You
want us all to live to be 100?

566
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
Sure. Why not? I'd love to live to 100.

567
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,360
Even if it meant giving up everything
and basically having no life at all?

568
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,400
I think I got a pretty
good life, actually, Siri.

569
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,760
What am I giving up? Uh, hot
dogs? Cigarettes? Explosives?

570
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,840
You know what I mean. Come on.

571
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,800
Mmm!

572
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,960
See the girl behind the counter?

573
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,560
Tell her I'm your fiancée, and I
just broke it off. Broke your heart.

574
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,160
Then ask her for a drink
when she gets off work.

575
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Um, you know, a shoulder to
cry on, that type of thing.

576
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,400
Now, when she says yes, play track
two off Wilco's Summer Teeth album.

577
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,320
It's in the car.

578
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,840
I have no intention of, um...

579
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,880
And even if I did, I certainly
wouldn't use Wilco. Wilco?

580
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,520
You don't deserve Wilco. Just trust me.

581
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,880
Look at her. She's
totally small-town America.

582
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,800
She's probably desperate.

583
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,080
If you have any kind of pulse, you'll do it.

584
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,360
It's over! We're through!

585
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,520
You even begin to follow me over there,
and that's it, this is over. Got it?

586
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,880
Yeah, good.

587
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,080
Here...

588
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,720
Did she say yes?

589
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,880
Her name's Zoe. Meeting her at 11:00.

590
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,400
What do you think of when you hear
the phrase, "You can't beat me?"

591
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,360
Um, sex?

592
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,720
Damn.

593
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,720
Death trap.

594
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,600
Always be prepared.

595
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, yeah.

596
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,680
Goddamn!

597
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,040
God! Thank you, Jesus.

598
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh, God! Jesus!

599
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,880
If you have a soul, you will help me.

600
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,920
You know how war photographers can't interfere
no matter what atrocity is being committed...

601
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,320
No!

602
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,560
You will burn in hell for this.

603
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,360
Help! Help!

604
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,200
Help! Help!

605
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,160
- Burrows?
- Help!

606
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,840
- Help!
- Sorry.

607
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,000
And I didn't even think you
knew how to have a good time!

608
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,440
I was just, the... It was...
I was trying to avoid the...

609
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,200
Let's just skip the
explanations and get you down.

610
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,960
Wait a minute.
You just stood there, not helping him?

611
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,440
Well, see, the main ethic of
documentary film prevents me from...

612
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,480
That's a really expensive
camera you've got there.

613
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,880
Yeah, actually. Kind of is. No,
please don't. No, please don't.

614
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,880
Let's just try to get you down.

615
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,480
What do you think of when you hear
the phrase, "You can't beat me?"

616
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,400
Please don't ask me that right now.

617
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,960
No, wait...
Ooh! Wait, wait, don't!

618
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,800
Yeah, but this is where
the knot is. I have to.

619
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,280
Look, I'm real flattered, but that is
not gonna help loosen anything up right now.

620
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,040
It's the straps.
I mean the the circulation.

621
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,360
Oh, boy. Okay, I got an idea. I have an idea.

622
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,360
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay.

623
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,040
- What?
- One, two, three!

624
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,520
- Ow! God!
- Are you okay there?

625
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,600
Hello?

626
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,760
- Michael?
- Oh, yeah.

627
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,680
Yeah. He's right here.

628
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,080
It's your date.

629
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,880
- Hello?
- Hello?

630
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,760
Oh, hi. It's you. Yeah.

631
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
Uh, that was my business partner. We're just...

632
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,760
Well, she's helping me...
...making me...

633
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
- Ah! God!
- Are you okay?

634
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,920
Just figured something out. Ah, yeah. Yeah.

635
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,320
That's it!

636
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,480
Good. There's this Polynesian
place around the corner.

637
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,480
They make really big drinks, and you
can share them, and they have live music.

638
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,400
- It's sort of like Don Ho.
- Yeah. Listen.

639
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm right in the thick of... In the
middle of something.

640
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,800
I think I should be with you shortly.

641
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,760
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,440
Bye.

643
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,240
Next time, try a bath. Have fun.

644
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,440
Thank you.

645
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,920
I give you such a perfect
song, and you blow it?

646
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,920
I can barely walk, much less anything else.

647
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,320
Last night actually explained so much.

648
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,160
- I have a theory.
- Really? Thank you, Dr. Freud.

649
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,360
No, seriously. You are so
obsessed with these Darwin cases...

650
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,520
that you are actually becoming one.

651
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,440
I think she's got a point.

652
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,520
No, I don't want Marcus, and
I don't want the bodyguard.

653
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,040
We'll be landing in 10 minutes, sir.

654
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,000
Christ, man, who's flying the plane?

655
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,280
I just put it on autopilot, ma'am.

656
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,840
Oh. Autopilot. Fantastic.

657
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,720
No. Marcus just got Carla a brand-new
international driving license...

658
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,800
and we're going to rough
it in the wilds of America.

659
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,760
The controls on the dash are...
The red button there is the cruise control.

660
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,680
Cruise control? What's that?

661
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,080
- Cruise control is... It's like autopilot.
- Oh, brilliant!

662
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,000
Then you have the...

663
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,320
You know? I think I'm really
getting the hang of this.

664
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,760
- My last experience at the dentist was a nightmare.
- I get that a lot.

665
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,720
There's no
reason to be worried.

666
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,760
We're a team. We're a team.

667
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,480
- Darling, do you want another drink?
- Magic, lovey, magic.

668
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,040
Magic. Yeah. I'm going to put
you on a little autopilot, lovey.

669
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,880
Go do your thing.

670
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,160
Darling...

671
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,560
I've got a lovely surprise for you.

672
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,400
That's very nice.

673
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,640
Who's driving the van?

674
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,760
It's on autopilot.

675
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,040
Oh, fuck.

676
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,240
I don't know if I made this clear enough...

677
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,760
but we're not going anywhere
until we get a statement.

678
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,400
My lawyer says because of a pending
malpractice suit, I can't make any statement.

679
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,200
How am I supposed to...

680
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,520
I'll take a written statement
from you, Mr. Harris. Thank you.

681
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,720
You know what this is?
This is the medical report.

682
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
It's got your dental impressions.

683
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,600
And, well, I mean, your wearing a diaper
makes it pretty goddamn obvious what happened.

684
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,120
And frankly, I don't give a shit if
you're too embarrassed to talk about it.

685
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,840
What my partner means to say
is, we need a moment alone.

686
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,760
Lesions on the base of the penis! Come on!

687
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,520
- Come on, what?
- She was giving him head!

688
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,160
And you say my theories are out there!

689
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,320
It's bullshit! She gave him a blow job!

690
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,800
You know these X-factor types of yours?

691
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,800
They may die young, but they
sure have more fun in the process.

692
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,720
Okay, I admit your theory on
that case had some probability of...

693
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,040
Oh, come on. It was obvious from the get-go.

694
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,160
No. Yesterday, 11:33 a.m,
you said it's 99.9% probable...

695
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,000
she was giving him a...
...giving him a...

696
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,600
Blow job.

697
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,600
You know, I still wonder if it's even
physically possible while driving...

698
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,080
Oh, believe me. It's possible.
You want me to show you?

699
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,360
Whoa! No, stop! It's all right. Okay,
I admit you're right. You're right.

700
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,400
That's all it took?

701
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,160
Christ, I thought I was gonna have to
solve the energy crisis or something...

702
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,280
- to ever hear you say that.
- Funny.

703
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,520
Oh! Hey, if we wanna make it to Tacoma
tonight we better take the interstate.

704
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,440
Interstate goes over a 6,000-foot pass.

705
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,600
It'll be ice this time of year. This road will
connect us to the state highway in no time.

706
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,480
All right, this cannot be the right way.
The road is actually turning to dirt.

707
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,880
Everything's under control.

708
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,360
There's a cattle grate up ahead. That
means there's ranches around here.

709
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,040
Ranches?

710
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,960
Okay, and we don't have a spare?

711
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,200
One. Car's also stuck in the grate.

712
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,000
Excellent! My fucking battery's dead.

713
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,960
- No signal.
- So what's the plan?

714
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,880
Wejust wait around here until it gets
dark and somehow our signal gets better?

715
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,160
You know, I take a lot of crap
from you for being prepared.

716
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,560
For thinking ahead. But you're
about to feel like a real idiot.

717
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,400
This balloon...

718
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,240
filament wire and helium.

719
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,320
See, the wire acts like a long
antenna, and I now have a signal.

720
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,840
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on.

721
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,760
Oh, it's too damp.

722
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,480
Fuck.

723
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,840
Remember a few years back,
wasn't there, like, a couple...

724
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,000
who ran out of gas on a desolate road...

725
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,280
and they didn't find their bodies until...

726
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,440
- That's it. There's a gas can in the car.
- Do you remember?

727
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,160
I got it.

728
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,120
- Do it. Just...
- I'm gettin' warm.

729
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Okay.

730
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,200
You are one of these sorry-ass Darwin cases.

731
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,480
Should we move near the car for heat?

732
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,040
No, the embers from the tires could
ignite the gas tank at any moment.

733
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,560
So what that, that phrase?

734
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,760
"Beat me"... something?

735
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,680
- Yeah.
- What is that?

736
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,600
Written by a perp who I let get away.

737
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,520
Only a matter of time before
he hurts someone again.

738
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,400
I'm sorry about what I said before.

739
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,080
- It's just our car blew up, and...
- Yeah, I know. I understand.

740
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,320
You're right. I'm...

741
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,200
I'm beginning to relate to these
Darwin cases a little too well.

742
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,880
It happens.

743
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,840
I have a secret...

744
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,800
something I've never told anyone before.

745
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,040
Oh, shit. I'm out of tape! Damn it.

746
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,520
Oh, my God.

747
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,480
That's the most incredible
thing I've ever heard. I...

748
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,680
I have a cell phone.

749
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,680
And it has signal too.

750
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,160
- What?
- Yeah.

751
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,520
What? Wh-What?

752
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,320
I have a cell phone.

753
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,480
- You have a... Show you...
- No, please don't.

754
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,680
- Please don't.
- I could ram a spork up your ass!

755
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,920
Gesundheit. Or bless you. Whatever.

756
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,360
Thanks.

757
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,400
How do they do it?

758
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,320
What?

759
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,240
People with normal lives.
How do they make that happen?

760
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:44,000
You got me. Why? Is that,
like, something you hope for?

761
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,440
I never hope.

762
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,360
Too disappointing.

763
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,720
It's amazing.

764
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,320
Some people bring danger on themselves
no matter what precautions they take...

765
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,160
while others seem immune
to the dangers of the world.

766
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,120
They do everything wrong,
take no precautions...

767
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,560
cause death, damage to property.

768
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,920
Yet they still live to tell about it.

769
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,000
Come on, dude. Let's go!

770
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,200
Simon! Did you steal my pot again?

771
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,800
No! Relax, Mom. I'll be back by 11:30.

772
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,760
Get back here, you little shit!

773
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,600
- Hi, Mrs. Simon.
- Oh, hi, Farley. How are ya?

774
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,960
Let's go!

775
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,760
- Got the tickets?
- Getting them from Jimbo at the parking lot.

776
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,280
- Fuck, dude!
- Relax, man.

777
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,920
He'll be there. Whoo!

778
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,160
Metallica! Whoo!

779
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,320
- Metallica!
- Yeah, dude. We're here, man.

780
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,280
Yeah! Nice parking space, dude.

781
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,360
He told me he'd be here by 8:00.

782
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,000
He's not fuckin' comin', man.

783
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,520
Listen to that. Metallica's taking the stage,
and we're in the goddamn parking lot, man.

784
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,040
They're not comin' back for two years.

785
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,200
I'll probably be dead or married by then.

786
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,600
Hey! Hey. You wanna sell your tickets?

787
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,920
- No way.
- Dude, 200 bucks.

788
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,840
- Nah.
- Dude, 200 bucks...

789
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,520
killer weed.

790
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,080
All right, man. There's no
price on this kind of experience.

791
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,880
- Dude, I'll give you my van.
- Not your ride.

792
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,480
- I'm serious, dude.
- Where is it?

793
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,080
- It's right there.
- There.

794
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,360
- No thanks.
- Idiot!

795
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,360
Hey, fuck you, dude!

796
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,840
That van has an excellent tape deck!

797
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,160
Enjoy your leather pants,
you fuckin' butt-hole!

798
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,040
That was beautiful, man.

799
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,200
You're so dedicated to Metallica that
you were willing to sacrifice your ride.

800
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,880
Man, you lost your virginity in that van.

801
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,880
No, dude. I'm still a virgin.

802
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,880
- What about Lisa Cummings?
- I only got a hand job.

803
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,520
Ah, fuck.

804
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,720
Exactly, man. What do we got?

805
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,840
Our lives are shit.

806
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,200
So that's why it is our birthright
at the end of the workweek...

807
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,880
to get messed up and go
hear fucking Metallica!

808
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,960
Metallica! Metallica!

809
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,320
I'm getting you into this concert, man.

810
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,920
The chances of a fatal
accident increase threefold...

811
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,480
with a blood alcohol level of over. 20.

812
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,200
- Come on up, man. It's easy.
- Combined with another drug, such as marijuana...

813
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,880
the likelihood increases 10 times.

814
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,000
Come on, man. You can do it.

815
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,080
Use the power of the music.

816
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,840
Thank you.

817
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,280
Dude, I'm in, man! I'm in!

818
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,640
Aaah! Fuck! Shit!

819
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,040
- Dude, help me out!
- What?

820
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,920
- Help me, man! Help me!
- Holy shit.

821
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,120
Help me, man! Help me!

822
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,880
- Use that Popeye strength from your mama.
- Yeah!

823
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,920
Help me, man. Help me!

824
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,760
Goddamn!

825
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,880
Oh, shit!

826
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,320
- Simon!
- I'm okay!

827
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,560
The tree, like, caught me.

828
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,120
Oh, yeah. I love that part. Yeah.

829
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,080
All right, dude, I'm gonna get the rope.

830
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,600
No, man. I think I'm
pretty close to the ground.

831
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,640
I don't know, dude. It looks pretty far.

832
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,000
It's bushes, man. I can make it.

833
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,440
No, dude. Come on.

834
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,720
I'm gonna cut myself free...

835
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,080
and then the bushes'll catch me.

836
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,280
When you fall just be
loose, like stage diving.

837
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,560
- Right.
- And try not to fall on your head.

838
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,360
Hey. Can you shine that light
down again? I want to light a bone.

839
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,600
Dude, I'm tokin' simultaneously.

840
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,840
Yeah, man.

841
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,360
- Ah!
- Oh, shit.

842
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
Simon!

843
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,400
Fuck, man! You trying to kill me?

844
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,680
Sorry, dude. What's the situation?

845
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,480
I think it's pretty fucked up, man!

846
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,480
- These are, like, sticker bushes!
- Damn.

847
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,920
- Didn't fall on my head.
- Right on.

848
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,040
I got an idea.

849
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,880
I'm gonna tie the rope to the bumper of the
van. I'm gonna throw it over to you, all right?

850
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,000
Then I'll just ease you up, all right?

851
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,040
The other risk factor with
simultaneous drug use...

852
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,560
- is seriously impairedjudgment.
- Sounds like a plan.

853
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,720
- More, dude.
- You got it?

854
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,240
Yeah. Yeah, I got it! I got it!

855
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,480
Ah, fuck.

856
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,760
Oh, shit. Aah.

857
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,560
Dude!

858
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,240
Dude.

859
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,960
Listen. We stopped the music.

860
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,920
The boy in the van survived.

861
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,080
His friend was not so lucky.

862
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,520
Gotta make a phone call.

863
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,360
Fuck.

864
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,520
This is purely for investigative purposes.

865
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,320
What the hell are you doing?

866
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,120
Research.

867
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,040
Ah. Well, good to see you're holdin' up.

868
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,720
- Neither of them is a second child.
- So?

869
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,560
So that was the one solid
trait I had linking the cases.

870
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,520
Look, with the amount of money you're
saving Simmons and the company...

871
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,440
believe me, you're gonna get the job.

872
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,240
A new job... doesn't matter anymore.

873
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,440
If I'm gonna find a way
to prevent these deaths...

874
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,600
I have to know why they do it.

875
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,200
I'll tell you why.

876
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,440
Do you know that companies intentionally
build in mistakes to monthly bills...

877
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,320
hoping you won't notice, just
so they can save a few pennies?

878
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,240
And insurance firms,
like the one I work for...

879
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,320
we have a... policy...

880
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,320
of rejecting every claim right off the bat.

881
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,360
And if you call to dispute that claim...

882
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,480
you get put on hold.

883
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,760
And then you get sent through an
endless maze of voice mail menus...

884
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,720
until you just give up.

885
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,520
All these minor insults,
they build up over the years.

886
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,400
Finally, people just...
People just lose their shit.

887
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,040
And you feel...

888
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,320
powerless and faceless, and...

889
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,440
and you end up strapping a JATO
rocket to the back of your Chevy.

890
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,600
Let's get you some coffee.

891
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,480
Oh, uh, coffee, regular.

892
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,200
"You can't beat me."

893
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,400
So illiterate for a lit major.

894
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,840
Well, a lit major.
Maybe it's a quote.

895
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,800
Nah, not a quote.

896
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,200
Did you hear that one about the
guys ice fishing using dynamite?

897
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,320
- Oh, yeah, yeah, with the dog.
- Exactly. Yeah.

898
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,440
What about the guy who takes a
rocket and bolts it onto the car?

899
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,400
- Yeah. He did a thousand miles an hour.
- I heard 2,000.

900
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,640
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I swear.

901
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,240
Harvey Wedstone.

902
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,160
What?

903
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,160
He had a name, and it
was Harvey Wedstone.

904
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,120
And he had something you'll never have...

905
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,120
- an imagination.
- Un-Unstable.

906
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,840
How about I don't give a shit?

907
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,040
You will.

908
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,080
No!

909
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,440
Can you see me?

910
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,800
Yeah.

911
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,720
Where are we?

912
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,640
Oh, we're in my room.

913
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,600
Where's the numb-nuts?

914
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,760
- I locked him in the bathroom.
- Please let me out.

915
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,720
Oh, my God. Are you still high?

916
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,040
'Cause this stuff is kinda strong.

917
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,920
I don't know.
I've never been high before.

918
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,240
It's kinda cool.

919
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:04,760
You know, I... saw the boy's face.

920
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,880
And it was like I was one of them.

921
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,640
- I'm starting to worry about you, Burrows.
- Why?

922
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,560
You gotta learn
to detach from these people.

923
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,000
Just let them go.

924
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,560
- Well, I can't.
- Oh. Be careful there.

925
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,000
- I'm not like you.
- What do you mean?

926
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,920
Look at yourself, Siri.

927
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,400
The body of that boy in the morgue...

928
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,160
You acted like he was just some piece of meat.

929
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:38,480
Well, you know...
I was doing my job. That's my job.

930
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,960
You've been doing this for four
weeks and look what it's done to you.

931
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,960
You've gone from...
...from robot to rehab candidate.

932
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,560
Well, I've been doing it for 10 years.

933
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,320
And I've been doing it alone.

934
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,240
- Siri, I'm sorry.
- I'm just not gonna sit here like you...

935
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,120
and photographically
remember every single death.

936
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,240
I remember good things too.

937
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,560
On December 3, 10:45 a.m...

938
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,360
your arm brushed against my shoulder...

939
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,840
as we ate at the restaurant.

940
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,720
On December 13, after dinner...

941
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,200
your hand rested on mine for a moment...

942
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,440
as you got in the car.

943
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,800
Yesterday, at 5:45 p.m...

944
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,200
This is gold, baby.

945
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,400
Ah, shit.

946
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,680
Oh, it's you. How'd you get out?

947
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,440
- She had to take a shower.
- Oh.

948
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,320
I think she might be in
the restaurant actually.

949
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,400
Damn, she's...

950
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,240
- Okay, okay.
- Nice to meet you. Thank you for the coffee.

951
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,120
- Hey. How's it goin'?
- Good. Good.

952
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,960
- What's going on?
- What? Do...

953
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,360
Come on, Burrows.

954
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,520
Last night was... stress relief.

955
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
You know, we were both on edge.

956
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,000
A little reefer involved.

957
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,480
It was more than just stress relief.

958
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,000
Um, you know what? Don't you have, like...

959
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,000
less than five days to
finish your project or else...

960
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,320
How did you put it? "My life will be over."

961
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,240
Sorry.

962
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,480
You know, we're not the
kind of people who can...

963
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,480
you know, do that or have that or whatever.

964
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,600
You think I don't know people.

965
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,480
You're wrong.

966
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,040
That was my specialty...

967
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:30,520
Analyzing a personality, anticipating
what their ultimate mistake's gonna be.

968
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,280
Your father left you between
the ages of four and five.

969
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,640
Just old enough to have a
memory of him, but it's fuzzy.

970
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,800
Fuzzy enough that you can project
him onto every man you encounter.

971
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,600
Fear of rejection causes you to work long
hours, have a job where you move constantly.

972
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,520
It keeps attachments to a minimum.

973
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,640
Unless it's a one-night stand.

974
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,440
You like those 'cause you
can control the situation.

975
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,120
That way you can always be
the one who does the leaving.

976
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,480
Tell me, genius.

977
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,480
What is my ultimate mistake gonna be?

978
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,080
You'll do this pattern too long...

979
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,480
To the point where you can't
do anything else but be alone.

980
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,800
Ow. Ow! I cut myself.

981
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,720
You know what? I know what
your problem is, Burrows.

982
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,440
You're faint of heart.

983
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,200
Find yourself another partner, because I quit.

984
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,000
You okay, man?

985
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,080
Uh, I guess I am.

986
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,840
You've got to snap out of it, man. Seriously.

987
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,080
You guys didn't get along anyway.

988
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,400
- I guess.
- I'm Mike Sugerman with Bay News Channel 1.

989
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,800
San Francisco Police say the North
Beach killer may have struck again.

990
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,440
The body of a young 25-to-35-year-old
woman was found here at...

991
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,920
Son of a bitch!

992
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,760
There were no other witnesses.

993
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,400
Couple at the restaurant, they were...
...they were reading books.

994
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,000
You don't see that much anymore.

995
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,120
When I arrested the perp, I
was comin'out of a bookstore.

996
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,960
- You travel with your tapes?
- Yeah.

997
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,880
- All of them?
- Yeah.

998
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,400
Fast-forward.
Fast-forward.

999
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,760
Slow it down.

1000
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,920
Freeze the frame. Zoom in.

1001
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,040
- "Howl."
- What's "Howl"?

1002
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,360
A famous book by one of the beat poets.

1003
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,080
Beat poets.

1004
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,520
"You can't beat me."

1005
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,440
The plans have changed.
We're going to San Francisco.

1006
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,320
Entering a crime scene or
tampering with evidence is a felony.

1007
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,600
I don't recommend it.

1008
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,680
Nothing's changed.

1009
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,040
I'm here 'cause numb-nuts called me and
said you were about to do something stupid.

1010
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,400
- Sorry.
- Manipulator. Interferer.

1011
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,800
Why don't you just sell out
and move to Hollywood right now?

1012
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,240
Listen, this is not your responsibility.

1013
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,680
- Just call the police.
- They won't even let me in the station.

1014
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,160
And this woman, she's
dead 'cause I let him go.

1015
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,680
- You can't even go in there.
- I'll need another set of eyes.

1016
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,440
Footprints.
Do you see any?

1017
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,480
Um, yeah, and they're huge.

1018
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,840
Good. Do you see any writing anywhere?

1019
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,400
Just the menu.

1020
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,720
Well, what does it say?

1021
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,000
It's so obvious.

1022
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,520
The book by Ferlinghetti.
Coney Island of the Mind.

1023
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,560
Hey. Look what I found.

1024
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,480
That's great.

1025
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,440
But he was referring to
this book by Ferlinghetti...

1026
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,360
not some tourist guide.

1027
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,760
Well, why don't we just go talk
to this Ferlinghetti guy directly?

1028
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,000
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.

1029
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,600
You don't just go talk
to Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

1030
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,480
Well, it says right here
that he owns this bookstore.

1031
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,640
Um, is this guy here by any chance?

1032
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,880
No.

1033
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,560
I think he's having a drink over at Tosca.

1034
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,280
- Buy me this?
- Fuck off.

1035
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,280
Sir, have you ever seen this man?

1036
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,800
Oh, yeah. That guy.

1037
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,880
- He was a real wannabe beat.
- What do you mean?

1038
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,800
Well, he filled endless
notebooks with endless poems...

1039
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,880
and nobody would publish
them, including myself.

1040
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,040
You can imagine how the poor guy felt.

1041
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,960
I don't think this man feels anything.

1042
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,760
Well, as the man says, "Only
the dead are disconnected."

1043
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,120
I remember him. He was a real asshole.

1044
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:12,400
Do-Do you have, uh... Any
idea where we could find him?

1045
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,320
I haven't seen him in years.

1046
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,640
I do remember that he
was absolutely obsessed...

1047
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,640
with Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America.

1048
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,600
Fishing for clues. Of course.

1049
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,120
When Brautigan was alive, he used
to camp outside Brautigan's office.

1050
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,080
It was really creepy.

1051
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:32,440
Are you talking about that office above
the bar just right across from City Lights?

1052
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,680
Vesuvio's. That was the place.

1053
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,880
That's a great book, by the way.

1054
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,840
Okay, now it really is time to call the cops.

1055
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,720
It's not like TV. You can't
break in without a warrant.

1056
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,880
For the conviction to stick, we need
evidence linking him to the murder.

1057
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,560
Yeah, but you just said we can't break in.

1058
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,960
Remember those guys at the rock
concert? Their idea with the rope?

1059
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,400
- Do you remember what happened to them?
- They were on drugs.

1060
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,760
Precisely my point.

1061
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,640
Listen, it'd be a good idea to have
some way to record the evidence.

1062
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:12,200
Siri, when I see the evidence,
I'll give you a thumbs-up.

1063
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,120
- Okay. Then I call 911.
- Shh.

1064
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,200
Yeah.

1065
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,240
Bingo.

1066
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,280
What the hell are you doing?
How did you get down here?

1067
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,480
Oh, I tied on to the other end of the rope.

1068
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,720
That is too much weight.

1069
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,080
Okay, maybe you're right.

1070
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,960
Damn it! Damn right I'm right.

1071
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,280
Are you okay? What should I do?

1072
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,360
The rope is slipping. Go up
on the roof and secure it.

1073
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,920
Okay.

1074
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,680
No. No. Siri! Don't go up on the roof!

1075
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,320
Shit!

1076
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,280
I'm only gonna tell you this once.

1077
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,240
Call 911 now.

1078
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,600
Salutations.

1079
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,440
No!

1080
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,400
- You talked to Ferlinghetti.
- You can't!

1081
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,960
- Don't give 'em more evidence!
- I don't think I am.

1082
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,920
You see, I happen to remember
your peculiar frailty.

1083
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,480
- No! Don't!
- Ow! Fucker!

1084
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,680
Oh, the world is a beautiful
place to be born into...

1085
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,760
if you don't much mind a few
dead minds in the higher places...

1086
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,880
or a bomb or two now and
then in your upturned faces.

1087
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,000
Burrows.

1088
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,760
- Catch.
- Oh, shit!

1089
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,280
Oh, shit!

1090
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,840
Are you... Numb-nuts.

1091
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,520
You could've just let me
fall. Why did you hold on?

1092
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,040
Instinct.

1093
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,440
I didn't wanna be saved, you fucking cretin.

1094
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,760
Okay.

1095
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,800
We shall go no more a-roving.

1096
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,160
Is he gonna be all right?

1097
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,720
He's got a concussion. I'm gonna
take him over to S.F. General.

1098
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,640
Well, can we ride with him at least?

1099
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,960
No, sorry. We got no room in the ambulance.

1100
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,040
In fact, buddy, you're gonna have to
leave your camera here with your friends.

1101
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,040
Well, then I'm not going.

1102
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,360
Believe me. You are never
gonna win that argument.

1103
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,440
Come on. Let him keep the camera.

1104
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,160
I mean, what's the harm?

1105
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,280
- Insurance, for one.
- Insurance? Oh. Fuck the insurance.

1106
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,040
I didn't see anything.

1107
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,120
All right.

1108
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,920
Well, you got thejob if you want it.

1109
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,520
But I never found any common
trait for the X-Factor.

1110
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,640
Tomorrow there's gonna be another 10,000
accidents, another thousand murders...

1111
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,840
A hundred thousand coronaries.

1112
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,920
Burrows.

1113
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,560
It is not your job to save the entire world.

1114
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,240
That's impossible.

1115
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,400
You're right. Maybe the world's
not such a dangerous place.

1116
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,280
Oh, damn. I missed it.

1117
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,080
- So what are you makin'?...
- Oh, it's a documentary.

1118
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,240
- Yeah? On what?
- Uh, paramedics.

1119
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,120
- No way. Really?
- Just keep going about your job as if I'm not here.

1120
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,040
Just pretend I'm invisible.

1121
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,960
Cool, man.

1122
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,680
You need anything? You all right? You cool?

1123
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,760
No, dude. I'm just happy to be here.

1124
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,960
- I feel sorry for you. You don't look so hot.
- Can I ask one question?

1125
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,960
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Hey, you know.

1126
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,520
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, dude.

1127
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,840
You should just focus on the sex and rock
and roll and forget about the drugs, huh?

1128
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,800
Actually, you could probably
forget about the sex too.

1129
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,480
Stick to rock and roll, dude.

1130
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,960
Appreciate it.

1131
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,640
And this next song goes out...

1132
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,360
to a dearly departed friend, Simon.

1133
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,320
I fucking did something!

1134
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,760
You minimum-wage asshole!

1135
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,680
Your father's lost his mind again.

1136
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,920
Too much Satan for one hand.

1137
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,640
Damn!

1138
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,240
Oh, fuck.

1139
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,000
I think I'm really getting
the hang of this now.

1140
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,760
We shall go no more a-roving.

1141
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,440
Wait...

1142
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,640
Get away from there!

1143
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,600
No, Max!

1144
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,800
It's not all doughnuts and broads.

1145
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,360
Making me...
Ah! God!

1146
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,760
Are you okay?

1147
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Okay, maybe you're right.

1148
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,920
Pathetic!

1149
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,560
"Only the dead are disconnected."

1150
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,200
Michael? Hello? Is this Michael?

1151
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:59,920
Should I dress up? Were you thinking
about going to someplace that's upscale?

1152
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,240
Because I'll have to go home
and change into something else...

1153
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,680
because all I have is my work clothes,
and I don't wanna go someplace...

1154
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,840
Hello? Hello?

1155
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,640
Hello?
