1
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,995
(woman) Why "Salomé "? You've done it.

2
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,069
You not only did it once.
You did it twice.

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,468
How many productions have you done?

4
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,597
(Pacino) Why "Salomé "?

5
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,608
"Salomé" is something I'm familiar with

6
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,678
and I have an idea for a movie

7
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,908
that intermixes the life of Wilde

8
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,644
and the life of the play

9
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,050
and the life of me
trying to make the play.

10
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,020
This is about a journey I'm gonna take.

11
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,751
Listen, that's important for me
that you say that

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,560
because to approach it not as a play
but to approach it as an inspiration.

13
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,999
That's why I'm doing the movie of it,
because I knew, you know,

14
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:13,403
to approach it just as a play,
or to approach it just as a movie,

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,034
no, it doesn't capture
what I feel is in that piece.

16
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,705
You take care of the theatre.
I take care of the movie.

17
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,182
It's gonna look a lot like
I don't know what I'm doing.

18
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,481
(phone rings)
Because I don't.

19
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,111
Yes?

20
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,564
(Pacino) "Salome" is the story
of a young princess

21
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,861
who lived in the time of Christ.

22
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:44,836
Still a virgin,
she is tantalising, seductive,

23
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:50,103
and after being insulted by King Herod,
her stepfather, at his birthday party,

24
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,235
she goes up on the moonlit terrace.

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,908
There she hears, for the first time,
the voice of John the Baptist,

26
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,181
who is being held prisoner by Herod
in an underground cell.

27
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,317
Instantly, irrationally,
she falls madly in love with him,

28
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,827
asking him to kiss her on the mouth.

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,660
A young Syrian soldier
who is in charge of the guard

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,597
is himself in love with Salomé,

31
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,863
becomes distraught at what he sees,

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,803
so distraught that he kills himself.

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,538
John the Baptist, a living
religious icon in communion with God,

34
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,443
has no use for Salomé.

35
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:32,519
He rejects her and in doing this
he puts his own fate in her hands,

36
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,815
for she seeks her revenge.

37
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:53,234
Ever since Oscar Wilde wrote this play
a hundred years ago,

38
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,705
there have been many interpretations.

39
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,832
This is one of them.

40
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,572
They walk into the music stands.
We see Yukio over there.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,377
Take that stool back where...
and you're...

42
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:09,547
You're... That thing you sit on,
they have to be at that end of Yukio.

43
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,118
Alan, I want...
Thank you.

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,722
.the reverb is not used,
is when you come down.

45
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,130
(woman) That's Salomé's stool.
We don't wanna see that colour.

46
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,672
If we could help it.
We start off with these muted colours.

47
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,970
Jessica, can you do
the whole first part without a stool?

48
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,308
Alright,

49
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,380
(Pacino) Now with her...

50
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,643
..and Salomé's entrance.

51
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,049
A prophet.
(actor) Oh, OK.

52
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,155
Let's listen to that. OK.
OK.

53
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,451
Can we hear it?
Yet who is he? 383.

54
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,992
How sweet the air is here.

55
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,621
I can breathe here.

56
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:58,335
It is so good to be rehearsing
the first day in the theatre.

57
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,599
It's just unheard of.

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,207
Why a reading?

59
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,173
(Pacino) It was just my idea.

60
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,471
My idea was

61
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,137
let's read Salomé rather than stage it.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,908
I was looking to do it
thinking of what would I do,

63
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,747
what would be appropriate, what way in?

64
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:18,325
And I said, "Let's just sit at podiums
and read this thing in modern dress."

65
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,620
I have never seen Caesar.

66
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,286
Another that comes from a town
called Cyprus and is yellow like gold.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,424
Somebody told me,
if my history researchers are correct,

68
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,060
that Oscar Wilde indeed wanted it read.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,572
(Pacino) The film set.
(man) The film set. Filming on 35mm.

70
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,675
The actual play.

71
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,073
(Pacino) I need at least five days
to shoot this film.

72
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,872
Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,780
So Monday and Tuesday
being our largest days.

74
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,854
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
half days, because we perform at night.

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,820
Right.

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,425
I'm doing a play,
I'm doing a movie of the play

77
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,256
and I'm doing a documentary
all at the same time.

78
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,695
I'm just trying to save you guys
some money, that's all.

79
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,792
It's called The Apparition,
the French title of this one.

80
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,802
Yeah. That's so cool.
Or even...

81
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,873
From Gustave Moreau's painting.
The moon is quite inspiring.

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,966
There it is. Now you're thinking
the way I'm thinking. Yes.

83
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,608
Where is Salomé?

84
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,822
Where is the Princess?

85
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:30,691
Why did she not return to the banquet
as I commanded her?

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,662
Ah!

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,791
(Estelle) Now, Roxanne.
There she is.

88
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,735
You must not look at her.

89
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,034
You are always looking at her.

90
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,104
The moon has a strange look tonight,
does she not?

91
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,515
Strange look.

92
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,242
Hey, Robert. How are you doing?

93
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,411
Good. How are you?
Good. Just waiting for Al.

94
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:01,517
A mad woman
who is seeking everywhere for lovers.

95
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,787
Our guests await us.

96
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,800
Whoa! Ah!

97
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,103
I have slipped.

98
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:20,203
That was a long time coming.
It was beautiful. Beautiful.

99
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,975
Where is Salomé?

100
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,047
Where is the Princess?

101
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,985
(Pacino) The first time I saw "Salome"

102
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,117
was the Steven Berkoff production
about 15 years ago.

103
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,696
I was astounded.
It was a great production

104
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,162
and at the same time
what really got me

105
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,702
was that it was Oscar Wilde
who wrote this play.

106
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,203
That in itself
was something that intrigued me

107
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,772
and I wanted to know more about it.

108
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,308
Then I started finding out
about Oscar Wilde more.

109
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,939
Of course, I knew of his plays and
his books but didn't go into his life...

110
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,448
..how it affects the play

111
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,681
and how we look at the play when
we know a little bit about his life.

112
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,987
Oscar Wilde came to New York City
over a hundred years ago.

113
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,860
He was this young

114
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,399
who had not written a play yet.

115
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:19,836
He was a performer, he was a raconteur,
a lecturer, he was a bon vivant.

116
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,898
Mark Twain, people like that,
were all fans of Oscar Wilde

117
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,503
because his wit had such intelligence,
such complexity to it

118
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,241
and yet so simple.

119
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,214
(woman) This is Oscar Wilde Bookshop,

120
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,480
the world's oldest
gay and lesbian bookshop.

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,248
(Pacino) Whose idea was it
to have it as Oscar Wilde?

122
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,983
The gentleman that opened the store
was Craig Rodwell

123
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:42,187
and he wanted to name the store
after Oscar Wilde

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,287
because he felt
that the name Oscar Wilde

125
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,959
would be readily identifiable
to people as a gay man.

126
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,366
I wonder what he would think
about the world now

127
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,338
and what's happened to it
and where it's gone

128
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,069
and how... how prominent
he was in all of it.

129
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,808
He was controversial,
even back in 1882.

130
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,645
When he was just a kid, 27 years old,

131
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,754
he was turning heads,
upsetting the status quo.

132
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,448
"Morality is simply
the attitude we adopt

133
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,355
towards people
whom we personally dislike."

134
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,452
"Whenever people agree with me,
I always feel I'm wrong."

135
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,065
"Young men want to be faithful
and are not."

136
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,998
"Old men want to be faithless
and cannot."

137
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,569
"The old believe everything,

138
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,106
the middleaged suspect everything,
the young know everything."

139
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,166
"The critic has to educate the public.
The artist has to educate the critic."

140
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,941
He took New York by storm.
He was the toast of the town.

141
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,710
As a matter of fact,
he became the toast of the world.

142
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,921
I feel like this is the end of the play.
Do you know what I mean?

143
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,289
I understand
what you're talking about with colour,

144
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,160
but at the beginning of the play,
she's determined to be a virgin.

145
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,130
I don't know.
I gotta see it under light, of course.

146
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,760
It's very hard to see this
in the naked, for me.

147
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,064
I know.

148
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,698
But I feel like coming out like this,
I'm coming out to do the dance,

149
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,809
and take off this...

150
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,936
You know what I mean? That's what I...
This is very different.

151
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,778
Can we get any sense of a stage light
up there in any way, shape or manner?

152
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,409
I don't need to look like a virgin,
but I need...

153
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,319
(Estelle) No, but it needs... Yeah.
Like more kind of an innocent...

154
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,224
I think that's how Salomé changes.
(Pacino) You're right.

155
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,392
Did Barry show you the schedule?
They don't have it yet.

156
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,524
What about the costuming?
(French accent) For the desert?

157
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:33,105
For the desert? For the desert scene
or for all the scenes?

158
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,640
What?
The costumes.

159
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,731
For all the scenes?

160
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,401
(man) No. You want the costume
for the desert scene.

161
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,879
For the... I thought you said "dessert".
I'm sorry. Desert.

162
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,110
When I speak like you do in French,
we can talk.

163
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,560
You see, I thought maybe I could just
try something different, you know,

164
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,994
just rehearse different actors

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,590
in the parts of Salome,
Herod, John the Baptist,

166
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,896
just to give it a different flavour,
you know,

167
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:08,497
as though they were the real characters
that existed thousands of years ago.

168
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,633
Maybe I could use that in the movie.

169
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:18,411
So what we wanna do, Barry, is we wanna
get everything back over there, OK?

170
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,416
We wanna get it all moving
from left to right.

171
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,092
What I'm trying to do, Barry,
is get everything going, get the period.

172
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,221
After all, this play takes place
thousands of years ago.

173
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,460
We're reading this thing
in modern dress.

174
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:39,971
We wanna see where it really took place.
We gotta give it some flavour.

175
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,444
This is the actual site
of Herod's palace.

176
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,944
This is where the play takes place.

177
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,675
This is what Oscar Wilde had
in his mind when he wrote the play

178
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,242
and it actually existed
thousands of years ago

179
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,517
when Jesus and John the Baptist
roamed the earth.

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,525
I was hoping to give the audience
a sense of the period

181
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,859
so when they hear the reading,
they could know from whence it comes.

182
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,094
You see, this is a way of knowing
that the characters we're playing

183
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,000
existed thousands of years ago.

184
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,311
(Pacino) Very good.
(man) No flashes, anybody.

185
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,470
(Pacino) Cut.

186
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,141
Beautiful.
Alright, this is what I want, Chris.

187
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,819
I thought going to LA was a good idea.

188
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,549
My youngest children were there.

189
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,526
I could get a chance to see them
and do the play at the same time.

190
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,926
Come on, let's go this way.
This way.

191
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,034
Let's go this way.

192
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,338
Hi, kids. Hi, Al.

193
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,805
Hi, Barry.
How are you?

194
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,071
OK. How's everything going?

195
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,179
You know, this is the problem...

196
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,645
This is the problem with my whole life.

197
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,584
What the hell does that mean?

198
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,588
How am I gonna live up to that?
(Barry) Saviour of the world.

199
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,216
Why don't you say, "Pacino is front"?
He's back.

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,725
(laughter)

201
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:13,492
How about just shooting me?
It sells tickets. It's what they want.

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,261
You're being too modest.

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,201
(Salome) There's nothing in the world
so black as thy hair.

204
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,599
Let me touch thy hair.

205
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,507
(Jokanaan)
Back! Daughter of Sodom, touch me not.

206
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,479
Profane not the temple of the Lord God.

207
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,415
(Salome) Thy hair is horrible!
That's great.

208
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,213
That's great.

209
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:38,484
Itis like a crown of thorns
which they have placed on thy forehead.

210
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,028
Itis like a knot of black serpents
writhing round thy neck.

211
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,294
(Pacino)
Five days to shoot this whole play?

212
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,267
(Barry) We have control.
We are shooting on the sound stage.

213
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,101
In the theatre we don't have control.
You have control.

214
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,265
After the show is over,
you stay and shoot,

215
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,673
or in the morning
you shoot before the show starts.

216
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,748
(Barry) You don't have time.
You're doing the play in the evening.

217
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,043
Here's the sound stage, Al.
I know, Barry.

218
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,482
I've seen these before, you know.

219
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,782
(Pacino) My goal is to take
a theatrical piece like "Salomé"

220
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,391
and make it theatrical as a movie.

221
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,588
And my challenge is to do this
while I'm doing the play at night,

222
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,890
both at the same time.

223
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,934
I know how you feel now, being in the
theatre, being in charge of everything.

224
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,002
But now I'm in charge.
Quiet, please.

225
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,629
And I'm higher than you are.
You ready?

226
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,435
Yeah.
And roll sound.

227
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,442
If you see something, let me know.
And action.

228
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,605
The Son of Man hath come.

229
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,241
(laughs)

230
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,684
(Pacino) The first thing
you see in this play

231
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,188
is the prophet, John the Baptist.

232
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,191
In Hebrew, he's called Jokanaan.
He lived in the time of Jesus.

233
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,958
As a matter of fact, he baptised Jesus
and was his cousin.

234
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:58,560
John the Baptist is being held hostage
by Herod, also known as the Tetrarch.

235
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,301
Now, "tetrarch” is a name
they called the leader of a province,

236
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,605
which Judaea was, a province of Rome,
at the time.

237
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,647
(Herod) Let them crush her
beneath their shields!

238
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,274
I will not stay. I cannot stay.

239
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,479
Why does the Tetrarch
look at me all the while

240
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,453
with his mole's eyes
under his shaking eyelids?

241
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,527
It is strange that the husband
of my mother looks at me that way.

242
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,786
I know not what it means.

243
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,420
(Pacino) Now, Salomé,
Herod's stepdaughter,

244
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:29,092
escapes the drunken party he's having
by going up onto the terrace.

245
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,433
There she hears, for the first time,
the voice of John the Baptist.

246
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,907
..shall devour the birds!

247
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,875
The day has come.

248
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,276
How beautiful
is the Princess Salomé tonight.

249
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,180
You are always looking at her.
You look at her too much.

250
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,582
(Jokanaan)
I hear upon the mountains...

251
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,815
I pray you not to look her.

252
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,857
There's something
about what's going on now that's wrong.

253
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,087
Don't do it. Stay away from it.

254
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,960
It's dangerous. It's dangerous.

255
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,933
Don't do it.
This play is full of danger.

256
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,867
The play's a warning...
from the start.

257
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,743
So, as luck would have it,

258
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,578
I was invited to Ireland
before the play started.

259
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,153
What an opportunity
to see what formed Oscar Wilde,

260
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,884
because that's where he was born,
that's where his roots were.

261
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,295
(man) You might like to look. There are
a couple of pictures of his parents.

262
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,130
This is William Wilde,
handsome... handsome young man.

263
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,071
And this is a rather idealised portrait,
I think, of Speranza,

264
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,643
Lady Wilde, his mother.

265
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:48,009
She was a very fiery nationalist,

266
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,582
Irish nationalist,

267
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,482
and a lot of people think that Oscar

268
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,056
inherited his politics from his mother.

269
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,488
Pleasure to be here.
Welcome to the park.

270
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,593
My pleasure.

271
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,493
She guides us too,
because I bump into things also, so...

272
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,828
So we were at some stage of something.

273
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,767
We were talking about something
that seemed interesting.

274
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,100
Oh, it was Oscar Wilde, wasn't it?
That's...

275
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,538
I think that was the subject,
and here's...

276
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,612
We were at something...
Oh, Oscar, finally!

277
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,077
Finally.

278
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,277
You knew I was in town, so you went
up there on the rock, didn't you?

279
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,717
I'm here doing this movie,
Wilde Salomé.

280
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,756
I just wanted to meet you and thank you.

281
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,485
Well, we love you.

282
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:38,291
We love you for everything
you've given us and we will continue to.

283
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,967
"I didn't come to Ireland
just to collect this award, of course,

284
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,696
though from what I've found out about it

285
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,433
and about your society,
I think I would have come anyway."

286
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,311
Their beaks are gilded with gold

287
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,816
and the grains that they eat
are gilded with gold also,

288
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:03,718
and their feet are stained with purple.

289
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,782
When they cry out, the rain comes,

290
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:12,730
and the moon shows herself in the
heavens when they spread their tails.

291
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,334
(boy) Oh! Pacino!
(boy 2) Al

292
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,439
Mr Pacino.

293
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,209
(mimics machine gun)

294
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,651
I'm the keeper and head of education
of the National Gallery of Ireland.

295
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,913
It's so great to see you.

296
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,387
What a pleasure to welcome you.
What a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

297
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,992
We have a little
John the Baptist corner over here.

298
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,722
This is a beautiful gallery, isn't it?
Oh, lovely.

299
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,026
(Grene) The John the Baptist here
was in the original collection,

300
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,430
so Oscar Wilde would have known it.

301
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,731
And I think
there's a really striking contrast

302
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,364
between a young, quite erotic
John the Baptist that you've got here

303
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,534
and the "about to be beheaded"
we saw around the corner.

304
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,646
(Pacino) So we can assume
that Oscar Wilde

305
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,080
actually came to this museum
and saw these paintings.

306
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,186
(man) This is Salomé.
That's right.

307
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,812
This is Salomé looking at him.
There's Salomé.

308
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,455
John the Baptist. We cast him.

309
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:20,430
He shall lead the lions by their manes!

310
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,261
Who was that who cried out?

311
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,267
The prophet, Princess.

312
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,203
The prophet?
He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid.

313
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,902
We know nothing of that, Princess. It
was the prophet Jokanaan who cried out.

314
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,070
And are lying beneath the leaves
of the forest!

315
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,876
He says terrible things about my mother,
does he not?

316
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,453
We never understand what he says,
Princess.

317
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,749
Yes, he says terrible things about her.

318
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,326
Princess, the Tetrarch prays you
to retum to the feast.

319
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,451
I will not go back.

320
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,122
Pardon me, Princess, but if you do not
return, some misfortune may happen.

321
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,962
(Jokanaan)
Rejoice not thou, land of Palestine,

322
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,469
because the rod of him
who smote thee is broken.

323
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,595
How black it is down there.

324
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,766
It must be terrible
to be in so black a pit.

325
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,900
(Jokanaan) ..and devour the birds!

326
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,844
..that I will wipe out...

327
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,948
What a strange voice.

328
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,782
I would speak with him.
Oh, what is going to happen?

329
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,790
I am sure that some misfortune
will happen.

330
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:25,193
I will but look at this strange prophet.
Men have talked so much of him.

331
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,925
Often have I heard the Tetrarch
talk of him.

332
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,298
But the Tetrarch has formally forbidden
that any man

333
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,097
should raise the cover of this well.

334
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,673
You will do this thing for me,
Narabeth, will you not?

335
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,104
You will do this thing for me.

336
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,200
I have always been kind to you.
You will do it for me.

337
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:44,306
And tomorrow when I pass in my litter
beneath the gateway of the idolbuyers,

338
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,909
1 will look at you
through the muslin veils,

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,684
it may be I will smile at you.

340
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,361
Look at me, Narabeth.

341
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,932
Look at me.

342
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:10,131
You know you will do what I ask of you.
You know it well.

343
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,406
I know you will do this thing.

344
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,176
Let the prophet come forth!

345
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:23,019
The Princess Salomé desires to see him.

346
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,500
When John the Baptist is out...
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,536
..I would like it to be... shadow.

348
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,107
Yeah.
And hear something.

349
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,701
You know, I'll be doing something
with sound and then we can just...

350
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,609
and then he goes into light.

351
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,349
(chains jangle)

352
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,292
Where is she who hath given herself
to the young men of Egypt,

353
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,561
who are clothed
in fine linen and purple,

354
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:14,037
whose shields are of gold,
whose helmets are of silver,

355
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,404
whose bodies are mighty?

356
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,341
Bid her rise up
from the bed of her abominations,

357
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,847
from the bed of her incestuousness,

358
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:28,819
that she may hear the words of him
who prepareth the way of the Lord,

359
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,821
that she may repent her
of her iniquities!

360
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:38,997
Though she will never repent
but will stick fast in her abominations;

361
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,691
bid her come!

362
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,096
Do you think he will speak again?

363
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,538
Do not stay here, Princess.
I pray you, do not stay here.

364
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,206
Who is this woman who is looking at me?

365
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,817
I will not have her look at me.

366
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:06,625
I am Salomé, daughter of Herodias,
Princess of Judaea.

367
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,494
(flapping wings)

368
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,191
Get thee behind me.

369
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,699
I hear in the palace the beating
of the wings of the angel of death.

370
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,239
Princess, I beseech thee to go within.

371
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,472
Angel of the Lord God,
what dost thou here with thy sword?

372
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:32,778
The day of him who shall die
in a robe of silver has not yet come.

373
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,784
Jokanaan.
Who speaketh?

374
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,551
Jokanaan, I am amorous of thy body.

375
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,655
Thy body's white

376
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,256
like the lilies of a field
that the mower hath never mowed.

377
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,463
Thy body's white like the snows
on the mountains of Judaea

378
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,596
that come down into the valleys.

379
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,233
Thy hair is like the cedars of Lebanon,

380
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:05,079
like the great cedars of Lebanon
that give their shade to the lions

381
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,482
and to the robbers
who would hide themselves by day.

382
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,077
No! Princess...

383
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,556
Thy mouth is like a branch of coral

384
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,026
that the fishers have found
in the twilight of the sea,

385
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,656
the coral that they keep for the kings.

386
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:29,534
There's nothing in the world
so red as thy mouth.

387
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,751
Let me kiss thy mouth.

388
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,359
Never.

389
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,830
Daughter of Babylon.

390
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,064
Daughter of Sodom.

391
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,396
Never.

392
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,402
I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

393
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,007
Princess, thou art
like a garden of myrrh.

394
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,768
Thou art the dove of all doves.

395
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,741
Look not at this man. Look not at him.

396
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,542
Do not speak such words to him.
I cannot suffer them, Princess.

397
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:13,642
Go back. Go back. That's very good,
but you gotta get closer, Benoit.

398
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:18,121
Get closer on his face. Say, "No, no,
no," Joe, and then go right into it.

399
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,555
No!
Back off. Back the camera off.

400
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,423
Forget the cues, Joe.

401
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,589
Just say, "No, no!" when you feel like
going into your line, OK? Let's go.

402
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,097
No!
No, Princess.

403
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:33,501
No, Princess.
I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

404
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,800
(chuckles)

405
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,803
(sword slashes)

406
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,915
(Pacino) Let the shoulders go.

407
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,119
Down.

408
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,219
Bang.

409
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,061
Dead.

410
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,562
The young Syrian has slain himself.

411
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,335
He has slain himself
who was my friend.

412
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:14,743
Princess, the young captain
has just killed himself.

413
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,845
Let me kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

414
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,655
Are thou not afraid,
daughter of Herodias?

415
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:30,590
Did I not tell thee
that I heard in the palace

416
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:36,168
the beating of the wings
of the angel of death?

417
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,828
And hath he not come,
the angel of death?

418
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:43,966
Let me kiss thy mouth.
I will not look at thee.

419
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:50,344
Thou art accursed, Salomé.
Thou art accursed.

420
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,020
(Pacino) You see,
"Salomé" was so important

421
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,926
for Oscar Wilde to write at the time

422
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,863
because he too,
like the character of Salomé,

423
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,492
was undergoing this transformation.

424
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,730
He was becoming another person.

425
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,033
His life was opening up.

426
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:19,202
He was awakening
to his own sexuality and spirituality.

427
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,546
Cut. Good. Good, guys.

428
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,653
So we went to London
in search of the man

429
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,120
who wrote something
so personal as "Salomé”,

430
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,952
so different from the work
he was known for.

431
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:38,056
Oscar Wilde's house. Here we are, Al.

432
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,632
We knock on the door
and see who's in there?

433
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,700
You can try.

434
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:49,197
I know they've seen us.
(man) Barry, we got the wrong house.

435
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,403
Uhhuh. I'd better not...
(laughter)

436
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,535
OK, let's go this way.

437
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,650
We came all the way here to London,

438
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,644
..and you had the wrong address.

439
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:13,726
"Oscar Wilde, wit and dramatist,
lived here."

440
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,600
Thank you, Freddy.
Can I get a signature for my wife?

441
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,331
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Sorry to be a pain in the arse.

442
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,932
We're here doing a filming
of Oscar Wilde, see?

443
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,238
Oh, right, yeah.
Did you know he lived here?

444
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,211
I didn't. I only live round the corner.

445
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,009
Isn't that something?
He lived here about 100 years ago.

446
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,480
Strange, innit?

447
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,746
Do you know who Oscar Wilde is?
Of course he does.

448
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,322
Areal drinker.
A drinker?

449
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,424
And your name is?
Neil.

450
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,220
(Pacino) This is the house
Oscar Wilde lived in

451
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,695
with his wife and his two boys.

452
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:50,325
(man) I've never doubted the fact
that when he got married to Constance,

453
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,632
my grandma,
that he was in love with her.

454
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,571
People have said it was
just a smokescreen, but, in a sense,

455
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,439
how could it have been a smokescreen?

456
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,569
They got married
before the law was changed

457
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,704
which made "indecency between two men"

458
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,284
as they called it,
rather quaintly, illegal.

459
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,047
So he didn't need, at that stage,
to have a smokescreen.

460
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,986
And why then have two children
on top of it all?

461
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,253
(Pacino) Oscar Wilde
was devoted to his children

462
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,488
and he wrote children's stories.

463
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,963
"The Happy Prince", "Nightingale
and the Rose", "The Selfish Giant"

464
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,034
became very famous
children's stories.

465
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,366
His children forever haunted him, the
fact that he missed them so terribly.

466
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,770
Not only did they take
his children from him

467
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,173
but they changed their name to Holland.

468
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,803
I think that was part
of what killed him.

469
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,451
I love these wipes you get on the bus.

470
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,255
But I think we have to go that way.

471
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,324
There we go.

472
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,726
This is it. So, Robert, Robert...
So why was he arrested here?

473
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,893
Because this is where he was staying.
He knew he was going to be arrested.

474
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,528
He was waiting for them
to come and arrest him.

475
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,538
So they came in here...

476
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,200
The police came in here.

477
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,803
(man) Chances are that tonight you
will spend your first night in prison.

478
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,782
This is a prospect
I do not believe you have faced.

479
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,452
The Victorians
were very disturbed by this man

480
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,028
who presented
a totally new sort of literature.

481
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,759
It was the literature, I suppose, if one
could call it that, of the Decadents.

482
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:32,029
It's not just gay people,
it's anyone who feels

483
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:39,271
that their part in society
is being marginalised.

484
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:43,177
I think that's...
that's his universal appeal.

485
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:49,243
He was also one of the early socialists
and a very good political thinker.

486
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:53,382
(Pacino) Oscar Wilde moved easily
in Victorian high society,

487
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,621
fascinating them
with his brilliance, his wit,

488
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,231
charming them with his conversation.

489
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,460
But beneath this Irishman's
veneer of conformity

490
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,263
lay a radical
who believed in social reform,

491
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,772
who wrote about socialism,
communism, even anarchism,

492
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,500
and who lifted the lid on things

493
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,704
the Victorians would have preferred
to keep secret.

494
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,510
And that's how he got into Reading Gaol.

495
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,847
The government feared him not for sex,
they feared him for ideas.

496
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,787
(Pacino) "Dear Bosie, you must read
this letter right through,

497
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:30,555
though each word may become to you
as the fire or knife of the surgeon

498
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,326
that makes the delicate flesh
burn or bleed.”

499
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:38,733
"It was not your father but you
who had me put into prison.”

500
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,502
It was a letter to his lover Bosie,
Lord Alfred Douglas,

501
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:48,011
a letter written in prison
out of anger and despair.

502
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,978
I'm sorry. I've kept you too long.

503
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,609
So how did Oscar Wilde get in all this
trouble? What led to this arrest?

504
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,745
That's where Bosie's father comes in.

505
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:02,759
Bosie's father, Marquis of Queensberry,
who made all the boxing rules,

506
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,693
hated Oscar Wilde and what he stood for

507
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,961
and hated the fact that his son Bosie
was having an affair with him.

508
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,698
(man) Queensberry writes this card,
Oscar Wilde posing as a sodomite,

509
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,308
or sodomist,

510
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:21,778
and Wilde could laugh,
forget it, throw it away or sue.

511
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,487
Bosie seemed to be the person
who said, you know, "Get the bastard."

512
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,683
(Pacino) Oscar Wilde didn't want
to take Bosie's father to court,

513
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,158
but Bosie convinced him
and in the end he relented.

514
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:40,220
What could he do? He was in love,
Of course, the case was dismissed.

515
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,198
However, it did encourage
Bosie's father

516
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,861
to go ahead with a counter suit.

517
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,371
His father knew of Wilde's reputation

518
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,204
and his poor relationship
with the upperclass society.

519
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,869
Oscar Wilde was being made a scapegoat.

520
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,502
He needed to be thought a lesson

521
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,549
and the Marquis of Queensberry
took advantage of this,

522
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,344
took him to court a second time.

523
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:04,912
However, things came out in that trial.

524
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:10,517
They'd encouraged the Marquis
of Queensberry to go after him again,

525
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:16,159
and he found enough witnesses,
Queensberry did,

526
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,431
that would testify
to being with Wilde physically,

527
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,166
and they caught him up.

528
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:27,735
And in the third trial
he was found guilty

529
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:32,373
of this lewd behaviour,
according to their interpretation.

530
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:40,187
Once he is found to have broken the law
against relationships between men,

531
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,952
it's an enormous relief.

532
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,256
It's given to the government on a plate
to put him away.

533
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:49,857
I'm afraid his news is not helpful.
He has failed.

534
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,767
He says that you will be arrested.

535
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,929
You must leave now, Oscar.

536
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,270
He says, however, there's
one further thing you should know.

537
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,739
They're deliberately choosing to delay.

538
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,317
How long?
Until this evening.

539
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,885
It would suit them better
if you would flee.

540
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,479
This brief opening is offered.
The last boat is at six o'clock.

541
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,923
(Pacino) And there are his friends
telling him, "You must go, Oscar."

542
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:15,993
But he chose to stay.

543
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:21,964
I think maybe he had too much pride
to be a fugitive for life.

544
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,767
The point is that, just at this moment,
just at this moment itself,

545
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,809
George is saying
that when they come to arrest you,

546
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,935
it's in nobody's interest
that I myself should be here.

547
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,149
(Pacino) He stayed in that room

548
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,980
because he couldn't believe
it was happening to him.

549
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,214
How could he, Oscar Wilde,
the pet of society,

550
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,316
the premier playwright of his time,
be put in prison?

551
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,328
(Stoppard) It's also possible
that he might have seen

552
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,558
a bit further into the future

553
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,330
and thought,
"Somebody's got to do it. I'l do it."

554
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,065
The person who becomes the martyr.

555
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,240
Me as Oscar Wilde. Can you imagine?

556
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,908
Somebody's gotta do it.

557
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:15,209
Finally the police came
and they actually took him to prison,

558
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:19,187
where he served two years
of hard labour.

559
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:23,124
(man) There are certain similarities
between the judge in Wilde's case

560
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,756
and the Rosenberg judge,
in that you have, suddenly,

561
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,097
this sort of thin veneer
of judicial impartiality falls

562
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,673
and at the sentencing you realise
the judge has just been waiting

563
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:39,369
to pass sentence
and really get this guy.

564
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,208
As far as I can remember,
the judge made a comment of regret

565
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,180
that he couldn't send him to prison
for longer than two years.

566
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:51,313
It was Victorian hypocrisy, I suppose,
in a way, at its worst.

567
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:56,292
They were going to eradicate
every trace of Oscar Wilde.

568
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:02,998
(Pacino) The irony here is that prison
informed two of his greatest works,

569
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,060
"De Profundis"
and "The Ballad of Reading Gaol".

570
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,674
"The Ballad of Reading Gaol"
is an epic poem

571
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:14,712
which describes a man who is going
to be hung for killing his wife.

572
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:21,077
"He did not wear his scarlet coat
For blood and wine are red

573
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:26,020
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead

574
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,721
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
And murdered in her bed.

575
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:36,268
I walked, with other souls in pain,
Within another ring,

576
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:41,339
And was wondering if the man had done
A great or little thing

577
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:47,139
When a voice behind me whispered low,
"That fellow's got to swing."

578
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:53,149
The man had killed the thing he loved
And so he had to die."

579
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,420
(Estelle) You're too much
to the right side. Make your entrance.

580
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,319
(Estelle) You're too much
to the right side. Make your entrance.

581
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,946
What are you talking about?
Can't let her do that?

582
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,252
Make an entrance.
What are you talking about?

583
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm talking about Roxanne.
I know.

584
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,730
But we have to talk about
what we're doing, darling.

585
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,800
OK.
We're all coming out into a terrace

586
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,527
because I said,
"Let's go to the terrace.”

587
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:15,334
So she's following me wondering
what's going on on the terrace?

588
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,239
What's been happening before this
at the banquet?

589
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,336
What have we been doing?
Right.

590
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,278
We're coming from a banquet.

591
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,421
I thought I was coming as Jessica.
What are we doing? What is this?

592
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,718
I thought this was
just like a dinner party.

593
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,019
I know.
But now it's like this weird thing.

594
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,527
I know.
What's going on?

595
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,757
Well, it's a party, it's a film,
it's a mix of everything.

596
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,859
But I don't understand.
You don't need to understand tonight.

597
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,165
(Barry) Well, Al is doing
his method thing,

598
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,331
you know, with these actors here,
and kind of experimenting.

599
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,740
He's kind of trying to give them
the feeling of the banquet.

600
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,713
(Pacino) Salomé is here
at this banquet, at this party,

601
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,181
given by Herod and his group.

602
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,685
She's a young girl who's transitioning.

603
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:07,520
And here is Herod
lusting after his stepdaughter.

604
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,855
Of course,
Herodias sees what's going on.

605
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,692
Her husband is actually
eyeballing her daughter.

606
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,698
You see, I think
that's what it's about.

607
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,963
I think that's what we come
to the terrace with.

608
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,040
We're carrying these feelings with us.

609
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,141
And that's Herod's entrance.

610
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,476
(guard 2) We must hide the body.
The Tetrarch must not see it.

611
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,709
The Tetrarch will not come
to this place.

612
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,376
He never comes on the terrace.

613
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,681
He is too much afraid of the prophet.

614
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,784
(Herod) Salomé!

615
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,754
Where is Salomé?

616
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,156
Where is the princess?

617
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:54,568
Why did she not return to the banquet
as I commanded her?

618
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,170
Ah!

619
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,300
There she is.

620
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,746
You must not look at her.
You are always looking at her.

621
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:16,884
The moon has a strange look tonight,
does she not?

622
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:24,166
She is like a mad woman
who is seeking everywhere for lovers.

623
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,336
She is naked too.

624
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,603
No. The moon is like the moon,
that is all.

625
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,709
Let us go within.
You have nothing to do here.

626
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,416
I will stay here.

627
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:52,255
Manasseh, lay carpets there.

628
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,161
Light torches.

629
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:59,135
Bring forth the ivory tables
and the tables of jasper.

630
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,295
The air here is delicious.

631
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,773
I will drink more wine with my guests.

632
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,841
(sighs)

633
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,572
Itis cold here.

634
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,615
There is a wind blowing, is there not?

635
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,551
No, there is no wind.

636
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:20,181
I say there is a wind that blows

637
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:26,458
and I hear in the air
something like the beating of wings.

638
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,534
Like the beating of vast wings.
Do you not hear it?

639
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,294
Itis the Lord!
(flapping wings)

640
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,570
I hear nothing.

641
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,139
I hear it no longer.

642
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,536
But I heard it.

643
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,943
(flapping wings)
No, I hear it again.

644
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,884
Do you not hear it?
Just like the beating of wings.

645
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,218
I tell you, there is nothing.
You are ill.

646
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,383
I am not ill.

647
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,886
It is your daughter who is sick.

648
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,625
Never have I seen her so pale.

649
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,168
(Jokanaan) Harlot!

650
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:07,534
You must not look at her,
I have already said so.

651
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,663
(Jokanaan)
..a multitude of men.

652
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,436
Let the people take stones and stone her

653
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,411
and then all women shall learn

654
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:20,074
not to imitate her abominations!

655
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:24,348
Do you hear what he says against me?
You allow him to revile your wife?

656
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,220
He has said nothing against you.

657
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,817
Besides, he is a very great prophet.

658
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,295
I do not believe in prophets.

659
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,095
Can a man tell what will come to pass?
No man knows it.

660
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:40,865
But I think you are afraid of him.
I am not afraid of him.

661
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:44,340
I am afraid of no man.
I tell you, you are afraid of him.

662
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,342
If you are not afraid of him,
why do you not deliver him to the Jews

663
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,004
who for these six months past
have been clamouring for him?

664
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,641
Truly, my Lord, it were better
to deliver him into our hands.

665
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,776
Yes, my lord.
Enough on this subject.

666
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,187
I've already given you my answer.
I will not deliver him into your hands.

667
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,886
He is a holy man.
He is a man who has seen God.

668
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:07,829
(Pacino) You see,
Herodias and Herod are living in sin.

669
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,299
He actually murdered his own brother
to marry Herodias,

670
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:15,873
and the prophet John the Baptist
knows this and he rails about it.

671
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,499
Of course, Herodias wants him gone,
wants him dead,

672
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,341
but Herod has this infatuation
with John the Baptist.

673
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,281
He's enamoured with him.
He believes in his spirituality.

674
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,854
He knows he's a holy man
and he fears him.

675
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,753
He fears him to such a point

676
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,794
that he keeps him locked up in a pit
so he can control him.

677
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,067
We have to have more time with Al
for the play,

678
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:57,739
because the reason that we can do this
at all is because the play's being done.

679
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,976
If we don't have the rehearsal
to do the play

680
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:03,281
and if all the energy's going to go
on the film, we're fucked.

681
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:07,222
We're doing the play purely because
Al wants to make the movie.

682
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,723
That's the reason, Robert.

683
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,022
Well, Barry,
that may be what you think it is,

684
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,460
but, I promise you,
that's not my understanding.

685
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:17,933
Al, do you wanna look at this? This is
what Jill will do for the announcement.

686
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,731
Like we did at the Barrymore.

687
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,897
(Pacino)
Welcome to the Wadsworth Theater.

688
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,337
I love my announcement.

689
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:28,275
Ladies and gentlemen, you don't
have to turn off your cellphones

690
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,007
because we realise
that all of you are doctors,

691
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,312
because you're the only people
who could afford to come to the show.

692
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,545
So you can keep 'em on

693
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,145
because we know that doctors
get calls, emergency calls.

694
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,156
(laughter)

695
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,925
Doctors and dentists are coming
because they can afford the prices.

696
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,523
Did you hear about the price of
these fucking tickets? Are you crazy?

697
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,905
I'm in the union.

698
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,543
(both) One, two, three.

699
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,612
I feel like working on the technical...
some of the dance.

700
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,080
I'm not ready for that.
(Estelle) You have to.

701
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:09,483
I'm not, because, I mean,
what can I say? There's nothing to say.

702
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,419
When the words are coming out of you...

703
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:14,548
We've got that other one
where you're going around him

704
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,456
and it's seductive and all that.

705
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,586
I wanna one that's not seductive.

706
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,723
OK. That it's just like...
It's just... It's just a little girl.

707
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:23,959
OK.

708
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:29,199
My vision was the camera
was a bit simpler. It was here.

709
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,742
(Benoit) That's better.

710
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,176
I know. Oh, yeah?
Oh, you can do it with that thing?

711
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,112
That's a beautiful thing.
Little bit to this way.

712
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,776
Salomé, come,
drink a little wine with me.

713
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:47,221
I'm not thirsty, Tetrarch.
I have here a wine that is exquisite.

714
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,657
Caesar himself sent it me.

715
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,992
Dip into it thy little red lips
that I may drain the cup.

716
00:43:54,131 --> 00:44:01,731
I play Herod because crazy emperors
sort of work for me.

717
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,366
Oscar Wilde creates this unstable king

718
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,378
who really is not in control of himself
and his emotions.

719
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,540
He's living
on the third rail of passion.

720
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,277
This guy's warped and jaded,

721
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:20,949
but he's also childish
and witty and sophisticated,

722
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,617
like Oscar Wilde.

723
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,388
How did you develop
the voice you're using for Herod?

724
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,328
I don't know.
Where did it come from?

725
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,160
I don't know.
Is he fay at all?

726
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,737
Does he have a...
a certain bisexuality to him?

727
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,603
Does he have that kind of power?
Of course.

728
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,369
Of course. Well, why of course?

729
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,104
Oh, Salomé.

730
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,183
Salomé, dance for me.

731
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:53,356
If you dance for me, you may ask of me
what you will and I will give it you.

732
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,981
Should I look at him? Shouldn't 1?

733
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,652
You can even give a little look
and then look back. OK?

734
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,786
OK, yeah. One more?
Alright.

735
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:07,099
If you dance for me, you may ask of me
what you will and I will give it you.

736
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,435
Will you indeed give me
whatsoever I shall ask, Tetrarch?

737
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,543
I swear, Salomé.

738
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,105
By what do you swear, Tetrarch?

739
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,910
By your great acting.

740
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,348
Cut. OK, fantastic.

741
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,746
We only got two days left?

742
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:28,382
You cannot expect me
to shoot this movie in two days.

743
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:31,621
Look how long it's taken to do this.
This is huge.

744
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,357
Well, I think once this is set up
in the next hour or so,

745
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,262
I think it's gonna move much faster.

746
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,734
Just the first day, everybody's...
No, it's...

747
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,531
It's really just
you can't do the impossible.

748
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,245
I'm later than shit.

749
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,584
(man) He's here. He's arrived.

750
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,388
Hi. Welcome.
Thank you.

751
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,514
Hi.

752
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,594
Opening night.

753
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:11,961
(man) Just a nice actor talk.
Salomé is really method.

754
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,333
No, that's Herodias.
Salomé is a virgin.

755
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,306
I put my costume on in the order...
(man) 15 minutes. 15 minutes, please.

756
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,911
The same order every night.

757
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:26,745
I won't elaborate on what more I do
because I do more things that are odd.

758
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,352
This is very private.

759
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,286
..shit about this for a month. This is
called the Jewish cistern down here.

760
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:35,757
This is a method actor.
Look at all these notes.

761
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:39,193
This guy has about five lines
in the whole play.

762
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,822
I played Hamlet once,
I didn't have that many notes.

763
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,161
(laughter)

764
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,166
(sings sustained note)

765
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,836
(man) One, two, one two...
Actually we do. I think it's...

766
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,341
Wait, wait. Slipping out.
It's gonna be fun when these suckers...

767
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,606
Once I played Richard Ill and somebody
had done something to my hair

768
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,444
and by the third act,
when I put the crown on,

769
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,951
my hair started to rise
because I had a ridiculous hairstyle,

770
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,419
where they curled it,
because I was doing a movie,

771
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,321
and so they made my hair very curly,

772
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,257
s0 when it dried,
it just started popping up.

773
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:12,329
People thought it was acting.

774
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,695
It was in a way. Everything's acting.

775
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,735
Look right this way.
I'm going blind here.

776
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,437
(man) One, two.
Ritual.

777
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,239
(man) You're hearing something
in the dressing rooms?

778
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,504
One, two...
My heart.

779
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:30,478
It's my heart you're hearing.

780
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:34,551
(announcer) We thank you
for your cooperation. Enjoy the show.

781
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:36,620
(dramatic music)

782
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,316
How beautiful
is the Princess Salomé tonight.

783
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:46,761
Look at the moon.
How strange the moon seems.

784
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,990
(Pacino) Well, here we are in LA,

785
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,966
presenting this avantgarde
piece of work to an audience,

786
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,266
and I guess we're presenting it
in an unusual way.

787
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,034
I mean, this is a staged reading,

788
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,837
and one just wonders,
how is this gonna come off,

789
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,810
how is it gonna be received?

790
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,577
I mean, Richard Strauss
wrote this great opera

791
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,687
based on Wilde's play "Salomé".

792
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:14,656
And he too was obsessed with Wilde,
so much so he had to write this opera.

793
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:18,696
He used Wilde's original text
for his libretto.

794
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,820
Now, I don't think there's a time

795
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,765
this opera isn't being performed
somewhere in the world.

796
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,872
Now here we are staging a reading.

797
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,480
We don't have the opera.

798
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,606
We have no music,
only podiums and words.

799
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,551
But, you know, I think for an audience,
it is a wonderful thing to hear words,

800
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:49,524
especially in verse
and especially Oscar Wilde's words.

801
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:51,493
It's like you can close your eyes,

802
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:55,122
like when you're at a concert
you become mesmerised with the music.

803
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:59,134
Well, here you can become entranced
by the words.

804
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:04,709
You see, it's the magic of the words
that eventually get you to the feeling.

805
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,297
You were wonderful.

806
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,035
I love Oscar Wilde.
I feel as though I know him.

807
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,244
I would've loved him. I love him.

808
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,416
Because of the civility in him,

809
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:53,457
his civility, his... his fragile power.

810
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,128
(Pacino) "I had given you my life,

811
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:08,398
and to gratify the lowest and most
contemptible of all human passions,

812
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:13,466
hatred and vanity and greed,
you had thrown it away."

813
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:16,046
This is the letter
"De Profundis” is about,

814
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:20,310
those feelings he had
about being so betrayed by Bosie,

815
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,920
who never visited him in prison.

816
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,816
So after serving two years in prison,
he comes out and what does he do?

817
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:33,055
He visits Bosie, of all people,
in Italy, the guy who never visited him

818
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,463
and who was responsible
for his incarceration.

819
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:40,162
Oscar writes Robbie, Robbie Ross,
a letter and says,

820
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:43,173
and I quote just from memory,
"My going back to Bosie was inevitable."

821
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:43,833
and I quote just from memory,
"My going back to Bosie was inevitable."

822
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,842
"I need to be loved,
live in an atmosphere of love."

823
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,913
"He offered me love,
so I went back to him."

824
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,950
"How could I not love him?
He's ruined my life."

825
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,320
This mysterious adoration

826
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,788
This mysterious adoration

827
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,085
for this, you know,
completely worthless human being.

828
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:05,526
I don't think Bosie's behaviour
is difficult to explain.

829
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,832
I think it's very easy to explain.
He was a shit.

830
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,094
I think it's very easy to explain.
He was a shit.

831
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,766
It's not that complicated.
The guy was a shit.

832
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:20,675
But the passion for this little shit,
you know, is... ignoble.

833
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,514
(Pacino) Bosie left Oscar in Italy

834
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,384
and Oscar travelled to Paris alone.

835
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,857
So here is Oscar Wilde's
last resting place.

836
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,417
So here is Oscar Wilde's
last resting place.

837
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,654
This is the room he died in

838
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:44,666
and it's almost preserved
exactly the way it was.

839
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,370
He said to the hotel, he said,

840
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,236
He said to the hotel, he said,

841
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:53,401
"Either I or the wallpaper
will have to go."

842
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,045
(Pacino) He spent the last eight months
of his life here.

843
00:51:59,149 --> 00:51:59,483
He was totally without money,

844
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,180
He was totally without money,

845
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,811
dying from an ear infection

846
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,151
which he contracted
while he was in prison

847
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,090
because of a lack of treatment there.

848
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,996
He developed complications.

849
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:12,326
He developed complications.

850
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:17,560
So, in a way,
it's prison that killed him.

851
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,636
He was 46 years old.

852
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,939
It took a while for him to, you know,

853
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,508
until he was sure
that he could trust people,

854
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,168
until he was sure
that he could trust people,

855
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,745
letting them know who he was
and who he had been.

856
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,541
You know, I mean, it's...

857
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:34,640
You know, obviously just sort of waiting
to go, I mean, waiting to die.

858
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,021
Because his income
had just stopped overnight.

859
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:37,283
Because his income
had just stopped overnight.

860
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:42,621
I mean, the two plays which were smash
hits the day before he was arrested

861
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,455
were just taken off, of course.

862
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:47,690
He was the invisible man
from that moment.

863
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,391
He had no income whatsoever.

864
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,533
(Pacino) Certainly at the time
he was writing,

865
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,865
(Pacino) Certainly at the time
he was writing,

866
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,461
he was the most prestigious writer
of his times

867
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:58,041
and was promoted
as the next Shakespeare.

868
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:01,510
Oscar Wilde and Shakespeare.

869
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,046
And, you know,
who can take on Shakespeare?

870
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,811
And, you know,
who can take on Shakespeare?

871
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,646
The Importance of Being Earnest
is the funniest play ever written

872
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,550
and what you could do with nothing.

873
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,646
He prided himself.
It is about nothing, you know.

874
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,192
Why must you have a subject?

875
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:15,988
Why must you have a subject?

876
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:20,825
The world takes everybody
and breaks them in the end,

877
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,901
but afterwards many are stronger
at the broken places.

878
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:27,704
One doesn't feel that about Wilde.

879
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,000
One doesn't feel that about Wilde.

880
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,267
The world did indeed take him
and break him,

881
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:35,710
but afterwards he was not stronger
at the broken places.

882
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:39,773
(Pacino) "The gods had given me
almost everything,

883
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:40,217
but I let myself be lured into long
spells of senseless and sensual ease.”

884
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:46,122
but I let myself be lured into long
spells of senseless and sensual ease.”

885
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,691
"Tired of being on the heights,

886
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:52,729
I deliberately went to the depths
in search for new sensation.”

887
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,025
I deliberately went to the depths
in search for new sensation.”

888
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:57,959
"What the paradox was to me
in the sphere of thought,

889
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,197
perversity became to me
in the sphere of passion.”

890
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:05,242
"Desire, at the end,
was a malady or a madness or both."

891
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,176
"Desire, at the end,
was a malady or a madness or both."

892
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,905
"I grew careless
of the lives of others."

893
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:14,177
"I took pleasure where it pleased me
and passed on.”

894
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,310
"I forgot that every little action
of the common day

895
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,388
makes or unmakes character

896
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,583
makes or unmakes character

897
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:23,523
and that therefore
what one has done in a secret chamber,

898
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,154
one has someday
to cry aloud on the housetop.”

899
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,664
"I allowed pleasure to dominate me."

900
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,901
"I ended in horrible disgrace.”

901
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,925
"I ended in horrible disgrace.”

902
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,601
You know, you feel a debt

903
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,233
to the writers of the world,

904
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:43,413
you feel a debt especially if you are...
anybody, of course,

905
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,175
you feel a debt especially if you are...
anybody, of course,

906
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,750
but an actor and a playwright...

907
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,688
Oh, man, that is a marriage,
that is a relationship

908
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,926
that is so spectacular and special.

909
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:56,085
that is so spectacular and special.

910
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,320
I know Shakespeare had it
with his actors.

911
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:05,232
You sort of lock souls
and you communicate in this way.

912
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,326
You are... You are...

913
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,542
..half of each other.

914
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,744
What is it about Oscar Wilde that makes
us want to know more about him?

915
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,585
He just wasn't around long enough.

916
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:22,711
He just wasn't around long enough.

917
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:28,147
That candle went out
and it was put out.

918
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:30,327
(Barry) So, Robert,
how were the reviews?

919
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,193
(Barry) So, Robert,
how were the reviews?

920
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,097
(Robert) The reviews are good.
"LA Times "?

921
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:34,791
(Robert) The reviews are good.
"LA Times "?

922
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,730
(Robert) The "LA Times" wasn't great,

923
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:41,771
but there's a fabulous review today
in the "Hollywood Reporter”.

924
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:45,900
There was a great review
in the Daily News.

925
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:46,610
Yeah, the Times was mean.

926
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,975
Yeah, the Times was mean.

927
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,739
But he obviously just wants
to make a name for himself.

928
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,150
What you get,
what you don't get, it's fine.

929
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,718
OK. Good, OK.

930
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,122
Mike, they didn't bring me
the right shoes that I wear in the play,

931
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,681
Mike, they didn't bring me
the right shoes that I wear in the play,

932
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,953
so I'm wearing different shoes.
That's OK.

933
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:10,364
The red things, the red roses,
I have the black... cover of them,

934
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,635
so the red doesn't show through these.

935
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:13,433
so the red doesn't show through these.

936
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,700
OK, so we should find that?
Is that something we have?

937
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,639
I just took what they gave me.
Rose petals, black rose.

938
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,576
Call Mike, Mike Quinn, get it done.

939
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,748
(Estelle) We have a play to do here
and you were supposed to be here

940
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:27,183
(Estelle) We have a play to do here
and you were supposed to be here

941
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:31,151
to work with people,
to inspire them, to excite them.

942
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:34,418
But you call the rehearsal
indiscriminately, my darling.

943
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,583
You can't just do that.

944
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,261
You should have scheduled the movie
after the run of the play.

945
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,891
You should have scheduled the movie
after the run of the play.

946
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,398
Oh, Estelle, for God's sakes.

947
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,503
We're gonna have to cancel a performance
because I'm thinking

948
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,773
that this is a lot of work here,
and we're getting started late

949
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,605
that this is a lot of work here,
and we're getting started late

950
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,369
and it's gonna be a lot of work.

951
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,706
I gotta talk to Robert
because it wasn't...

952
00:56:55,846 --> 00:57:00,943
I don't think it's a wise thing
to just shortchange the movie.

953
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,286
(man) I think some of your audience
members are gonna have a problem

954
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:04,220
(man) I think some of your audience
members are gonna have a problem

955
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,947
with this stagereading aspect,

956
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,822
and I heard some of this feedback,
so, for me, was I put off at first?

957
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,363
Yes. Why? Because the perception
is you expect more, you expect better.

958
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:14,798
Why aren't you off book? And then you
see that you pretty much are off book.

959
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,462
Why aren't you off book? And then you
see that you pretty much are off book.

960
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,694
So what's the deal?

961
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:23,137
Then you understand it's a creative
choice on the part of you and Estelle.

962
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,299
But why?
It's an interpretation. It's a style.

963
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,944
It's our captain, sire.

964
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,308
It's our captain, sire.

965
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:32,040
He is the young Syrian whom
you made captain only three days ago.

966
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,345
I gave no order
that he should be slayed.

967
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,077
(Robert) The public are furious.

968
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,746
Estelle's been attacked
by members of the public yesterday.

969
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,457
(Pacino) Why?

970
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:40,923
(Pacino) Why?

971
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:44,187
A couple going out of the theatre.
Because it wasn't a production.

972
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,956
They said I should be ashamed of myself
for putting it on.

973
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,965
It wasn't clear to me whether
they were really upset about the play

974
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:52,969
or about the fact that it was a reading,
I couldn't really tell.

975
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,027
or about the fact that it was a reading,
I couldn't really tell.

976
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,299
(Pacino) Reading.
They don't understand that.

977
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,703
No, they didn't get it.

978
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,334
(man) Are you getting that feeling
from the audience?

979
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,640
(Barry) What, that they feel like
they're being ripped off?

980
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,482
Yeah.

981
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:05,710
Yeah.

982
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,020
(Pacino) Sometimes
it just stops for me, you know,

983
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:16,183
and I just don't know what I'm doing,
I don't know why I'm doing it.

984
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,994
I think, more importantly,
I don't know why.

985
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,689
I think, more importantly,
I don't know why.

986
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:25,360
Something is pushing me forward
and... and... and I'm saying,

987
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,334
"Well, they're gonna get the movie."

988
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:30,463
And you say, "Well,
what are they gonna get in the movie...

989
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,334
..that they're not getting
in the play?"

990
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:38,346
How is the movie
going to make the play...

991
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:40,610
Because it's not a movie
about a play.

992
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,653
It's a movie about... inspiration.

993
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,985
It's a movie about... inspiration.

994
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:50,082
There's something about my struggle
that's not clear.

995
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,494
Something happened to me
when I saw this play.

996
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,166
I felt as though I had found a friend,
someone I wanted to know,

997
00:58:56,166 --> 00:59:00,262
I felt as though I had found a friend,
someone I wanted to know,

998
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:05,206
someone that was prophetic,

999
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,678
because he was expressing
his own destiny in this play.

1000
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:08,701
because he was expressing
his own destiny in this play.

1001
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,678
It was as though he knew
what was gonna happen to him.

1002
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,645
(bell rings)
Mark, please.

1003
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,722
Mark.

1004
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,191
OK, we're set.
Set.

1005
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:21,453
OK, we're set.
Set.

1006
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,548
Action.

1007
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,491
Salomé, come.

1008
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,620
Come, eat a little fruit with me.

1009
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:34,337
I love to see in a fruit
the mark of thy little teeth.

1010
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:35,168
I love to see in a fruit
the mark of thy little teeth.

1011
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,104
I am not hungry, Tetrarch.

1012
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,834
You see how you have brought up
this daughter of yours?

1013
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:43,038
My daughter and I come of a royal race.

1014
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,672
As for thee,
thy father was a camel driver!

1015
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:46,850
He was also a robber!

1016
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,214
He was also a robber!

1017
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,615
Thou liest.
Thou knowest well it is true.

1018
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,487
Salomé, come. Sit next to me.

1019
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,185
I will give thee
the throne of thy mother.

1020
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:58,887
(laughter)

1021
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,766
I am not tired, Tetrarch.

1022
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,392
(Herodias)
You see what she thinks of you?

1023
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,732
Salomé.

1024
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,875
Why did you wanna use the stage?
It's just too many words.

1025
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,343
Why did you wanna use the stage?
It's just too many words.

1026
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,740
Alright, just keep going.

1027
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:18,712
I mean, I don't know what to...
I mean, I wish I could just say...

1028
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,807
Thou speakest at random.
I will not stay here. Let us go within.

1029
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,920
Dance for me, Salomé.

1030
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,864
I will not have her dance.

1031
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,501
I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch.

1032
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:37,899
I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch.

1033
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:42,399
If you dance for me,

1034
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:45,635
you may ask of me what you will

1035
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,972
and I will give it you,

1036
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,013
even unto the half of my kingdom.

1037
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,539
even unto the half of my kingdom.

1038
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,385
You swear it, Tetrarch?

1039
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,526
I swear it, Salomé.

1040
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:02,822
I swear it, Salomé.

1041
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:06,793
Do not dance, my daughter.

1042
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,126
By what will you swear, Tetrarch?

1043
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:15,038
By my life, by my crown, by my gods.

1044
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:15,504
By my life, by my crown, by my gods.

1045
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,835
You have sworn, Tetrarch.

1046
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:22,138
I have sworn, Salomé.

1047
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,077
(Bono) The subject matter of "Salomé",

1048
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,551
which is really the destructive power
of sexuality, you know,

1049
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,677
which is really the destructive power
of sexuality, you know,

1050
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:32,652
the personification of desire
that can destroy you,

1051
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:37,818
really turned out to be deeply prophetic
to his own life.

1052
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:40,697
I mean, he thought
that he could write away

1053
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:40,890
I mean, he thought
that he could write away

1054
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,400
the destructive power of sexuality
in this play,

1055
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,004
and he failed in the play
and he failed in his life.

1056
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,300
(woman) Je suis Salomé...

1057
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:53,206
(Pacino) Oscar Wilde
wrote "Salomé" in French.

1058
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:55,334
He actually wrote it
for Sarah Bernhardt,

1059
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,412
the great French actress of the time.

1060
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:59,482
(woman speaks French)

1061
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,987
I think it's so interesting that he
wrote it in French, I mean, that it's...

1062
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:11,357
There was something about that language
and maybe even just the sound of it.

1063
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:15,124
Very daring of him. Write in French?

1064
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,598
His French wasn't that good, you know.

1065
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,702
(woman speaks French)

1066
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:23,173
Wow.

1067
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,743
Looking at these sketches,
they were all naked.

1068
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,971
All the Salomés were naked. See?

1069
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:35,578
I'm OK doing nudity. I'm confused.

1070
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,919
I feel like it's working right now
and I'm confused with the whole reading,

1071
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,322
if that's just gonna
completely turn the audience off,

1072
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,191
if they see like this dance

1073
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:49,288
and then all of a sudden
I'm completely naked.

1074
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,993
(Jokanaan)
Rejoice not thou, land of Palestine,

1075
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,901
because the rod of him
who smote thee is broken.

1076
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,236
For from the seed of the serpent
shall come forth a basilisk

1077
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:03,904
and that which is born of it
shall devour the birds!

1078
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,015
Let us go within!

1079
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,084
The voice of that man maddens me.

1080
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:11,483
I will not have my daughter dance
while he is continually crying out.

1081
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:15,582
I will not have her dance
while you look at her in such a fashion.

1082
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:18,092
In a word, I will not have her dance!

1083
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:21,562
Do not rise, my wife, my queen.

1084
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:27,001
It will avail thee nothing. I will not
go within till she hath danced.

1085
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,074
Dance, Salomé.

1086
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,907
Dance for me.

1087
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,045
I am ready, Tetrarch.

1088
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,652
(plays slow tune)

1089
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,073
(music quickens)

1090
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:03,793
(sighs)

1091
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:09,932
Wonderful.

1092
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,634
You see?
She has danced for me, your daughter.

1093
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:42,731
Come near, Salomé.

1094
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,699
Come near
that I may give you your reward.

1095
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:49,735
I pay the dancers well.

1096
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,103
I shall pay thee royally.

1097
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:58,238
I shall give thee
whatsoever thy soul desireth.

1098
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,809
Speak.

1099
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,583
I would that they presently bring me
in a silver charger...

1100
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,951
In a silver charger?

1101
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:14,920
Surely, yes, in a silver charger.
She is charming, is she not?

1102
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:21,066
But what would you have them bring you
in a silver charger? Tell me the thing.

1103
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:26,665
Whatsoever it may be,
my treasures belong to thee.

1104
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,109
What is it, Salomé?

1105
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,582
The head of Jokanaan.

1106
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,846
(thunder / Herodias gasps)

1107
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,680
That is well said, my daughter.

1108
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:46,159
No, no, Salomé, you do not ask me that.

1109
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:51,200
Don't listen to your mother's voice.
(phone rings)

1110
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,462
Yeah?

1111
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,537
Now what?

1112
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:59,265
What do you mean? Well, what happened?

1113
01:07:59,409 --> 01:07:59,842
I'm gonna go mad.
Yes.

1114
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:00,934
I'm gonna go mad.
Yes.

1115
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:04,571
And I want two cameras.
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

1116
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,649
What we said, yeah.
Getting everybody, that's what I want.

1117
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,084
This is what we are waiting to do.
Well, we're gonna do it now.

1118
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,246
Because I only have these people
till five o'clock.

1119
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,551
So we've got to do it now.

1120
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:18,024
We were ready to do that before.
We're just ready.

1121
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,151
OK.

1122
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:23,823
Do you want to rehearse now or not?
These people don't need rehearsal.

1123
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:27,733
Do you now want to
rehearse with a sound check?

1124
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:33,309
This is crazy. I got four days
to shoot a 90minute play.

1125
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,705
Money issues.

1126
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:40,408
In order to have the time that you need,

1127
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:44,180
it would make sense to shoot out

1128
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,119
the soldiers, the Jews...

1129
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:50,351
Everything, everything, everything
is money. Everything is money.

1130
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,896
No matter what you say or do or ask,
it's all about money.

1131
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,522
It's driving me crazy.

1132
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,259
I have been on this earth now,
what, 48 years...

1133
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:04,205
It's money, baby. Everything's money.

1134
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,709
(Robert) It would make sense
to shoot out the soldiers...

1135
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:14,306
These guys, I don't know what they want.
They expect me to do this in five days.

1136
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:20,412
I don't understand it,
how they can be so... filmicly ignorant.

1137
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,992
(Barry) A lot of the stuff
was on Al at the beginning.

1138
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,254
Yeah, but that doesn't make
any difference.

1139
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,956
Because it's not about that.
It's about when I'm ready to function.

1140
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:32,193
When you first started, I'm cold.
Don't you understand?

1141
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,099
What about my acting?

1142
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:37,662
"Oh, we got him. He is on camera."
It doesn't mean a fuck... thing to me.

1143
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,833
It's what I'm doing on camera
that means something.

1144
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,810
Please, please, it's crazy.

1145
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:47,541
I am a slave to my word
and my word is the word of...

1146
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,811
Cut.
What's going on?

1147
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,943
Sorry, guys. Can we cut?

1148
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:55,582
I'm mad at the producers,
that's who I'm mad at, not you people.

1149
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:57,693
It's the producers. Fuck 'em.

1150
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,061
I have to function two ways.

1151
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,292
One as a director,
one as dealing with the camera,

1152
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,664
and the other as an actor.

1153
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:09,295
I'm not ready in the first take
todoit.

1154
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:14,375
"Oh, we got Al, so let's get
everybody else." You didn't get me.

1155
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,035
You got me, my face.

1156
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:17,977
You didn't get my soul.

1157
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,847
That's what we're doing here and that's
what's gotta light up, let me tell you.

1158
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,248
Because if it doesn't,
we don't have a movie.

1159
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,482
Let us go within. You are sick.

1160
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,116
They will say at Rome that you are mad.

1161
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,749
Let us go within, I tell you.

1162
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:38,866
Ah! It is cold here.

1163
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:43,438
There is an icy wind,
and I hear in the air...

1164
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:47,908
Wherefore do I hear in the air
this beating of wings?

1165
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:52,140
One might fancy a bird,

1166
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,775
a huge black bird
that hovers over the terrace.

1167
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,080
Why can I not see it?

1168
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:00,747
We're not gonna shoot the whole play.
Of course we're not.

1169
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,756
We're not gonna cut
the whole play together.

1170
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,326
(yells)

1171
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,620
I am choking.

1172
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,959
Pour water on my hands.

1173
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,357
Give me snow to eat.

1174
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,562
But... But... Nay, leave it.

1175
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:17,696
The flowers are like fire.
They burn my forehead!

1176
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,987
(Pacino) We just need more time.
We need more time.

1177
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,425
(Barry) Al, I've got you an extra
two days. I've talked to the agents.

1178
01:11:40,563 --> 01:11:42,327
(man) It's all set to go.

1179
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,900
(Barry) We've got the studio
longer than four days.

1180
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:48,938
Six days, eight days, in fact,
in case we need to do some pickups.

1181
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,598
We can have it after the play wraps too.

1182
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:57,339
(man) Basically we can shoot on the
Wednesday, the Thursday or the Friday,

1183
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,711
depending on your schedule
and what you wanna do.

1184
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:05,083
But what we did was just try to
pack everything into those four days

1185
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:07,213
and if you need
to stretch it out further...

1186
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,120
Can I have some napkins?

1187
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,097
(bell rings)

1188
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:15,698
Pictures up.
Yeah.

1189
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,496
Pictures up.
Yeah.

1190
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,394
(Salome) I do not heed my mother.

1191
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,663
It is for my own pleasure

1192
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:25,797
that I ask for the head of Jokanaan
on a silver charger.

1193
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:29,276
You've sworn, Tetrarch.
Forget not you hath sworn an oath.

1194
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:32,211
I know. I know it well.

1195
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,443
But I pray you, Salomé,
ask of me something else.

1196
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,349
I ask of you the head of Jokanaan.

1197
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:40,012
No, no, I do not wish it.

1198
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:41,282
You have sworn, Herod.

1199
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,325
Yes, you have sworn.
Everybody heard you. You swore it.

1200
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,987
Be silent. Speak not to me.

1201
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:56,066
Salomé, this is a terrible thing.

1202
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,539
This is an awful thing to ask of me.

1203
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,144
Surely I think that you are jesting.

1204
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:07,342
The head of a man
that is cut from his body...

1205
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,848
(groans)

1206
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:11,750
..is ill to look upon, is it not?

1207
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:17,190
It is not meet that the eyes of a virgin
should look upon such a thing.

1208
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,694
What pleasure could you have in it?
None.

1209
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,765
No, no. Itis not what you desire.

1210
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:26,198
I demand the head of Jokanaan.

1211
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:30,363
Salomé, come, let us be friends.

1212
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,531
You know my white peacocks?

1213
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,170
My beautiful white peacocks
that walk in the garden

1214
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:41,376
between the myrtles
and the tall cypress trees?

1215
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,849
Their beaks are gilded with gold

1216
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:47,116
and the grains that they eat
are gilded with gold also,

1217
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,089
and their feet are stained with purple.

1218
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,587
When they cry out, the rain comes,

1219
01:13:55,731 --> 01:14:01,329
and the moon shows herself in the
heavens when they spread their tails.

1220
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,065
Two by two they walk in the garden

1221
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:07,039
and each has a slave to tend it.

1222
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:11,137
They will follow you
whithersoever you go.

1223
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,749
And in the midst of them

1224
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:20,983
you will be like the moon
in the midst of a great white cloud.

1225
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,190
I will give them all to you.
I have but a hundred.

1226
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,595
And there is no king in all the world

1227
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:33,259
who possesses peacocks
like unto my peacocks.

1228
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,393
But I will give them all to you.

1229
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:39,739
Only you must loose me from my oath.

1230
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,036
You must not ask of me
that which you have asked of me.

1231
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:48,547
Give me the head of Jokanaan.
That is well said, my daughter.

1232
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:51,245
As for you, you are ridiculous
with your peacocks.

1233
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:54,051
Be silent!

1234
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,620
You cry out always!

1235
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,219
You cry out. You must...
Give me the head of Jokanaan!

1236
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,355
(thunder)

1237
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,901
Be calm. Be calm.

1238
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,472
I am calm.

1239
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,336
Listen.

1240
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:17,276
I have jewels hidden in this place.

1241
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,315
Jewels that your mother even
has never seen.

1242
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,283
Jewels that are marvellous.

1243
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:28,824
I have a collar of pearls
set in four rows

1244
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:32,724
that are like unto moons
chained with rays of silver.

1245
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,661
I have opals, I have onyxes,

1246
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:39,393
and moonstones
that change when the moon changes

1247
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:41,630
and are wan when they see the sun.

1248
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:48,404
I have sapphires big like eggs
and blue as blue flowers.

1249
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,512
The sea wanders within them

1250
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:54,173
and the moon comes never to trouble
the blue of their waves.

1251
01:15:54,316 --> 01:16:00,813
I have chrysolites and beryls
and chrysoprases and rubies.

1252
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:05,987
I have sardonyx and hyacinth stone
and stone of chalcedony,

1253
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:09,463
and I will give them all to you, all.

1254
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:13,366
And other things will I add to them.

1255
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:21,371
The King of the Indies
has but even now sent me four fans

1256
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,945
fashioned from the feathers of parrots.

1257
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:29,075
In an ebony coffer
I have two cups of amber

1258
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:33,086
that are like apples of gold.

1259
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:38,854
If an enemy pour poison into these cups,
they become like an apple of silver.

1260
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:40,952
These are great treasures, Salomé.

1261
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,464
These are treasures above all price.

1262
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,365
They are treasures without price!

1263
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,740
But this is not all.

1264
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:59,840
In a coffer encrusted with amber,

1265
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:04,944
I have sandals encrusted with glass.

1266
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:10,958
I have mantles that have been brought
here from the land of the Seres,

1267
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:17,191
bracelets decked about
with carbuncles and with jade

1268
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,496
that come from the city of Euphrates.

1269
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:26,298
What desirest thou
more than this, Salomé?

1270
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:30,276
Please tell me the thing
that thou desirest. I will give it thee.

1271
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:35,509
All that thou asked, I will give thee,
save one thing.

1272
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:41,690
I will give thee all that is mine...

1273
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,194
..save one life.

1274
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:55,071
1 will give thee
the mantle of the high priest.

1275
01:17:57,306 --> 01:18:00,503
I will give thee
the veil of the sanctuary.

1276
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,746
Give me the head of Jokanaan.

1277
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:54,357
Let her be given what she asks.

1278
01:18:54,496 --> 01:19:00,026
For of a truth,
she is her mother's child.

1279
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,137
(laughs)

1280
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:06,108
"And every human heart that breaks
in prison cell or yard

1281
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:10,944
"And every human heart that breaks
in prison cell or yard

1282
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,108
is as that broken box
that gave its treasure to the Lord."

1283
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,685
This is what he actually said
in the play,

1284
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:21,313
"Each man kills the thing he loves",
from the poem Reading Gaol.

1285
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:28,056
"How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from sin?

1286
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:32,327
He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby grey;

1287
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:38,373
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;

1288
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:43,605
But I never saw a man
Who looked so wistfully at the day,

1289
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:49,082
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die

1290
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:55,683
Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
By each let this be heard,

1291
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:01,252
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,

1292
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:08,531
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!"

1293
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:23,550
Kings ought never to pledge their word,

1294
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:28,021
for if they keep it not, it is terrible.

1295
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,829
If they keep it, it is terrible also.

1296
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,365
Strike, Naaman! Strike, I tell you!

1297
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:48,038
He has let his sword fall.

1298
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,073
He is afraid, this slave.

1299
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:56,379
He is a coward, this slave!
Let soldiers be sent!

1300
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,113
Come hither, thou wert the friend
of him who is dead, is it not so?

1301
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,350
Well, I tell thee
there are not dead men enough.

1302
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:05,825
Get ye to the soldiers, bid them go
down and bring me the thing that I ask,

1303
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:09,829
the thing that Tetrarch has promised me,
the thing that is mine.

1304
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:12,557
Hither, ye soldiers.

1305
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:16,069
Get ye into the cistern
and bring me the head of this man.

1306
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,607
Tetrarch, Tetrarch!

1307
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:24,373
Command your soldiers
that they bring me the head of Jokanaan!

1308
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,594
(sword slashes)

1309
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,227
(flapping wings)

1310
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,268
(Herod) Wherefore did I give my oath?

1311
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:32,575
I am sure a misfortune will happen.

1312
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:59,130
Thou wouldst not suffer me
to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

1313
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,811
Well, I will kiss it now.

1314
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:08,216
I will bite it with my teeth
as one bites a ripe fruit.

1315
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:12,754
Yes, I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

1316
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:15,222
I said it. Did I not say it?

1317
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,449
(laughs)

1318
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,560
I will kiss it now.

1319
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:25,863
But wherefore dost thou
not look at me, Jokanaan?

1320
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:32,168
Thine eyes that were so terrible,
so full of rage and scorn, are shut now.

1321
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,436
Wherefore are they shut?

1322
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:40,539
Open thine eyelids.
Lift up thine eyes, Jokanaan.

1323
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,542
Thou wouldst have not of me, Jokanaan.
Thou didst reject me.

1324
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,848
Thou didst speak evil words against me.

1325
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:54,089
Thou didst treat me as a harlot,
as a wanton.

1326
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,860
Me,...

1327
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,197
..Salomég,

1328
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:07,798
daughter of Herodias,
Princess of Judaea.

1329
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:13,240
Well, Jokanaan, I still live.
But thou, thou art dead.

1330
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:18,751
And thy head belongs to me.
I can do with it what I will.

1331
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,822
I can throw it to the dogs
and to the birds of the air.

1332
01:24:21,924 --> 01:24:25,792
That which the dogs leave behind,
the birds of the air shall devour.

1333
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,636
Oh, Jokanaan.

1334
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:39,300
Jokanaan, thou wert the only man
that I have loved.

1335
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,109
All other men were hateful to me
but thou.

1336
01:24:45,948 --> 01:24:48,440
Thou art beautiful.

1337
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,848
Thy voice was a censer
that scattered strange perfumes.

1338
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:58,716
And when I looked on thee...
I heard a strange music.

1339
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:09,367
Wherefore does thou
not look at me, Jokanaan?

1340
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:15,942
Behind thy hands and thy curses,
thou didst hide thy face.

1341
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:25,086
If thou hadst looked at me,
thou hadst loved me.

1342
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,318
Well I know
that thou wouldst have loved me,

1343
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:33,122
and the mystery of love
is greater than the mystery of death.

1344
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:37,926
Love only should one consider.

1345
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:43,865
I saw thee, Jokanaan,
and I loved thee.

1346
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:48,410
Oh, how I loved thee.

1347
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:54,849
I love thee yet, Jokanaan.

1348
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:58,284
(sobs) I love thee only.

1349
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:24,310
(Herod) She is monstrous, thy daughter.

1350
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,938
She is altogether monstrous.

1351
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:34,786
In truth what she has done
was a great crime.

1352
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:41,964
I am sure that it was a crime

1353
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:44,863
against an unknown god.

1354
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,198
I approve of what my daughter has done

1355
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,305
and I will stay here now.

1356
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,340
Ah!

1357
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:57,105
There speaks the incestuous wife.

1358
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,812
(Herod) Come.

1359
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,044
I will not stay here.

1360
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:07,178
Come, I tell thee.

1361
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:12,521
Surely some evil will befall.

1362
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:16,996
Manasseh, Issachar, Ozias!

1363
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,534
Put out the torches!

1364
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:21,966
I will not look at things.

1365
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:25,902
I will not suffer things to look at me.

1366
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:28,743
Put out the torches!

1367
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:33,271
Hide the moon.

1368
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,383
Hide the stars.

1369
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:39,877
Come, Herodias,

1370
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:43,889
let us hide ourselves in our palace.

1371
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:47,890
I begin to be afraid.

1372
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,162
I have kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan.

1373
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,301
I have kissed thy mouth.

1374
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,507
There was a bitter taste on thy lips.

1375
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,909
Was it the taste of blood?

1376
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,550
But perchance it is the taste of love.

1377
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:19,155
For they say that love
hath a bitter taste.

1378
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,432
But what of that?

1379
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,569
What of that?

1380
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:38,002
I have kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan.

1381
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,846
Kill that woman!

1382
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,781
(thunder)

1383
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,148
(sword slashes)

1384
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,617
(Pacino) We gotta go back
to the desert.

1385
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,128
We're not finished.

1386
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,627
We've gotta go.

1387
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:52,384
(Pacino) "All trials
are trials for one's life,

1388
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,218
just as all sentences
are sentences of death,

1389
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:59,658
and three times have I been tried.”

1390
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:04,289
"The first time I left the box
to be arrested,

1391
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:08,630
the second time to be led back
to the house of detention,

1392
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:14,106
the third time to pass into a prison
for two years."

1393
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:20,375
"Society as we have constituted it
will have no place for me,

1394
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:23,382
has none to offer,

1395
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:30,356
but nature, whose sweet rains
fall on unjust and just alike,

1396
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:34,292
will have clefts in the rocks
where I may hide,

1397
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:39,458
secret valleys in whose silence
I may weep undisturbed.”

1398
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,036
"She will hang the night with stars

1399
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:46,472
so that I may walk abroad
in the darkness without stumbling,

1400
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:52,069
send the wind over my footprints
so that none may track me to my hurt."

1401
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:55,979
"She will cleanse me in great waters

1402
01:30:56,084 --> 01:31:00,248
and with bitter herbs make me whole."

1403
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,270
