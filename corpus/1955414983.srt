1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,856
- You get your raise?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,699
Me, too, and my cheque was smaller.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,017
The government takes out
more taxes in the first quarter.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,495
- Why?
- To pay for last year's overspend.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,578
Get a jump on this year's overspend.
Got anything invested?

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,737
Invested? What do I have left
after the bar?

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,011
You put all your money in the bar?

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,131
What? You didn't?

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,050
- What if the bar's hit by lightning?
- So what do I do?

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,536
- You got anything saved?
- No. I keep buying bigger TVs.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,528
- Why do you all get so hard for Harleys?
- You wouldn't understand.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,697
- That's deep. Hey, Doc!
- What's his name?

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,050
Andrew Whetherly.
His nickname was Monk.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,729
Member of the Deacons' biker gang.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,851
Was he shot in the face?

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,414
Yeah, then dragged behind a car.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,215
See the ligature marks and gravel
on his cheeks?

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,377
You. If I asked what you know,
you wouldn't tell me, right?

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,138
Depends on your attitude.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,651
Any idea who might want
to overkill your buddy?

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,739
Nobody wanted the Monk to die,
all right? We loved him.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,933
That implies you'd have some say
in whether he lived or died.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,848
That implies nothing, officer.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,929
All I'm saying is this was club business.
You should know what I mean.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,528
I don't.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,458
- Can't help you, then.
- We'll be in touch.

27
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,456
- Hello.
- Hello, Commissioner.

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,653
Commissioner Harris, good to see you.

29
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,577
Good to see you.

30
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,336
Hello. Hi.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,373
- How are you?
- Very well, all things considered!

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,775
- Busy?
- No more than usual, sir.

33
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,449
- Are you free for lunch?
- Actually, I am.

34
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,299
- Shall we?
- See you later, Tim.

35
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,657
What's he doing here?

36
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,375
- He asked Frank for lunch.
- Hey, get your own!

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,890
- I just want the sports section.
- There wasn't a game last night.

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,330
They usually advertise airline prices.

39
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,054
If memory serves,
you've used up your vacation.

40
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,852
I'm not taking a vacation.

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,735
I hired a private detective
to find Beth and the kids.

42
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,657
Private detective? You're a detective.

43
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,658
You're way better
than any Sam Spade wannabe.

44
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,296
If memory serves, I've got a day job.
Besides, this guy's good.

45
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,093
He found receipts
from a motel outside Camden.

46
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,211
- Camden New Jersey?
- Makes sense.

47
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,889
Beth's got family in Pennsylvania.
It's on her way there.

48
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,897
Anyway, it's something.

49
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,895
Homicide. Detective Felton.

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,698
Yep. Right. I got it.

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,093
Come on. Let's go.

52
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,137
Hi, Jim.

53
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,928
- Oh, hi.
- How's it going?

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,058
- Hello, Commissioner.
- Oh, hiya!

55
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,297
Iced tea and linguine pomodoro,
Mr Harris?

56
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,615
Ah, yes. Thank you.

57
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,731
And for you, sir?

58
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,420
- The same, please.
- Very well.

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,014
- May I?
- Well, you're wearing the gun.

60
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,131
True.

61
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,294
You really broke my heart last year.

62
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,457
Did I? How?

63
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,538
- Turning down that promotion.
- The shift commander?

64
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,458
Yeah. I've been watching your career.

65
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,413
You're a hell of a good policeman.

66
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,612
My plan was to move you upstairs
with me.

67
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,731
I felt that I would be better off

68
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,933
handling cases than... politics.

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,539
Yes, I understand.

70
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,619
Most care more about moving up
than being good where they are.

71
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,892
I respected your decision then,
and I still do.

72
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,931
Thank you.

73
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,848
Do you know Congressman
Jeremy Wade?

74
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,098
Not personally. I voted for him.

75
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,938
Mmm, he's been good,

76
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,530
especially to the police department.

77
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,220
Two nights ago,
Congressman Wade called me.

78
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,650
Said he'd been kidnapped by two men

79
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,577
who had warned him

80
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,613
about staying away
from his assistant's girlfriend.

81
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,012
He didn't wanna report it officially,
but he sounded shook up,

82
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,734
so I had the unit response.

83
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,773
I don't think it's appropriate for me
to conduct the investigation,

84
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,017
so I want you to do that for me.

85
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,019
- Sir, I'm a homicide investigator.
- I know.

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,213
But I need somebody good,
someone smart,

87
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,251
someone... tactful.

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,737
I need the best. You're the best.

89
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,657
I'll have to clear this with Giardello.

90
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,611
We're a man down.

91
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,096
- You let me make that call for you.
- OK.

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,895
I want you to separate
the fact from the fiction.

93
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,899
- I want you to report to only me.
- Right.

94
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,776
Put a little parmesan on that pomodoro.
It brings it alive.

95
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,697
- What have we got?
- A white male.

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,177
50 to 60 years old. Homeless.
Single bullet to the head.

97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,610
He was found with his hands
down around his ankles.

98
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,892
He was by a tree squatting,
as if about to...

99
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,657
- Defecate.
- Did he?

100
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,293
- What, sir?
- Dump?

101
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,298
Not as far as I can tell.

102
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,617
- Did you look?
- Well, I, er...

103
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,210
- Where is this tree?
- It's right over here.

104
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,449
- Where's the body?
- They took it.

105
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,175
- Who took it?
- The paramedics in the ambulance.

106
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,656
Hold on. That wasn't
a medical examiner's truck.

107
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,011
- No, it's from St Agnes Hospital.
- Oh.

108
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,212
- Where are they taking the body?
- To St Agnes.

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,333
- So, the guy wasn't dead?
- He was dead. Definitely dead.

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,179
They pronounced him at 1:30pm.

111
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,088
So you let them take a dead body
to the hospital?

112
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,290
They knew what to do.

113
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,493
- Man!
- He was found kinda like this.

114
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,853
- Let's go.
- Go where?

115
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,574
Go find the body!

116
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,898
Rule of thumb - it's not a homicide
unless there's a body.

117
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,573
Tattoos make you queasy?

118
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,897
I don't understand the fascination
with scarring your body.

119
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,090
It's an ancient ritual

120
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,735
that originated in Polynesia
as a symbol of virility and manhood.

121
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,773
If you need a scar on your body
to declare your manhood,

122
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,891
you're not much of a man.

123
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,451
- Tattoos are cool.
- You got one, they're so cool?

124
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,572
- Where?
- Bree Whetherly work here?

125
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,691
- Who wants to know?
- We do.

126
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,132
- And you are?
- Representatives of a sweepstake.

127
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,253
- Cops. She's in the back.
- Doesn't that hurt?

128
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,932
Trick is not to care.

129
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,855
- Mrs Whetherly?
- Yeah?

130
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,210
We're from Homicide.

131
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,332
- Damn, this hurts!
- Trick is not to care.

132
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,213
Oh, really? You try it.

133
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,373
Mrs Whetherly, I'm sorry
to tell you this, but your husband...

134
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,899
Is dead.

135
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,696
Last night before he left the house,
he was sitting on Mama's rocking chair,

136
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,856
feeding the baby.

137
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,971
He was crying.

138
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,691
Kissing Sarah's cheeks. Holding her
so tight I thought she'd break.

139
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,330
I knew he didn't have long.

140
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,454
Why? Was Monk in some feud
with a rival club or with the Deacons?

141
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,093
Feud?

142
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,339
Nobody messed with Monk.

143
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,419
He'd just as soon beat your ass
as shake your hand.

144
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,613
Except when it came to Sarah Rose.

145
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,255
He made a mook of himself around her!

146
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,975
Any idea who might have wanted
your husband dead?

147
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,210
- Ask Preacher.
- Preacher?

148
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,650
He's the Deacons' warlord.
Keeps the club members in line.

149
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,533
Disciplines the rallies.
Reviews prospects.

150
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,379
- Whose prospects?
- Guys who wanna be in the club.

151
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,890
Preacher also does weddings.

152
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,534
He's a bishop in
the American Fellowship Church.

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,538
He married me and Monk.

154
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,176
Did Monk ever say anything about
any trouble he might have been in?

155
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,054
Monk didn't talk to me
about club business.

156
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,613
That just ain't done.

157
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,095
Where would we find this Preacher?

158
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,212
The club's got a strip joint on Blair Road.

159
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,538
Watch yourself around Preacher.
He's not liable to take a joke.

160
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,739
Interested in a cherry '68 Electra Glide?

161
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,049
- Monk bored and stroked it last spring.
- Electra Glide?

162
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,968
His Harley! Pull your head
out of the sand, boys.

163
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,775
Well, ask your cop buddies, would you?

164
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,299
I need the money.

165
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,969
Monk wasn't exactly over insured,
you know.

166
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,296
When white people mess themselves up

167
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,969
they do it in such bizarre ways.

168
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,455
- Where's your tattoo?
- Guess.

169
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,570
No!

170
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,534
Frank, I don't care about
the alleged kidnapping.

171
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,049
I wanna know what Jim Harris,

172
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,139
the wunderkind of our department,
had for lunch.

173
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,854
We had linguine pomodoro, OK?

174
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,575
Oh! It's like you're being groomed!

175
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,497
Mr Wade says the van

176
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,408
was a late-model Ford Windstar, red.

177
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,856
He was forced into the van
through a side door on the driver's side.

178
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,972
Vans don't have side doors
on the driver's side.

179
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,172
Was he the one who engineered
your promotion offer?

180
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,733
- Yes.
- You're golden, Frank.

181
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,775
He also claims the van slowed,
and he was ejected here.

182
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,573
When I examined the clothes
he was wearing,

183
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,330
I found no grass stains,
no rips, no tears.

184
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,133
What about these people
who dropped him off?

185
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,570
He says there was a Neighbourhood
Watch barbecue going on.

186
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,895
It's chilly to be cooking outdoors.

187
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,659
I checked with the parks and recreation,

188
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,137
and I found there was no permit
issued for the park that day.

189
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,252
We're looking for a van
which does not exist,

190
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,976
carrying kidnappers who never lived,
who didn't abscond with a Congressman,

191
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,694
and then didn't drop him off here?

192
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,778
I guess. I don't know.

193
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,693
This really stinks, Frank.

194
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,737
Well...

195
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,339
Let's keep looking.

196
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,451
None of the particulars exist.

197
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,573
I have been asked to exercise
my expertise as a homicide detective.

198
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,372
That's what I will do.

199
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,570
- Harris caught you doing something.
- What?

200
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,409
Nabbing the cash out
of the Orphans' and Widows' Fund.

201
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,939
Is that it?

202
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,052
You know, sometimes you're funny,
and then there's now.

203
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,254
'Dr Barratt,
please call your office.'

204
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,258
Excuse me, I'm Detective Howard,
Baltimore City Homicide.

205
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,053
- We're looking for a body.
- Take your pick.

206
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,770
We've been to the morgue
who sent us to Admitting,

207
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,095
who sent us to you.

208
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,013
Gotta make a call.

209
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,732
Dead body. Came in within the last hour.

210
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,420
White male. Approximately 50 years
of age.

211
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,691
- Oh, I know who you mean.
- Where is he?

212
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,731
Detective, that man was dead.

213
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,976
To qualify for admission to this hospital,

214
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,775
a patient has to be, at least,
clinging to life.

215
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,371
But if you didn't admit the dead body,
where is it?

216
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,095
- They took it back.
- Took it back?

217
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,896
- To where they found it.
- Back to where they found it, huh!

218
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,057
Kay, my PI thinks Beth went to Philly.

219
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,855
The paramedics took the body
back to where they found it!

220
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,971
It's like a treasure hunt!

221
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,577
Ready?

222
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,296
- Whoa!
- Lisa. She's limber.

223
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,172
She's a virgin.

224
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,973
I get this urge to take them home,

225
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,330
and talk some sense into them.

226
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,610
- No sex?
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

227
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,416
Couple of beers. Couple of shots.
I still wanna try and help them out.

228
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,008
- We're looking for Preacher.
- Over there.

229
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,854
Are you Preacher?

230
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,609
Detective Lewis, Detective Munch,
Homicide.

231
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,819
Monk was a good soldier.

232
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,899
Had an awesome sense of duty
and a lot of heart.

233
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,580
So he died for a reason?

234
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,454
- Don't we all?
- So who killed the Monk?

235
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,890
When a man dies at the hands of a mob,

236
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,658
how do you tell?

237
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,817
- More than one killer?
- The Warren Commission says not.

238
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,374
Can you give us a straight answer

239
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,288
or do we need to drag
your narrow behind downtown?

240
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,730
If you got Natty Bo in your office,
I'm in.

241
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,098
Monk's wife seems to think
you might know who wanted him killed.

242
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,336
Her yapping is why he's dead.

243
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,339
- Are you saying this is a vendetta?
- Detective...

244
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,375
You'll have to abandon this linear way
of thinking you've grown to love.

245
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,493
Dig a little deeper, man.
You're being lazy.

246
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,090
Who are you calling lazy,
you retro Nazi crap?

247
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,370
Whoa!

248
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,731
What are you looking at? Get up!

249
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,898
Make me.

250
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,289
What the hell happened to you guys?

251
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,129
Our man Lewis
has a Chuck Norris streak.

252
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,412
- Who's the welterweight?
- A member of the Deacons' biker gang.

253
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,850
He got into a "mine's bigger than yours"
with Lewis.

254
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,813
- Looks like his was bigger.
- Much bigger.

255
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,134
Frank, what floor
are you working on these days?

256
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,012
Your chair's empty.

257
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,452
The room no longer has the energy of
Baltimore's best and brightest detective.

258
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,016
Well, Harris asked me
to look into something.

259
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,418
- Did he call and tell you?
- Yeah, and told me nothing.

260
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,453
You're my prize pupil.
Wanna tell me the goods?

261
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,253
He asked me to fix a traffic ticket.

262
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,133
- You don't trust me.
- Oh, Gee, Gee!

263
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,252
They eat their wounded upstairs.

264
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,416
Be careful.

265
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,939
OK, Gee.

266
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,139
Thanks!

267
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,935
Whetherly was doing business
on the side!

268
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,733
He was breaking the rules.
You're the warlord.

269
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,852
You had to make an example out of him!

270
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,655
- You have no soul.
- Don't you talk to me about soul!

271
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,453
The whole premise of this case is soul.

272
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,218
You've decided I'm trash,

273
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,334
and that I'd take the life of my brother
when I sip beer.

274
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,419
Where is all this eloquence coming from?
Did you pass third grade?

275
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,010
No. Actually, he went to
Williams College.

276
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,653
For a year, anyway.

277
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,771
- What?
- He's from Connecticut.

278
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,299
Connecticut?

279
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,729
His real name is Jason Calhoun.

280
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,935
He prepped at Hodgekiss.

281
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,131
You come from money?
Your parents own some bank?

282
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,057
What's this? "North-eastern mortgage..."

283
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,933
We all have these embarrassments
in our past.

284
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,373
Mr Calhoun, do you know
who killed Monk Whetherly?

285
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,695
I don't know who,

286
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,459
but I do know why,

287
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,492
and if you two understand the why,

288
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,293
then you'll figure out who.

289
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,218
Why don't you just tell us the why?

290
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,570
Because he loved his little girl.

291
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,609
Now, I'm sorry about
the scuffle earlier,

292
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,413
but you asked for it.

293
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,895
You know I didn't kill the Monk,

294
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,136
so unless you've got anything further,

295
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,093
I'd like to get back to my life.

296
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,895
I'll have an officer take you home.

297
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,058
Don't bother.

298
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,411
My ride's here.

299
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,494
- Timothy Draper?
- Yes.

300
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,975
Could we speak with you?

301
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,091
- Sure. Come in.
- Thanks.

302
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,291
I met Jeremy Wade

303
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,537
at the Democratic National Convention
in New York, 1992.

304
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,171
We're all hugging and singing,
"Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow."

305
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,895
No, thanks. How long have you
worked for Congressman Wade?

306
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,695
Two years,
I was in my second year of law school

307
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,459
when Jeremy offered me to be
his assistant.

308
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,856
I'm actually moving back to New York
to finish school.

309
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,178
Congressman Wade is asserting
that you had him kidnapped,

310
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,292
and warned him to stay away
from your girlfriend.

311
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,451
- What?
- Wanna tell us what's really going on?

312
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,539
I came to DC

313
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,494
to work for a powerful
three-term US Congressman.

314
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,614
He set me up in Baltimore
to be closer to his constituents.

315
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,697
It was great helping him
come up with ideas,

316
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,495
legislation, breaking bread
at the weekly caucus

317
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,010
with the most powerful politicians
in our government.

318
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,017
DC is like heroin.

319
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,053
You get a taste of that power,
that level of involvement...

320
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,533
Why did you quit?

321
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,057
Because Jeremy and I
started a relationship.

322
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,499
A love affair.

323
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,292
- You don't have a girlfriend?
- No.

324
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,819
I'm gay.

325
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,616
The affair was beginning
to affect his work and mine.

326
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,416
I told him I had to quit,
that I was going back to school.

327
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,656
- Then he blew up.
- Blew up?

328
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,056
Yeah. He broke my arm.

329
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,091
Why didn't you report that?

330
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,531
Bones heal.

331
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,331
So this whole kidnapping story is...

332
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,178
Sad.

333
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,053
Why are we investigating a domestic?

334
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,899
I don't get the accordion effect of traffic.

335
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,615
Ten feet, stop! Ten feet, stop!

336
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,698
It's not a domestic. It's a kidnapping.

337
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,130
It was no abduction.
It was a lovers' quarrel.

338
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,252
Draper quit.
Wade beat the crap out of him.

339
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,177
Why did Wade make the call?

340
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,770
Probably thought Draper
was gonna report the assault,

341
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,735
so Wade decides he'll call in first, and
say Draper had someone kidnap him.

342
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,138
- It takes the wind out of Draper's sail.
- That doesn't make sense.

343
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,139
People under stress sometimes
don't make sensible decisions.

344
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,213
Did you ever think that you were gay?

345
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,857
- No.
- Ever had a homosexual experience?

346
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,129
- No, Frank.
- Even when you were a kid?

347
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,215
- No. No, I haven't!
- Every guy goes through this.

348
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,889
- I didn't.
- No hugs? Pecks on the cheeks?

349
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,488
- No close encounters?
- How about you, Frank?

350
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,259
- Go on.
- You first.

351
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,735
OK, I...

352
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,251
I had a cousin who used to follow me
into the bathroom. Sometimes.

353
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,218
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

354
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,376
- What did he do?
- I don't remember. Your turn.

355
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,298
I got nothing to tell.

356
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,811
You said every guy has had
one of these experiences!

357
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,613
I must have been lying.

358
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,289
What am I gonna do with this case?

359
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,015
Ask Harris. He's the one
grooming you for upper management.

360
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,052
OK, OK! I'll go ask Harris.

361
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,690
Rookie! Gonna get his name and
shield number and put him on report.

362
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,893
We're in a hurry here.
I might have to leave for Philly.

363
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,011
We got a hard enough time,

364
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,371
what with rookies letting bodies go.

365
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,379
You don't wanna put this poor kid
on report. He's just inexperienced.

366
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,617
Remember when you
were inexperienced?

367
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,537
I was never that inexperienced.

368
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,815
- Put him on report.
- What's you number, son?

369
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,374
The Deputy Commissioner
will be right out.

370
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,697
He's meeting with the mayor.

371
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,211
- In there? The mayor's in there?
- He's in and out all the time!

372
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,695
Oh!

373
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,812
Frank! Sorry to keep you waiting.
Come on in.

374
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,538
- Have a seat.
- Where's the mayor?

375
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,015
Well, he went out the side door.

376
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,891
Does he have something to hide?

377
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,818
Not really. At least not today. Sit down.

378
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,218
So, what's the good news
about our little problem?

379
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,218
It's not little, sir.
There was no kidnapping.

380
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,169
It's a lovers' spat between
Wade and Draper.

381
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,612
It started as a smoke screen
to hide the fact Wade is homosexual.

382
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,379
All of which would've meant no harm,

383
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,855
except that he filed a police report,

384
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,416
which is false, which is a crime.

385
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,019
Yeah.

386
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,977
So how do you plan to proceed?

387
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,455
You tell me.

388
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,253
All I know is Article 27, Section 150

389
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,372
of the Annotated Code
says Wade owes the public

390
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,652
$500 and six months in jail
for the filing a false report.

391
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,010
The way I see it is,

392
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,450
if Congressman Wade is charged,

393
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,971
the media will probably pull
his private life out of the closet,

394
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,376
and we will lose
a very important ally in Congress.

395
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,175
If Wade goes, we'll have
more dead cops on the street.

396
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,656
- Want me to walk away?
- What about the false report?

397
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,657
If no crime was committed,

398
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,897
then we could just let this thing die.

399
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,736
- Have you talked to Wade?
- No.

400
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,128
Then you should.

401
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,889
Make sure he understands
how you plan to proceed.

402
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,692
How I plan to proceed?

403
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,857
Sir, you have to be
much, much more specific.

404
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,054
Do you want me to cut a deal
with Wade?

405
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,776
I want you to tell Congressman Wade
there will be no investigation.

406
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,892
That we understand

407
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,252
that this is just a trivial episode
of poor judgment,

408
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,053
and we will take care of it.

409
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,891
OK, sir.

410
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,768
Taking your work a bit too seriously.

411
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,334
I'm trying to get into their heads.

412
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,133
I mean, this is a fascinating world.

413
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,534
Fascinating?

414
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,777
These pig boys are nothing
but fat drunken racists

415
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,572
who ride illegally altered motorcycles.

416
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,773
- They're a gang!
- True. They're not a gang, per se.

417
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,016
The MC on the patches,

418
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,210
that stands for "Motorcycle Club."

419
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,620
Meldrick, they're stone killers!

420
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,937
Or you could say
they're the last living legacy

421
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,699
of a wild, wild West, huh?

422
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,936
Riding steel horses,

423
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,257
and maintaining
an almost fanatical code of honour

424
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,132
and independence.

425
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,139
They blew a guy's face off.
Where is the honour?

426
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,775
The Hell's Angels
were an Air Force fighter squadron

427
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,811
in the Second World War.

428
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,976
No, I did not.

429
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,139
After the war, when they'd finished flying,
they took up bikes.

430
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,731
In fact, they had a riot of some sort
out in Hollister, California.

431
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,328
They based the movie "Wild Ones" there.

432
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,859
Yeah. Interesting.

433
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,495
I interviewed two members
of the Phoenix Motorcycle Club,

434
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,932
and they assured me they had
no bones to pick with the Deacons.

435
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,372
This ain't got nothing to do
with no outside club.

436
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,775
Lewis, it's for you. Line three.

437
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,135
Lewis, Homicide. Who's this?

438
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,891
OK.

439
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,614
- Where are you going?
- Don't know.

440
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,378
Lewis!

441
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,658
- Yeah?
- Sorry about the cloak and dagger.

442
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,058
- I'm Special Agent Harvey Easton, FBI.
- How didn't I know that?

443
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,217
Yeah. I'm not the guy
in the recruiting posters.

444
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,333
Look, I know you're investigating
Whetherly's murder.

445
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,451
You do, huh? How?

446
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,935
I'm doing undercover work
into the Deacons.

447
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,733
Mind if we step out of the way?

448
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,975
You know who whacked Whetherly?

449
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,489
Oh, yeah. Guy named Gabe Clark.

450
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,410
He's just some punk prospecting for
the club. I got his address here, but...

451
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,328
- Make a clean bust.
- I'm stepping on federal toes?

452
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,452
We're making a RICO case
to shut the club.

453
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,979
Is Preacher involved?

454
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,738
The club president, Benny Reston,

455
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,852
has been working
for some wise guys in Miami,

456
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,618
doing some odd hits,

457
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,130
distributing coke,
amphetamines here in Baltimore.

458
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,935
I got the two acts of racketeering
I need to indict,

459
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,574
but I gotta get my contact out.

460
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,691
- Who's your contact?
- Whetherly's wife.

461
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,175
She put me in contact with Reston.

462
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,014
- He loved his little girl.
- Yeah, whatever.

463
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,700
Look, I'll take Reston.

464
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,493
You take the slug who whacked Monk,
OK?

465
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,929
Yeah, whatever. Thanks.

466
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,136
Ah, Detective Pembleton. Good
afternoon. Sorry to keep you waiting.

467
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,252
- Need some coffee or anything?
- No, I'm fine.

468
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,132
Please.

469
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,538
- How's everything on the home front?
- Same as usual. Out of control.

470
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,498
I love Baltimore.
The northernmost southern city.

471
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,292
Friendly and gracious like Dixie,

472
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,059
but liberally conservative
like any good WASP enclave.

473
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,569
I assume you know why I'm here.

474
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,773
Yes, I think so. You're here
to interview me about the kidnapping.

475
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,299
Congressman, er...

476
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,099
I'm not sure how to say this.

477
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,734
There isn't any truth to your story.

478
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,215
There was no van, no abduction.

479
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,810
No threats were made against your life.

480
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,500
Jim said you were honest
and honourable.

481
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,611
This is the way we are.

482
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,130
You called to pre-empt
Mr Draper's assault charge.

483
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,728
You thought there might be
an investigation

484
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,691
and that might lead

485
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,812
to the disclosing of your personal life.

486
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,134
Yes.

487
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,254
A police officer responded to that call.
A report was filed.

488
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,974
- Yes.
- Filing a false report is a crime.

489
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,290
This is a private matter
between you and Mr Draper,

490
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,809
and you'd prefer to keep it private.

491
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,976
That is correct.

492
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,696
Well, then, if a crime
has been committed,

493
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,653
we will investigate... fully.

494
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,171
However, if no crime was committed,

495
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,054
well, then that puts an end to it.

496
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,292
If I tell you that no crime occurred,

497
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,412
would this ever be used against me?

498
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,814
Not by me.

499
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,375
There was no abduction,

500
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,776
and I would prefer the matter
be dealt with privately.

501
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,939
Consider this case file closed,
and your private life private.

502
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,299
Thank you very much, Detective.

503
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,014
I represent a mostly southern city.

504
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,816
This isn't California or Massachusetts.

505
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,092
The truth is not my ally
with respect to my private life.

506
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,133
- I wish it were, but...
- I wouldn't worry about it, sir.

507
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,732
Suspect's name is Gabe Clark.

508
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,215
He's 6'3". Black hair. Heavy set.

509
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,729
Considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

510
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,215
He may have a girlfriend with him.

511
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,378
Baltimore Police!
You're under arrest!

512
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,053
You got him?

513
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,740
- We never will close this case.
- I know.

514
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,411
Whatever chance we had -
if there were a chance - it's gone.

515
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,531
- I know.
- Crime scene's been violated,

516
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,131
Chain of evidence has been broken.
The body's toured Baltimore!

517
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,370
I feel bad you're the primary.

518
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,971
After not closing Chilton, your average
will sink below the Mendoza line.

519
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,614
I'm the primary? You took the call.

520
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,775
When we were getting in the car...
Dalkins Investigations. Yeah, I'll hold.

521
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,698
You said, "I'll be the primary."

522
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,018
I'm gonna kick you somewhere below
your Mendoza line!

523
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,335
Doug Chambers. Yeah, is he in?

524
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,770
Hey, if you want, I'll be the primary.

525
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,735
Yeah, just tell him
that Beau Felton called, OK?

526
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,533
- Answering service.
- You are gonna eat this one!

527
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,852
Even a homeless, unknown,
unclaimed John Doe

528
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,972
deserves my 100% effort
in closing his case.

529
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,958
- Frank! Hey, hey!
- Good morning.

530
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,435
- Morning.
- What's with the dog and pony show?

531
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,599
There's blood in the water. It's your
blood. They're waiting for you.

532
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,188
- What the hell for?
- I'm just a messenger.

533
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,312
Maria Delgado of Channel 8
broke a story saying

534
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,035
there had been a cover-up of
criminal charges brought against Wade.

535
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,559
You've gotta be kidding!

536
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,035
As you indicated, I'm not funny.

537
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,992
What do you wanna do?

538
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,476
I'm with you either way.

539
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,115
- Walking in the front door.
- Just as I thought.

540
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,272
Here he comes! Let's go!
Detective Pembleton!

541
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,709
Excuse me! Excuse me!

542
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,231
Do you have any statement
as to your alleged complicity

543
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,511
in covering up the charges against
Congressman Wade?

544
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,517
Hey, hey, hey!

545
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,031
Frank.

546
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,155
- Don't say hello at once.
- Sit down.

547
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,872
Then again I might not.

548
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,357
Detective Pembleton,
I was making French toast for my kids

549
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,914
when I got a call from Maria Delgado.

550
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,670
She was about to go on air about
Congressman Wade being kidnapped

551
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,554
and then after a formal investigation,
he recanted,

552
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,276
which implied that instead of Wade
being charged with filing a false report,

553
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,753
you covered it up.

554
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,236
Give me your side of the story

555
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,433
before I decide what, if any,
disciplinary action will be taken.

556
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,710
Deputy Commissioner, you wanna?

557
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,832
Feel free to jump in here at any time.

558
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,957
I called in Detective Pembleton

559
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,470
to investigate the veracity

560
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,830
of Congressman Wade's allegations.

561
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,951
- And?
- No crime was committed.

562
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,675
We have to notify the Attorney's office
to charge Wade.

563
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,285
We can't.

564
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,436
- Why?
- I gave him my word.

565
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,791
- Under whose authority?
- Under the Commissioner's authority!

566
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,195
Jim, did you OK this deal?

567
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,359
No, I did not.

568
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,031
Detective Pembleton
has clearly overstepped

569
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,915
the parameters of professional conduct
and propriety.

570
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,155
That's it, then.

571
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,558
Detective Pembleton, you are under
administrative suspension with pay.

572
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,831
You'll limit your activities
to paperwork and answering phones

573
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,030
and don't act so surprised!

574
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,037
You've done a great disservice

575
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,789
to the reputation of this department
and to this city.

576
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,480
- Gee, help.
- You said it was a traffic ticket!

577
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,355
You said everything was under control!
Now there's nothing I can do!

578
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,718
There's only one thing for me to do.
I quit!

579
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,880
You all riding today?

580
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,515
We got a funeral. We're burying
our brother.

581
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,275
- We arrested Gabe Clark this morning.
- Nothing righteous about him.

582
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,915
Yeah, well, he says your club president,

583
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,553
Reston, ordered the hit.

584
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,910
- You believe him?
- It's club business.

585
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,477
Monk's wife was giving up the club.
You couldn't let her get away with it.

586
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,070
In ancient Rome,
when a member of your family sinned...

587
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,750
...the head of the family was allowed
to die so the others could live.

588
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,270
So, Monk died for his wife's sins?

589
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,712
He allowed himself to be slaughtered
because he loved his daughter so much?

590
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,479
Have you ever love anybody that much?

591
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,795
- Not yet.
- It's something to work for.

592
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,478
Look, you know,

593
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,036
I've read about
your so-called code of honour,

594
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,073
and the way that you live your life
with this abandon,

595
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,998
but murder is not honourable.

596
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,475
If you ain't picked up the sword,

597
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,878
then you ain't never have to worry
about falling on it.

598
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,269
Is it worth living without the sword?

599
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,837
You picked up one, right?
It's in that holster on your hip.

600
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,993
Let's make it fast. We gotta go.

601
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,680
- Mrs Whetherly.
- Yeah, what?

602
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,476
I have your husband's effects.
You never picked them up.

603
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,830
Frigging Feds!

604
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,155
I got 15 minutes

605
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,511
to pack up my entire life!

606
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,679
- Nobody's coming for you.
- You're a civilian. You've no idea!

607
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,191
- Do you know why Monk was killed?
- Yeah. Yeah, because of me.

608
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,072
No... Because of her.

609
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,756
You listening to me?

610
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,996
He made a deal.

611
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,712
Your husband died

612
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,992
so that your daughter, his daughter,
could have a mother.

613
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,192
- Ain't nobody gonna touch you now.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

614
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,311
I can't take that chance.

615
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,234
They're burying him today.
See that he gets that.

616
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,351
I don't want him all alone.

617
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,476
Sarah could always make him smile.

618
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,160
Always make him feel better,
huh, honey?

619
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,760
That's it. It's all I'm taking.

620
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,668
I don't have time to go to the funeral.

621
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,635
I just want someone to say goodbye
to him for us, OK?

622
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,478
That's fine. Let's go.

623
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,675
Hey, Frank!

624
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,952
- What's going on?
- I'm fixing dinner for my wife tonight.

625
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,152
- You're gonna walk out on me?
- I didn't.

626
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,273
We're not engaged.
Don't act like I left you at the altar.

627
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,516
You're my partner, OK?

628
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,677
I mean, you're my best friend.

629
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,389
What am I supposed to say?

630
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,432
That you're my best friend?

631
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,597
They only suspended you for a month.

632
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,870
I shouldn't have been suspended.

633
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,949
I was asked by a superior
to fix a lumpy situation.

634
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,993
I got screwed. I should've known
better, but I broke the law.

635
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,395
Cops can't do that.

636
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,195
Consequently, I'm no longer
any good to myself or my badge.

637
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,189
Listen, this isn't you. What happened?
You're not quitting! Come on!

638
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,198
- Yes, I am.
- What are you gonna do?

639
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,437
You gonna run security
at a corporation off the beltway?

640
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,156
You gonna teach crime detection
technique at the police academy?

641
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,158
You can't! You will always be a cop.

642
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,679
I'm not any more.

643
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,555
I'm relishing that moment tomorrow
when I haven't seen one dead person.

644
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,911
That moment
when my wife walks in says,

645
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,031
"Honey, I'm home."

646
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,039
And I get to ask her about her day,

647
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,472
and actually, for once, listen and care

648
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,512
as she relates every boring detail.

649
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,550
- I don't have a partner.
- Get over it. I'm going home.

650
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,715
- What did Gee say?
- He's giving me time to hash it out.

651
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,400
- How long?
- A couple or three days.

652
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,398
I'll be at Beth's cousin's house
in Upper Darby.

653
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,435
I can't believe how long it's been
since I held my kids.

654
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,199
- All right, I'll see you.
- Hey, Beau!

655
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,632
- Thanks!
- Merry Christmas, huh?

656
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,245
Thanks!
