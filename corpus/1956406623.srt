(gun fires)
(thunder crashes)

16
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,020
- Well Peter, I am continuing
to stand at the base

17
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,980
of the Richmond-Sanderfeld Bridge,

18
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,870
just moments from San Francisco Bay's

19
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,760
maximum security San Quentin Prison.

20
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,670
What we have seen so far today have been

21
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,940
local and federal law
enforcement officials

22
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,960
launching a massive manhunt
towards the apprehension

23
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,473
of escaped federal prisoners
Odessa and Kyle James.

24
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,110
United States Marshal Lorna McCoy,

25
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,210
with prison warden Samuel
Corothers, just moments ago

26
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,440
in what would have been
a rare public address

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,170
stated that yes indeed, both brothers

28
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,530
did in fact disappear from
the high security wing

29
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,070
of one of the country's most
notorious of all death rows.

30
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,760
We know it was sometime
before dawn this morning

31
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,140
and that one guard has been
confirmed dead on the scene.

32
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,470
Two others were taken to
Parkland Memorial Hospital

33
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,720
where they continue to be
listed in critical condition.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,080
Peter, Susan, it was the
trial that stunned the nation

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,270
and now convicted killers
Odessa and Kyle James

36
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,653
are out amongst the rain, among us.

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,873
- Convicted killers Kyle
and Odessa James are out.

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,383
Amongst the rain, among us.

39
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:58,261
(Suspenseful music)

00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,678
(bell rings)

41
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:36,005
(trunk closes)

42
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,669
- Do you have an eight?

43
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,540
(Laughing)

44
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,110
- Daddy needs to go fishing.

45
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,060
- [Charles] Curses.

46
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,105
(Doorbell rings)

47
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:49,938
- I'll get it.

48
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,831
- Jenny, no running in the house.

49
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:54,860
(Doorbell rings)

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,693
- I'll go too.

51
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,375
(Doorbell rings)

52
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,600
- Dad, you would not
believe what a nightmare

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,060
it is out there.

54
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,680
The cops have roadblocks on the 101, 580,

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,530
even the one that leads into Timeron.

56
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,300
- Hmm.

57
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,600
- The James boys are here.

58
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,583
- So I keep hearing.

59
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,530
- Well you're drenched, honey.

60
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,940
Well, you better go get cleaned up.

61
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,530
- On my way, Daddy dearest.

62
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,570
(Door closes)

63
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,470
(suspenseful music)

64
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,528
- I was waiting on my own.

65
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:37,528
It was dark.

66
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,095
I was scared.

67
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,281
I was tired of being violated.

68
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:48,611
Tired of my brother being violated.

69
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,501
Then my brother was outside my door.

70
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,924
I joined him in the hallway.

71
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:03,174
He took me down until we
reached our parents' room.

72
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,230
He kicked open the door.

73
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,018
He went in, I went in after him.

74
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,366
He sent the first round into them.

75
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:21,523
And then we, my brother
and I, we both fired.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,093
- Oh, okay.

77
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,883
Movie.

78
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:38,953
Three syllables.

79
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,689
(Gags)

80
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,320
- I know this one, The Naked Gun.

81
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,153
(Clapping)

82
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,640
- Mommy wins, Mommy wins.

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,770
- How in the heck is that The Naked Gun?

84
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,300
- Charles, she was clearly portraying

85
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,600
the very gallant Nicole Brown.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,923
It was obvious.

87
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,063
- Jennifer Lynn Ryan,
that was absolutely gross.

88
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,550
No I know I've talked to you about this.

89
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,910
Honey, the taking of a human life,

90
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,863
especially one that's a
young, innocent, beautiful,

91
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:21,752
voluptuous, ooh, perfect
example of femininity.

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,870
Not to mention she's a
pillar of the community.

93
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,320
It's a tragedy, it's an American
tragedy, plain and simple.

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,930
And how my wife of all these years

95
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,930
could've gotten The Naked Gun from that,

96
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,870
well, I'll tell you, it's
beyond me, I'm shocked, Rea,

97
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,293
absolutely shocked.

98
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,170
- [Rea] But I win.

99
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,620
- I've gotten myself all
worked up, over nothing.

100
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,810
Well, I guess we dwelled
on that long enough.

101
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,750
Who wants to go next?

102
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,110
- Jenny, go tell your sister she's gonna

103
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,360
be late for work, please.

104
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,520
- [Jami] So finish the story.

105
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,057
- [Jenny] I already told
you, Dad turned it off

106
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,470
before the greatest hits.

107
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,110
- [Jami] What pictures did they show?

108
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,670
- Usual, trial proceedings, mug shots,

109
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,926
reaction shots of the verdict.

110
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,260
- What about the sentencing?

111
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,890
- Yeah yeah, they showed 'em laughing

112
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,970
when the judge sentenced death.

113
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,120
- The McKenzie twins had it on satellite

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,810
first thing this morning.

115
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,970
One cop said that it was
Odessa who killed a guy,

116
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,640
probably was, that's why
Mom thinks he's so hot.

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,520
He's got that whole OJ
thing going for him.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,693
Totally guilty, totally cute.

119
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,120
- I like Kyle.

120
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,940
- Well, I'm sure he'd be hot to trot

121
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,240
knowing miss just turned
12 was interested.

122
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,690
- I did not just turn 12.

123
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,600
- Well continue to pardon
me, miss two weeks later.

124
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
- Did they really set
up road blocks there?

125
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
- Yeah.

126
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,853
Can you believe it?

127
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,100
Motherfucking Beatty.

128
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,620
I hate this fucking town.

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,100
What are we up to now,
about population seven?

130
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,510
- But it's named after the actor.

131
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,000
- Beatty?

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Warren Beatty, you mean?

133
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,500
Hardly, baby.

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,530
I think it was named after
the Greek god of boredom.

135
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,620
- Do you think they'll come here, Jamie?

136
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,260
- Who, Warren Beatty?

137
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,833
- No, the brothers.

138
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,430
- I don't know, honey.

139
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,293
But (clears throat) if
those boys know what's best,

140
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,553
they better help themselves south.

141
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,535
(Suspenseful music)

142
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:54,770
(thunder rumbling)

143
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,541
- It's cold out there.

144
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,840
- Honey, you're soaked.

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
- Girls are there, no problem.

146
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,840
Jenny wanted to help her sister

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,340
so tonight she's gonna be doing that.

148
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,250
- An assistant babysitter following

149
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,400
in the footsteps of an
official babysitter.

150
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,370
Honey, we should have an employee day.

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,223
Oh, don't forget to lock that door.

152
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,050
You can never tell in this day and age.

153
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,640
Assuming the James brothers will be

154
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,023
paying us a visit, Charles?

155
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,033
- Better safe than sorry.

156
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:45,182
- Better safe than sorry.

157
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,902
(Thunder crashing)

158
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:10,963
(sighs)

159
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,046
- God dammit.

160
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,617
- Ms. McCoy.

161
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,050
- What?

162
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,320
- Rupert MacAlister was
the lieutenant on duty.

163
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,793
Apparently he worked
the closing hours alone.

164
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,330
Caucasian male, 40
years of age, no priors.

165
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,293
Mr. MacAlister was a father of three.

166
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,460
His time card was punched
at nine p.m. sharp,

167
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,369
leaving behind a cash box
of $480 in credit charges

168
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,624
and $209 in cash coin.

169
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,420
And his '86 Ford Mustang,
California license

170
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,050
two Charlie Nevada five niner two,

171
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,690
was discovered abandoned by highway patrol

172
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,790
near check station 12.

173
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,463
- And where was Mr. MacAlister?

174
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,543
- In the trunk.

175
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:13,113
(Water running)

176
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,355
- Nobody does dishes like you.

177
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,188
(Thunder crashes)

178
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:22,056
- Charles, the power's gonna be out soon.

179
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:23,000
- I hope.

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,645
- Three,

181
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,478
two,

182
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,507
one.

183
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,700
(Thunder crashes)

184
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,533
Power's out.

185
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,434
(Knocking)

186
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,160
- Oh, for goodness sake,
on a night like this.

187
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,960
- It's Jenny, she did
say if she was bored.

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,710
- She's probably forgotten her key.

189
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,100
- Sooner you get back,
sooner she's gonna be

190
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,453
in her bed asleep.

191
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:50,190
Charles, she's probably
soaked to the bone.

192
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,107
- Probably.

193
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
- Are you going to get the door?

194
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,413
- Already left.

195
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:57,338
- Go, get the door.

196
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,730
- [Charles] I'm leaving right now.

197
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,563
- Go!

198
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,723
(Suspenseful music)

199
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,333
- Jesus Christ.

200
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,010
- Nope.

201
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,659
(Suspenseful music)

202
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,630
- Both of 'em if you want.

203
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:13,200
What do you need, clothes, money?

204
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,140
I got money, you can have
it, it means nothing to me.

205
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,230
You need a hostage?

206
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,063
I'm your man.

207
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,393
Please.

208
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,760
Please, I beg of both of you.

209
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,403
Do not hurt my wife.

210
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,620
- You people always
have the same confusion.

211
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,283
To compare bravery and brilliance
with a lot of bullshit.

212
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,133
- My wife means the world to me.

213
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,640
Please, just let her go.

214
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
- My wife is the world to
me, please, just let her go,

215
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,940
how fucking noble.

216
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,173
- There are people here in
this town, they'll find you.

217
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,750
They'll find you and arrest you.

218
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,543
- Now why would people be looking for us?

219
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,723
- Why?

220
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,283
Because you're Kyle James.

221
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,040
And that monster there
you call your brother.

222
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,930
- [Kyle] He is my brother.

223
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,763
- Yes.

224
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,563
The infamous Odessa Lee James.

225
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,383
- You obviously benefit
upon knowing who we are.

226
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,263
As for you, I can give a fuck.

227
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,420
But that lingering flower,
the one there with the eyes

228
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,523
of an angel and lips of a god.

229
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,860
The one that gives you the
apparent strength of nobility.

230
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,693
- My wife.

231
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,780
Rea.

232
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,453
Her name is Rea, Rea Ryan.

233
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,460
- I'd like you to make me a drink, Rea.

234
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,030
Nothing fancy, nothing trivial.

235
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,470
I don't want you to become
creative on me, Rea.

236
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,953
So diminish those immediate
thoughts of heroism.

237
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,310
If you fuck with the drink, you die last.

238
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,743
If you die last, you are the winner.

239
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,120
It'll be an experience, Rea, to watch

240
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,570
your movements of expression
as I calmly and collectively

241
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,560
will gut the Mr. Fuck
you nobility man there.

242
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,710
- If you're gonna talk like that,

243
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,550
you can just take it somewhere else.

244
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,350
I won't have that kind
of vulgarity in my house,

245
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,310
especially when it's
directed towards my wife.

246
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,143
- Fuck you.

247
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,713
Charles.

248
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,593
Is this you?

249
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,230
Well it must be.

250
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,497
Yeah, one Charles Winwood
Ryan, you don't mind, do you?

251
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,823
Well, I guess you know you've
maxed out your Visa card.

252
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,740
All these penalties and interest.

253
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,900
Apparently you haven't been
making your payments, Charles,

254
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,000
and I'd say that puts you in some trouble.

255
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,570
Well, let's see here.

256
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
You could always get a loan from a friend

257
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,110
or steal an old lady's
handbag, or you might even try

258
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,200
selling assault rifles to
right-wing biblical adversaries.

259
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,790
The point is, regardless of what you do,

260
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,323
always pay what you owe, Charles.

261
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,940
You see, I'm a firm
believer that credit cards

262
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,240
were the fall for this country.

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,350
Buy now, pay later, the American dream

264
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,437
of owning what we can't afford

265
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:17,083
and spending what god knows we don't make.

266
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,033
You know what it is?

267
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,480
It's an organized crime
against the misfortunate many.

268
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,763
A corporate-made suicide for
a shattered middle class.

269
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:34,863
- Why?

270
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:37,969
Why'd you do it?

271
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,233
Why did you kill your parents?

272
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,192
We've heard all the rumors.

273
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,830
All your endless rambling thoughts.

274
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,740
That ended up emblazoned
on the front pages

275
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,883
of the newspapers.

276
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,210
From the trash tabloids to
that bullshit autobiography

277
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,060
you used to set up your defense fund.

278
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,113
What was it?

279
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,660
What was it, physical abuse?

280
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,623
Mental abuse?

281
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,263
All those childhood charges
of molestation and sodomy?

282
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,070
There truth to any of that?

283
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,410
- Charles, that's the only
thing that you can ask me,

284
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,210
the only question that's
been asked repeatedly

285
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,820
almost yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly,

286
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,380
and every motherfucking
moment in two state trials,

287
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,210
one goddamn state board appeal,

288
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,863
and one jack-me-off interview
with that bitch Ricki Lake.

289
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,700
- I wish I could agree with the comradery

290
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,450
of those wishful thinking
statements of yours, Charlie.

291
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,070
Looking back now, as a
free man in confusion,

292
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,780
those were all indeed desperate
last minute solutions.

293
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,850
Thoughts that stormed high
towards the pending future

294
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,473
of a never-ending incarceration.

295
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,240
I killed both my mother
and father, Charlie.

296
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
Their death emerged slow.

297
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,830
It was filled with the
absolute agony of despair.

298
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,290
Only the darkness would cloud.

299
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,337
This was my end.

300
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,630
An ending of painless peace for a boy

301
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,923
who longed to see death.

302
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,123
Money brought motivation, Charlie,

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,733
and the motivation sought murder.

304
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,620
Tell me you were a good girl, Rea.

305
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,240
- I was very good to you, Mr. James.

306
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,073
- Odessa.

307
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:39,685
- Odessa.

308
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,620
- Charles, I'm curious, is this

309
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,253
your video collection over here?

310
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,220
(Laughs)

311
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,400
My, what a vivid array of
shit you own, let's see here.

312
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,763
Crap, crap, crap.

313
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:01,373
Ha, this is the absolute
biggest piece of crap.

314
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,800
Free Willy, Charles?

315
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,023
You should die now.

316
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:09,450
- You know what the only redeemable moment

317
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,913
of Free Willy is, Charlie?

318
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,970
- That film I thought was quite suitable.

319
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,803
- No it wasn't!

320
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,910
- My brother takes this one
most personally, Charlie.

321
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,670
But to answer my own question,

322
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,770
Free Willy, redeemable points, only one.

323
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,680
Michael Madison smoking cigarettes.

324
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,300
- We believe in family fair entertainment

325
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,113
in this household, Mr. James.

326
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,190
Regardless of what unstable individuals

327
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,900
like yourselves might think.

328
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,580
- Well, wait a minute, I
owe you an apology, Charles.

329
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,090
Once Upon a Time in the West?

330
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,660
This is a classic, Charles
Bronson, Henry Fonda?

331
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,003
A tale of revenge and retribution?

332
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,970
- That film belongs to a neighbor.

333
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,083
- Of course it does.

334
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,550
Why?

335
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,590
Because quality and you would be like

336
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,410
a paraplegic trying to masturbate.

337
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,240
You try and you try and you try,

338
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,390
but you never quite
get it, do you Charles?

339
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,070
Kids, kids, kids, the rest of
this is a bunch of kids' crap,

340
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,660
and I'm having a hard time
picturing you watching this.

341
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,880
- We have a child.

342
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,423
- Our daughter.

343
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:24,340
She's moved away from home,
first year of college.

344
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,130
- Presented with such
admirability, Charlie.

345
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,713
For the man who owns not
one Mickey Rourke movie.

346
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:34,260
When I look at your wife, Charlie,

347
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,270
I see a female, a young woman,

348
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,820
a goddamn wet dream pushing
the bounds of bewilderment.

349
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,800
- Okay, let's go back here.

350
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,740
Charles, these are kids' tapes.

351
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,473
So tell us about the child.

352
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,800
- Two.

353
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,850
We have two children.

354
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,093
Two girls.

355
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,410
- Their expected arrival is when?

356
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:01,580
(Clears throat)

357
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,840
- 11.

358
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,530
- Are they at a friend's house, Rea?

359
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,020
Maybe with a parent?

360
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,160
Someone who'll come to the door with them?

361
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,180
- No.

362
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,610
Babysitting.

363
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,330
- Tell me about your children, Rea.

364
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,020
- Don't tell them any more.

365
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,793
- Rea, I don't wanna
hate them at this point.

366
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,693
Two girls, babysitters, begin.

367
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,893
- Jami, well, she's the eldest.

368
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,953
17, she's just now 17 years old.

369
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:37,770
- Word just came down
from Parkland Memorial.

370
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,760
Both of the Quentin
guards certified deceased.

371
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,010
We got a statement though.

372
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,880
One of the guards, still semi-conscious,

373
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,550
says he overheard a voice.

374
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,150
Now he can't tell which one
of our lost boys he heard,

375
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,310
but a name came up.

376
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,033
- Lennox.

377
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,200
Goddamn swear to Christ.

378
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,090
Boys are out, sent 'em down death row.

379
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,842
Kincaid, come back.

380
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:58,675
- [Kincaid] Kincaid here, over.

381
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:01,440

one Dick and Marlene Lennox.

382
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,250

392
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,560
Witness protection withdrawn
December 12th, 1995.

393
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,643
- Shit.

394
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:32,830
- All available units to
1135 Eat McConnell, let's go.

395
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,620
First comers, use a door-to-door,
two-by-two formation,

396
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,440
subjects are armed, repeat,
subjects will indeed be armed,

397
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,510
possible hostage situation.

398
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,813
Suspects are two, Odessa James,
Kyle John, let's go, people.

399
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,681
(Engine starts)
(siren wails)

400
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:49,678
(lighter flicks)

401
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,678
(suspenseful music)

402
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,370
- You ever have one of those days, Rea,

403
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,350
which eventually turns into this night,

404
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,677
which makes you stop and ask
the very question of why?

405
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,720
As a child, Rea, I had a dream.

406
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,902
It was the one true destiny
for which rightly I deserved.

407
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,840
A movie, Rea.

408
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,470
To write, direct, act, and produce.

409
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,333
Just one goddamn movie.

410
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,830
Shit, at least I can die knowing

411
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,820
I never bought any of that white bread

412
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,310
Leave it to Beaver,
don't walk in the rain,

413
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,423
home by dark theory shit.

414
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,697
My life, a tolerant tale,
where the good becomes poor

415
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:59,150
and the rich evil, and
life, Rea, just life.

416
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:02,867
One simple motherfuckin' life.

417
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,547
Life on the edge.

418
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,268
The American dream.

419
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,673
Charles and Rea Ryan, the happy couple.

420
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,790
Two daughters, championship.

421
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,084
(Suspenseful music)

422
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,839
(gate creaks)

423
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:29,750
(gagging)

424
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,000
(vomiting)

425
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:34,801
(insects chirping)

426
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,468
(intense music)

427
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,942
- Holy Mary mother of god.

428
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,396
(Suspenseful music)

429
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,989
(door closes)

430
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,398
- Welcome home, honey.

431
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,240
- Coroner's moving 'em now.

432
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,450
By his estimate, figuring
over 100, 150 stab wounds.

433
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,930
- Time of death?

434
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,466
- [Man] No.

435
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,930
- What do you mean no?

436
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,394
- No time of death, not yet, no.

437
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,130
- Boys are pissing me off.

438
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,680
They're going down.

439
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,060
This very night, down in
fuckin' Pisswater USA.

440
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,570
And then I'm taking 'em
home back to Quentin,

441
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,890
where I personally am gonna gas

442
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,540
the second goddamn
fucking life out of them.

443
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,080
- Beatty PD found a blood
trail about a half mile down.

444
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,230
- Have it matched against both brothers.

445
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,183
- [Man] Preliminary shows AB negative.

446
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:55,563
- Kyle John James.

447
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:02,574
(Grunts)

448
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:05,074
- [Jami] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

449
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,914
- [Jenny] This is all I could find.

450
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:10,747
- Perfect.

451
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:26,046
(Knocking)

452
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,238
- [Beverly] It's Beverly, Rea, open up!

453
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:31,260
(Knocking)

454
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,460
- She's just a neighbor.

455
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,035
(Knocking)

456
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,680
- Kyle, Jami, Jen, upstairs.

457
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,482
Miss Ryan, you and I
have a date with destiny.

458
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,732
(Knocking)

459
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,810
- It's Beverly, open up, Rea, open up!

460
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:53,793
(Knocking)

461
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:57,750
Oh Rea, it's awful, the
Lennox family's dead!

462
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,583
- Dick and Marlene?

463
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,330
- And the children!

464
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,570
- Oh god.

465
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,160
- Don't you have your radio on?

466
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,100
They think it's those
convicts, the two brothers.

467
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,510
- Beverly, now's not a real good time.

468
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,870
- But Rea, where's Charles, shouldn't he

469
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,310
be helping the police?

470
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,830
- He's in bed asleep, good night, Beverly.

471
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,030
- But Rea, what about the James brothers?

472
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,850
- I'm sure they're just fine
and a long ways from here,

473
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,859
so good night now, Beverly.

474
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,140
- But Rea!

475
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,390
(Knocking)

476
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:28,478
(gun fires)

477
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,550
(suspenseful music)

478
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:59,483
- But out of all the towns,
Kyle, why would you pick here?

479
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,823
Jesus, Beatty?

480
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,990
I still can't believe my mother

481
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,540
is sitting down there with
your brothers like that.

482
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:16,842
(Mysterious music)

483
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,053
I like you, Kyle.

484
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,673
I like you a lot.

485
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,433
And I'm your biggest fan.

486
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,032
(Crashing)

487
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,980
(suspenseful music)

488
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,900
- Jenny, you were told to stay upstairs.

489
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,322
- But I just wanted to
ask Mr. James something.

490
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:37,849
- And what is that, darling?

491
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,573
- Mr. James sir, can I get your autograph?

492
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,610
(Suspenseful music)

493
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:14,310
- Those two I met because of Daddy.

494
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,903
He has such great connections.

495
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,100
- Jerry Mathers and Bob Barker?

496
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,200
God damn, Charlie,
whose dick did you suck?

497
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:29,347
- Mr. James, wait!

498
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,180
Wait!

499
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,516
Okay, okay, sorry, I'm sorry.

500
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,933
It's just that he's my absolute favorite.

501
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,916
Adam West, he's such a dream.

502
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,080
- Can you hear it, Charlie?

503
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,180
The pounding of the bed frame?

504
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,770
The screws turning, bolts falling?

505
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,373
Sweat angels and the pants.

506
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,253
The pant, Charlie.

507
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,803
The try to be quiet so no one
will know we're fucking pant.

508
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,490
- God damn, look at him go. (Laughs)

509
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,310
- Word of advice, Charlie, my brother,

510
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,670
bay captain of boating.

511
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,290
He ties a knot, unmovable.

512
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,533
So Mr. Ryan, sir, don't move.

513
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,280
I wanna hear your daughter fuck.

514
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:51,490
They came.

515
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,210
Ravishing Rea, one widower to Charlie.

516
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,780
So what do you say, Rea?

517
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,063
Testimony and tea or Mexico, you and me?

518
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,810
- Mexico.

519
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,030
- Think it, Rea.

520
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,483
Mexico, the American
dream elsewhere found.

521
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:18,426
(Mysterious music)

522
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,510
- I know the brothers.

523
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,957
I know 'em both.

524
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,257
I used to have lunch
with them down at county.

525
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,833
For two years, that
boy sat across from me.

526
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,103
Just watching.

527
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,900
He never feared death like most of us do.

528
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,525
Because how can you fear death

529
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:47,862
when you never lived your life?

530
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:49,550
And then he was alone.

531
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,363
Kyle was hospitalized
during a jailhouse brawl.

532
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,313
And that was the day I saw through him.

533
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,957
Past him.

534
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,147
And I asked him for the truth.

535
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,927
And I asked him why.

536
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,960
One solitary tear slid down his face.

537
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:22,197
And then he said, "revenge."

538
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:32,347
- You fell for them, didn't you?

539
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,004
- Yeah.

540
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,746
(Knocking)

541
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,980

(mysterious music)

545
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,063

546
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:32,572
Beverly!

547
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:04,585
(Suspenseful music)

548
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:07,080
- Hughes, come back.

549
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,180
- [Hughes] Not a goddamn thing, ma'am.

550
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,430
- What do mean not a goddamn thing?

551
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,408
Who the fuck do you
have out there with you?

552
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:13,241
(Hughes laughs)

553
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,640
- [Hughes] Half of this
piece of shit county,

554
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,483
local boys from Frisco and half
of the damn National Guard.

555
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:18,316
- Hmm.

556
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:19,330
Yeah.

557
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,880
Dawson, Samuel, where's he at?

558
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,872
- [Hughes] Hell if I know.

559
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:24,034
- [Dawson] Go for D.

560
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,640
- Mr. Dawson.

561
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,070
What's this crap I'm hearing about you

562
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,528
convincing the James boys to surrender?

563
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,953
- [Dawson] Yeah, well,
we certainly didn't shove

564
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,278
any rocks down their throats.

565
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:34,097
- Ha ha ha, what a dick.

566
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,130
- [Dawson] What do you wanna
do with his dick, ma'am?

567
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,397
- [Hughes] Eh, go fuck yourself with it.

568
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:40,000
- Two words, assholes.

569
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,630
Traffic duty, so over and
fuckin' out, good fuckin' bye,

570
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,780
fuck you, and I'll see
you fuckers in hell.

571
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,953
- Beverly.

572
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,980
- No.

573
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,900
You sure it wasn't backfire,
or a firecracker possibly?

574
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,790
- I was in World War II, god
dammit, don't you go tellin' me

575
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,522
what you think I heard.

576
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:04,790
(Dog barking)

577
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,620
- Now, your wife Beverly.

578
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,030
Let's go back to her for a second.

579
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,720
- She went to check on the neighbors.

580
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,670
She went over there.

581
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,840
She went to that house, right there,

582
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,220
the one I been tellin' ya about.

583
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,703
Jesus Christ almighty on a goddamn crutch.

584
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,120
- Now, you said that the gunshot

585
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,427
came from that general vicinity.

586
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:33,750
(Man sighs)

587
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,750
- Son, the gunshot came from
that house, right there.

588
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,803
It came from the Ryan house.

589
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,520
- Mr. And Mrs. Charles Ryan.

590
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,188
- Oh Miller, shut up.

591
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,060
And what is that?

592
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,110
Go get the uncut on Charles and Rea Ryan.

593
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,313
Go.

594
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,680
- The phone, well it ain't
been workin' since the storm,

595
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and well Beverly, she wanted,
well she wanted to help,

596
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,680
and I didn't want her to
worry, you know, she worries.

597
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,500
And Charlie, well he's such a hard worker.

598
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,521
And well, ever since the storm,

599
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:21,917
she wanted to go over and make sure Rea

600
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,710
didn't have any problems, you know,

601
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,550
with her being alone with
the children and all.

602
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,190
- Children?

603
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,660
- Yes ma'am, two girls.

604
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,803

Off-green artificial tree.

660
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,550
Carolers.

661
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,550
The patter of eight tiny
reindeer and small jingle bells.

662
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,250
Oh what a silent night.

663
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,730
That is of, unless you don't wanna count

664
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,170
the 27 double buck
rounds which are blasted,

665
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,763
pounding, and ripping into
both you and your better half.

666
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,473
Christmas goddamn motherfuckin' Eve.

667
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:52,593
Yeah.

668
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,690
I'd have done it then.

669
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,743
One shit-kicked homicidal holiday.

670
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,563
So, Kyle James, you wanna
fuck me again, killer?

671
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,793
- Jami, do you watch a little TV?

672
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,140
- [Jami] What?

673
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,973
- TV.

674
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,220
We had a TV in prison and I used to spend

675
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,760
all my time watching it.

676
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,300
Watching all those white trash programs.

677
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,900
And I would wonder if those
people really did exist.

678
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:29,240
And now I'm here with you
and now I know that they do.

679
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,770
Do I wanna fuck you?

680
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,150
Yeah.

681
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,440
That's all anybody would
ever wanna do with you,

682
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,397
and since we already did that,

683
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:37,750
why don't you just take your cute ass

684
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,346
and go make my fucking dinner.

685
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,858
(Jami laughs)

686
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:43,367
- [Jami] You're kidding.

687
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:44,231
(Laughs)

688
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:46,630
- No.

689
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,173
- You know what I think?

690
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,043
I think you've been bent over
one too many times, Kyle.

691
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:54,500
I think your tired little white ass

692
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,473
can just go on and serve itself.

693
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:01,863
- [Kyle] Jami.

694
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:03,833
- What?

695
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,360
- [Kyle] Please.

696
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,193
- Fuck you.

697
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,080
We got all you can eat in the pantry.

698
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,090
- [Kyle] And I can find
that where, sweetie?

699
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,810
- Just downstairs, honey.

700
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,053
You can't miss it.

701
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,463
- You, Odessa James, I could've loved.

702
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:30,414
I could've loved you forever.

703
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:32,363
Will they catch you?

704
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,098
- [Odessa] No.

705
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:36,693
- Then go, go now.

706
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,071
Run.

707
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,165
They're coming.

708
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:55,582
(Suspenseful music)

709
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,380
- Jenny.

710
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,773
Jenny, how long?

711
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:36,003
- They're right outside, Mom.

712
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:38,253
They're here, they're here!

713
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:11,537
- Bob?

714
00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:15,452
Who the fuck is Bob?

715
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,830
(Suspenseful music)

716
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:37,697
- Mr. Ryan, I'm United
States Marshal Lorna McCoy.

717
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,603
Mr. Ryan?

718
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,440
We're here to help you,
can you tell me where--

719
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,273
- The boys.

720
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,033
You must be looking for the boys.

721
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,860
Odessa seems to have taken quite a liking

722
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,053
towards my wife, Rea.

723
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,543
They hit it off.

724
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,780
She seems pleased.

725
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,480
That's important, you know,
a marriage needs pleasing.

726
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,870
- Mr. Ryan, can you tell me where he is?

727
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,861
Is he still in the house?

728
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:11,973
- Sure, he's right upstairs.

729
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,370
I can smell his cigarette.

730
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,343
Nasty habit.

731
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:22,023
Kyle on the other hand, well,
his hunger overcame him.

732
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,923
He's in the pantry.

733
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,590
A limited selection to be sure.

734
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,740
Nevertheless, that's
where he can be found.

735
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,352
(Insects chirping)

736
00:50:06,697 --> 00:50:08,394
- Exteriors.

737
00:50:08,394 --> 00:50:09,894
- [Man On Radio] Nothing.

738
00:50:09,894 --> 00:50:11,380
- Shitters.

739
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,463
- [Man On Radio] Nothing.

740
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:19,286
(Dramatic music)

741
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,999
(gun fires)

742
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:37,504
(insects chirping)
(suspenseful music)

743
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:56,463
- Back in 'Nam, with boys like you,

744
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:02,428
I used to come in their ass for breakfast.

745
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:04,261
Those were good times.

746
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:07,350
- Did you ever have
one of those days, Odi,

747
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,670
which eventually turns into this night,

748
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,523
which makes you stop and ask
the very question of why?

749
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,280
This little piggie went to the market.

750
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,800
This little piggie went to the store.

751
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,673
But these five piggies
here, well they went down.

752
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:36,773
(Banging)

753
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:47,447
- The silent freedom of hostility.

754
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:51,466
The chambering of another
thoughtless round.

755
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:53,883
(Gun clicks)

756
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:00,540
- You wanna fuck me, Odessa?

757
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,761
Goddamn piece of shit,
take it in the ass liking

758
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:08,863
son of a bitch, come fuck me, Odessa!

759
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,364
(Gun clicking)

760
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:13,197
- Uh-oh.

761
00:52:15,113 --> 00:52:17,926
I think we may have a runner.

762
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,114
(Gun fires)

763
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:21,864
(dramatic music)

764
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:23,759
- Hi!

765
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:26,176
(Gun firing)

766
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:35,156
- [Charles] Odessa James.

767
00:52:37,314 --> 00:52:40,070
(Gun clicking)

768
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,070
- Hi Odessa.

769
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:12,509
(Lighter clicks)

770
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:15,509
(suspenseful music)

771
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,474
- Where have you brought me, girl?

772
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:40,724
(Laughing)

773
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,542
(gun firing)

774
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,700
(guns firing)

775
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,076
(gun firing)

776
00:56:52,295 --> 00:56:54,896
(glass breaks)

777
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:57,063
(belches)

778
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,986
- [Kyle] What the fuck are you doing?

779
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:09,902
What, what?

780
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:12,810
No!

781
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:18,079
(Whimpers)

782
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,020
- We speak of god, that path he trod,

783
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:35,020
and of that righteous
day he toyed with clay.

784
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,833
- Joseph Paul Kretzen.

785
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,323
Murdered, Alcatraz Island, 1946.

786
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,393
- Lorna McCoy.

787
00:57:47,407 --> 00:57:49,343
- Damn you, Odessa James.

788
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,357
Goddamn you.

789
00:57:58,502 --> 00:58:00,835
You know I have to kill you.

790
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:05,263
And you know you have to die, you know it.

791
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:10,815
- [Odessa] Not today.

792
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,720
- Jenny, don't you think it's
a little early for Halloween?

793
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,830
- Oh, I don't know.

794
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,760
Sorta gives the whole situation a kind of

795
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,790
biblical ending, if you ask me.

796
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,013
- Odessa and that lady, the policewoman.

797
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,270
- Marshal, honey, she was
a United States Marshal.

798
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,733
- She's alive.

799
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,720
- Really?

800
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,950
Must be losing my touch.

801
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,863
- Uh-huh.

802
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,410
She's in the underworld with Mr. James.

803
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,120
I saw 'em smoking a cigarette together.

804
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,080
- Jennifer Lynn, is there something

805
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,630
you might like to share with this family,

806
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,740
like maybe of you helping Mr. James?

807
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,590
- Like I'm really sure, Dad.

808
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:08,373
Did he or did he not like rip
up my Adam West signature?

809
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:11,993
- Yes, of course, I'd forgotten.

810
00:59:12,872 --> 00:59:15,640
- Bob's still with Kyle.

811
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,993
- Anything from Bob?

812
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,473
- No news is good news.

813
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,280
- Yes, well he does need the company.

814
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:29,100
(Door opens)

815
00:59:30,602 --> 00:59:31,435
(gun clicks)

816
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:34,339
(gun firing)

817
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,879
(thuds)

818
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:38,129
(whooshes)

819
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,583
Another storm is expected by midweek.

820
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:46,645
It says right here, another
three to four inches is coming.

821
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:48,241
Well.

822
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:50,680
Guess it's safe to say,
so much for the drought

823
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,783
in California.

824
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,550
Honey, would you hand
me one of those cookies?

825
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,720
One of those funny looking ones there

826
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,510
with the sprinkles on top?

827
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,500
- Or a ladyfinger?

828
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,880
- No, I think not.

829
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,690
That's a little too
heavy for after dinner.

830
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,040
I'll stick with the cookie.

831
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,733
Thank you.

832
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:13,607
Mm.

833
01:00:14,898 --> 01:00:15,731
Mm.

834
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:22,273
(Light music)

835
01:00:28,576 --> 01:00:30,576
(spits)

836
01:00:45,656 --> 01:00:47,506
(spits)

837
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:49,589
(scoffs)

838
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,366
(mysterious music)

839
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,616
- You're a pain in the ass.

840
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,833
Pain in my ass, you are.

841
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:09,328
What?

842
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,912
What?

843
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:12,745
(Gun clicks)

844
01:01:12,745 --> 01:01:13,578
What's there?

845
01:01:24,053 --> 01:01:27,053
(Suspenseful music)

846
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,483
- [Narrator] America's favorite killers,

847
01:01:29,483 --> 01:01:34,380

- [Jenny] Daddy, I think Bob is having

863
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,383
some troubles with Kyle.

864
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,670
I just heard him release a plaintive wail,

865
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,767
just a hop, skip, and a
jump from a second ago.

866
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:26,869
(Cheerful music)

867
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,930
- Your brother.

868
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,763
Odessa.

869
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,193
He's left you, Kyle.

870
01:02:34,582 --> 01:02:35,915
And I liked him.

871
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:38,993
Lord knows my wife approved.

872
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,770
I just opened the door,
off and away he went.

873
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:46,123
- Yeah?

874
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:48,863
- Yeah.

875
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,203
Now, about Bob.

876
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:59,183
He's explained it to me,
and I think I understand.

877
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,700
And I could also understand
how you might think

878
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,163
he's a little bit different.

879
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:08,453
But he really is a very sweet fellow.

880
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,960
And you may not be able
to tell by looking at him,

881
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,823
but he is one hell of a lover.

882
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:17,771
(Whines)

883
01:03:19,249 --> 01:03:21,372
Let's get to the point.

884
01:03:21,372 --> 01:03:24,043
You've been pushing
away from his advances.

885
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,973
Kyle.

886
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,100
Now what's up with that?

887
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,913
Hmm?

888
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:32,363
Look at me, Kyle.

889
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:36,353
Look at me, Kyle.

890
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,000
- Fuck Bob, Charles.

891
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,210
I'm gonna get out of here with absolutely

892
01:03:44,148 --> 01:03:46,980
no explanation at all,
because I also understand

893
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,280
and feel that it's going to come simple.

894
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,297
Now as for my brother, and
the theory of off and away,

895
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:56,227
you're right, he's not coming back for me,

896
01:03:56,227 --> 01:03:59,160
and do you know why, you fuck?

897
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,370
Because he never left.

898
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,450
You see, that's the difference between

899
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:08,730
being a James and a fuck like a Ryan.

900
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,100
Now Charles, my brother and
I are going to kill you,

901
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,410
your cunt wife, your bitch daughters,

902
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,620
and last but not least, the beheading

903
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,950
of dear good old Bob.

904
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:23,620
(Whining)

905
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,240
- Yeah?

906
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,453
- Yeah.

907
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:28,620
(Whining)

908
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:35,697
(dramatic music)

909
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:42,806
(guns firing)

910
01:04:46,443 --> 01:04:49,360
(mysterious music)

911
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,093
- Rea.

912
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:00,619
I want you so much.

913
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:03,080
Let me have you, let me
make love to you right now,

914
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,913
what do you say?

915
01:05:03,913 --> 01:05:05,930
- Charles, not now, maybe later.

916
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:06,763
Okay?

917
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,760
- Did you like it?

918
01:05:16,563 --> 01:05:19,100
Did you like getting fucked by that kid?

919
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:19,933
- Yeah.

920
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,673
- Did you come?

921
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:26,793
- God, yes.

922
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,280
- Would you have fucked him again?

923
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,143
- Yeah.

924
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,023
- But you were gonna
kill him, honey bunny.

925
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,363
- And I would've, but I
would've fucked him first.

926
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:50,373
- Kyle James.

927
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,163
What a pussy.

928
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,883
- Odessa Lee, what a coward.

929
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,490
What are you doing?

930
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:04,603
- I'm saying my prayers, honey.

931
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,283
Nations raged, but thy wrath came.

932
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,513
The time for the dead to be judged.

933
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:22,043
For rewarding thy servants,
the prophets and saints,

934
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:27,303
and those who fear thy
name, both small and great.

935
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,923
For destroying the destroyers of Earth.

936
01:06:33,692 --> 01:06:36,068
Amen.

937
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:36,901
- Amen.

938
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:47,581
- You going back to sleep, honey?

939
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:48,414
- Mm-hmm.

940
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,443
Why don't you go see Jami?

941
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,423
She's probably still awake.

942
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,757
- Yeah.

943
01:07:00,757 --> 01:07:02,963
Yeah, I'll go climb in with Jami.

944
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,577
See you in the morning.

945
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:11,700
- Odessa?

946
01:07:27,705 --> 01:07:28,872
You regret me?

947
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,984
- You were the only one who gave me hope.

948
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:43,597
- You're gonna be okay, right?

949
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:50,616
I loved you, Odessa.

950
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,436
Like a mother.

951
01:07:56,944 --> 01:07:59,111
If I was yours I would've.

952
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:16,850
See you soon.

953
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:18,760
Right?

954
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:22,953
Kill 'em all.

955
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,592
(Mysterious music)

956
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:51,677
- God damn, eh?

957
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:58,897
You know, I wanted the colonial
house, and you said no.

958
01:08:58,897 --> 01:09:01,290
And so then I wanted the adobe,

959
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,660
and you said nothing Spanish.

960
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,530
And instead, you picked the only house

961
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,223
with a fucking dungeon.

962
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,194
It's a lovely home though,
don't get me wrong.

963
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:14,277
(Laughs)

964
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,529
(lighter clicks)

965
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,529
(suspenseful music)

966
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,020
Do you wanna kill her or do you want me?

967
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:38,683
(Jenny laughing)

968
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:41,433
- Where did she go, nobody knows.

969
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,960
Brother James, I think it's
time we show the Ryan family

970
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,123
just who the fuck death is.

971
01:10:19,517 --> 01:10:20,350
(Guns clicking)

972
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,267
(mysterious music)

973
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:38,436
(guns fire)

974
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:29,188
(intense rock music)
(guns firing)

975
01:11:29,188 --> 01:11:32,105
(thunder crashing)

976
01:12:16,117 --> 01:12:18,910
- The fuck did they get those guns?

977
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,310
It wasn't like Bob gave
'em the goddamn weapons.

978
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,763
- Maybe it was Bob?

979
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:31,238
- Yeah.

980
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:33,398
(Laughing)

981
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:34,231
Yeah.

982
01:12:35,169 --> 01:12:37,252
(Laughs)

983
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,620
I think it's time to show
those pussy James brothers

984
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,543
just what it means to be a Ryan.

985
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:56,043
- Yeah.

986
01:12:57,023 --> 01:12:58,679
- Damn, I'm feeling good.

987
01:12:58,679 --> 01:12:59,512
Woo!

988
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:09,899
(Wind blowing)

989
01:13:28,143 --> 01:13:29,930
(suspenseful music)

990
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,183
- Let's see.

991
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,033
What do you think, M16?

992
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,893
That's my girl.

993
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,247
I'm so proud of you.

994
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,860
And honey, I don't know, what
do you think, that outfit?

995
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,780
- I think basic black.

996
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,613
Shotgun.

997
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:06,512
- Yeah.

998
01:14:09,106 --> 01:14:12,106
I got just what you need right here.

999
01:14:23,636 --> 01:14:25,381
(Dramatic music)

1000
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,881
(guns firing)

1001
01:14:43,347 --> 01:14:44,860
- Damn.

1002
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,277
(Rea laughs)

1003
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,593
Jesus H. Christ, I feel for this country.

1004
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,040
It's no wonder the conviction rate

1005
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,320
fucking sucks in this country.

1006
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,135
Sending me these pussies here.

1007
01:14:58,135 --> 01:15:00,560
(Gun fires)

1008
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,580
Do a man's job by trying to kill me.

1009
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,450
Me!

1010
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,330
God damn, don't these people
know who the fuck I am?!

1011
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,220
- Would you like some
meatloaf for dinner, love?

1012
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,190
- Yeah, that sounds great.

1013
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:11,770
Don't they know not to fuck with me?

1014
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,755
To fuck with my family?

1015
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:14,797
(Gun firing)

1016
01:15:14,797 --> 01:15:15,630
- Fuck 'em!

1017
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,730
(Gun firing)

1018
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,380
- Where are those James brothers?

1019
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:22,405
They still killing those dwellers?

1020
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,320
(Laughs)

1021
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,473
Maybe they have some balls after all.

1022
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,773
Maybe they're ready to
dance with the devil.

1023
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,723
(Gun clicks)

1024
01:15:34,723 --> 01:15:36,773
- You know, with all these sparks flying,

1025
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,530
kinda reminds me of our honeymoon.

1026
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,363
- Yeah?

1027
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,283
- Yeah.

1028
01:15:45,756 --> 01:15:48,186
(Suspenseful music)

1029
01:15:48,186 --> 01:15:50,686
(guns firing)

1030
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:12,500
- [Soldier] That's a gun.

1031
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,233
Listen, I can just leave.

1032
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,579
(Mumbling)

1033
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:21,861
I can just leave you
guys alone if, oh shit.

1034
01:16:21,861 --> 01:16:24,361
(Guns firing)

1035
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,857
(gun clicks)

1036
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,351
- [Rea] Motherfucker!

1037
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:57,451
(Guns firing)

1038
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,233
- Sweetie.

1039
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,003
- Kyle James.

1040
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:51,313
I'm curious.

1041
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,340
When you put your dick inside of me,

1042
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,553
how long was it there before I noticed?

1043
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,750
You're a shitty fuck, Kyle.

1044
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,439
A real goddamn disappointment.

1045
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:09,080
(Gun firing)

1046
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,797
Daddy's much better.

1047
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:16,586
(Gun firing)

1048
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:17,419
(squelches)

1049
01:18:17,419 --> 01:18:18,586
- Stupid fuck!

1050
01:18:22,968 --> 01:18:24,950
Odessa Lee James.

1051
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,670
One of the most notorious of all killers

1052
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,400
to ever walk the row.

1053
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,953
You know, look at me!

1054
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,093
You were my fucking hero!

1055
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:40,030
Can I ask you, lover, while you feel

1056
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,823
this moment's for a smile?

1057
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,430
- An ending of painless peace for a boy

1058
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,693
who longed to see death.

1059
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,200
- How about showing me a wee bit

1060
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,880
of some sort of fucking disappointment.

1061
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,713
- Why?

1062
01:18:57,557 --> 01:18:59,020
- Why?

1063
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,807
Because I'm about to blow
your goddamn head off.

1064
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:04,890
(Laughs)

1065
01:19:05,757 --> 01:19:08,720
- You know Rea, I just
thought of something

1066
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,080
really fucking funny.

1067
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,120
- And what's that?

1068
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,703
- You.

1069
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,512
Dead.

1070
01:19:17,512 --> 01:19:19,845
(Gun fires)

1071
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:27,433
Ever had one of those days, Rea?

1072
01:19:54,952 --> 01:19:57,369
(Gun firing)

1073
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:04,645
(guns firing)

1074
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,837
- Am I meant to say, in my humble way,

1075
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:47,003
if another is right or wrong?

1076
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Or am I to judge with never a budge

1077
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,243
if another is weak or strong?

1078
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:56,813
God.

1079
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:02,500
He came down through the
ages to write a small code,

1080
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,513
in that mode he created for
his brothers iron cages.

1081
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,880
Sat himself on a throne, that he alone

1082
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,173
might judge the deeds of others.

1083
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:19,610
Through his greed, and wanton need,

1084
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:23,003
created the sins of his brothers.

1085
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,190
Said he, with a sneer, I am here,

1086
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:32,010
and this is the rightful code.

1087
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:36,183
Before me you stand, why, at hand,

1088
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:39,813
it's you who must bear the load.

1089
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,210
How long the lout can stand and shout

1090
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:46,173
of god and noble things.

1091
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:51,150
Can turn it around and knock to the ground

1092
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,873
the man who laughs or sings.

1093
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:06,030
As a child, Odessa, I too had a dream.

1094
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:12,763
Be strong in the lord, and
in the power of his might.

1095
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,310
Put on the whole armor of
god, that ye might be able

1096
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:21,430
to stand against the wild, the devil.

1097
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:32,763
I'll see you in hell, Odessa Lee James.

1098
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,770
- Hell, Charlie, is gonna be
like a family fucking reunion.

1099
01:22:44,104 --> 01:22:47,104
(Suspenseful music)

1100
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,457
(gun firing)

1101
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:23,612
(explodes)

1102
01:23:33,325 --> 01:23:35,992
(siren wailing)

1103
01:23:46,658 --> 01:23:49,575
(thunder rumbling)

1104
01:24:04,922 --> 01:24:05,962
- Fuck.

1105
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:08,462
(Guns firing)

1106
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:14,908
(cheerful music)

1107
01:26:55,536 --> 01:26:58,369
(Multicom Jingle)
