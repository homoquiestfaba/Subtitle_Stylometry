1
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,100
Thank you, D.C. Thank you.

2
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,166
Thank you. Thank you.

3
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,376
Thank you.

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,876
Thank you.

5
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,009
Whoo!

6
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,009
Oh. D.C., thank you,
Washington, D.C.

7
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,333
on the weekend.

8
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:43,443
Let's turn the law machine off

9
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,743
and party.

10
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,976
Yeah.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,042
Let's keep partying,
'cause the show's not over

12
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,266
till someone throws up
on my dick, all right?

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,142
Don't drink and drive, kids.

14
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,710
Mixed messages, I know.

15
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:06,333
Do not drink and drive.

16
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,376
I've been there,
I know how it is.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,810
I've been there. Look at me,
I've been there, okay?

18
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,042
I know it.

19
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,242
It gets late, you're drunk,

20
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,509
you're thinking, "What's
the worst that can happen?

21
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:21,042
"I'll hit another drunk driver,

22
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,834
and then we'll just high-five
and laugh."

23
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,176
If you drink wine and you think
you have a drinking problem,

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,810
you don't.

25
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,934
You're gay, okay?

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,910
You cannot go to rehab
with a wine problem.

27
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,176
No one wants to hear
your stories

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,209
about going to the Pottery Barn
or sailing, antiquing.

29
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,943
You're a fag, okay?

30
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,233
Even the guy who drinks Zima,
you're his bitch.

31
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,509
You can't even blame drunk talk
on wine.

32
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,009
"Where the whores at?

33
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,776
"Sorry, that's not me.

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,710
"That's the Beaujolais.
Look at this year.

35
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,033
It's a saucy year."

36
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,409
I used to drink a lot
of Jagermeister, mm-hm.

37
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I know.
You guys did too.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,776
Jagermeister is for children.

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,509
It is. It's too sweet.
I'm serious.

40
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,242
I give it out on Halloween,
that's what I do.

41
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,710
"Here's a shot, go home, find
your dad's gun, be somebody.

42
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,600
All right?"

43
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,843
Jager is fun yet disappointing.

44
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,743
It's kind of like running
downstairs on Christmas morning

45
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,176
and realizing you're Jewish.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,133
It kinda sucks.

47
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,476
"Where is everybody?
Oh, I remember."

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,343
Now...
Heh-heh-heh.

49
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,409
There's no commercials
for Jagermeister.

50
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,242
I've never seen one. Have you?
No, I haven't. Right?

51
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,609
There should be some, right?

52
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:07,076
So you know
what you're getting into.

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,376
But there aren't any.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,576
But I thought of some.
Do you guys wanna hear it?

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,309
Do you?

56
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,543
Do you or don't you? You do?
Okay.

57
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,242
Commercials for Jagermeister.

58
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,509
A guy comes out of a hedge.

59
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,943
He's covered in mud and blood.

60
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,843
He's holding one high heel shoe.

61
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,409
"Did I just eat a stripper?"

62
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,643
"Jager."

63
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,876
There you go.

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,633
To the point. Direct.

65
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,710
How about another one?
Can you do another one?

66
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,834
I think you could.

67
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,776
A little girl is sitting
on the swing,

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,209
not swinging.

69
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,009
A tear rolls down her cheek.

70
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,076
"Where's Daddy?"

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,233
"Jager." There you go.

72
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,576
How about a third one?

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,209
Can you do another one,
you think?

74
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,643
You guys are great. Okay.

75
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,676
A guy, let's call him me,

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,166
is fucking the left eye
of a pumpkin, okay?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,843
"If that pumpkin didn't want it,
why was it smiling at me?"

78
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:20,943
"Jager."

79
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,876
Yes. Yes.

80
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,443
Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,734
I'm trying to teach.
I'm teaching.

82
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,810
I was in the Middle East
doing shows for the troops,

83
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,700
and let me tell...
Thank you. Well, thank you.

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,443
I'm not exactly sure
if they enjoyed it,

85
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,142
since I kind of look like
every other guy

86
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,700
who's trying to kill them
over there.

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,643
I'm walking around trying to act
very American, you know?

88
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,910
"Where's the pork at?
Who's got some pussy?

89
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,400
What's up?"

90
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:06,076
The Middle East is a very, very
religious place.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,810
No one has sex,

92
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,266
but they smell
like they just did, okay?

93
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,609
It's not their fault.

94
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,300
It's hot.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,209
I met a local guy over there,
something...

96
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:26,476
I don't know his name, something
with a lot of Q's, U's and Z's.

97
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
I called him Quiznos.

98
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,810
I said, "Queazy,
what's the big hullabaloo...?"

99
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:38,443
Which is a dessert over there.
"What's the big problem?

100
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,976
Why can't we get along?"

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,710
He's like, "My friend, you must
understand we look at the world

102
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,142
differently than you do
in the West."

103
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,176
I'm like,
"You're exactly right, Q.

104
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,734
We look at the world through
a two-eyebrow system, okay?"

105
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,443
What is up with the monobrow?

106
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,676
Can I get a tweezer
for Teen Wolf over here?

107
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,834
Help him out.

108
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,876
Here's my idea for peace:

109
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,242
water parks.

110
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,609
It's a hot place, man.

111
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,776
I don't know about you,
but on a hot day, a water park

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,443
takes all the mean out of me.
I'm a functional drunk.

113
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,876
You put me on a flume,
I turn from a total alcoholic

114
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,710
into a giggly little fat man

115
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,166
with my big fat boy tits
all wet and pert.

116
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,843
Get these people on a flume!

117
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,910
Get 'em wet, get 'em laughing.

118
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,443
Then we shoot 'em. Now, easy.

119
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,734
Calm down. Calm down.

120
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,042
You go to the Middle East,

121
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,643
what's the first thing you wanna
see?

122
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,309
Something you've heard
a lot about.

123
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,800
A woman beaten for driving
a car, right?

124
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,476
Then you get something to eat.
Now what do you wanna do?

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,843
Camel ride.

126
00:07:58,867 --> 00:07:59,844
Yeah.

127
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,676
A camel.

128
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,676
You wanna get on him,
ride him around.

129
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,433
Put a cigarette in his mouth
and laugh at him.

130
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,176
It's a tourist attraction.

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,910
Just like when you go
to southeast D.C.,

132
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,009
what do you wanna see?

133
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,300
Pregnant crack whore. Yeah.

134
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,710
You wanna see it, ride it,
put a cigarette in her mouth

135
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,567
and laugh at her.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,209
"Boo! Problems! Boo!

137
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:33,667
You insensitive prick. Boo!"

138
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,343
I was just down in Florida,
half-business, half-pleasure.

139
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,734
I was putting my mom in
a nursing home, and I'll tell...

140
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,042
Relax.

141
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:49,200
She thinks she's voting. Now...

142
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:56,176
Florida looks like
a gigantic penis, doesn't it?

143
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,343
Have you ever Googled it?
It looks like a gigantic peener

144
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:03,500
about to shoot a load
of freedom all over Cuba.

145
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:11,467
A bukkake of choices and ideas.

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,500
"Jager." Now...

147
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,009
I went down to Florida... I went
down to Florida, okay?

148
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,676
'Cause it looks like
a gigantic penis.

149
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,476
I wasn't on the, uh, you know,
Miami, Fort Lauderdale...

150
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,934
I was on the other side.
The taint of Florida.

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,600
It definitely smelled like
balls, that's all I'm gonna say.

152
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,710
All right, anyway, you know,
it's like one of those places,

153
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,876
redneck kind of place, where you
go into a strip club,

154
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,443
and there's, like,
300 pounds of sad

155
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,710
hanging upside down on a pole,
and... You know?

156
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,276
You kinda wanna laugh, but her
kids are there cheering her on,

157
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,000
you know what I'm saying?

158
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,710
No, I went down there.

159
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:58,409
I wanted to see the shuttle go
up, you know, our space program.

160
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,209
I wanted to see that.
No one was there.

161
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,443
I was the only guy there.
Everybody was at NASCAR.

162
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,242
Who's your favorite astronaut?

163
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:08,443
If you could only fuck one
astronaut, who would it be?

164
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,667
Mission Specialist
Blah-Ba-Da-Da, I don't know.

165
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:17,743
But NASCAR, now that's
something different.

166
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:21,009
'Cause going into outer space,
that's for nerds.

167
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,533
But driving quickly
in a circle...

168
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,876
Who isn't wet?

169
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,543
You know why?
'Cause we're Americans.

170
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,276
And we only like competition,
okay? Yeah.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,476
Now, if one shuttle
raced another shuttle

172
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,976
into outer space,

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,476
and they had stickers and shit
on 'em,

174
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,476
and the countdown was done
by celebrities,

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,309
like DUI celebrities, you know,
like a Mel Gibson.

176
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,943
"Ten, nine, Jews." All right?

177
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,967
"The Jews control space."

178
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:57,242
Were you guys upset
when Steve Irwin died?

179
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,009
Were you? Yeah.

180
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,076
You should... Three of you were?
One guy wasn't.

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,643
'Cause you know what?
He didn't die, he was murdered.

182
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,343
Okay? Yes.

183
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,376
The crocodiles put a hit out
on him

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,009
using the stingray or, as I call
it, the Puerto Rican of the sea.

185
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:19,533
Yeah. Hear me? Hear me.

186
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,543
With its switchblade-like tail

187
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,609
and deliciously big brown eyes.

188
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:31,476
Where were the dolphins
that day?

189
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,309
Our friends in the oceans.
The dolphins.

190
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,867
Laughing, smiling.
Teaching retards how to swim.

191
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,409
Here's my one retarded story.

192
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,843
I might as well
tell you right now.

193
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,776
It's true, so there you go.

194
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,609
I was smoking in a bar. Just
smoking. This was years ago.

195
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,910
I don't even know how long ago,

196
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,943
but it was when you could smoke
in a bar, all right?

197
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,343
So back then, I was smoking.
Not breaking the law. Smoking.

198
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:05,276
Kid comes up to me,
he's retarded, all right?

199
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,500
I think he's retarded.

200
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,242
I know he is.

201
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:13,543
He's wearing medals for sports
that don't exist,

202
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:18,443
he's wearing a ski boot
and a flipper, okay?

203
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:23,376
This guy's either retarded
or he's ready for everything.

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,710
"Jager." Now...

205
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:30,209
I'm smoking
with my unretarded mind.

206
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,576
The kind that can download porn

207
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,042
as you talk to your mother
on the phone, yes.

208
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,843
Semi-genius.

209
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,443
I'm smoking, this is what he
does to me:

210
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:44,976
"Heeh! Heeh! Heeh!"

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,476
I'm like, "Are you shooting webs
of stupid at me?"

212
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,233
Watch out.

213
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,042
Webs of stupid, watch out.

214
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,667
He got me.
Can't ride a bike. Now...

215
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,609
Get this, it gets worse.
His wife...

216
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,600
I don't have a wife. He does.

217
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,376
His wife goes,
"Can you put out that cigarette?

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,943
"He doesn't like
secondhand smoke.

219
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,676
It's a killer."

220
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,843
I'm like, "Really?

221
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:19,009
"He's retarded.

222
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:22,233
That can't be his biggest fear."

223
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,376
No, I know it sounds mean,
but really.

224
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,910
That's gotta be pretty low
on the fears of the retard-os.

225
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:37,643
Number one: fork,
electrical outlet, okay?

226
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,300
That kills thousands.
That's their Omaha Beach.

227
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:46,743
Then you got buttons
that look like candy, all right?

228
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,266
Who hasn't been fooled?

229
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:54,009
Secondhand smoke. Everybody's
health conscious but me.

230
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,609
Even the handicapped people,
God bless 'em,

231
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,109
they're out there doing things.

232
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:02,209
A blind man climbed to the top
of Mount Everest,

233
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,009
or so he thinks, all right?

234
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:09,142
That's a lot of trust, guys.
I mean, really.

235
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,609
If that was my buddies, they
would have taken me everywhere

236
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,876
but the top of Mount Everest.

237
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,900
I would have been shivering
on the roof of a gay bar,

238
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:23,042
sucking on what I hope
is an icicle.

239
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:26,843
"What a salty icicle," I'd say.

240
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,333
"What do you think,
seeing eye dog?"

241
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:37,200
"Uh-oh. That's his 'There's
a cock in my mouth' growl."

242
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,876
Thank you.

243
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,943
Truly.

244
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,576
That was great, wasn't it? Yes.

245
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,042
Do you guys call it "blow jobs"

246
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,400
or "Let's make some throat
babies?" What do you guys say?

247
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,433
Where are my Christians? Where
are my Christians out here?

248
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,176
Let's talk about real issues.
I wanna be that kind of comic.

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,443
I'm not really political.

250
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,242
I wanna talk about
real fucking things,

251
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,109
like, I don't know, pro-choice.

252
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,443
All right?

253
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:13,109
Ladies? Nothing?

254
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,834
Some of you?

255
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,042
You know, they might take
your right away, girls,

256
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,643
but they will never, ever
take your right to get drunk

257
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,166
and throw yourself down
a flight of stairs, all right?

258
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,109
'Cause you can't arrest gravity,
fuck-o!

259
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,743
Yeah.

260
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,676
That's right.

261
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,876
Thank the I-man for that.
Not I, miss.

262
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,309
Isaac Newton, that's right.

263
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,776
That fucker has given us
so much joy.

264
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,876
Whether it's America's Funniest
Home Videos...

265
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,743
Babies falling down.

266
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,433
Or really cheap abortions.

267
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:57,409
Thank you. That one was
deliciously evil, wasn't it?

268
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:58,710
It was funny yet sad,

269
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:02,109
kinda like being tit-fucked
by a clown, you know?

270
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,967
"Jager." Now...

271
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,609
It's been over a year, guys.

272
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:15,710
I declare the tsunami's
now funny. Now...

273
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,676
This is not for everybody.

274
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,309
This is not a joke for everyone.

275
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,810
I know what you're thinking:

276
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:25,867
"Dave, you're gonna lose your
entire Indonesian fan base."

277
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,934
The tsunami, or as I call it,
God's money shot, is...

278
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,409
Global warming. That's what
I'm trying to get at.

279
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,242
Global warming, guys.

280
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,776
I don't know about you guys,

281
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,309
maybe it's true, maybe it's not,

282
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,600
maybe I work for an oil company.

283
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,343
The ice caps are melting,
people.

284
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,376
People always say it that way.
"The ice caps are melting."

285
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,443
Maybe there's some really cool
shit under those ice caps.

286
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,276
I mean, like treasure.

287
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,009
Or even better than treasure:

288
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,443
a talking dinosaur

289
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,309
who we can all
have adventures with.

290
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,200
Me first.
I thought it up.

291
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,443
What if he's really wise too,

292
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,209
and he can help us
with our problems?

293
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,176
"Hey, dinosaur buddy,
since you are fuel,

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,476
"maybe you would know
what the next untapped resource

295
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,743
"in this country is
that we can burn.

296
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:32,743
"What did you say? Mexicans?
That's fucking racist.

297
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,900
"You're a fucking racist.

298
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,109
"No one likes
a prehistoric racist.

299
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,400
Can I get a drink
for Hitler-saurus over here?"

300
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,209
Ahem. Ready? Good.

301
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,609
Potheads, where are you?

302
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,242
Yeah.

303
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,343
You should have...

304
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,300
Talking dinosaur,
how fucking cool was that, huh?

305
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,309
Don't do drugs, guys. Don't.

306
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,500
I mean, do them.

307
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,476
Who am I to tell you fuckers
what to do?

308
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,643
I don't care. Live it up.

309
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,976
I don't smoke pot, though.

310
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,009
It's not my drug, okay?

311
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,367
I know you're hissing me,
one guy's hissing me.

312
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,509
That's 'cause he doesn't really
see me.

313
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,543
There's an imaginary comic
behind him

314
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,300
that I'm interrupting.

315
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,910
I used to smoke pot. I don't.

316
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:34,476
Don't. Uh-uh.

317
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,343
I'd like to talk about
the last time I did smoke pot.

318
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,209
I was smoking some herb,
some chronic.

319
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,343
Trees, whatever it is.
I don't know.

320
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,142
I was smoking something,

321
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,810
and all of a sudden
I couldn't think.

322
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:48,109
My heart was pounding,
my left arm was numb.

323
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:52,633
And I'm thinking I'm either
dying or bowling. Now...

324
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,509
I think pot
should be legal though.

325
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,166
You guys?

326
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,109
Don't worry, I have
enough energy for all of us.

327
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,843
Pot should be legal.
It should be.

328
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,776
It's on the top
of Mount Should Be.

329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,109
Right under
"I should have a bigger dick,"

330
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,976
pot should be legal.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,409
But it won't.

332
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,409
'Cause you fucking potheads
aren't making it happen.

333
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:26,242
You're not out there every night
like us fucking alcoholics are

334
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,166
affecting society.

335
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:33,443
Things have been invented
because of alcohol.

336
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,876
Like the Taser, okay?

337
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,400
Yeah.

338
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,710
The morning-after pill, okay?

339
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:44,300
The reacharound.

340
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,443
Judge Judy.

341
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:52,376
What has pot given the world?
Hacky Sack? Yeah.

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,476
Hilarious ringtones? Oh, God.

343
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,443
Ultimate Frisbee championships?

344
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:06,409
It sucks to be a champion at a
sport that can't get you laid.

345
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,876
It's an unneeded skill, kind of
like being, I don't know,

346
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,943
the best banjo player

347
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:14,266
or a squirter. Now...

348
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,009
Did you guys just wake up?
I knew that would wake you up.

349
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,676
I will give you potheads
one thing.

350
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,667
You know your way
around a microwave oven.

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,142
Amazing.

352
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,142
Yell any food out,
you guys will know the time.

353
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,609
It's like, "Baked potato."
"Three minutes."

354
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,476
Au gratin, pull it out,
laugh at it,

355
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,042
put it in
for another 30 seconds.

356
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:39,276
Don't even need cheese.

357
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,743
I'm a fat man,
I'll give you that.

358
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:45,076
I am fat, but at least
I act my own weight, okay?

359
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,176
I hate it when I see a fat man
not acting fat.

360
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,743
You've seen them out there. It's
a hot day. You've seen them.

361
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,900
Rollerblading.

362
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,276
Wearing shorts.

363
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Talking to a live woman.

364
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,910
I even dream fat. I do.

365
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,576
I woke up the other night,
I'm like,

366
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,266
"When are we gonna get
some new soups?"

367
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,376
Honestly.

368
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,142
When's the last time you were
blown away by a new soup?

369
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,543
I can't think of it.

370
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,409
Nothing.

371
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:23,609
It doesn't even have to be good,
just something different.

372
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,676
Break up the monotony.

373
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,042
Just once I wanna go into
a restaurant and they're like,

374
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,142
"The soups of the day,
we got lentil,

375
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,910
"mushroom barley

376
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:34,333
and whale come."

377
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,900
"Did you say 'whale come'?"

378
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:50,367
"I know, it sounds
more like a chowder." But, uh...

379
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,876
Wouldn't you try it?
Wouldn't you give it a nibble?

380
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,367
Just to have that in your
references of tastes?

381
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,810
You go out with your friends.
"Oh, that meal sucked."

382
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:12,400
"Well, it was no whale come
soup, I'll tell you that."

383
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,042
Was that a joke about whale come
or the environment?

384
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,543
I don't know.

385
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,276
We get new juices all the time,
don't we? Yeah.

386
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,476
Everyone has a favorite juice.
Here's one of mine:

387
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,843
pineapple juice.

388
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,843
Love it. Pineapple juice.

389
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,242
Oh. It's so sweet.

390
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,676
It's too sweet.

391
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,276
It's not even juice

392
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,100
or the laughter of children.

393
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,142
As opposed to tomato juice.

394
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:47,576
What evil fucking mind
thought that up?

395
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,776
Is the Taliban behind that shit?

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,643
It's so tart and bitter
and unforgiving.

397
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,476
That's not juice.

398
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,300
That's the tears of Indians,
yes.

399
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,343
Thank you.

400
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:13,343
You know, I was dating
a Native American girl,

401
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:17,142
and she hated that joke.

402
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,309
She told me to stop doing it,
but I kept doing it,

403
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,976
and she got really pissed.
And I'm like, "You know,

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,409
"you of all people should know

405
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,934
promises mean nothing, okay?"

406
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,309
Anyhoo... And that was her name.

407
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,967
Anyhoo Walking Stick
Shiny Knife.

408
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,543
A lovely girl, but a temper.
Yes.

409
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:49,142
A temper. She slapped me.

410
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,276
She slapped me.

411
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,242
I'm a gentleman.
I don't hit women, okay?

412
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,943
Yeah, I don't.
Even during the Super Bowl.

413
00:23:56,967 --> 00:24:00,209
I do not touch chicks.

414
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:04,967
I just coughed on her and she
died several days later, yeah.

415
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:11,676
A little white man karate,
bitch.

416
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,066
A little trick
Columbus taught me.

417
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:20,700
Don't boo me, boo history,
all right? I mean, really.

418
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:28,176
I know what women like. You know
what they like? Flowers. Yeah.

419
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,776
Flowers. Right here. Yes?
Exactly.

420
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,142
I'm not Dr. Phil, guys.

421
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,743
I'm not a doctor.

422
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,576
But I think women like flowers

423
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,343
a million times more
than a kick in the cunt.

424
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,100
Am I right?

425
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:45,609
I am not a doctor.

426
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,509
I'm going with what I know.

427
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,042
Okay, let me figure it out.

428
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,242
Here's flowers way up here,
okay?

429
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,810
Here's a kick in the cooch
down here.

430
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,910
Or here if you're Filipino,
okay?

431
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:59,867
They're teeny.

432
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:08,276
Somewhere in between
is Applebee's, okay?

433
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,600
It's not that great,
could be worse.

434
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:18,743
I'm sorry
for using the c-word, guys.

435
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,343
Honestly, I apologize.

436
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,943
I did that joke one time
and there was a 6-year-old boy

437
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,276
sitting in the crowd.

438
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,776
And I felt horrible,

439
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,676
'cause the first time
a young boy should hear that

440
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,142
is from his dad's drunken lips

441
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:36,233
as he's being handcuffed
and put in a squad car.

442
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:40,476
"Tell that cunt I'll be back.

443
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,066
It's my trailer too!"

444
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,309
I like these girls, man.
You guys are hot.

445
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,543
I don't know if you're into

446
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,543
the tattoos and piercings,
anything like that?

447
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:52,943
Straight up?
Okay, that's cool.

448
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,509
I like the piercing thing,
you know.

449
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,609
Girls, I think that's cool
if you want to decorate

450
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,676
and all that.
That's your business.

451
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,209
Just let a guy in on it, okay?

452
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,009
Sometimes you go down there
and it's like,

453
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:07,209
"What is...? What?"

454
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,533
I'd better proceed with caution.

455
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,443
A pierced hooch
is like finding a washer

456
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:18,100
in the most delicious
corned beef sandwich, okay?

457
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:21,676
I am... Heh.

458
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,533
I am... Ha, ha.

459
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,076
Really?

460
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,600
I am not the best analogy guy.

461
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,910
Ladies, there's a lot
of beauties out here tonight.

462
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:37,676
I see you, yeah.
It's summer.

463
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,643
It's summer
and that means shaving.

464
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,443
It usually means
some shaving down there.

465
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,576
The Brazilian wax.

466
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,676
I've heard of it.

467
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,142
Yeah?
Some fans of it.

468
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,976
I've heard of it.
Personally, I've never seen it.

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,743
It's kind of a legend,

470
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,910
like the Loch Ness monster
or something like that.

471
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:56,266
I usually show up weeks later

472
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,934
when whoever that was for,
it did not work out, okay?

473
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,810
Now it's serious
down there, okay?

474
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,109
It's starting to grow back,

475
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:12,109
it's got this, kind of,
3:00 shadow look to it,

476
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,776
like, your snatch
has been up all night

477
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,876
trying to solve a murder.

478
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,867
It looks... Really.

479
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:25,934
It is definitely not
a fun-gina, that's for sure.

480
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,376
I give you credits, girls.

481
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,176
That's a very complicated thing,
down there.

482
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,066
Not like the penis,
which is idiot-proof.

483
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,543
I mean, come on,
have you ever come across a cock

484
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,633
and you're like, "I'm stymied.

485
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,867
I give up."

486
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,609
Each one's the same.
It's like a rider mower.

487
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:54,843
You just sit on it
making small circles

488
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,133
till it runs out of gas.

489
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,242
Each one's the same.
It's the same thing.

490
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:08,743
Suck, suck, lick, pretend to gag
so he thinks he's huge...

491
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,700
Watch your eyes, you're done.

492
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,543
There is
that one guy out there, right?

493
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,810
That one kinky fucking freak,
you know?

494
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,609
That guy's like,
"You wanna make me come?

495
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:22,376
"Well, nibble my ball-sack
like it's a bag of trail mix.

496
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,543
Nibble it up."

497
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,242
Num, num, num.

498
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,934
Num, num, num.

499
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,643
"Now lift the whole package
and tongue my anus.

500
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,943
"Tongue it.

501
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,943
"Like you're waiting
for an acceptance letter

502
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,776
"from Brown University.
Get in there.

503
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,934
Do it."

504
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,543
Do you guys know
what bukkake means?

505
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:45,910
You do?

506
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,734
How come everybody knows that?

507
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:50,676
I don't know, guys.

508
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,176
If your lady
will let you do that...

509
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,843
Which means shooting your love
on her face neck or back.

510
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,900
She's cool.

511
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:02,576
If she lays there
and lets it dry, marry her.

512
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,900
All right?

513
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:08,309
Doesn't it suck when you come up
with something so true,

514
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,800
yet it's too long to fit
on a T-shirt?

515
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,576
Some...

516
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,776
Some guys are really into it,
you know?

517
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,543
I don't know, I get really,
kind of like...

518
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:21,643
I feel bad about it.

519
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,543
I turn into, like,
a English schoolboy.

520
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:24,876
I'm so defensive.
I'm like,

521
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,176
"Oopsy-diddly.

522
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,976
"Pardon me, madams,

523
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,734
did I get me rah-rah juice
on your peepers?"

524
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,009
Are there any English
people here? Back me up.

525
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,443
Was that a great impression,
or what?

526
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,433
Didn't you feel like you
were in London town right now?

527
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,676
Vicious handjobs.
What is up with that, girls?

528
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,976
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

529
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,376
Some of you girls
are pulling way too hard.

530
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,176
Some of you are pulling
like you're trying

531
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,876
to pull a better-looking guy
out of me.

532
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,200
What is that?

533
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,710
I didn't swallow
Patrick Dempsey, okay?

534
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:09,209
I'm the same bald, fat guy
who met you on MySpace,

535
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,543
deal with it.

536
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:13,509
And you don't even
have the class

537
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,242
to spit on your hand first.

538
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:19,133
A dry, hobo jerk down.

539
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,433
What are your stepfathers
teaching you?

540
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,142
Wow.

541
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,843
What a great joke.

542
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,543
The only thing missing
from that joke

543
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,667
was Oprah silently nodding.

544
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,643
I'm into lube.
How about you guys?

545
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,543
Lube? Girls? Lube?

546
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:50,176
You got your own favorite?
Good for you, buddy.

547
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,543
Some guys like K-Y, Astroglide.

548
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,609
Personally, I'm a gravy man.

549
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,834
Yeah.

550
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:00,033
Brown gravy.

551
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:05,166
This next part,
you're gonna moan at.

552
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:08,042
But I think you guys are cool
so I think you're gonna like it.

553
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,276
How do you, uh...?

554
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,142
How do you handle it
with your special lady?

555
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,967
Do you put it on
or what do you do?

556
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:15,910
There you go.
All right.

557
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,743
On your dick to her?
There you go.

558
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:18,976
All right.

559
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,266
I like to spoon-feed it in.

560
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:28,209
Like it's a naughty little baby.

561
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,910
Open up the beef lips!

562
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:36,000
Here comes
the George Clooney juice.

563
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,367
What?

564
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,934
What, you don't like improv?

565
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,710
I love children, guys.

566
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:48,509
I do.

567
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,710
I'm serious.

568
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:51,609
I'm on the Internet,
talking to them all day.

569
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:53,500
All right?

570
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,843
Pedophilia.

571
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:01,109
You know what I'm talking about.
This is a smart town.

572
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,734
Pedophilia.

573
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,176
You've heard about it.

574
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,676
First of all,
I wanna say one thing:

575
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,343
I would never,
ever touch a child.

576
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,567
Even if the kid was on fire,

577
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,509
and the only thing wet around

578
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,734
was my ass, mouth
and lips. Okay?

579
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,433
He's gonna burn,

580
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,810
but he's gonna
go to heaven untouched,

581
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:28,767
so he can play football
with Jesus.

582
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,576
Pedophilia. Come on,
let's think of it the other way.

583
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,976
I mean, really,
are we making a mountain

584
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,667
out of a delicious
7 to 9-year-old molehill here?

585
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,609
Maybe these guys
are ahead of the curve.

586
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,509
I don't know.

587
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,409
No. Remember a few years back,
cousin fucking was so taboo?

588
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:54,176
Do you remember that?
Come on, you know.

589
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,710
Every time you left
your mom's house, it was like,

590
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:59,776
"Don't fuck your cousins!

591
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,934
You're gonna get a retard baby."

592
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:08,076
Like I can't pull out
when I'm fucking my cousin.

593
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,800
Really.

594
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,209
You know what
these pedophiles say?

595
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,700
I've been in their chatrooms,
I know what they're up to.

596
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,676
"It's an addiction."

597
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,910
"We can't help ourself.

598
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,142
"It's a constant craving.

599
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,009
Kind of like smoking."

600
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,576
Fuck, I hope not.

601
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,976
I smoke a pack and a half a day.

602
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,166
I don't know
what that equals in boy.

603
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,643
Do you think it's the same
kind of addiction?

604
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,176
Do you think when a pedophile
gets off a long, long flight

605
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,643
he can't even think?

606
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,943
"Get out of my way, guys,
really.

607
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:57,076
Don't even talk to me
unless it's about kids."

608
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,109
He jumps in a cab,
"Take me to a toy store.

609
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:03,409
"Uh, a puppet show.
Something.

610
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:06,533
Drive around a Gap. Something.
Just do something for me."

611
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,343
Do you think
they're afraid to quit

612
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:10,676
'cause they might gain weight?

613
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,076
What do you think?

614
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,343
Whoa, you guys
tightened up on me.

615
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,910
Oh, I get it.

616
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:20,166
Did I cross a line?
Is that what it is?

617
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,843
Don't worry, guys,
we can go to silly town.

618
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:26,476
We can do that too.

619
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
Ever wrestle your dog
till you come?

620
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,476
Jager.

621
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,266
Now...

622
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,743
Yes.

623
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,100
Oh, I get it.

624
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,710
I get it, D.C.

625
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:51,776
Okay, fucking a child, no.
Wrestling a dog, yay.

626
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,533
I got it.

627
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,042
We got a lot
of college kids in here.

628
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,242
Is that what it is?

629
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,209
Good for you. Live it up.
College is cool.

630
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,376
Your parents want you
to go to school. You know why?

631
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,976
Because when you're away
at college,

632
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,543
they're at home
fucking in your beds.

633
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,376
You know that, right?

634
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,643
I mean, you know that, right?

635
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,867
Daddy's spanking Mom's ass
with a Hot Wheels track,

636
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,800
as they both do blow off of
Lindsay Lohan's poster, okay?

637
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
How about a moment
for poor Lindsay, guys?

638
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,000
Boo?

639
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,467
Where are my Freaky Friday fans?

640
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,843
I don't know... Ha.

641
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:43,676
I don't know if you saw
the picture of her passed out,

642
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,643
with her mouth open,

643
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,900
daring us to Photoshop
our own penises in there.

644
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,233
Jager.

645
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,276
These little girls...

646
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,109
That's their job
to get fucked up, okay?

647
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,676
They... Lindsay Lohan,
they found cocaine in her car.

648
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,576
Ooh.

649
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,767
Call me when they find
a book in her car, okay?

650
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,343
These girls...
I don't know if you know it.

651
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,867
They go commando.

652
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,209
Have you been on the Internet?

653
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:30,943
Yeah.

654
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:33,309
These girls get to show us
their little... You know.

655
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,309
Their hooch, down there.

656
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,776
And I think they have to realize

657
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
with great vagina
comes great responsibility.

658
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,109
I think Spider-Man said that.

659
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,142
I'm not exactly sure.

660
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,710
Somebody said it.
Maybe Jefferson.

661
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,200
I don't know who said it, but...

662
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,209
I mean, if they're gonna show
their little hoop-dah down there

663
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:55,910
why not
turn it into a good thing?

664
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:58,743
How about
some positive messages?

665
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:00,476
You log on to the Internet,

666
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,509
Is that's Lindsay's
how-do-you-do?

667
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,042
What does it say?

668
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:07,033
"Buckle up"? All right.

669
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,710
So...

670
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,976
I do like, uh, performing
and I've been traveling

671
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,076
all over the country
and stuff like that and, uh...

672
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,710
You know, I will say this:
I live alone

673
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,343
and, uh,
it gets a little lonely.

674
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,242
The other day I was naked,
laying on my couch,

675
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:22,710
just got out of the shower,

676
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,100
letting the sun dry me
like a sea manatee.

677
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:33,066
Or a man coming off a horrible,
horrible whiskey binge,

678
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:37,042
who's afraid of his towels,

679
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,200
'cause they look like phantoms.

680
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:43,609
I'm half-hard
from watching The View.

681
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,109
Have you been watching lately?

682
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,033
Provocative.

683
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,810
It was one of those
mysterious hard-ons,

684
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:56,066
where you look at your dick
and you're like, "Really?

685
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,266
Is there someone at the door?"

686
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,710
Half-hard, I roll over,
one thing leads to another,

687
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:09,776
my penis
goes between the cushions

688
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,776
and I realize
I'm fucking my couch.

689
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,609
Yes. Fucking it.

690
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,643
Didn't come inside of it.

691
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,476
Pulled out,
shot it on the coffee table.

692
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,367
Yup.

693
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,843
'Cause that coffee table's
a coke whore,

694
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,300
if you know what I mean.

695
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,609
Pull out, look at my dick.
You know what I see on the tip?

696
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,333
A dime and two M&M's, yeah.

697
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:38,367
I got some couch scabies.

698
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,609
And to answer your question,
yes, I ate the M&M's.

699
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,076
I did.

700
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,834
Yeah.

701
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:53,743
I found a gray hair
on one of my testicles today.

702
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:57,200
No, it wasn't mine
but it's frightening.

703
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,710
See?

704
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,976
Should I pluck it?
Is that what somebody said?

705
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,176
Tweeze it?

706
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,142
You can't tweeze a gray hair.

707
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,667
You know that'll kill a midget.
Come on.

708
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,109
And you can't kill a midget,

709
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,843
'cause that's
where our dreams are kept,

710
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,876
in their heads.

711
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,767
You guys are sick and evil.

712
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,576
Ever whisper sweet nothings
to your girl

713
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,810
to cover a fart?

714
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,309
Have you ever done that?

715
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,810
See?

716
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,009
That's a simple one, huh?

717
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,300
No one gets angry on that one.

718
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:44,042
Anal sex, what do you say?

719
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:45,643
Yeah.

720
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,209
Wow. A few fans.

721
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,976
Guys, hear it up.

722
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,876
Women do not like anal sex.

723
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,300
They love it.

724
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:03,009
They hate it.

725
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,433
Sure, they might try it
when they're asleep.

726
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:14,676
Anal sex is a lot like swimming,
isn't it?

727
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,910
It involves every muscle
in the human body.

728
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:19,609
Especially the "I can't believe

729
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,734
this is fucking happening"
muscle.

730
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,543
Anal sex is a lot like swimming.

731
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,609
I'm gonna do fucking
all of them, all right?

732
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,509
'Cause I love it.

733
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,109
It's just like swimming.

734
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,900
You should not eat
before you do it, okay?

735
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:41,433
And you've got to keep moving
or you'll die. All right?

736
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:47,142
They have a little thing
out there called anal beads.

737
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,976
Anal beads.

738
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,633
The unholy rosaries.

739
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,509
Where they're going,
there is no God.

740
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,943
Am I right?

741
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,867
Dominos santos.

742
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,609
Have you?

743
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,133
Yes.

744
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,609
When you pull him out,
you gotta say something.

745
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:13,876
It is awkward.

746
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,076
Yeah.

747
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,676
It's not like
what you think it'll be,

748
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,776
A big...

749
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,867
and everybody laughs.

750
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,000
Nailed it.

751
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,710
This is what I do.
You guys can do it too.

752
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,676
I try and make a little funny.
This is what I do.

753
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,042
Check it out, it's like,

754
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,767
"The winning
Powerball numbers are..."

755
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,276
Funny. Funny.

756
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,467
I did it.

757
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,076
The cameraman who's got my ass

758
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,200
is tittering
like a little girl over there.

759
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,209
D.C. is a great drinking town.

760
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,810
I've had so many
amazing drunk stories

761
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:56,076
come out of this place.

762
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,509
In fact...

763
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,200
No, really.
You guys are amazing.

764
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,376
Let it out.
It's not gonna kill you.

765
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,176
Let it out.

766
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,876
Actually, the two scariest words
to any drunk is,

767
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,276
"Remember me?"

768
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,567
No.

769
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:14,176
You guys like porn, am I right?

770
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,910
Yeah, you do.

771
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,767
In the balcony, not so much?

772
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,042
If we watched all my porn,
one after another,

773
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,934
we would be done
two days after never.

774
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,609
I got a lot.

775
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,810
That's a lot.

776
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:37,176
There's a new porn series out,
I want you to check it out.

777
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,810
Okay, listen to me.
This one's good.

778
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,242
It's called Monster Cocks.

779
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:43,309
Yeah.

780
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,409
Monster Cocks.

781
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,543
Ladies,
these are not the penii...

782
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,376
Which is more than one penis.

783
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,109
Of your dreams.

784
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:54,266
These are the cocks
of your nightmares.

785
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,376
I dare you...

786
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,643
No wait, I double dare you.

787
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,500
Not to turn a light on
after you watch Monster Cocks.

788
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:06,609
Look under the bed.

789
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,309
Ha, ha.

790
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,934
"Mommy, Daddy,
can I sleep with you tonight?"

791
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,843
So...

792
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,066
You had enough of that one?
That's cool.

793
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,776
What is it?
I'll tell you what it is.

794
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,276
Here's the cover
of Monster Cocks:

795
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,376
It's a woman's face,
half-covered

796
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,543
by a gigantic,
humongous, black penis.

797
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,133
Like a
Phantom of the Opera mask.

798
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,576
That's when you know
you got a big dick.

799
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,233
When someone else can use it
as a disguise.

800
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,643
"I don't want anyone to know
I'm in here.

801
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,276
"Can I borrow your penis?
Thank you.

802
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,333
Put your balls on my chin,
get me to the car, please."

803
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,142
I couldn't do that.

804
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,042
I don't got that kind
of equipment.

805
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:59,367
If that was me, it would look
like I'm pointing to her eye.

806
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,500
Is that her favorite eye?

807
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:17,076
I was in Hawaii during the,
uh, earthquake.

808
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,343
They had a earthquake there.

809
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,109
Which is freaky,
'cause you don't expect

810
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:21,876
something like that
to happen in Hawaii.

811
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,710
There's a volcano there, okay?

812
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:25,576
Everybody there thinks,
like, the volcano

813
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,242
and the lava,
is gonna fucking kill 'em.

814
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:28,776
All that kind of stuff.

815
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,309
But then for an earthquake to
hit with a volcano right there,

816
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,443
that's like having a gun

817
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:33,943
to the back of your head
at all times

818
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:35,910
and a guy just runs up
and kicks you in the balls.

819
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:37,609
You're like, "Whoa.

820
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,776
"I didn't...

821
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,967
I didn't see that coming."

822
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,242
Wow. You guys
really loved that one.

823
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,710
Did you really love it?

824
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:48,876
Wasn't it good?

825
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,700
Not you though?
Nothing yet? Nothing.

826
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,876
You get older, you realize
you gotta live your dreams.

827
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,142
Have you lived yours yet?

828
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,142
There's a lot of young
guys here. How about you?

829
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,710
What kind of white dreams
do you have

830
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:04,042
rolling inside of you
right now? Anything?

831
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:06,409
"The ultimate
snowboarding competition.

832
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,300
I wanna do some guy shit."

833
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,543
I lived one of my dreams
from the '80s, okay?

834
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:15,810
I'm older than you guys.

835
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,876
Back there in the '80s,
a little different time.

836
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,176
That's right.

837
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,343
I did blow off a stripper's ass.

838
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:23,810
Thank you.

839
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,509
Were you there?
Thank you.

840
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:26,834
Nothing?

841
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:33,600
First of all, it was nothing
at all like the dream,

842
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:37,400
'cause there's no smells
in dreams.

843
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,934
Fill in your own smells.

844
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:49,976
I go with Taco Bell and Valtrex.

845
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,910
Whatever you guys want,
fill in your own.

846
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:55,867
I have figured that out yet.

847
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:58,209
And in the dream,

848
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,567
she wasn't text messaging
her boyfriend, okay?

849
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:06,743
I live in hotels mostly. I don't
know if you guys get to...

850
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:07,867
Anybody?

851
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,810
Anybody else?
Okay.

852
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,009
I try and make every hotel
a little bit like home.

853
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:14,710
This is what I do,
you guys can do it too.

854
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:18,409
Before I leave for the last time
I take the phone in the hotel,

855
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:21,576
rub it on my balls,
hang up, check out,

856
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:29,600
call the room the next day
and just laugh.

857
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:32,876
"Are you in Room 312?

858
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,176
"Do you wanna hear something

859
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:42,200
that'll make you never stop
washing your face?"

860
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,633
Jager.

861
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:49,242
We've been talkin' about
Jagermeister all night long,

862
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,309
I might as well tell you
one of my Jager stories.

863
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:55,309
One time I drank a bottle
of Jagermeister... Whole bottle.

864
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:58,042
I had three slices of pizza,

865
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:00,500
a handful of magic mushrooms,

866
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,567
and a Mento.

867
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,643
It turned into
the perfect storm of shit, okay?

868
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:10,834
Yeah.

869
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,543
I'm serious.
Do you know the kind

870
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,409
where you gotta wipe
your ass and your legs?

871
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:16,743
Have you ever had one of those?

872
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:22,843
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

873
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:25,976
It was like a prison rodeo,
you know?

874
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,433
No winners.

875
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:32,042
Plus I'm on shrooms, guys.

876
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:35,109
Yeah. I'm hallucinating.

877
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:38,333
I don't even know
if I'm sitting on a toilet.

878
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:43,710
All I know is it was very cold
and very white.

879
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:46,976
Could've been a snowbank,
could've been a Republican.

880
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,676
Could've been a lot of things.

881
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,042
Let it out.

882
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:51,400
Let it out.

883
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,409
It's the only
political joke I have.

884
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:58,076
Where were we?
Oh, yeah. I'm shitting.

885
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,242
Now,

886
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:02,443
I'm sitting there for
I don't even know how long.

887
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:05,200
Days? Centuries?
I don't know.

888
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,133
I'm afraid to look
in the bowl, guys,

889
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,376
at this Franken-dump,
this hybrid turd.

890
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,643
I'm afraid I'm gonna look down

891
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,643
and see something so brown
and so odd,

892
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:26,667
even Angelina Jolie
will not adopt this thing.

893
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,242
I looked down,
you know what I see?

894
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,900
Nothing.
There's nothing in the bowl.

895
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,367
What happened to my poopers?

896
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:42,400
Did David Blaine
crawl into my asshole,

897
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,567
and ta-dump it away?

898
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,200
Well, something happened
'cause it stunk in there.

899
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:56,109
Guess where it was.

900
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,300
Under the rim.
Yeah.

901
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:03,643
That's right.
I Tony Hawk'd it.

902
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,133
Yeah.

903
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,910
Wait a minute,

904
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:18,433
I'm getting something
on my finger right now.

905
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,376
Oh, my God.

906
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,943
I did it.

907
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:25,376
I told
the world's longest shit joke.

908
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,543
We did it.

909
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,776
We did it. Thank you.

910
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,276
Thank you.

911
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,076
Thank you, guys.

912
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,376
The world's longest shit joke.

913
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,700
I can't believe it.

914
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,200
Thank you.

915
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:43,266
Thank you.

916
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,133
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

917
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,600
Live your dreams, kids.

918
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:20,376
Especially if it's
telling shit jokes.

919
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,910
Good night, God bless.

920
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,500
Thank you.

921
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:41,867
Thank you.

922
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:48,066
Thank you very much.

923
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:51,109
Thank you.

924
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,976
I'd like to thank
the people who stood up.

925
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,533
What the fuck's
going on over here?

926
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:57,509
Since we are
talking about drinking,

927
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:59,576
I'd like to end with
a little thing I like to call,

928
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,076
"Tell me what you're drinking

929
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,176
and I'll tell you how
you're night's gonna end."

930
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,509
Okay?
Let's start it out.

931
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:06,276
You can yell it out.
Go right ahead.

932
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,209
- Whiskey.
- Vodka.

933
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,343
You're gonna go home
and laugh till someone farts

934
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,976
and laugh even louder.
You're fine.

935
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,242
Bourbon.
Bourbon.

936
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:16,076
One a time. Bourbon.

937
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,376
You're going to videotape
the first fucking guy.

938
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,509
You're all right.

939
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:20,576
Whiskey.

940
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,576
Whiskey.
What aren't you going to do?

941
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,676
Pick a hole, any hole.

942
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,066
How about some ladies?

943
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:31,843
What's that?

944
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:34,276
A margarita?
You're gonna go home with me.

945
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,543
All right?

946
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,710
Thank you very much.
You guys have been a lot of fun.

947
00:51:37,734 --> 00:51:38,734
See you later.
