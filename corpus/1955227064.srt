Stevie's back there, man.

He's helping Mario, he's hurt.

01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:58,895
We're supposed to stay, one
of those guys was captured.

Joker, and some other people

I talked to Mario
and Steve, man.

Mario don't look good, man.

01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:02,526
But I think I got a plan.

Let's hear it man.

982
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,528
All right, check it out.

983
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:05,962
Spill it out.

cars are about right here.

01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,336
OK... Andre, where's
the grounds at.

986
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:13,637
About right here?

987
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:14,471
Yeah, about right there.

988
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:15,271
That's cool?

989
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:16,072
Yeah.

990
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:17,173
All right, then.

991
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,876
I think if we cause a
distraction up here,

992
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,345
We can get in there,
man, and take off.

993
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,912

back at 11:30, it's now 4:30.

997
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,291
I think it's pretty
safe to say that we

998
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:37,260
Might have a problem here.

I knew I shouldn't
have let him go.

OK, do you want
me to organize it?

1003

save Taka and the rest of them.
