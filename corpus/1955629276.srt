1
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,214
Hi, sir.

2
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,448
Just this.

3
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,584
Four.

4
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,187
Thank you.

5
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,271
<i>Furthermore
this indemnification clause</i>

6
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,508
<i>clearly states that there
will be no injunctive relief.</i>

7
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,247
And our client's chances
of being rewarded

8
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,916
financially are minimal at best.

9
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,722
I'll finish it tomorrow.

10
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:33,473
<i>Can I be blamed for feeling</i>

11
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:37,609
<i>that things were a little
strange that night?</i>

12
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,750
<i>You don't expect a power
outage in the spring.</i>

13
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,852
<i>Not without a storm first.</i>

14
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,302
<i>When you're tired
and it's a long day</i>

15
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,504
<i>and you're trying to get home</i>

16
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,607
<i>you tend to feel all these
little disconnects</i>

17
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,344
<i>as the slow trajectory
of a collapsing civilization.</i>

18
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,548
<i>At least that's where I go.</i>

19
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:52,017
<i>"In the suburbs,
we live in nature."</i>

20
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,885
<i>That's a quote from my realtor</i>

21
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,954
<i>the selling phrase she used
when Diana and I</i>

22
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,956
<i>first looked at this place.</i>

23
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,091
Oh, crap.

24
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:03,962
<i>And you do see
deer, rabbits, crows.</i>

25
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,365
<i>But we don't live in nature.</i>

26
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,768
<i>That's the point of the suburbs.</i>

27
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,437
<i>You live apart from humans.</i>

28
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,740
<i>And you're protected
from what's wild.</i>

29
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,708
Jesus.

30
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,577
Go on, get out of here.

31
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,711
Go on!

32
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,981
Go on, get out!

33
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,753
Oh, damn it.

34
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,496
Oh, Christ.

35
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,109
Oh, god. Damn it.

36
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,620
Damn it.

37
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,023
Alright.

38
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,969
Ha! Ha! Go on.

39
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,728
<i>I had quarreled with my wife.</i>

40
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,165
<i>We did this thing
where we would play</i>

41
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,667
<i>at sexual jealousy.</i>

42
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,906
But anyway, um..

43
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,008
<i>Or I played at it</i>

44
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,010
<i>and she was my accomplice.</i>

45
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,846
<i>After 15 years of marriage</i>

46
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,948
<i>jealousy was
the reliable stimulant.</i>

47
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:11,951
<i>Let's be honest.</i>

48
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:17,088
<i>When your spouse gets
jealous, it's flattering.</i>

49
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,258
<i>The blood stirs,
the heart pounds.</i>

50
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,061
<i>We'd quarrel..</i>

51
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,897
<i>And we'd have sex.</i>

52
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,768
<i>Or as Diana would say
provocatively</i>

53
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,803
<i>we'd fuck.</i>

54
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,903
<i>And it works.</i>

55
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,940
The guy you were coming
onto all afternoon.

56
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,040
<i>Until it doesn't.</i>

57
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,909
Obviously, I wasn't
coming on to him...

58
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,611
Oh, yeah, obviously.

59
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,047
Well, Diana,
anyone within 10 feet

60
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,982
could see what was going on.

61
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,984
Well, who was watching?

62
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,652
It was a conversation.

63
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,088
I witnessed
the whole thing, Diana.

64
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,824
You were practically
issuing him an invitation.

65
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,660
Only in your peculiar
imagination, Wakefield.

66
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,729
Meanwhile,
you'll chat up any woman

67
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,631
who even looks at you
and I'm the one who...

68
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,367
No, no, no. You made
a very suggestive remark.

69
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,835
I made an amusing remark.

70
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,236
Oh, amusing? Ah!

71
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,238
Everyone laughed but you.

72
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,175
Well, I failed to be entertained
by watching my wife

73
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,044
come onto a guy in a Polo shirt.

74
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,214
I was replying
to something he said.

75
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,151
Something stupid
if you must know..

76
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,251
God!

77
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,023
I am so sick of this...
This constant surveillance.

78
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,423
- You...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

79
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,960
No, you have muzzled me
to the point where I can't

80
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,129
carry on a conversation
with other parents.

81
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,931
I barely relate
to people anymore...

82
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,101
- You were relating to him.
- What do you not see?

83
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,469
I mean, do you think I'd be
even remotely inclined to start

84
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,005
something up with anyone given
the relationship we have?

85
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,010
All I want..

86
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,112
Is to get through the day.

87
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,649
That's what I think about.
Just get through the day.

88
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,200
Unbelievable.

89
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,313
<i>Why go in there now?</i>

90
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,349
<i>Just to endure another
predictable scene with my wife.</i>

91
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,319
<i>Soon enough,
they'd all be asleep.</i>

92
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,412
Oh.

93
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,257
Oh.

94
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,260
Oh, shit.

95
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,263
Shit! Ah!

96
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,267
<i>Oh, god.</i>

97
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,437
Oh!

98
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,449
<i>You know, frankly
I was totally bewildered</i>

99
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,019
<i>by this situation
I had created for myself.</i>

100
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,057
<i>Diana would probably think
I'd been with someone else.</i>

101
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,893
<i>Not that I had ever
given her a reason</i>

102
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,229
<i>to doubt me
in 15 years of marriage.</i>

103
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,998
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

104
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,001
<i>It would be
the weakest of tactics</i>

105
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,370
<i>for me to walk into my house</i>

106
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,105
<i>and try to explain to her</i>

107
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,941
<i>the perfectly rational sequence</i>

108
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,310
<i>that led me to spend
the night in the garage.</i>

109
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,287
<i>You know,
another woman might have</i>

110
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,190
<i>saved my supper plate
in the refrigerator.</i>

111
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,293
<i>But I lived in Diana's judgment.</i>

112
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,996
<i>It shone on me
as in a prison cell</i>

113
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,465
<i>where the light
is never turned off.</i>

114
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,206
<i>The immediate solution?</i>

115
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,509
<i>Postpone my entrance 'til
my wife had gone off to work.</i>

116
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,420
Mm.

117
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,924
Rush, rush, rush.

118
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,034
The bus is here, girls.

119
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,204
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

120
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,172
They forgot their lunches.

121
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,911
<i>Girls, girls, lunch.</i>

122
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,447
<i>They're gonna be late again.</i>

123
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,385
Bye-bye, girls. Have a good day.

124
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,053
<i>Okay, love you.</i>

125
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,063
Oh, yeah.

126
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>The first call
would be to my office.</i>

127
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,402
<i>No, he hasn't come in.</i>

128
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,204
<i>No.</i>

129
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,441
Yesterday evening.

130
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,044
Well, no,
he didn't say anything.

131
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,647
Mm-hmm. Well, he left around
the usual time.

132
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,584
<i>Oh, yes, of course, I will.</i>

133
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,421
Bye-bye.

134
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,198
Oh, where are you going now?

135
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,575
Surprise, car's still there.

136
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,419
The plot thickens.

137
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,136
<i>After a few calls to her friends</i>

138
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,438
<i>wouldn't it seem reasonable
to expect</i>

139
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,708
<i>that the assistant curator
of the county museum</i>

140
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,543
<i>would depart for work?</i>

141
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,781
<i>I realize this is
a common enough complaint.</i>

142
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,784
<i>But there are times when I
feel I've spent my life</i>

143
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,352
<i>just waiting for my wife</i>

144
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,421
<i>to get ready to leave the house.</i>

145
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,533
Oh, you got to be
fuckin' kidding me.

146
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,061
Oh.

147
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,577
What the hell?

148
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,416
Wait a minute, wait a minute
wait a minute.

149
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,690
Ah-ha!

150
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,127
Yeah.

151
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,503
<i>Ah-ha.</i>

152
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,839
Yes, officer.

153
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,508
<i>No checks were missing.</i>

154
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,678
<i>Why, why! Where could he be?</i>

155
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,249
<i>Ah. Oh.</i>

156
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,486
There's the hubs.

157
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,688
No wonder you want him back.
He's a stud.

158
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,465
<i>Our town police
are well-paid and polite</i>

159
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,501
<i>and not so different
from the rest of us</i>

160
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:00,371
<i>in their distant relationship
to actual crime.</i>

161
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,474
<i>Nobody mugged him or anything.</i>

162
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,853
What? What am I, a travel agent?

163
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,160
<i>I guarantee
he's at the strip club</i>

164
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,162
<i>right now hangin' around.</i>

165
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,164
Dickhead.

166
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,819
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

167
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,490
Here come the water works.

168
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,648
Shit.

169
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,991
<i>But then god help us.</i>

170
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,560
<i>The widow, babs.</i>

171
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,729
<i>Right on cue.</i>

172
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,332
Christ.

173
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,875
<i>Oh, god.</i>

174
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,746
Do you ever shut up?

175
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,485
<i>No, no, no, no.
Don't cry, don't cry.</i>

176
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,621
<i>No. He's not worth it.</i>

177
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,789
There you go.

178
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,727
I have big broad
shoulders, darling.

179
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,896
And if you need to cry, you
just lay your head right here.

180
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,967
Broad shoulders.

181
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,802
Like a fuckin' linebacker.

182
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,807
I'll be here for you.

183
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,509
<i>But, darling, now is the time</i>

184
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,379
that you need
to protect yourself.

185
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,947
You do.

186
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,815
Financially, I mean.

187
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,889
<i>He could wipe you out.</i>

188
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,924
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

189
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:38,529
<i>Mommy, the bank accounts
are secured.</i>

190
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,498
Look.

191
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,932
Look, look, look.

192
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:42,934
You see?

193
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,871
<i>If Howard was going to leave me</i>

194
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,573
<i>wouldn't he have cleared out
all the accounts?</i>

195
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,909
<i>But he didn't.</i>

196
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,944
<i>Well, just give him time.
He will.</i>

197
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,048
You bitch.

198
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,718
Oh, god, I wish I had

199
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,586
a high-powered rifle right now.

200
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,856
<i>One shot.</i>

201
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,928
That woman could be up here
for two days.

202
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,667
<i>At this juncture,
it seems fair to point out</i>

203
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,002
<i>if your spouse
had seemingly vanished</i>

204
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,538
<i>would you go off
to work as usual?</i>

205
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,375
<i>Are daily matters
so very goddamn urgent</i>

206
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,710
<i>at the local county museum?</i>

207
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,580
<i>Or was that desperate call
to the police a tactic</i>

208
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,815
<i>calculated to embarrass me?</i>

209
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,985
<i>Leave it to Mrs. Wakefield</i>

210
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,954
<i>to turn a rather
amusing sidestep</i>

211
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,956
<i>into prima facie evidence</i>

212
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,825
<i>of Howard's
thoughtless behavior.</i>

213
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,927
<i>I was naive</i>

214
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,964
<i>and condescending to her mother.</i>

215
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,032
<i>I lacked interest in her work.</i>

216
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,736
<i>Or I wasted perfectly
beautiful full weekends</i>

217
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,805
<i>watching football games.</i>

218
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,040
<i>And if she was such a feminist</i>

219
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,109
<i>why did my opening
a door for her</i>

220
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,013
<i>or helping her on with her
coat matter so goddamn much?</i>

221
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,877
<i>Standing there
in the clear light of day..</i>

222
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,648
<i>I could see.</i>

223
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,051
<i>Diana felt that she
had married the wrong man.</i>

224
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,584
Oh.

225
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:23,988
<i>I ask you</i>

226
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,893
<i>what is so sacrosanct about
a marriage and a family</i>

227
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:32,663
<i>that you should have to live
in it day after day</i>

228
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,965
<i>however unrealized
that life may be?</i>

229
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,019
<i>Who hasn't had the impulse
to just put their life</i>

230
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,787
<i>on hold for a moment?</i>

231
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,223
<i>I ask you.</i>

232
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,819
Mm.

233
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,988
<i>Oh, my god, that looks good.</i>

234
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,995
<i>What are you two doing laughing?</i>

235
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,231
Assholes.

236
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,234
Unh-unh-unh.
Here's the conspiracy.

237
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,037
<i>It's all a little too
convenient, don't you think?</i>

238
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh, yes, I agree.

239
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,642
I think she's totally guilty.

240
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,712
She murdered him.

241
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,054
Oh.

242
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,225
Oh, no.

243
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,161
Ben Jacobson, attorney at law

244
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,896
just stoppin' by
for a little deli.

245
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,798
Hello, Ben.

246
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
<i>You're not fooling anybody.</i>

247
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,173
<i>I say, without shame</i>

248
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,176
<i>I'd given not a single
thought to anyone at work.</i>

249
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,180
<i>And the documents
I carried away with me.</i>

250
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:33,283
<i>Documents, vital
to a very lucrative case</i>

251
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,085
<i>we'd been preparing.</i>

252
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,088
<i>All of that
was pretty remote now.</i>

253
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,824
Well..

254
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,361
<i>I've got my own
little deli going here.</i>

255
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,431
Oh, my god.

256
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,167
Here I am.

257
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,250
Ta-dah!

258
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,497
<i>Oh, right.</i>

259
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,366
Make her the victim.

260
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,878
Oh, please.
They've hardly been abandoned.

261
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,780
People, I'm right here.

262
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,242
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

263
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,911
Here it is.

264
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,781
Making your play, huh, Ben?

265
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,416
<i>Go on, go on, go on. Go, on.</i>

266
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,352
She's hurting.

267
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,320
Give her your hanky,
be a gentleman.

268
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,993
Oh, my god.

269
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,495
He..

270
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,366
He took out his phone.

271
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,967
What an ass.

272
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,569
A husband doesn't just vanish,
Mrs. Wakefield.

273
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,309
<i>Howard Wakefield
is on this earth.</i>

274
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,380
Or under it.

275
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,618
And only you, madam,
know which it is.

276
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,163
<i>Are you accusing me
of making a game of this?</i>

277
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,433
<i>I assure you my frame of mind
was quite rational.</i>

278
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,536
<i>May I remind you</i>

279
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,373
<i>I was eating actual garbage
to survive?</i>

280
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,011
<i>Oh.</i>

281
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,950
Come on back.

282
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,719
Come on, honey, come back,
come back.

283
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,521
Come back, come back, come back.

284
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,525
<i>There you are.</i>

285
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,697
<i>About my wife's
deliberate nudity.</i>

286
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,200
<i>Apparently
it's a side effect of her</i>

287
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,736
<i>having once been
a modern dancer.</i>

288
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,138
<i>Briefly.
I feel compelled to add.</i>

289
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,409
Who exactly are you trying
to attract out there?

290
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,645
No one can see me
and if they can, I don't care.

291
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,246
Uh, clearly.

292
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,350
Strutting around this house
on full display.

293
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,986
Would it kill you
to put some clothes on

294
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,387
in front of our girls?

295
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,921
No, I'm not gonna
teach our daughters

296
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,256
to have shame
about having a body.

297
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,659
What if I started parading
naked around them, huh?

298
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,627
What'd you think about that?
Hey, look at me!

299
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,463
Whoo, daddy's naked!

300
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,198
Mr. prude-o in the nude-o.

301
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,500
Hey, look at me,
I'm going to work naked!

302
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,568
Right, right, right.

303
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,004
Jesus.

304
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,373
Would you get away from there?

305
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,375
<i>There's no one there, Howard.</i>

306
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,487
Oh.

307
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:52,529
<i>Seeing my wife in the nude,
oddly enough</i>

308
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,564
<i>usually got me
thinking about money.</i>

309
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,804
<i>I've only a slender amount
of cash with me.</i>

310
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,107
<i>And if it's my intention
to vanish completely</i>

311
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,643
<i>using a credit card
is out of the question.</i>

312
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,516
<i>I could pre-date a bank check</i>

313
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:15,118
<i>and cash it somewhere, yes.</i>

314
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,686
<i>But that might signal to Diana</i>

315
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,589
<i>that my disappearance
was pre-meditated.</i>

316
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:23,226
<i>Which, I don't know,
seems unnecessarily cool.</i>

317
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,682
<i>It's not difficult to run away.</i>

318
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,750
<i>People ditch their families
all the time.</i>

319
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,690
<i>But if this were
a simple abandonment of wife</i>

320
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:30,460
<i>and children, I'd have
written Diana a note</i>

321
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,196
<i>taken my car out of the garage</i>

322
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:36,600
<i>driven to Manhattan,
checked into a hotel</i>

323
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,335
<i>and walked to work
in the morning.</i>

324
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,570
<i>Easy. Anyone can do that.</i>

325
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,578
<i>But you'd still be
the same person.</i>

326
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,483
<i>This is different.</i>

327
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,294
<i>You see..</i>

328
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,630
<i>I no longer seem
to require those things</i>

329
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:09,733
<i>that only days ago
were so indispensable.</i>

330
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,502
<i>The armor of a clean shirt</i>

331
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,803
<i>the smooth shave</i>

332
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,606
<i>credit cards, cellphones</i>

333
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,674
<i>clients.</i>

334
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,346
<i>There will be no more
getting on that train.</i>

335
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,659
<i>I'll take nothing more from her.</i>

336
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,495
<i>Nothing from that house.</i>

337
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,597
<i>Ever.</i>

338
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,671
<i>I'll sustain myself
like a castaway.</i>

339
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,674
<i>A survivor.</i>

340
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,810
<i>Undetected.</i>

341
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,749
<i>Unshackled.</i>

342
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,353
<i>I'll become the Howard Wakefield</i>

343
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,754
<i>I was meant to be.</i>

344
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,662
<i>Oh, please.</i>

345
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,864
<i>You've imagined doing this
yourself. I know you have.</i>

346
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,870
<i>But what about
the twins you ask?</i>

347
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,472
<i>No regrets there.</i>

348
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,442
<i>In their current phase</i>

349
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,344
<i>our girls generally think of me</i>

350
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,646
<i>as some kind
of unfortunate oddity</i>

351
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,815
<i>who embarrasses them
in front of their friends.</i>

352
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,719
<i>Believe me</i>

353
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,721
<i>I'm seeing more of these two now</i>

354
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,789
<i>than I have in months,
if not years.</i>

355
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,828
<i>And I'm sure
it's not lost on you.</i>

356
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,831
<i>Though I might have left my wife</i>

357
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,799
<i>I'll still be able
to keep an eye on her.</i>

358
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,598
Ah.

359
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,968
There we go.

360
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,906
<i>Did I ever miss
the conveniences of home?</i>

361
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,141
Oh!

362
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,910
Yeah.

363
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:42,946
<i>No TV..</i>

364
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,615
<i>No problem.</i>

365
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,454
<i>Our neighbor, Dr. sondervan,
is a known authority</i>

366
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:54,524
<i>on down syndrome and other
developmental disorders.</i>

367
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,829
<i>When he began
to board some patients</i>

368
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:03,066
<i>a few months at a time,
I stood up for sondervan</i>

369
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,168
<i>when our neighbors
petitioned against him.</i>

370
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,012
Shit!

371
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,014
<i>God.</i>

372
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,960
<i>My spirited defense
of Dr. sondervan</i>

373
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,096
<i>and his young charges
for once gave me</i>

374
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,098
<i>the moral high ground with Diana</i>

375
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,034
<i>who naturally
took the opposing view.</i>

376
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,134
<i>Howard, really?</i>

377
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:43,206
<i>Do we have any idea what
goes on behind those gates?</i>

378
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,075
<i>And the apparent answer
to your wife is</i>

379
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,945
<i>not too goddam much.</i>

380
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,514
<i>Morning's a little
social interaction.</i>

381
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,117
<i>Evenings conclude
with a hot shower.</i>

382
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,954
<i>And who can argue with that?</i>

383
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,118
There you are.

384
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:36,059
Oh. That's so easy, isn't it?

385
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:39,028
<i>In every marriage,
there's a division of labor.</i>

386
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,864
<i>Mine and yours.</i>

387
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:43,867
<i>By Diana's artful calibration</i>

388
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,103
<i>her tasks occur
only inside the house.</i>

389
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,873
<i>Children, cleaning,
provisioning.</i>

390
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,808
<i>Oh, which means shopping.</i>

391
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,676
<i>Lots of shopping.</i>

392
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,045
<i>But anything external, the roof</i>

393
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,981
<i>the gutters, the chimney, trash</i>

394
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:01,718
<i>you know, servicing the cars,
that's all left to me.</i>

395
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,818
<i>Her duties end at the door.</i>

396
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,155
<i>And of course, any labor
accomplished outside the house</i>

397
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,558
<i>is invisible to my wife.</i>

398
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,294
<i>Paying the bills, invisible.</i>

399
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,831
<i>Property taxes, life insurance</i>

400
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:18,668
<i>home insurance
and of course, our mortgage.</i>

401
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,104
<i>All faithfully and invisibly</i>

402
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:24,541
<i>taken care of
by one Howard Wakefield.</i>

403
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,176
<i>Now quite possibly deceased.</i>

404
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,146
Celebration.

405
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,016
One, two, three, four, five.

406
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,786
Party?

407
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,058
P-a-r-t-y.

408
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,126
Yeah.

409
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,661
Tsk. Monday.

410
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,304
Who the hell is this?

411
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,181
Oh, my god. Ben Jacobs.

412
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,086
<i>Oh, yes, yes, yes, uh-huh.</i>

413
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,221
You dog.

414
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,659
<i>Coffee? Cookies? Come on in.</i>

415
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,329
Oh, he's gonna need
some whitener

416
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,664
for his coffee, Diana.

417
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:25,001
Uh, excuse me, you don't
have any soy milk, do you?

418
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,769
Of course, she's got soy milk.

419
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,237
She's got everything.

420
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,611
Please, Ben, please tell her

421
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,947
about your tragic
lactose intolerance.

422
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,384
All the bloating and flatulence.

423
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,335
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

424
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:02,238
Little pro-bono work
on behalf of the firm.

425
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,273
How nice of you.

426
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,144
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

427
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,063
<i>You know, I never used to sing.</i>

428
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,198
<i>I think that's worth noting.</i>

429
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,170
<i>If I sign this..</i>

430
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,041
It's declaring
my husband absentee.

431
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,778
What if I don't sign?

432
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,214
Would it make him
any less absent?

433
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,060
You've got to be kidding me.

434
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:59,762
<i>Right away with the..</i>

435
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,330
<i>Come on, honey.</i>

436
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,332
<i>Show him the door. Show it.</i>

437
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,271
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

438
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:14,343
Oh, Ben, you're such a douche.

439
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,347
She is totally
out of your league.

440
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,049
<i>Attagirl!</i>

441
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,292
That's for you, dickhead.

442
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,832
Yeah.

443
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:39,035
<i>Absentee or no,
it's a victory, I guess</i>

444
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,204
<i>to know I've still got
possession of my wife.</i>

445
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,008
<i>Which reminds me,
I believe you're aware</i>

446
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,111
<i>that Diana was something
of a dancer.</i>

447
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,749
<i>By the time we met, of course.</i>

448
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:55,318
<i>Diana's brief flirtation
with the stage</i>

449
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,186
<i>had been replaced
by the occasional</i>

450
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,955
<i>evening bar class.</i>

451
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,358
<i>While she pursued a graduate
degree in art history</i>

452
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,261
<i>and complicated her life
in the usual ways.</i>

453
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,800
<i>Did I tell you she was
involved with someone else</i>

454
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,468
<i>when she started seeing me?</i>

455
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:17,140
<i>Dirk, dirk morrison.</i>

456
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:20,109
Without touchin' the dime
or the bottle

457
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,412
and usin' only one finger,
get the dime into the bottle.

458
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:26,883
<i>We met in the city through an
alumni mix and hit it off.</i>

459
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,152
<i>A few years later,
my firm did some work</i>

460
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:30,853
<i>for his capital investment firm.</i>

461
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:32,255
I thought you were smart.

462
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,491
<i>I guess he'd say
we were friends.</i>

463
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,959
- Where's the $5?
- Well done.

464
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,995
I didn't bet you $5 on that.

465
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:43,299
<i>There was nothing dirk couldn't
turn into a competition.</i>

466
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,034
<i>Fuck, yeah!</i>

467
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,236
- What else you got?
- I can't hear ya.

468
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,173
Thank you very much.

469
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,441
<i>And I'm not defending
my own actions</i>

470
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,377
<i>but dirk's competitiveness</i>

471
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,946
<i>brought out a certain
quality in me.</i>

472
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,415
So before your very eyes..

473
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,384
I'm gonna make this widget

474
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:04,353
leave this bottle
without touching the bottle

475
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,589
or the widget in any way.

476
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,025
Should we stand back?

477
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,196
- Whoa!
- Oh, ow!

478
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,333
Oh, shit.

479
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,469
<i>I had never had a thing
for dancers myself</i>

480
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:25,141
<i>but somehow dirk's
intense interest in Diana</i>

481
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,143
<i>gave me ideas of my own.</i>

482
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,219
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

483
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:38,054
- Diana.
- Oh, yes, of course. Hi.

484
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:39,154
- Hi.
- How are you?

485
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,724
<i>At first, she wouldn't
go out with me.</i>

486
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:44,393
I'm seeing
a good friend of yours.

487
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,229
Dirk morrison.

488
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,564
I'm... I'm dating dirk.

489
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,099
<i>The thing to remember is</i>

490
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,968
<i>I'm a litigator by profession.</i>

491
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,237
<i>I have a talent for persuasion.</i>

492
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,945
<i>Not that she ran to dirk
with the news.</i>

493
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,987
<i>I had just been made a
senior partner at the firm.</i>

494
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:13,189
<i>Dirk was grinding away
at wall street.</i>

495
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,558
<i>So busy people, right?</i>

496
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>It took a while
for dirk to find out.</i>

497
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,900
Howard, you are jokin'
right now?

498
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:26,235
No, no, she..

499
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,304
She wanted to get out
and I thought great.

500
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,439
So we went for a bike ride
in central park.

501
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,539
<i>It was nice.</i>

502
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,044
Little lunch
at the... at the boat house.

503
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,446
- That is total bullshit.
- Here. Here's your light beer.

504
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,348
Cheers.

505
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,983
I mean, let's be serious,
it's not as if

506
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,119
anything is happening with you.

507
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:44,987
That's bollocks.

508
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,390
Howard, we have a thing.

509
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,392
We... we have an understanding.

510
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,929
- An understanding?
- Yeah.

511
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:56,399
Dirk, I mean,
you're not even fucking her.

512
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:59,135
Last week, you told me
not to rouse her.

513
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,235
- That means.. Jesus.
- Yes.

514
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,239
A woman like Diana
cannot be pushed.

515
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,340
You need to gain her trust.

516
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,741
Wait, did you... did you
tell Diana

517
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,810
that I gave you permission
to ask her out?

518
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,580
- What?
- Just tell me.

519
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:12,949
Jesus.

520
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,118
No.

521
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,422
Come on, dirk.
She was just not happy.

522
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,124
She didn't wanna tell you
what really happened.

523
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,594
She's protecting you.

524
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,598
Honest.

525
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,004
<i>I lied, of course.</i>

526
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,273
<i>Diana was torn between us.</i>

527
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,745
<i>The drama went on for,
god, for weeks at least.</i>

528
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,580
It's okay.

529
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,451
<i>Why she'd never gone to bed
with dirk</i>

530
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:52,521
<i>was I had made my move early
on in time to hit it off.</i>

531
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,358
<i>But in those early weeks</i>

532
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,326
<i>she wasn't
sleeping with me either.</i>

533
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,662
It's okay.

534
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,597
<i>Till I made a genius</i>

535
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,633
<i>and I mean
genius strategic move.</i>

536
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,535
I mean,
whatever she's telling you

537
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,505
she is certainly
not asking me to back up.

538
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,241
I don't know.

539
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,647
What she says is that
she really cares about me.

540
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,617
What?

541
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,486
That is Diana

542
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,554
the queen of mixed signals, huh?

543
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,524
Hey, maybe she's playing
us both.

544
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,594
You know, in bed last night

545
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:34,163
she started talking about
moving in with me

546
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,132
and I went seriously?

547
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm thinking, I really like you

548
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,469
but aren't we moving
a little too fast with this?

549
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,637
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

550
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,173
She... she's not..

551
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,376
She's... she's not
sleeping with you?

552
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,415
Yeah, of course.

553
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,519
What? She didn't say
anything to you?

554
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,722
Oh, my god.

555
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,360
Diana.

556
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,763
<i>Genius, right?</i>

557
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,266
<i>I knew dirk would do
something stupid.</i>

558
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,541
Wait, wait, no. Stop.

559
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,243
Stop it.

560
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,345
<i>Within hours,
it had all played out.</i>

561
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,148
Hey, how are you?

562
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,489
- Oh.
- How is it? Is it bad?

563
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,691
- Oh.
- Yeah, I know.

564
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,561
I'm so sorry.

565
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,563
Ooh.

566
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,298
- No, no, no.
- I'm sorry.

567
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,365
That feels better.

568
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:45,634
Just leave it there a second.

569
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,572
I have never seen
this side of him before.

570
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,707
This violence.

571
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,609
Ah, I'm not so surprised.

572
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,411
I've known this guy a long time.

573
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,747
Has the swelling gone down?

574
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,816
- No.
- Oh.

575
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,518
Oh, poor baby.

576
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,390
Hmm. That's better.

577
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,361
That's even more better.

578
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,446
<i>And thank you, dirk morrison.</i>

579
00:52:37,016 --> 00:52:38,455
<i>Would I have wanted her</i>

580
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:41,490
<i>if she weren't
my best friend's girl?</i>

581
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,761
<i>Was I just jacked up
by the competition?</i>

582
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,664
<i>Yeah, well..</i>

583
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,799
<i>It did occur to me</i>

584
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,269
<i>about a year into the marriage.</i>

585
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,808
<i>But by then,
your wife is pregnant.</i>

586
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,777
<i>She's carrying your child.</i>

587
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,780
<i>And god, I don't know.</i>

588
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,816
<i>She was just so beautiful.</i>

589
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,818
<i>All over again.</i>

590
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:16,959
<i>It makes you go
a little crazy and stuff.</i>

591
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:19,828
<i>Oh, that gorgeous round belly.</i>

592
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,465
<i>It awakens this
whole other level of..</i>

593
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,703
<i>Well, fear, I guess.</i>

594
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,838
<i>You wanna capture her somehow.</i>

595
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,210
<i>You see,
this is how they get you.</i>

596
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,679
<i>They maneuver things
to that point</i>

597
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,714
<i>where you feel like
everything in your life</i>

598
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,650
<i>is suddenly precious.</i>

599
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,720
<i>And... and simultaneously,
totally precarious.</i>

600
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,390
<i>It just slams you.</i>

601
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,560
<i>The realization that everything</i>

602
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,697
<i>with any meaning,
anything you love</i>

603
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:57,666
<i>could just be taken away
in some random event.</i>

604
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,307
<i>Anything could happen, right?</i>

605
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:08,711
<i>Anything.</i>

606
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,716
<i>If I had left her
in the conventional sense</i>

607
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:15,884
<i>if I had divorced her</i>

608
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,686
<i>no one would blame my wife</i>

609
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:20,723
<i>if she began entertaining
hoards of men.</i>

610
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:24,326
<i>But by simply vanishing,
I placed Diana</i>

611
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:27,296
<i>in a, let's say,
a distant category.</i>

612
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,834
<i>Till it's known
what's become of her husband.</i>

613
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:36,038
<i>Mrs. Wakefield remains
not quite available.</i>

614
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,808
<i>A power move.</i>

615
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,810
<i>Am I intentionally
frustrating her?</i>

616
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,547
<i>Not at all, my love.</i>

617
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,816
<i>I'm sure you have vivid memories</i>

618
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,885
<i>of what you're missing.</i>

619
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,920
<i>I know I do.</i>

620
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,527
<i>I just want you to want me</i>

621
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,663
<i>as much as I want you.</i>

622
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,911
<i>When people are leaving
for summer vacation</i>

623
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,479
<i>they put out more trash.</i>

624
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,515
<i>Cleaning up the fridge
never fails.</i>

625
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,920
<i>Ah, the tell-tale signs.</i>

626
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,790
<i>There's always ice cream.</i>

627
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,961
<i>Every two weeks, residents here</i>

628
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,563
<i>put out the good stuff.</i>

629
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:36,865
<i>Whatever isn't strictly garbage.</i>

630
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,535
<i>By 2:00 A.M.,
anything usable is gone.</i>

631
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:00,924
<i>Gleaners.</i>

632
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:04,593
<i>Russians from the south end
of town.</i>

633
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,929
<i>Bottom feeders.</i>

634
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,744
I'm not being a baby.
I'm just not going up there.

635
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,879
- Yes, you are.
- Duh.

636
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,447
I'm saying you have to.

637
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:27,449
Well, you know what,
I don't have to listen to you.

638
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:28,850
Yes, you do.

639
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,955
No, come on.

640
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:35,391
Mommy said you have to.
I need your help.

641
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,826
No way, there's spiders up
there. Can you just...

642
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:40,028
- I don't have on shoes.
- Neither do I.

643
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,799
I'm gonna get splinters.

644
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:44,933
And I won't?

645
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,101
<i>Do you see..</i>

646
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,873
- Okay, we'll both go.
- Okay.

647
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,073
No!

648
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,047
<i>I blame myself
for getting lulled</i>

649
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,116
<i>into the domestic routine.</i>

650
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,052
<i>Day after day,
so much is the same.</i>

651
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,622
<i>Diana, neighbors..</i>

652
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,592
<i>Tradesmen.</i>

653
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,031
<i>Week after week.</i>

654
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,905
<i>And one day,
routine goes to hell.</i>

655
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,991
<i>Exhibit a.</i>

656
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,062
<i>Diana couldn't be
taking the girls</i>

657
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:22,931
<i>on our usual summer trip
to the cape.</i>

658
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,067
<i>How could she possibly
afford it this year?</i>

659
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,172
<i>Diana had very little
coming in these days.</i>

660
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,975
<i>Would she really
damage our savings</i>

661
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:35,143
<i>just to loll around on the beach</i>

662
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,145
<i>in her very small bikini?</i>

663
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,550
<i>God, the three of them.</i>

664
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,852
<i>I'm trying to track
the exact moment</i>

665
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,555
<i>those three became
the opposing team.</i>

666
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,023
How do you do?

667
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,194
How was, uh, how was school?

668
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,638
Okay. Right.

669
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,011
<i>The many times I've listened
under the windows</i>

670
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:13,782
<i>of this house, have I heard
my name spoken even once?</i>

671
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,788
<i>So, why am I still concerned</i>

672
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,790
<i>about their financial situation?</i>

673
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,195
<i>I'm the one who's
impoverished, goddammit.</i>

674
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:28,964
<i>Scrounging every meal.</i>

675
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,200
<i>It's hot as blazes
in this attic.</i>

676
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,104
<i>It's glaringly obvious</i>

677
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:38,907
<i>that my wife herself
will come up here tonight</i>

678
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,177
<i>to carry away those
essential vacation items</i>

679
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,147
<i>that Howard Wakefield,
devoted husband</i>

680
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:48,116
<i>had so obediently opened
his wallet to provide.</i>

681
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,049
<i>A prisoner.</i>

682
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:25,053
<i>That's what I've made of myself.</i>

683
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,823
<i>A fuckwit prisoner of all time.</i>

684
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,837
Here we go.

685
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,255
Ugh.

686
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,759
Ah!

687
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,763
Oh! Ugh, ugh!

688
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,233
Oh!

689
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,346
Son of a bitch!

690
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,249
Oh!

691
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,463
Ah!

692
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:39,321
Look, oh, dear.

693
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,357
It's a shame.

694
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,440
She isn't back. She's getting
stuff into the car.

695
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,917
How many bags? Hold up.
I got the chairs.

696
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,420
Sweetheart.

697
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,829
I'm coming, I'm coming.

698
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,998
I brought us a go cup of coffee.

699
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,134
<i>Is it just me
or is it oddly relaxing</i>

700
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:00,969
<i>when the wife goes out of town?</i>

701
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,448
<i>You know, maybe it's summer</i>

702
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,451
<i>but I find I'm becoming lax</i>

703
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,453
<i>about keeping up with events.</i>

704
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,936
Look at you.

705
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,276
Uh..

706
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,517
"Luckiest guy on wall street?"

707
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,220
Goddamn right he is.

708
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,924
Divorced.

709
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,193
Loser.

710
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:09,037
<i>What's amazing is that
old dirk and I</i>

711
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,406
<i>ended up in the same line
of work.</i>

712
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,508
<i>Dirk morrison, junk man.</i>

713
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,944
<i>Scavenging the remnants of what?</i>

714
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:17,679
<i>Pizza chains and supermarkets?</i>

715
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,547
<i>Buying, raiding, flipping.</i>

716
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,384
<i>Exhausting.</i>

717
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:23,484
Mm.

718
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,520
Take the money to him.
There you go.

719
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,426
Good job, sweetheart.

720
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,571
<i>Do I ever worry that someone
might recognize me</i>

721
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,707
<i>on one of these
expeditions to town?</i>

722
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,278
<i>Diana.</i>

723
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,180
<i>Coming home early from the cape.</i>

724
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,586
<i>She could show up any moment.</i>

725
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:06,261
<i>Oh, believe me, I can knock
out countless variations.</i>

726
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,471
<i>It's endlessly entertaining.</i>

727
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,508
<i>You do realize,
I hope, that none of this</i>

728
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,210
<i>is a rejection of my wife</i>

729
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:25,146
<i>or... or suburban life
or any of that.</i>

730
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,652
<i>You see, I never left my family.</i>

731
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,989
<i>I left myself.</i>

732
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,392
<i>I stepped into the wild.</i>

733
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:42,230
<i>Into that primal arena,
a beach vacation in Cape Cod</i>

734
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,032
<i>only pretends to supply.</i>

735
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,772
<i>But in the primal world,
there's one law.</i>

736
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,541
Oh!

737
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,745
<i>We are food to one another..</i>

738
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,315
<i>Or we are not.</i>

739
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:03,018
<i>That's it. End of story.</i>

740
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,627
<i>You know how in late summer</i>

741
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:15,030
<i>there's always
that first night of Autumn.</i>

742
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,699
<i>That familiar chill.</i>

743
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,538
<i>Normally, I welcome
the change of seasons.</i>

744
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,041
<i>But this time, well</i>

745
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:28,276
<i>I no longer
have a pair of shoes.</i>

746
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,647
No, no, no, mine. Mine, hey!

747
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:07,615
Hey, hey, no, no, no!

748
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,451
Mine. Mine!

749
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,222
No. No.

750
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,498
- <i>Nyet!</i>
- Go!

751
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,833
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

752
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,312
Come, come on.

753
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,684
Mm.

754
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,473
Herbert.

755
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:13,675
Herbert.

756
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,349
Emily.

757
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:23,818
Hm.

758
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,690
Emily and Herbert.

759
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,532
Howard.

760
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:38,534
Howard.

761
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,238
<i>Howard.</i>

762
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,773
Shoes.

763
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,382
Uh-huh.

764
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,940
Yeah, okay.

765
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,947
Listen.

766
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,787
Emily, Herbert..

767
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,725
It's very important

768
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:41,763
that you don't tell anyone
that you saw me.

769
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:43,364
<i>You understand?</i>

770
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,834
Shh, shh, yes, yes.

771
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:48,936
It's a secret.

772
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,614
Bye.

773
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,596
<i>Suppose they do tell someone,
those two next door.</i>

774
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,368
<i>I should leave.</i>

775
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,973
<i>Diana will be coming back soon.</i>

776
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,809
<i>My daughters
coming up the stairs</i>

777
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:29,911
<i>to put their vacation gear away.</i>

778
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,452
<i>I should go sleep in the woods.</i>

779
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,005
Mm.

780
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:31,038
Those are toe shoes for ballet.

781
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,573
You know, ballet?

782
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,178
Mm-hm.

783
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,420
Yeah, that's you. Look here.

784
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,588
You know who that is?

785
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,457
- Mm?
- Who is that?

786
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,794
Yeah.

787
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:55,062
Yes. That's Emily.

788
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:57,732
- Emily?
- Emily.

789
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:58,933
Yeah.

790
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,934
Oh, you know what that is?

791
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,838
That is a bicycle pump.

792
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,842
You use that to put air in
your... in your bicycle tires.

793
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,209
Here, let me... let me show you.

794
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,011
You see, uh, there we go, see.

795
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,246
You take this part..

796
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:48,049
<i>Have I mentioned the loneliness?</i>

797
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:49,083
Just like.. Feel the air?

798
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,653
Feel this?

799
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:57,525
Whoo! Hoo-hoo! I give up.
Let's get Emily. Come on.

800
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:04,599
Oh. Now this is a very
important piece of equipment.

801
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:05,699
You have a hole..

802
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,536
<i>When you are alone for so long</i>

803
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:11,138
<i>you forget the simple
human exchange.</i>

804
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,274
Snap that into place. Voila.

805
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,080
Listen, Herbert, Emily.

806
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,684
Don't come back here again

807
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,553
or I'll have to leave.

808
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,990
Okay? Do you understand?

809
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,794
It's our secret. Remember?

810
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:36,130
Yes. Yes.

811
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:38,065
Good, Herbert. Our secret.

812
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:40,902
Remember, Emily?
Don't tell anyone.

813
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,540
And I mean it. Don't come back.

814
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,043
Yeah.

815
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,083
<i>They'll never be able
to keep their end of it.</i>

816
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,328
<i>The sensible thing would be
to abandon this place.</i>

817
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:09,965
Ah.

818
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:15,069
<i>No question. I'd have
completely stranded myself.</i>

819
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:08,015
<i>She's taking dance class again.</i>

820
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:11,952
That's good.

821
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,766
<i>She seems a little
tired tonight.</i>

822
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:26,801
Well..

823
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,971
The kids are running her ragged.

824
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:42,183
<i>They're looking more like Diana
these days, don't you think?</i>

825
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,458
<i>Hey, check this out.</i>

826
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,394
<i>I like her wearing her hair
long like that.</i>

827
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:56,363
- Have a safe drive. Bye.
- Bye.

828
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:05,940
Uh, Taylor, gelly, I think, um,
these ninja's might belong to you.

829
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,508
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

830
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,976
<i>Boys.</i>

831
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,314
<i>When did that happen?</i>

832
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:16,283
What do you say when you knock
on the door on Halloween?

833
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:17,785
Good morning.

834
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:18,919
Good morning?

835
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:21,188
You don't say good morning.

836
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,124
<i>- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!</i>

837
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,270
<i>There's no point denying it.</i>

838
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,774
<i>They're much happier without me.</i>

839
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,443
<i>She's buying the cheaper
cuts of meat.</i>

840
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,046
<i>Saving her pennies.</i>

841
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,353
<i>Suppose she has to sell
the house?</i>

842
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,194
<i>How far am I willing
to let this go?</i>

843
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,432
<i>Then again,
it could end at any moment.</i>

844
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,137
<i>I could be exposed.</i>

845
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,843
<i>Christ, if I did go back</i>

846
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:51,412
<i>I mean, how would I begin?</i>

847
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,382
<i>How does a man in my situation</i>

848
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:57,418
<i>explain himself to his wife?</i>

849
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,288
<i>She'll think
I vacated my senses.</i>

850
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:08,495
<i>If anything, I've come
into my senses fully.</i>

851
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,973
<i>My god, I can see it so clearly.</i>

852
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,910
<i>I've constructed
the whole thing.</i>

853
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,880
<i>The jealousy</i>

854
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:27,114
<i>the resentment..</i>

855
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,117
<i>The selfish urgency.</i>

856
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,127
<i>Howard is victim.</i>

857
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,199
<i>Howard is persecutor.</i>

858
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,901
<i>There's no one there, Howard.</i>

859
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,272
<i>Howard has mastered the world.</i>

860
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,145
<i>That was my prison.</i>

861
01:21:58,147 --> 01:22:00,147
<i>That's what I've escaped.</i>

862
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,553
<i>Leaving me where now?</i>

863
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,226
<i>An outcast of cosmos.</i>

864
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,000
<i>I'll tell you this.</i>

865
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:22,937
<i>You can think whatever you like.</i>

866
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:26,407
<i>I love my wife now as I've
never loved her before.</i>

867
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:44,158
<i>So I'm guessing
Thanksgiving dinner</i>

868
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,427
<i>will be at babs' house
this year.</i>

869
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:50,631
<i>And you know what that means.</i>

870
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,434
<i>Zilch-o for me
in the leftovers department.</i>

871
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,043
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

872
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:04,712
<i>A family of ten
could eat for weeks</i>

873
01:23:04,714 --> 01:23:06,580
<i>off what my neighbors throw out.</i>

874
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:11,485
<i>This stuff will keep forever.</i>

875
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,588
<i>The whole attic's
like a goddamn refrigerator.</i>

876
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:25,466
<i>Unfortunately, Howard Wakefield
had ignored some basic repairs.</i>

877
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:48,255
<i>What about
when it starts snowing?</i>

878
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:52,326
<i>Diana will think
she has a prowler.</i>

879
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,730
<i>Stupid. They're not home.</i>

880
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:59,199
<i>Go inside where it's warm.</i>

881
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,485
<i>The first catch of the game..</i>

882
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,220
<i>He's going for another
first down.</i>

883
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,070
<i>And with our black
Friday sales going on</i>

884
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:37,270
<i>throughout the entire weekend</i>

885
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:40,840
<i>you can find savings
for the entire family.</i>

886
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:43,270
Ssh. Shh, shh.

887
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,608
<i>Want some wine?</i>

888
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,279
<i>Here.</i>

889
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:54,681
<i>Just a little...
Just a little sip.</i>

890
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,277
<i>Here.</i>

891
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,720
<i>"The quality of mercy
is not strained.</i>

892
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,723
<i>"It droppeth as the gentle rain</i>

893
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:38,959
<i>from heaven
upon the place beneath."</i>

894
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,263
<i>Your whole life
you hear that quoted.</i>

895
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,767
<i>I never got it till now.</i>

896
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:52,406
<i>Mercy is not something
you ever get to request.</i>

897
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:56,210
<i>Not strained means not forced.</i>

898
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,647
<i>It's given freely.</i>

899
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:02,683
Thank you, Herbert.
Thank you, Emily.

900
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,425
<i>No reason.</i>

901
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:14,394
<i>Just a gift drops from the sky.</i>

902
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,801
<i>Twice blessed.</i>

903
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,336
<i>Blessing him that gives</i>

904
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:24,371
<i>and him that takes</i>

905
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:26,740
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

906
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:27,840
Thank you.

907
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:31,544
<i>The giving and the taking
all in one.</i>

908
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,037
Okay. Thank you so much, Caleb.

909
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:32,406
We'll see you in June? July?
June? Okay.

910
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:33,540
Okay.

911
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,986
<i>Supposed she had recognized us.</i>

912
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,790
<i>You could have lost her
right there, pal.</i>

913
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,726
Unthinkable.

914
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:54,561
<i>I mean, the shock of it.</i>

915
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:57,597
<i>To look into Diana's eyes.</i>

916
01:28:57,599 --> 01:29:01,802
<i>Her eyes that I've seen into
countless, countless times</i>

917
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:04,771
<i>to look and to see nothing.</i>

918
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:17,017
<i>I had no idea how one-sided
this relationship had become.</i>

919
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,312
Where should I dump
daddy's clothes?

920
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:47,647
<i>Put everything in the car.</i>

921
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:49,383
<i>Good god.</i>

922
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:52,085
<i>They're emptying my closet.</i>

923
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,593
I'll be right back.

924
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:02,562
Just put the oven on,
would you, please? 350.

925
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,564
- <i>Alright.</i>
- Close the door.

926
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:15,836
<i>Am I a coward, afraid
of facing her rejection?</i>

927
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,207
<i>Or am I just resolved
to see this thing through?</i>

928
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:24,077
<i>And by this thing</i>

929
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,112
<i>what the hell do I even mean?</i>

930
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,787
<i>Gone is the provider</i>

931
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:36,022
<i>the family man, the litigator</i>

932
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,024
<i>the husband.</i>

933
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:40,560
<i>All that remains is the lover.</i>

934
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:45,265
<i>Enduring, passionate.</i>

935
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:51,538
<i>I love her
because she belongs to me.</i>

936
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,573
<i>And I love her
because she doesn't.</i>

937
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,145
<i>And I know
if I come in from exile</i>

938
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:00,847
<i>there's every chance
I'll lose her.</i>

939
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,017
<i>On the other hand</i>

940
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,019
<i>I know this look she has</i>

941
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,754
<i>from deep memory.</i>

942
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:13,226
<i>My wife, infatuated..</i>

943
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,795
<i>Eager to please..</i>

944
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,901
<i>Trusting that every word
is true.</i>

945
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:40,086
<i>Why wouldn't she seek
a little tenderness?</i>

946
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,765
<i>I'm not saying I welcome this.</i>

947
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:53,767
<i>I'm saying I understand.</i>

948
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:13,787
<i>Mom, can you get scissors?</i>

949
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:14,955
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hang on.

950
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:19,059
Just leave the tree
by the steps, okay?

951
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:20,627
Okay.

952
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,106
<i>Company for dinner?</i>

953
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,076
<i>Who can it be?</i>

954
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:14,814
Um..

955
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:36,870
<i>Ah! A-ha!</i>

956
01:34:36,872 --> 01:34:38,838
<i>A city feller, eh?</i>

957
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:50,283
<i>He's tall.</i>

958
01:34:50,285 --> 01:34:52,786
<i>Not much to conclude from that.</i>

959
01:34:57,393 --> 01:34:58,492
<i>My, my.</i>

960
01:34:58,493 --> 01:35:01,928
<i>Coffee and dessert
in the living room.</i>

961
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:03,963
<i>This is a special evening.</i>

962
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:30,457
Oh, my god.

963
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,494
<i>Dirk morrison.</i>

964
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:37,297
Son of bitch.

965
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:40,333
<i>Then again,
who else would it be?</i>

966
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:47,240
<i>The unfinished business.</i>

967
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,314
<i>They've compared stories</i>

968
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:55,882
<i>revived the past.</i>

969
01:35:55,884 --> 01:35:56,950
<i>Jesus.</i>

970
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:01,221
<i>He's told her everything by now.</i>

971
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:07,794
<i>At last, the great fraud
has been exposed.</i>

972
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:37,323
<i>You do understand that this was
the music of our courtship.</i>

973
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:47,267
<i>If he's the one
you think you want, my love..</i>

974
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:52,105
<i>It seems only fair to give
you the choice this time.</i>

975
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:59,212
<i>Forgive me
if I don't stand and watch..</i>

976
01:36:59,214 --> 01:37:02,048
<i>As another man lays claim
to your affections.</i>

977
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,618
What happened to the burberry
coat that... that was here?

978
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,254
It was sold yesterday.

979
01:37:41,256 --> 01:37:42,488
Sorry.

980
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:00,874
- There.
- Thank you.

981
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,671
<i>It seems remarkable that I
still know how to drive.</i>

982
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:51,351
<i>Strange to be subject
to rules again.</i>

983
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:13,740
<i>You forget god awfulness.</i>

984
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:18,578
<i>Buildings stacked up like that.</i>

985
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,584
<i>People in endless replication.</i>

986
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:33,259
<i>It's impossible to imagine
I worked here once.</i>

987
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:35,261
<i>That I could
ever work here again.</i>

988
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,232
<i>One thing at a time, Howard.</i>

989
01:40:39,234 --> 01:40:41,067
<i>Construct it.</i>

990
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:43,803
<i>First the thrift store,
then the haircut.</i>

991
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,575
<i>And now I can pass
through this door.</i>

992
01:40:57,684 --> 01:41:00,586
<i>First that and now this.</i>

993
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,791
Karaoke.

994
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,340
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

995
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:52,959
I'm home.
