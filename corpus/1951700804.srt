- Omerta -

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Well, I'm just a smalltown cop,
Mostly I give out parking tickets.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
<i>I don't wanna talk about your work.</i>

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,900
Ok... How are things in L.A.?

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>Jesse...</i>

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,700
- Why'd you call me
at the office, Jenn?

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>I don't want you to call me tonight.</i>

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
Ok.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,600
<i>Actually, I don't think
we should talk for a while.</i>

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,500
How long, a while?

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>I don't know.</i>

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,600
Ok.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,700
<i>So, now it's coming over.</i>

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>He thinks it's strange
that we still talk every night.</i>

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
Was he there last night?

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
<i>Yes.</i>

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
Ok.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>Do you understand?</i>

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,400
No.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,200
<i>Are you alright?</i>

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,100
Yeah...

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,200
<i>Jesse... Thank you.</i>

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
Things get this slow
when Lou was Chief?

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
All the time. How's your wife?

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
Ex-wife, Rose.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,600
- The Rabid skunk has benn dispatched.
- How?

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
D'Angelo shot him.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,900
- Ok.
- D'Angelo was not happy...

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,500
- What did he say?
- He said "Why it is always my fault?"

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Hey, I didn't say it was his fault,
I just said I was blaming him for it.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,700
He thinks you pick on him.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, I don't like him.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
If you don't like him,
why don't you fire him?

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm not gonna fire him,
I'm gonna wear him down.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,600
Wednesday is your town council meeting.
Oh, I'm gonna be late tommorrow...

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to take Brian to the orthodontist.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
And Edwin says the Civil War
Memorial was falling down.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,400
He's watering too much.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,300
Well, he wants the square to
look good for the Fall Regatta.

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,600
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,100
- What did he say?
- He wants to know, how you know?

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm the police chief, I know everything.

43
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
They said it might be vandalism.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,400
Tell them he's watering to much.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,800
- Brahms.
- Excuse me?

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm Hilda Evans, Chief Stone.

47
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,300
How's the drinking thing going?

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,700
Small town. Ever since people heard
that you were drunk on your job interview...

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,400
...there's been concern.

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Actually I drank too much the night before.
I just made the mistake...

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
...of having one in the
morning to steady up.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,400
Brahms. When I'm feeling troubled,
I sit in my favourite chair...

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,100
...put my head back, and listen to Brahms.

54
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,600
I find it comforting. Enough said.

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Wake up!

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,500
I know you can hear me.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Doctor says your wound's
completely healed.

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,500
Believe it or not,
Melbourne, Australia.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
A man left comatose for over
ten years, suddenly sat bolt...

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,900
...upright and said
"I'll have a cappuccino."

61
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,300
Well, everything happens
at once, Suitcase.

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,400
Things are really jumping in Paradise.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Rampant crime.

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,600
I just heard at
the weekly briefing...

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,000
... that there's a drug ring
trying to set up in our town.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
I could use a little backup!

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,300
Suit, we're four people police force.
With Molly out, I got to retrain Rose...

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
The town council wants me to replace you.

69
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,700
"It was bitter cold"

70
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,300
"The wind in his face made it difficult
to grasp the shape before him. "

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
"The bow of the yacht cut through
the sea, needly cleaving the water... "

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,500
"... into mirror image waves. "

73
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,800
"Now he saw the ship
with in its full glory..."

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,000
"...80 feet at least,
mahogany hull in full sail, dark and silent. "

75
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,000
"A latter day Flying Dutchman. "

76
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,600
ROBERT B. PARKER'S
JESSE STONE

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,100
SEA CHANGE

78
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,100
Nice car.

79
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Are you giving me a ticket?

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
- It depends.
- On what?

81
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,600
If this is your car...

82
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,800
You don't hink I can own a car like this?

83
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,900
- I didn't say that.
- It's not mine.

84
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Then I'm not giving you a ticket.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,700
Look, the owner's
just been in a week...

86
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,600
- ...He came up for Race Week.
- Race Week.

87
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Race Week is good for local business, right?

88
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,800
- It is.
- Ok, why give him the ticket?

89
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
The curb is red.

90
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,000
What if it were my car?

91
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,900
I'm still give it a ticket,
but with infinitely more regret.

92
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,200
- So, are you feeling regret?
- A little.

93
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,900
Alright, it's not hard to fix that.
Tear it up!

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,100
No.

95
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
You gonna get me
in trouble, don't you.

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,500
No.

97
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,300
And you are feeling regret.

98
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,700
Yes.

99
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't you have anything better to do...

100
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,100
...then spend your time
with writing parking tickets?

101
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
No.

102
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
<i>Hi jesse, it's Jenn.</i>

103
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,600
<i>I guess you are left,
I'll call you at the office.</i>

104
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,900
- Hello?
- It's me.

105
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
What's wrong?

106
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Nothing, I just wanted to see
how you're doing, Molly.

107
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,000
Fine... You?

108
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,600
I woke you up.

109
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
<i>Oh no, you didn't, I'm...</i>

110
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,800
...too uncomfortable to sleep.

111
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,500
What time is it?

112
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,200
9 o'clock in L.A.
How is Jenn?

113
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
Fine.

114
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
You Ok?

115
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,100
<i>Yes.</i>

116
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,300
Would you tell me, if you're worrying?

117
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,600
No.

118
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,500
<i>There's a lot of people
care about you, Jesse.</i>

119
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
Including you?

120
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Especially me.

121
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
So you think you gonna
have the kid early?

122
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Hopefully not too early.

123
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,300
How's Rose doing?

124
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,100
She's a little rusty,
but she's doing fine.

125
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,700
Did you see Suitcase today?

126
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
<i>Every day.</i>

127
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,700
Did you give him my love?

128
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,200
I forgot.

129
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh, did you have the test?

130
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, the baby's fine.
I'm what's termed the "high risk" mother.

131
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Means "old".

132
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,300
Jesse, I need to get some sleep.

133
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,700
- I woke you up.
- Will you call me tomorrow?

134
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,400
Ugh, sure.

135
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,100
- So, nobody called?
- I don't do phones.

136
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
- You go now?
- Aham, in a while.

137
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,300
'Cause we're almost
out of coffee.

138
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,700
I think you should get some.

139
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,000
Alright, I'll buy it.

140
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,700
- Ugh, Skipper, I...
- Not today, D'Angelo.

141
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,400
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,800
You can't come every couple of months,
and expect to get anything done.

143
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,500
I've been busy.
Fighting crime.

144
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,200
- It's small town, What do you wait?
- What I've come to expect.

145
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,300
You take a job you're overqualified for.

146
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,300
You're good at what you do, so you
stir the pot up comes a couple of rats

147
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,400
but for all intents and purposes,
nothing happens here.

148
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,100
You know what I'm
talking about, you're a cop.

149
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,800
- Yeah, but I quit.
- Because it made you drink?

150
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,100
I think that's called "projection".

151
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,200
- So... You called me.
- In a moment of weakness.

152
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,700
Is that happened last night?
A moment of weakness?

153
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,300
No.

154
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,100
- Did you talk to you ex-wife?
- You think that's what makes me drink.

155
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,000
- Do you drink when you work?
- No.

156
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,600
- So then you drink when you get home.
- I have two drinks.

157
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,700
- Did you had two drinks last night?
- No.

158
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,500
- And did you talk to your ex-wife?
- I talk to her every night.

159
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,200
- And did you speak with her last night?
- Are you sensing a breakthrough?

160
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,600
Do you drink, when you're
involved in a serious crime?

161
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
- No.
- Because?

162
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,700
- It would be unprofessional.
- So you stop.

163
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,300
- Yes.
- As long as you need to.

164
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,800
- Yes.
- And how long do you need to?

165
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,000
- It depends.
- On what?

166
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
On how long I need to.

167
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,400
If you've got nothing to do,
pal, find something to do.

168
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,800
If it's not important,
make it important.

169
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,100
Rose, where do we keep
the unsolved cases?

170
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,700
You mean where do "I" keep
the unsolved cases?

171
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,400
- What kind of cases?
- I want a homicide.

172
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,200
There's three. 1905, 1923, and 1992.

173
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
- You know?
- Yes...

174
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,200
- How do you know?
- I'm the dispatcher, I know everything.

175
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,400
Molly rearranged my files,
I rearrenged them back.

176
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
1992.

177
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,000
- You said you wanted to get in the field.
- Not in this field...

178
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
- And you're sure you can find it.
- I'm sure...

179
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,100
No other customers, just, uh, the bank guard...

180
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,600
...Hasty Hathaway, and the bankteller.

181
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,200
A robber takes the teller hostage,
uses her as a shield.

182
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
The bank guard gets off
an errant shot...

183
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
... as he's dragging her out
the door. Then they disappear.

184
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
You know, in six months,
none of this is gonna be here,

185
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,700
some guy bought up the whole point,
gonna put up forty houses...

186
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,200
- Yeah, rich people from Boston...
- Do me a favor...

187
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Tell the town council not to
reassess and raise my taxes

188
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
A tenuous relationship at best.

189
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Ever since our friend Hasty resigned.
They don't seem to understand...

190
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
...why I was hired to begin with...

191
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,200
but I will tell them just the same.

192
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Anyway, two years later some hunters find
the teller's body in her shallow grave.

193
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,900
- Why are you so sure you can find it?
- It would be hard to forget.

194
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Because?

195
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I threw up all over the body,
first time I saw her.

196
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Well, that would be a reason.

197
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,500
I'll have a cappucino.

198
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,100
I threw up the first time
I found a body.

199
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,900
That's comforting.

200
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,600
And that's when Lou pulled you out of field?

201
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah, well, he promoted me to dispatcher...

202
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,700
- And this is the spot.
- Yeah.

203
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
How you know?

204
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,500
This is the rock I sat on after I threw up.

205
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,600
- This about the right depth?
- Yeah.

206
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
Oh my God! The grave is empty!

207
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,600
Maybe that's because the body
was removed thirteen years ago.

208
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
Jesse, what are we doing?

209
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,200
We're waiting for a clue to pop up.

210
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,200
We had this coroner in L.A.,
with that asian guy

211
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,500
he recovered this body in her shallow grave,
just kept saying "Dig deeper! Dig deeper!"

212
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,900
Because he was asian?

213
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
No. Because he was stubborn.

214
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,600
And anytime some would ask "why",
like you keep doing...

215
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,100
...he'd say "because I'm a
stubborn asian guy".

216
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
Why?

217
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,400
That's not the point.
The point is...

218
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
...he dug up the murder weapon.

219
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,300
That was sloppy police work, Lou.

220
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Thank you.

221
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
- She's afraid of me.
- Oh, she'll be okay.

222
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,700
- Can I talk to her?
- She won't talk to you, Luther.

223
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,100
- Because?
- Because she's afraid of you.

224
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
- D'Angelo!
- So Luther, do you remember anything?

225
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,300
I remember cookies.

226
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,700
And I remember juice.
Cranberry juice.

227
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,000
You were shot at the market, Luther.

228
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh.

229
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,600
Anything new on the drug case, Lou?

230
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Excuse me?

231
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,900
Anything new on the drug case?

232
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,000
Not really.

233
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,300
And no blood at the scene.

234
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,300
Apparently not.
There is nothin in the report...

235
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,800
No, a lot of things are in the report.
I know you're fond of your old boss...

236
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,000
...but that report is a mess.
And what was the robber wearing?

237
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,400
Jesse, I know these are
the robber's clothes.

238
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,900
He didn't need the hostage anymore...

239
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,700
...so he shot the teller, buried in a
shallow grave, changed his own clothes...

240
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
...buried them, so he
wouldn't be recognized.

241
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Well, actually he buried his clothes,
and then he buried the teller...

242
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
...doesn't it seem backwards to you?

243
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,400
- I guess it could be...
- Lou should've found these.

244
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,300
- He found the body, that's pretty big.
- Actually some hunter's found the body.

245
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,600
And what d'you suppose
made these holes?

246
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,000
- Ugh, fifteen years underground?
- Organic matter.

247
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
How was the body ID-d?

248
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,200
- Her mother.
- Not even dental records?

249
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,300
"Mary Lewis came in, looked to the
body, and said 'that's my little girl' ".

250
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,000
Excuse me.

251
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,600
- I'm Chief Stone.
- My name's Sam Holton.

252
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,200
My daughter Cathleen.

253
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Why don't we go on into my office.
Officer Gammon.

254
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,000
We'd just passed Paradise Cove
when it happened.

255
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
On one of those yachts
come up for Raceweek.

256
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
What happened?

257
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
I was raped.

258
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,900
- Do you know who did it?
- The owner of the boat.

259
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,700
- Do you know the name of the boat?
- The "Lady Jane".

260
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,200
- Could you pick the owner out of a lineup?
- Yeah.

261
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,200
Good. Officer Gammon will take the rest
of your report and then we'll look into it.

262
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,500
Now if you excuse me...

263
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,700
- Have you talked to your wife?
- Ex-wife.

264
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,200
I'll take that as a "no".
I thought you spoke to her every night.

265
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,000
- Not lately.
- Why not?

266
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,600
- She's seeing someone.
- At night?

267
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
- Yes.
- At your house?

268
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,400
- Oh, yeah.
- How do you feel about that?

269
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,300
Like I wanna kill him.

270
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,900
Do you imagine her
with him, having sex?

271
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,500
Yes.

272
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
- Does she tell you about it?
- No.

273
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,800
- So, in fact, you don't know
what she's doing.

274
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't know anything...

275
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,400
So you invent it.

276
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,900
How long have you been
inventing her life?

277
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,300
- I'll take that as an "always".
- Not always.

278
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,200
- Since the divorce?
- You're pretty good at this.

279
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,700
How many year's it to
take to be a psychiatrist?

280
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,800
- Ten.
- You got to go at medical school first.

281
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,000
- I'd have a question for you.
- A medical question?

282
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:43,300
- A medical slash-cop question.
- Is this important?

283
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,600
I hope so.

284
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,700
What's the question?

285
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Bugs go after organic
matter first, right?

286
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,400
What kind of bugs?
What kind of organic matter?

287
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,400
I have these clothes, and they've
been buried for about fifteen years...

288
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,800
...and pretty deteriorated, but there
are two big holes - one on the shirt...

289
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,100
...one on the jacket, and they
line up, with, I think it might be, blood.

290
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,200
You know what I think?
I think you won't be drinking tonight.

291
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Who are you lookin' at?

292
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,500
<i>Hi, jesse. It's Jenn. I guess you
already left. I'll call you at the office.</i>

293
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:09,600
<i>Hi, jesse. It's Jenn. I guess you
already left. I'll call you at the office..</i>

294
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,500
- So where is Stone?
- Town Council.

295
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,400
- You interviewed the raped victim?
- Basically.

296
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,800
- Don't you think he should've
been there? I mean...

297
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,100
He's always the first one to work.
But he wasn't the other day.

298
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,300
- That's correct.
- Why do you think that is?

299
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
- You know what I think?
- Tony.

300
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,500
I don't really care what you think.

301
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,300
The rabid skunk is no longer a threat,
Officer D'Angelo expressed his regrets.

302
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,800
Uh, sixty-three parking tickets,
fourteen traffic stops...

303
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,700
...and Edwin claims the Civil War
Memorial has been vandalized.

304
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,400
You don't think it has been?

305
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Maybe you could tell him
he's watering too much.

306
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,600
- What about this rape case?
- What about it?

307
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,400
- Anyone arrested?
- No.

308
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,600
- Good...
- Rape out of season?

309
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
All our merchants need Raceweek,
I don't need a scandal.

310
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
I know that.

311
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,400
The Fall Regatta brings in
a lot of revenue.

312
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
Including your paycheck.

313
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,900
- So how have you been?
- Fine.

314
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,800
- No problems.
- No.

315
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No... personal issues?

316
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,200
Anything we need to know about?

317
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,100
Yes, my deputy doesn't want you to
reassess her house and raise her taxes.

318
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,800
What are you looking at?

319
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,600
I was admiring the rigging
on the "Lady Jane".

320
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,000
What d'you use for bait?

321
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,400
Bugs, worms, last night supper.

322
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,800
- Catch much?
- Don't catch spit.

323
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
- Plenty of fish, though.
- Yep.

324
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,400
- Maybe you should just shoot 'em.
- The fish or the bank robber?

325
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,300
You a good shot, Bob?

326
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,700
I was certified

327
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,600
expert with a pistol
in the Army.

328
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,500
Which war?

329
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,200
Korea.

330
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,100
You a good shot now?

331
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
I don't know.

332
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
How old are you, Bob?

333
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,500
76.

334
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,600
You a good shot
when you were 61?

335
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
I thought I was.

336
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,300
You had to be qualified
to be a bank guard.

337
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,600
Have you ever been in a hostage
situation, Chief Stone?

338
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Yes.

339
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,600
Did you take the shot?

340
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

341
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,400
So did I.

342
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,300
I reached for my backup,
and I went to the door.

343
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,600
I saw him in
my front sight.

344
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,700
I figured he'd kill Rebecca
when he didn't need her.

345
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,600
Well, you figured right, Bob.

346
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,600
What caliber bullet
killed Rebecca?

347
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,300
.38.

348
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,700
That's what I was shooting.

349
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,200
You don't think that I...

350
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,000
No. And I don't
think you should.

351
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,600
Why is that?

352
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,300
Not healthy.
It will drive you to drink.

353
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,300
Already did.

354
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,400
Six years sober come December.

355
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,200
And when did this happen?

356
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,000
Four days ago.

357
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,600
Cathleen, we have
no evidence of that.

358
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,000
So you think I was lying?

359
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,500
It doesn't mean you' re lying.

360
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,200
It just means
there was no sperm.

361
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,200
He was wearing
a rubber.

362
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,600
I thought it was be best
if Cathleen

363
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,200
and I discussed this.

364
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
The rape test was inconclusive.

365
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Why don't you tell us the part
you didn't want your dad

366
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,600
to hear, Cathleen?

367
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,100
They made me do a striptease.

368
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,400
Were you drinking?

369
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,600
Yes. They said
I had to do a striptease

370
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
or they wouldn't
take me back to shore.

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,400
Who is they?

372
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,300
The guy that raped me
and two other guys.

373
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
They said
I had to strip.

374
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
So you' re saying
they forced you?

375
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,700
Yes. And then the guy who owned
the boat took me downstairs.

376
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,000
I thought, you know, so
I could get dressed again,

377
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,500
but he just threw me on the bed
and raped me.

378
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,500
He was like an animal.

379
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,200
Just threw me down
and jumped on me.

380
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,900
But he wore a condom.

381
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes.

382
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,300
Did he put that on just before
he jumped on you like an animal?

383
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Yeah. Just before.

384
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,900
Was it in a packet?

385
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,500
Yes.

386
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,100
Did he have to open the packet?

387
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,500
I don't remember.

388
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,000
You think she's lying?
You don't think she was raped?

389
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,300
I didn't say that.
Well, I think

390
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,500
we can get a warrant.
Sure, we can get a warrant,

391
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,700
but I don't want to.

392
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,700
Since when
do you care

393
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,700
what the Town
Council thinks?

394
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I don't.
But I do care about Paradise.

395
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,000
You prosecute a rape case
in a resort town,

396
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
all the cable news channels

397
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,100
will live here.

398
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,700
And no rape shield law
will protect that kid.

399
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,300
Legally, she's not a kid.

400
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,900
I think it's blood
on his clothes.

401
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,800
Excuse me?

402
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,400
I want to test
the robber's clothes for blood.

403
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,000
So, after he
shot the teller,

404
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,100
he dragged the body
to the grave

405
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,400
and got blood on
his clothes. So what?

406
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,600
So what? How much money
was taken in the robbery?

407
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Just the cash
that was in the bank: $24,000.

408
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,900
Hardly worth a life.

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,900
Jesse, what's the point?

410
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,100
The point is, this isn't
just a robbery, Officer Gammon.

411
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,300
It's a murder.

412
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,200
And the guy got away with it.

413
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
This report doesn't even
say whether she was shot

414
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,900
from the front or the back.

415
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,700
No, it doesn't.

416
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
And I'm not happy
with the ID of the body.

417
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,300
You don't want to run a DNA test.
I do.

418
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,000
You don't think a mother could
recognize her own daughter?!

419
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Not after two years underground.

420
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
She recognized the clothes.

421
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,700
And where are they?

422
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,700
Lieu returned

423
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
the effects
to the family.

424
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
Jesse, this stuff
isn't important!

425
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,200
I think it is.
Why?

426
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,900
Because I need it to be!

427
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,700
What was the mother's
last known whereabouts?

428
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,500
Sisters of Mercy
Hospital, up north.

429
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,000
Jesse...

430
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
I think DeAngelo went
to the Town Council.

431
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,000
I would expect no less of him.

432
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
They' re laying for you.

433
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,000
The ugly truth of it, Rose,

434
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,600
is it doesn't matter
a whole hell of a lot to me.

435
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,300
Jesse, you need to concentrate
on the rape case.

436
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,800
I know.

437
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
You' re right.

438
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,700
Thank you.

439
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,000
Yes?

440
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm Jesse Stone,
the police chief in Paradise.

441
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,700
You' re a long way from home.

442
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
I was looking for Mary Lewis.

443
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,300
Oh, my mom's resting.

444
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,200
You look like your sister.

445
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
Is this is about Rebecca?

446
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,200
Yes.

447
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,500
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

448
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm Leeann Lewis. Come in.

449
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,100
Thank you.

450
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,400
You can speak to her,
but she won't speak back.

451
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,100
My mom had a stroke.

452
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
Mama, this is...

453
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,100
Jesse Stone,
Mrs. Lewis.

454
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
I was just visiting

455
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,400
with Leeann.

456
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Would you like some coffee?

457
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,100
I would.

458
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,600
Nice meeting you,
Mrs. Lewis.

459
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,100
When did your mom
have the stroke?

460
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,500
The day after she
identified Rebecca.

461
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
Thank you for
not upsetting her.

462
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,700
I assume you have
power of attorney.

463
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
I thought this
case was closed.

464
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,600
No. Just cold.

465
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,100
What do you want, Chief Stone?

466
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,900
Probably what you want.

467
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
Justice for your sister.

468
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,000
I'd like permissión
to exhume

469
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,000
the body.

470
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,300
My sister was cremated.

471
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,400
Okay.

472
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,000
This is old.

473
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,700
I'm going to get
you a new pot.

474
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,300
Did you see your
sister's body?

475
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,100
No. Maybe my mother
wouldn't have had her stroke

476
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,800
if I had been here.

477
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,000
I wouldn't beat yourself up.

478
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,700
You've obviously devoted
yourself to her.

479
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,600
I left my job in L.A.,

480
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,600
and I got her out
of that hospital,

481
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,600
and we've been here ever since.

482
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,400
Long way from Paradise.

483
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,800
Too many memories.

484
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,400
Do you have any

485
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,600
personal effects of
your sister? Pictures?

486
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,400
Why?

487
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Well, it's just
the way I work.

488
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,400
Gives me a sense
of the person.

489
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,600
Frankly, there's
not much in our files.

490
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,700
We really don't want to open old
wounds unless there's a reason.

491
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, I think there's a reason.

492
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,700
Well, I got rid of all that
stuff after the funeral.

493
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,700
It upset your mom?
Yeah.

494
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,500
Frankly, it upset me, too.

495
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,700
I'm sorry.

496
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,500
This is going
to take a while.

497
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,500
Do you still want coffee,
Chief Stone?

498
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,600
Jesse.

499
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,400
Jesse.

500
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,400
Coffee would be good.

501
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
It's a long way back.

502
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,500
Jesse?

503
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,200
Would you like
to eat at the bar?

504
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,200
Sure, Laura.

505
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,900
Okay.

506
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
I thought I'd stop by,

507
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
see if you need any help
fighting crime.

508
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,800
What's happening at home
that you'd rather be here?

509
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,800
Nothing.

510
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,000
Not nothing.

511
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,500
My wife's younger brother
is visiting with his wife.

512
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,500
They have young children.

513
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
You don't care
for young children?

514
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,800
Neither of us do.

515
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,600
But it's her brother.

516
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,400
So your dropping by is not
all about helping me.

517
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,200
It's nothing about that.

518
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,600
Are you staying for dinner?

519
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,300
Can I tell my wife
it's business?

520
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,700
You can if you crank up
your lab for me.

521
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,900
There's something
I want you to check.

522
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,900
Can't Doc Perkins do it?

523
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,200
I don't want to destroy
his confidence.

524
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Yeah, but State Homicide
operates on a budget.

525
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,000
This stuff costs money.

526
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Is it important?

527
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
I have no idea.

528
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,900
Will you call
my wife for me?

529
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,700
Okay.

530
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,700
Then I'll crank up the lab.

531
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,600
You know, marriage
is hard for cops.

532
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,300
And the only people
we know how to talk to

533
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,100
are the women we marry.

534
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,000
Then the marriage breaks up,

535
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,500
and you need to talk to someone,

536
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,600
and only one you can't talk to

537
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,600
is the woman you married.

538
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,700
When did Molly call you?

539
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,400
The morning
after you woke her up.

540
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,500
Oh, Captain Healy will be
joining me for dinner, Laura.

541
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,300
What can I get for you?

542
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,000
Scotch on the rocks...

543
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,200
and another for the Chief.

544
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm good, Laura.

545
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Have you talked
to the son of a bitch?

546
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,900
No.

547
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,600
But I will be talking
to the son of a bitch.

548
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,600
Why'd Cathleen drop out

549
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,600
of high school
before her senior year?

550
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,700
What's that have to do
with her being raped?

551
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
I don't know.

552
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,600
I tried, but
she just wouldn't go.

553
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,600
And I couldn't make her.

554
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,900
I work all day.

555
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Her mom is...

556
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,000
Gone.

557
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,600
Took off with a guy
when Cathleen was just six...

558
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,200
Look...

559
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm sorry, Chief Stone.

560
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,900
This whole thing's
just got me...

561
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,600
Pissed off?

562
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,000
She came home very late.

563
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,300
I confronted her.

564
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,400
She got real upset,
and then it all just came out.

565
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,800
Well, two things
you need to know.

566
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,900
One is, I'm going to talk
to the son of a bitch.

567
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
And two, you' re going to stay
away from the son of a bitch.

568
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,400
Because?

569
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,100
Because I'm the police chief.

570
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,100
What were you thinking?

571
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,200
Jesse!

572
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,100
Boy, I do not get
many visitors.

573
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
So how you doing, Hasty?

574
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,100
Don't say "How you doing?"
to a convict.

575
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,800
Okay, how's it going?

576
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,100
Well, I teach
illiterate prisoners to read.

577
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,200
I give financial advice
to the guards.

578
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,100
How's the drinking thing?

579
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,300
Better since I gave up hope.

580
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,000
How's my wife?

581
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,300
Ex-wife, Hasty.

582
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,700
How's she doing?
Cissy?

583
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,700
Is... Cissy.

584
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,000
But she's okay?

585
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,400
Yes.

586
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,400
Jesse, you and Cissy...

587
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,200
You never...

588
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,800
No. We never.

589
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,500
So, no hard feelings?

590
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,500
Hey, a guy saves your life.

591
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,900
Albeit for the wrong reasons...

592
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,700
What are you doing here?

593
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,700
Your bank was robbed in 1992.

594
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,100
Teller was killed.

595
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,700
Yeah, Rebecca. Nice kid.

596
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,700
What do you remember about it?

597
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,200
Nothing.

598
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,900
Hasty, you can't be
put away twice

599
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,900
for money laundering.

600
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I know that.
So?

601
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,000
So I just didn't see anything.
Because?

602
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,900
Because I was hiding
under my desk the whole time.

603
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,000
There were no surveillance
cameras in your bank.

604
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,600
Small town.

605
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,400
Were you laundering money
for Gino Fish back then?

606
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,400
No.

607
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,000
No, on my sacred honor, no.

608
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,100
You know, Hasty, when I
said you saved my life,

609
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,400
I wasn't talking about the night
I arrested you.

610
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,100
I meant you saved my life
because you hired me.

611
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,800
Albeit for the wrong reasons.

612
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,100
I'm very fond of you, Jesse.

613
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,300
See you, Hasty.

614
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,100
Suit.

615
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,100
Jesse!

616
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,000
Where have you
been, Skipper?

617
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,800
Fighting crime.

618
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,200
Rose at the
orthodontist again?

619
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,400
Yes.

620
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,600
How you feeling?

621
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,300
Perfect.

622
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,300
You lost a little weight.

623
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm not much good

624
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,100
with the phones.

625
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,900
You supposed to be here?

626
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,100
They let me out of the hospital.

627
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,700
They say it was okay for you
to go back to work?

628
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,500
I didn't ask.

629
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,500
Well, I need you
to answer the phones

630
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,900
for now, Suitcase.

631
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,100
How do you feel about that?

632
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,700
I don't like it.

633
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,400
I feel fine, Lieu.

634
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,900
Okay.

635
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,200
Boy, that thing's a mess.

636
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,400
Tell me about it.

637
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,300
The folder's torn.
The pictures are dirty.

638
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
The papers are all wrinkled...

639
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,200
Well, I threw it
across the room.

640
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
Why'd you do that?

641
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
Because it's a mess.

642
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,900
I think DeAngelo wants your job.

643
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,300
I feel it in my cells.

644
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,600
Well, actually, he thinks

645
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,600
he should have had the job
to begin with.

646
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,000
I'd like to help you
with your drug case.

647
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,800
Suit, do you remember anything
about your stay at the hospital?

648
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:32,900
No.

649
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,200
Okay...

650
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,900
What did you think
about the bank robbery?

651
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,100
I think you' re on to something.

652
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,600
Rose doesn't think so.

653
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,500
Rose hasn't been in the field.

654
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,000
Well, she threw up.

655
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Was she sick?

656
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,100
It's not important.

657
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,900
You know, I think
we should check for blood

658
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,400
on those clothes
you found.

659
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,800
You know, there might be
an upside to this coma thing.

660
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,500
What are you talking about?

661
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,000
You know what I'm talking about.

662
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,200
You mean...

663
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,200
Yes.

664
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
Cop intuition.

665
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,900
Now you' re as crazy as I am.

666
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,900
Watch your step.

667
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,100
Well... Inspector Yokel.

668
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,800
Actually it's Chief Yokel.

669
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,800
Where's your badge?

670
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,300
It's in a drawer.

671
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,600
Ah...

672
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,900
This your boat?

673
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,900
Why, you don't think I could
afford a boat like this?

674
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,600
The Lady Jane's mine.

675
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,500
I'm Chief Stone.

676
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,500
This is Officer Gammon.
I'm Harrison.

677
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,400
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Harrison.

678
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,000
Harrison is my first name.

679
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,300
I'm Harrison Pendleton.

680
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,000
I see.

681
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,900
Nice boat.

682
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,300
Schooner.

683
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Officer Gammon would like
to ask you a few questions.

684
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,600
Do you know a Cathleen Holton?

685
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,100
I do.

686
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Was she a guest
on your schooner?

687
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,100
Yes.
When?

688
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,000
Four days ago.

689
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,900
She joined some friends and me
for an evening cruise.

690
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,900
Do you know how old she is?!

691
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,200
Yes. 18 years and two months.

692
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,000
She showed me her ID.

693
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,400
I was wondering
if you could show me below.

694
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,200
Do you have a warrant?

695
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,100
No.

696
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,700
Well, then, no.

697
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,900
Guy's got two last names.

698
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,300
You might have briefed me
that I was going

699
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,500
to question the suspect.

700
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,400
Well, I'm not sure
he's a suspect.

701
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,300
But I thought
you handled it well...

702
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,200
till you got pissed off.

703
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,000
Jesse, why don't you get
a cell phone?

704
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,500
' Cause I don't like them.

705
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
You can always page me.

706
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,100
I have.
Well...

707
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,900
call me
on the car radio.

708
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,400
I have.

709
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,600
You've been spending
a lot of time

710
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,100
away from the office.

711
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,900
I have.

712
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,900
At home?

713
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,300
No.

714
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,500
Good.

715
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,900
So, I assume
you've talked

716
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,400
to the bank guard.

717
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,800
I did.

718
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,900
Have you talked to the mother?

719
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,400
Actually, I didn't.

720
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,800
What are you doing?

721
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,800
Run that plate.

722
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,100
License and
registration, please.

723
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,000
Did I do something
wrong, Officer?

724
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,700
You have no front
license plate,

725
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,300
Mr. Genest.

726
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,700
I knew someone named Genest.

727
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,600
Joe Genest?

728
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,900
He your brother?

729
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,400
He was my brother.

730
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,900
I tell you what.

731
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,600
I'm going to let you off
on the license plate.

732
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,800
Just put one on.

733
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,300
Thank you, Officer.

734
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,000
One more thing.

735
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,100
Don't follow me around, Terry.

736
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
wouldn't have
surveillance cameras

737
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,500
in my bank if I were
laundering money.

738
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,800
Well, neither would I,
if I was laundering money.

739
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,700
When did you call Gino Fish?

740
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,900
What?

741
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,900
When did you call Gino Fish?

742
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,900
I didn't...

743
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
Right after you left.

744
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,700
You know, Jesse...

745
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,000
I know, you' re very fond of me.

746
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,600
How much money was
really in the bank?

747
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,300
$24,000.

748
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,000
A lot.

749
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,000
$2 million.

750
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,000
You think the robber knew?

751
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,900
Well, not if I was
doing my job right.

752
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
How did you know?

753
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,500
Gino had some guy
following me around.

754
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,500
Turned out to be
Joe Genest's brother.

755
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,000
Terence Genest?

756
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,200
But do you think he
knows I killed Joe?

757
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,600
Hasty, everybody knows
you killed Joe.

758
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,100
It's just that
this is a really bad guy.

759
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,900
I would assume so.

760
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,400
Th-This is the kind of guy
that would hold a grudge.

761
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,100
I would assume so,

762
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
especially since
you weren't prosecuted for it.

763
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,400
In defense of
a police officer's life.

764
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,800
Well, I'm not sure Mr. Genest

765
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,800
makes those kind
of distinctions.

766
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,700
I'm not sure he makes
distinctions, period.

767
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,000
Now, Jesse, you know,

768
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,600
you might need
to be a little careful.

769
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,600
JESSE:
Excuse me.

770
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Your boss in?

771
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,400
Do you have an appointment?

772
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,100
I'm with the police.

773
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,300
Can I see your badge?

774
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,100
No.

775
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,300
What police department's that?

776
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,200
Paradise.

777
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,400
Paradise?

778
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,700
Is your interest personal

779
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,900
or professional?

780
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,900
I'll talk with the boss.

781
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,100
Mr. Fish never sees anyone
without an appointment.

782
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,500
And your name is?

783
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:38,900
Alan.

784
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,200
Alan.

785
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,500
Well, we can
do this easy,

786
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,500
or we can do
this hard, Alan.

787
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,200
Easy is

788
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,100
I go in, sit down
and chat with your boss.

789
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,700
Hard is I call Captain Healy,
the state homicide commander,

790
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,800
and bring your boss in
for questioning.

791
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,500
I'll talk to Mr. Fish.

792
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,900
Jesse Stone.

793
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
I know who you are.

794
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,500
As I recall,
you thought I should be arrested

795
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,500
during the Hasty Hathaway trial.

796
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,700
That would be me.

797
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,900
Have you spoken
to Hasty lately?

798
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,600
I've never spoken
to Mr. Hathaway.

799
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,900
I have some questions about an
employee of yours, Terry Genest.

800
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,800
I have no such employee.

801
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,700
You employed his
brother, Joe.

802
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,200
That was never proven.

803
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,200
You lost a lot of money

804
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,200
in a bank robbery
in Paradise in 1992.

805
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,000
I've never been
a depositor in Paradise.

806
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,800
This isn't going
very well, is it?

807
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,800
Here's what I think.

808
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:53,800
Think?

809
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,700
Know but can't prove.

810
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,700
I think Hasty Hathaway

811
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,700
was laundering
a lot of money for you.

812
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,600
I think it was stolen in
the robbery, and you'd like

813
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,400
to get what's left of it back,

814
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,100
so you hired
Joe Genest's brother

815
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,100
because you knew
he had a deep,

816
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,500
personal interest.

817
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,300
That is quite a story.

818
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,600
I think it is.

819
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,600
I think I'll wait
to see the movie.

820
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,600
Nice to meet you, Jesse Stone.

821
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,100
Chief Yokel,
I came to say good-bye.

822
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,600
Was it something I said?

823
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:56,900
No.

824
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,300
It was something Harrison did.

825
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,000
You mind if I smoke?

826
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,700
No.

827
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,300
Is this legal?

828
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,600
No.
You gonna

829
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,400
search me,
cuff me and then arrest me?

830
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,000
Are you carrying

831
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,200
your gun?

832
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,200
Always armed and ready.

833
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,600
My name's Sybil Martin.

834
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,000
Jesse Stone.

835
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,800
I know.

836
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,900
You married, Jesse?

837
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,100
Sort of.

838
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,300
"Sort of."
Divorced.

839
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Every place but in my mind.

840
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,400
I came to help you.

841
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,700
With my relationship or my case?

842
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,900
Both. Are you wondering
what help I'm going to bring?

843
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,200
Breathlessly.

844
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,400
Listen...

845
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,500
I only met Harrison
a couple days ago.

846
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,100
He tapes himself having sex.

847
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,500
Did he tape you
having sex with him?

848
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:55,800
Yeah.

849
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,600
Were you aware he was taping you
having sex with him?

850
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,100
Yes.

851
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,700
But when I saw
this tape of a kid...

852
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,300
I thought you
should know.

853
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm going back to Boston.

854
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,300
I come to Boston a lot.

855
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,300
Well, let me give you my number.

856
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,200
Boston's not far,
as the crow flies.

857
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,400
I'll have to drive.

858
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,800
SUITCASE:
She likes you, Jesse.

859
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,800
How do you know?

860
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,500
I just know.

861
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,900
So, what about
the bank case, Lieu?

862
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,100
I'm Jesse.

863
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Yeah, I know.
What about the bank case?

864
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,200
I don't have a clue.

865
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,300
I think I'm throwing stuff
against a wall

866
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,300
to see if anything sticks.

867
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,800
Well, isn't that what cops do?

868
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,900
You stirring the pot?

869
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,300
Oh, yeah.

870
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,400
Well, what's come up?

871
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,100
Nothing.
Not nothing.

872
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,800
Nothing.

873
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,000
What do we know
so far, Jesse?

874
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,900
Well, that there wasn't
$24,000 in the bank.

875
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,900
There was...
$2 million.

876
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And it would make a hell
of a lot more sense

877
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,200
for the robber to take
down a small-town bank

878
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,200
if...
If the robber knew.

879
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,900
But the question is...
How would he know?

880
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,200
I wish you wouldn't do that.

881
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,200
Do what?

882
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,900
Finish my sentences.

883
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,800
Sorry, Jesse.

884
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,000
What if the teller
who found out about the money

885
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,800
was in
on the robbery?

886
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,200
Doesn't fit
with the facts.

887
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,200
Yeah, I know,
robber killed the teller.

888
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,000
But what if the guard hit
what he was aiming at?

889
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,700
He obviously
only wounded him.

890
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,500
Maybe we can get Healy

891
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,400
to check
emergency room records

892
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,300
for May of ' 92.

893
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
I mean,
the guy isn't going to say,

894
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,400
"Doc, I just robbed
a bank.

895
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,000
Can, can you fix me up
so I can get away?"

896
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,400
So... accidental
gunshot wounds.

897
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Maybe we can get
a name.

898
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,400
Why don't you call him?

899
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,000
Can I?

900
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,800
You can.

901
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:06,600
Good.

902
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,700
That's good work, Suit.

903
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,300
You' re on to something,
Jesse.

904
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,300
I feel it in my cells.

905
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:19,800
Oh.

906
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,600
You had a phone call.

907
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,500
My sense was
it was personal.

908
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,800
Hello.

909
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,400
Jesse Stone.

910
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,200
Oh, I, I checked in storage

911
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,900
and I couldn't find anything
that might help you.

912
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I'm so sorry.

913
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,100
It's like she didn't exist.

914
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,500
Regrets, Chief Stone.

915
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,800
Jesse.

916
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,100
Jesse...

917
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,300
Listen, um...
I know this is forward, um,

918
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,700
but if you' re ever around here,

919
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,500
I'd love to see you again.

920
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,900
Well, if you' re ever in
Paradise, I'd love to see you.

921
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,800
Ah...

922
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,500
well, um...

923
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,100
I can't get that far away
from my mom, so...

924
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,400
I guess we' re at an impasse.

925
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,800
Not really.

926
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,800
Thanks.

927
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,400
Thanks.

928
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,500
And the woman there said
we should have T-shirts

929
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,500
that say
"I went hunting here"...

930
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It looks like she was having
a pretty good time stripping.

931
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,400
Cathleen is apparently wise
beyond her years

932
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,700
and in my expert
police chief's opinion,

933
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,500
it hardly looks
like she was being raped.

934
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,600
Where did you get these?

935
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,600
I accidentally found them.

936
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,200
Where did you find them?

937
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,500
In a cabinet below decks
on the Lady Jane.

938
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,700
I'd be interested
to know what you think.

939
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,900
Do you think I should
see them, Jesse?

940
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,600
No.

941
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,400
Are you happy in your work?

942
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,800
What do you mean?

943
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,300
Well, there's this
Japanese prison camp commander

944
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,300
in Bridge on the River Kwai

945
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,200
and he just keeps telling these
miserable starving prisoners,

946
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,200
"Be happy
in your work."

947
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,900
You didn't see the movie.

948
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,000
You happy in your work,
Cathleen?

949
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,300
What are you talking about?

950
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,700
The point I was attempting
to make is this is a lousy job.

951
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,300
You need some help with that?

952
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,000
No.

953
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,300
Why'd you drop out
of school, Cathleen?

954
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,100
Why are you here?

955
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,000
You miss your mom?

956
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,400
You've been checking up on me.

957
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,900
I have.

958
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,100
Don't talk to me about things
you don't know anything about.

959
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,000
Actually,
I know something about that.

960
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,800
Your mom run off?

961
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,200
No, she died...
when I was eight.

962
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,300
I miss my mom
a lot.

963
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,600
Moms are important.

964
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,100
Well, you don't miss
someone you never knew.

965
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,600
You know how to do
hospital corners, Chief Stone?

966
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,300
I do.

967
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,600
And call me Jesse now
that you' re 18 and all grown up.

968
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,400
What's that supposed to mean?

969
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,600
It means
you' re not

970
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,800
a kid anymore.

971
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,500
It means you' re fair game.

972
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
I saw the tape.

973
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,200
So?

974
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,400
It didn't look like anybody made
you take off your clothes.

975
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,000
So?

976
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,100
That's no excuse
for what he did.

977
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,800
There's another tape.

978
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,800
Just you
and Mr. Pendleton.

979
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,100
He had a hidden camera
in his bedroom.

980
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
I want you to tell your dad.

981
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,300
Why should I?

982
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:24,900
Because he loves you,

983
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and I don't want to see your dad
do something stupid.

984
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,800
Unintended consequences.

985
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,600
You' re not supposed to be here.

986
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,200
No, I'm not.

987
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,100
You' re not supposed to try and
talk me out of this, are you?

988
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,300
That's correct.

989
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,600
I could get you in trouble.

990
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,300
You could.

991
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,400
You don't think
what he did was wrong?

992
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,800
It was wrong,
but it wasn't illegal.

993
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,800
Yeah, but he's...

994
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:53,700
A grownup?

995
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,500
You know
what I think?

996
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,400
I think you
don't like yourself

997
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,400
so much for what you did.

998
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,300
I think you love your dad

999
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,000
and you know how disappointed
he'd be if he knew the truth,

1000
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,700
but you getting even
with some sick son of a bitch

1001
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,500
isn't going to change
any of that.

1002
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,400
Well, at least,
then he won't do it again.

1003
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,200
Oh, he'll do it again.

1004
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,200
Why?

1005
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,600
Because he can.

1006
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,800
And there's nothing
you or I can do to stop him.

1007
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:19,700
You know...

1008
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,800
you live long enough,
you have regrets.

1009
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,300
And the ones
that nag at you the most

1010
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,900
are the ones where you knew
you had a choice,

1011
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,800
the ones where you knew you
could have stopped yourself,

1012
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,000
the ones where
you looked into the mirror

1013
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,500
and everything good
inside you said,

1014
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,800
"Don't do this."

1015
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,300
You go talk to your dad and I'll
go punch him in the mouth.

1016
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,300
How's that?

1017
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,000
The Paradise Motel.

1018
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,700
I know it well.

1019
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,600
As do I.

1020
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,500
I used to live there.

1021
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,500
You' re not following me around,
are you, Terry?

1022
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,000
I prefer Terence.

1023
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,700
And I prefer you didn't do that.

1024
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,700
Do what?

1025
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,000
Follow me around, Terry.

1026
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,500
Are you trying to provoke me?

1027
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,600
I was going
to ask you the same thing.

1028
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,100
I'm just sitting here
reading the paper.

1029
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,100
Did you get that license plate
fixed, Terry?

1030
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,700
Yes, I did, Officer.

1031
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,700
And since now I have a
violation-free motor vehicle,

1032
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,700
I'll drive it wherever I want.

1033
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,000
I'll obey all traffic
regulations

1034
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,100
so as you can't harass me,

1035
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,800
unless you set me up,

1036
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,400
the way you did my brother
when you killed him.

1037
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,100
I didn't kill your brother,
Terry,

1038
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,200
but I did set him up
pretty good.

1039
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,500
God, I miss her.

1040
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,000
Scotch?

1041
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,200
For the lady.

1042
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,600
Thank you.

1043
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,300
Thank you.

1044
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,900
Long way back?

1045
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,300
It is.

1046
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,100
Thanks for meeting me halfway.

1047
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,800
Well, actually, it's three
quarters to one quarter,

1048
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,600
so I guess you owe me.

1049
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,600
Are you going to find the man
who killed my sister?

1050
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,900
Well, it's been 15 years.

1051
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,700
How long have
you been on it?

1052
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,600
Three days.

1053
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,700
That's not actually
why I called you.

1054
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,300
Why'd you call me?

1055
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,000
The soup of the day
is cream of tomato.

1056
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,400
Thank you.

1057
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,100
You know, I wasn't
being entirely honest

1058
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,500
with you the other day.

1059
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,400
I know.

1060
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,700
How do you know?

1061
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,100
I'm a cop.
I'm good at what I do.

1062
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,200
The truth is?

1063
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,500
The truth is, my mom and I...

1064
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,600
I hadn't spoken
to her

1065
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,800
for years.

1066
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I, um, I was

1067
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,600
3,000 miles away when I heard
about Rebecca and the stroke.

1068
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,400
I was just a kid.

1069
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,200
I... I couldn't get along
with her.

1070
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,600
I understand.

1071
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,600
You do?

1072
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,500
That's how I got here.

1073
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,400
I went 3,000 miles to get away
from someone I loved.

1074
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,100
Was the someone you loved
a wife?

1075
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,300
Not anymore.

1076
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,000
You don't like to talk about it.

1077
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,800
Actually, I talk too much
about it.

1078
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,100
Well...

1079
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
...anyway, um,

1080
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,600
when I did find
out, I was lost.

1081
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,700
So you came home.

1082
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,500
You know, I'm from L.A.

1083
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,100
Where'd you live?

1084
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
Beverly Hills.

1085
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,500
Well above my pay grade.

1086
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Your mom was
in a charity hospital.

1087
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,000
If I'm not being too nosy,

1088
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,600
how do you handle this
financially?

1089
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,400
I grew up a lot in L.A.

1090
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,400
I went back to school,
and I, um...

1091
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,100
I made some money
in real estate.

1092
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Well, an attractive,
educated, full-grown woman

1093
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,000
can make a lot of money
in Beverly Hills.

1094
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,200
Attractive how?

1095
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,000
What do you want
to talk about, Jesse?

1096
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:52,700
Baseball.

1097
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,500
Do you have someone
in Paradise?

1098
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:57,800
I did.

1099
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,500
But you' re not
seeing anyone now?

1100
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,200
I'm seeing you.

1101
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,400
How about those Sox?

1102
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,500
Well...

1103
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,700
It's been a long time.

1104
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,400
TAXI DRIVER:
Want me to come back?

1105
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,600
Keep the change.

1106
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,200
There won't be any change.

1107
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,900
Well, keep it anyway.

1108
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,700
Good night.

1109
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,700
Good night.

1110
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:43,200
_Aid you do?

1111
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,300
I hit somebody in the fist
with my face.

1112
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,600
So, Jesse...

1113
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,400
is there anything you need
to talk about?

1114
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,500
Did Molly call you
or did Rose call you?

1115
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,700
Rose called me.

1116
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,800
She's...

1117
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:01,900
Concerned?

1118
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,900
How are you with blood?

1119
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,300
I see blood all the time.

1120
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,600
It's just usually
child blood rather

1121
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,300
than big people blood.
Doc,

1122
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,300
you are rapidly spiraling
into pediatrician talk.

1123
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,000
Sorry, Jesse.

1124
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,700
I need your expert, grownup
medical examiner opinion here.

1125
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,400
Okay.

1126
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,700
Somebody gets shot,
do they bleed right away?

1127
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,900
Not necessarily.

1128
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,300
I'm studying at night.

1129
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,000
Good.

1130
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,300
So a gunshot victim might not
leave a blood trail

1131
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
at the scene.

1132
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,600
Exactly.

1133
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,300
So...

1134
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,200
did I answer your question?

1135
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,400
Oh, I think I know the answer.

1136
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,100
I just wanted
to be sure you did.

1137
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,100
I want you
out of my town.

1138
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,900
Your town?
That's right.

1139
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,900
What are you, the sheriff?

1140
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,200
Chief Stone?

1141
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,900
Hey, I'm just here
for field training.

1142
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'm missing some
personal property.

1143
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,800
Did you misplace
the item or items?

1144
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,900
I think it was stolen.

1145
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,700
I see.

1146
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,000
A theft.

1147
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,000
Well, during
your abbreviated

1148
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,800
stay in Paradise,
we aim to protect and serve,

1149
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,300
so, just what are you missing,
Mr. Pendleton?

1150
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,200
Uh, perhaps I did
misplace the items.

1151
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,700
How's tomorrow?

1152
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,200
How's after the race?

1153
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,400
How's tomorrow?

1154
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,600
Oh, well.

1155
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Mr. Pendleton?

1156
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,700
Yes?

1157
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Shame on you.

1158
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,400
How'd I do?

1159
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,600
Officially, I'm shocked.

1160
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,500
Unofficially.

1161
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,700
I'm proud of you.

1162
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,400
What would you have done,
Jesse?

1163
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,400
I would have
slugged him.

1164
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,000
Skipper, what happened?

1165
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,000
I fell.

1166
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,900
Where'

1167
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,100
Orthodontist.

1168
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,300
Where's Suit?
Market.

1169
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,600
He said to let you know

1170
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,700
that Captain
Healy called.

1171
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,000
Hey, Skipper,

1172
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,900
do you think I could have
the day off tomorrow?

1173
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,900
Are Gino Fish and his
receptionist an item?

1174
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,800
You got a problem
with that?

1175
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,200
Hey, I'm just
accumulating data.

1176
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,400
Your in-laws
still visiting?

1177
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,200
That's what they call it.

1178
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,200
What did you find out
about Terry Genest?

1179
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,800
Well, he prefers Terence.

1180
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,200
Just got out of prison.

1181
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,500
Freelance gunsel.

1182
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,800
Works for Gino
on occasión.

1183
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,400
Bit of a
loose cannon.

1184
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,300
Cokehead.

1185
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,100
You better be a
little careful.

1186
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,900
Everybody says that.

1187
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,600
The material on the robber's
clothes was blood.

1188
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,500
Now, we' re no going to get
much more out of it.

1189
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,000
It was pretty degraded.

1190
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,200
Oh, and I also, uh,

1191
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,600
ran that check that
Suitcase said you wanted.

1192
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,300
And?

1193
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,200
Dead end.

1194
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,200
There were no accidental
gunshot wounds in May ' 92.

1195
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,500
I also checked, uh, New
Hampshire and Rhode Island.

1196
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,900
You' re thorough.

1197
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:03,700
I am.

1198
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,400
And I don't know what
this other thing's about.

1199
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,400
Is he okay?

1200
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:13,100
He's not quite in the same pond
with the other ducks yet.

1201
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,800
What "other thing"?

1202
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,900
Well, he wanted me to, uh,

1203
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
run a background check on
L.A. resident Leeann Lewis.

1204
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,400
Because?

1205
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,600
He said he had a feeling.

1206
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,200
He's been having
a lot of those.

1207
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,800
Uh, the only thing
we got was

1208
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,100
she was reported
missing once.

1209
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Landlady filed
the report.

1210
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,100
Well, she left
to take care of her mom.

1211
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,800
Anyway, it went away.

1212
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,700
And she sent the landlady
an apology and money

1213
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,900
to pay off the lease.

1214
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,400
And that was May ' 92.

1215
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,600
You mean ' 94.

1216
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,600
No...

1217
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,200
she was reported missing
May 23, 1992.

1218
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,300
That's the, uh,

1219
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,000
that's the same date
as the robbery.

1220
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,400
Is that important?

1221
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,000
Jesse?

1222
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,300
That report list an occupation?

1223
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,100
Uh, yeah. Um...

1224
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,400
Waitress.

1225
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,700
Where was her residence?

1226
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,300
Inglewood.

1227
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:07,800
Jesse.

1228
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,700
What happened?

1229
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,700
I fell.

1230
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,100
You got some coffee?

1231
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,600
Long drive.

1232
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,600
Lot of traffic?

1233
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,300
Actually, I had to make sure
I wasn't followed.

1234
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
Turns out there
was a lot of money

1235
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,500
in Hasty's bank-
mob money.

1236
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,100
And I've been getting
the distinct impressión

1237
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,600
they'd like to have
what's left of it back.

1238
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,900
Do you think you were followed?

1239
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I know I wasn't.
How do you know?

1240
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,600
I'm good at what
I do, Rebecca.

1241
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1242
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,800
It's just that you and
your sister look so much alike.

1243
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:52,700
Of course, if Leeann was dressed
as a man, you wouldn't look

1244
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,900
anything like her, would you?

1245
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,700
I screwed up.

1246
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:00,800
I know better.

1247
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,500
It's not just men
who rob banks.

1248
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,300
It's not just men
who kill people.

1249
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,900
I didn't kill anyone.

1250
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,800
You mean, you didn't
shoot anybody.

1251
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,400
Look, it's just a theory so far,

1252
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,400
but it's a pretty good theory.

1253
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,400
Shouldn't be too hard to prove.

1254
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,400
You went to the dentist
as a kid.

1255
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,000
Dental records,
fingerprints, DNA.

1256
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,800
Something will tell us.

1257
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,400
And then what?

1258
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,600
Then I'll have to arrest you.

1259
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,900
Will you give me time
to make arrangements for my mom?

1260
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,900
Yeah, your mom.

1261
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,000
How much money
you got left?

1262
01:18:59,100 --> 01:18:59,900
Not a lot.

1263
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,600
Enough to...

1264
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,600
Enough to make sure
I can take care of her.

1265
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,800
When you go to jail,
they take it away.

1266
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,000
I talked Leeann into it

1267
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,600
when I found out
how much money

1268
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,300
there was going
through that bank.

1269
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,500
We never had anything.

1270
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,300
We thought
we were going to travel

1271
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,100
and do anything we wanted.

1272
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,200
It just seemed so easy.

1273
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,500
We thought we were so smart.

1274
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,600
It was smart.

1275
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,100
WOMAN
Light to moderate training...

1276
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,900
Unintended consequences.

1277
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,100
The bank guard hit what
he was aiming at, didn't he?

1278
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,400
Leeann died where we planned
to change our clothes,

1279
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,600
so I...

1280
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,200
I put my clothes on her,
and I buried her.

1281
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,700
Mutual fund companies

1282
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,200
are reporting
first quarter vestment...

1283
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,600
What do you think's going
to happen to her

1284
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,100
after I take you away?

1285
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,900
Oh, what the hell.

1286
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,000
You won't be hearing
from me again.

1287
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,800
What was that kiss about?

1288
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,000
You.

1289
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,500
I'd like to believe that.

1290
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,500
Platinum rose three dollars...

1291
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,400
FISH: Did you find what
you were looking for?

1292
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:12,600
I did. I found the money
Hasty was laundering for you.

1293
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,500
Hasty who?

1294
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,100
Let's not do this again.

1295
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,800
I don't know
what you' re talking about.

1296
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,800
If we' re going to be pals,
we have to find a way

1297
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,300
to be more honest
with each other.

1298
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,000
Ah.

1299
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,200
Not completely honest?

1300
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,200
More honest.

1301
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,100
Well...

1302
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,000
You first.

1303
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,800
Assuming I were interested

1304
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,900
in the whereabouts
of this money,

1305
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,800
what could
you tell me?

1306
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:45,300
A woman robbed the bank
and has used up most of it

1307
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,700
taking care of her sick mother.

1308
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,900
You don't really expect me
to believe that?

1309
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,800
Not really.

1310
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,600
You don't know
where the money is?

1311
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,700
Not really.

1312
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,000
I'll pull off Mr. Genest.

1313
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,700
Jesse, it's Rose.

1314
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,600
Where are you?

1315
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,600
Hello?

1316
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,600
Hello?
