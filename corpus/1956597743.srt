1
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,507
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,551
I'd like to be a saint...

3
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,089
but I feel so helpless.

4
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,001
Hello, child.

5
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,877
My little queen.

6
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,482
Oh, sweetheart, thank you.

7
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,878
Mom, I wish you would die.

8
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,151
- Therese!
- Therese, why do you say that?

9
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:17,491
I want you to go to heaven
and you have to die to get there

10
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,598
<< Unless the grain dies... <<

11
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,474
Normandy, France, 1877

12
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,416
The day Mom died...

13
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,960
I didn't cry,

14
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,930
and I haven't talked to anyone
of my feelings.

15
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,801
I watched and listened,
in silence.

16
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,965
Hail Mary, full of grace
May the Lord be with you,

17
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:09,481
You are blessed among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

18
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,211
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
Pray for us sinners

19
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,153
Now and on time
of our death, Amen.

20
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,694
Hail Mary, full of grace
May the Lord be with you

21
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,354
You are blessed among all women...

22
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,922
Blessed be the fruit of your womb.

23
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,231
Holy Mary Mother of God
Pray for us sinners...

24
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,804
Ah, there you are, my child.

25
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,374
Come on. Come on.

26
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,374
Pauline is my new Mum.

27
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,349
After Mom died...

28
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,923
this world seemed sad to me...

29
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,118
and I was dreaming about the heavens.

30
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,005
But when I compared myself
to the saints...

31
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,910
I could see that the distance
between them and me...

32
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,211
was the same distance
that between a mountain

33
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,378
and a tiny speck of sand.

34
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,482
My little queen! Therese!
A fish!

35
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,397
- What a beautiful trout.
- What generosity!

36
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,304
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

37
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,344
- Let's meet in the visiting room.
- Yes, Sister.

38
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,841
Mr. Martin, you spoil us.
You really do.

39
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,146
I could never
enough to give you thanks.

40
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,187
Thank you for your prayers.

41
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,188
And your daughters are growing up.

42
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,882
I recognize Pauline...

43
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,851
Marie...

44
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,097
Leonie...

45
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,756
Celine.

46
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,733
And Therese is that big girl?

47
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,360
Yes, my mother.

48
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,572
- I'll clean it up.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,076
It's all right, child.

50
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,013
That's a holy image for you.

51
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,480
Thank you, Mother.

52
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,894
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

53
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,272
What is it, Therese?

54
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,206
Nothing.

55
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,471
What's going on?

56
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,012
Nothing.

57
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,513
Tell me.

58
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,176
I had a horrible dream.

59
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,049
I've done so many sins, Daddy.

60
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,089
You?

61
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,682
And what are these sins, my little one?

62
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,989
You really want me to tell you?

63
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,723
Of course you did.

64
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,464
I took the biggest
piece of cake yesterday.

65
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,164
Oh, I see. I see. Is there anything else?

66
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,764
Oh, yeah, Dad.

67
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,538
I didn't pack my things
when Marie asked me.

68
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,079
I kept reading that horrible novel.

69
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,742
I think God is punishing me.
I have bad thoughts.

70
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,115
Listen to me, Therese.

71
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,883
Don't take your scruples too seriously.

72
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,119
Confess them and forget them.

73
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,957
Jesus forgives you.

74
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,590
I think he's even smiling
of your peccadilloes.

75
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,861
Maybe you're right.

76
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,268
Therese...

77
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,931
sleep.

78
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,413
In nominates Patris, and Filii,
and Spritus Sancti. Amen.

79
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,798
I don't want to get up.

80
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,272
Come on, I let you sleep,
but we have to go now.

81
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,309
Why do I have to go?
I hate school.

82
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,132
I can't stand
Sister Scholastica.

83
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,933
She's an old witch.
She can die.

84
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,168
Don't say that!

85
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh, the sister's pet.

86
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,039
You think you're so pious
and so good with your curls.

87
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,015
I'll tell you what I think of you.

88
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,112
You're spoiled and rotten and no one
can't smell you.

89
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,350
Except maybe your family of slaves.

90
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,484
That's not true! You're lying!

91
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,427
That's right. Everybody's...
is laughing at you.

92
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,996
Natural Law is the law that
God has written in the hearts of men.

93
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:45,373
That's how he's capable of
to distinguish right from wrong.

94
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,778
Who can tell me now what...
other law God gave us?

95
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,312
Yes, Therese?

96
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,981
Divine Positive Law?

97
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,578
All right, fine.

98
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,093
And both parties
of Divine Positive Law are... ?

99
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,267
The New and the Old Law.

100
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,104
That's it.

101
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,641
I want all of them...

102
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,977
except Therese Martin,
were going home tonight

103
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:29,612
turn the page on the difference
between Divine Law and Natural Law.

104
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,747
Let us pray.

105
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:41,059
Blessed be the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit

106
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,365
now and forever,

107
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,133
Amen.

108
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,270
ln Nomine Patris and Filii
and Spiritu Sancti. Amen.

109
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,814
You may go.

110
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,118
A thousand thanks.

111
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,122
It must be hard to be so perfect.

112
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,378
It's so good to be all together here.

113
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,389
Daddy, I wish I could have seen you
dancing with Mommy.

114
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,926
You must have been
a beautiful couple.

115
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,188
We've never danced...

116
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,130
Your mother and I. We were
probably too pious.

117
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,062
I regret it now.

118
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,571
She was so graceful.

119
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,340
Very, very graceful.

120
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,071
Dad, have you thought about it?

121
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,977
You told me you'd think about it.

122
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,517
- To what?
- At school, Dad.

123
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,183
I don't want to go back.

124
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,451
But you have to go to school,
how are you going to learn?

125
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:50,689
Pauline can teach me,
I promise to be studious.

126
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,993
Pauline, are you sure about this?

127
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,830
It would be fun, and I know
that she'd be happier...

128
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,837
and that she'd work better.

129
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,467
Well, that's understood.

130
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,211
Let's give it a try.
until the end of the year.

131
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,250
Thank you, Daddy.

132
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,545
Thank you!

133
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,408
Let's review your Bible verses.

134
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,740
Have you been working?

135
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,282
I've recited them 50 times.
I think I know them.

136
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,685
Saint Mark 10, verses 13 â 16<<

137
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,284
They brought him children
so that he could touch them.

138
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,157
And the disciples ...

139
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,359
- pushed them away...
- and the disciples pushed them away...

140
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:06,564
<< Jesus, seeing this, was indignant
and says to them:

141
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:11,075
Let the little children come to me.
Don't stop them.

142
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,111
For the Kingdom of God
is for their fellow man.

143
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,481
I'm telling you the truth...

144
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,950
Whoever does not receive the kingdom
of God like a little child...

145
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,520
will not enter it. <<

146
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,447
Wonderful!

147
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,219
Am I winning a prize?

148
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,022
You win a prize.

149
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,859
Your tortoiseshell wallet!

150
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,765
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

151
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,838
I know you love him.
...it's yours.

152
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,373
Oh thank you thank you!

153
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,307
You're the sweetest
sister of the world!

154
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,936
No, it's you.

155
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,040
But I corrected
your algebra lesson.

156
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,619
Oh, no, you don't. How was it?

157
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,689
Two strikes. Pretty good math.

158
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,190
Dad, did you hear that?
Only two faults.

159
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,260
All right, fine. Keep it up.

160
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,829
Try not to overdo it.
you two have fun.

161
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,125
Oh no, we're very serious.

162
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,799
I'm convinced of that.

163
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,530
Let's get to work, girls.

164
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,936
You want to stay with me
for the next chapter,

165
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,941
or do you want to go upstairs
read it quietly?

166
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,603
I want to stay with you.

167
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,274
I could get eaten up
by a second-degree equation...

168
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,251
you'll have to catch me.
and brings me back to the surface.

169
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,758
All you have to do is scream if they...
attack you and I'll save you.

170
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,989
Mom, I love you so much.

171
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,655
Therese...

172
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,400
What's on your mind?

173
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,105
I was thinking of the faraway desert...

174
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,944
where we'll always be together.

175
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,555
I have to finish it by Thursday.
and I'm only at the bottom of it.

176
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,721
Can you help me?

177
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,295
you draw flowers so well.

178
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,627
If you want, I can try.

179
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,658
Pauline, where have you been?

180
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,602
I went to the convent
bring fresh bread to the sisters.

181
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,040
How's your painting coming?

182
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,171
I haven't made much progress,
I only painted the background.

183
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,181
I'm trying to give him
an air of spring.

184
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,444
idyllic and pastoral.

185
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:38,080
That's exactly right.
The colors are good.

186
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,215
But look at the perspective
from your cottage.

187
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,123
If you extend the line
from the roof like this...

188
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,162
you see how that includes
in the landscape?

189
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,698
Oh that's much better!

190
00:17:54,706 --> 00:18:00,076
Beloved mother I still want
to be with your son Jesus...

191
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,544
like a little child.

192
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,620
- You're gonna have to tell him.
- I know we have to tell him.

193
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,125
I don't know what I'm waiting for.

194
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,358
She's not a little girl anymore.

195
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,699
- She'll take it well.
- Maybe she will.

196
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,466
But it will be hard for her.

197
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,043
What did Mother Mary say
of Gonzaga?

198
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,384
That I had no reason
to delay my entry.

199
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,321
The date is set.
It's for the 2nd in October.

200
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,824
So soon?

201
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,621
Pauline, I envy you.

202
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,293
Therese, I found our desert.

203
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,796
Did you find him?

204
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,061
A beautiful desert...

205
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,899
full of roses...

206
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,200
where Jesus is waiting for me.

207
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,535
All I want...

208
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,670
is to be alone with him.

209
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,221
I'm going into Carmel
next month, Therese.

210
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,948
You're not going to wait for me.

211
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,618
No.

212
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,864
Does such a place really exist?

213
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,832
Yes, my darling.

214
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,353
I lost Pauline.

215
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,222
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,699
Goodbye, Celine.

217
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,168
Bye, Daddy.

218
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,432
Leonie,
God bless you.

219
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,508
Bye, Daddy.

220
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,009
When Pauline left me,

221
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,103
life was no longer...

222
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,706
that separation and suffering
continuous,

223
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,184
and I fell into a
deep melancholy.

224
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,891
She seems so happy in her letters!

225
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,458
He doesn't miss us at all.

226
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,800
It'll be good to see her anyway.

227
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,908
Oh the fruit!
Daddy, did you take them?

228
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,410
Don't worry.

229
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,844
It's at the front of the carriage.

230
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,076
Therese, do you feel bad?

231
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,247
It's just my head.
It feels heavy to me.

232
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,135
Aren't you coming, Therese?

233
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,999
I'll wait in the carriage.

234
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,768
Are you sure?
Pauline's going to be so disappointed.

235
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:02,143
I can't. I can't. I want to rest.
It's going to get better.

236
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,746
Let her rest, Celine.

237
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,491
My little queen.
Are you feeling better, my darling?

238
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,398
Yes, Daddy, thank you.

239
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,304
I beg your pardon.

240
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,852
It's all right, Therese.

241
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,287
Pauline's got it all figured out.

242
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,090
How's she doing?

243
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,565
She's happy and healthy.
She misses you very much.

244
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,761
What did she say about the food, Dad?

245
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,567
Let's see, now... Let the roast chicken from
He missed victory...

246
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,075
but that she was feasting
of bread and cheese.

247
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,670
Feasts, I doubt it, but...
she didn't look hungry.

248
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,147
When I saw her with her veil...

249
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,310
she looked much older.

250
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,854
She reminded me of your dear mother.

251
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:57,554
I was delirious for two weeks,

252
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,756
and I didn't seem to be recovering.

253
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,571
Blessed Virgin, please,

254
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,441
heal my little girl.

255
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,879
Mommy!

256
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,757
Dr. Notta says
that it's very serious.

257
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,057
He's never seen anything like it.
last so long.

258
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,799
Go away!

259
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,145
Holy Mother of God...

260
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,082
I'm begging you...

261
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,244
Have pity on me.

262
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,911
Daddy... (Sighs)

263
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,888
I'm hungry.

264
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,015
Are you sure you want to come in?

265
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,359
Yes, I'm sure of it.

266
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,719
Hello, Mum!

267
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,394
You're very skinny, sweetheart.

268
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,966
I'm told you're cured, but...

269
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:27,528
you need to rest
and heal you well.

270
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,904
I'm fine. I'm fine,
I'm telling you.

271
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,944
If only we could not
so worried about me.

272
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,206
Well, all right.

273
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:42,115
How are your battles going
with the equations?

274
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,188
It's hard.

275
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,384
I persevere.

276
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,791
My little hermit.

277
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,647
The desert is here,
isn't that right, Pauline?

278
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,877
And there I will find my beloved.

279
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:18,285
Yes. He's here. He's waiting.

280
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,188
Then I'll come to him.

281
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,824
Write to me, girls,
check in.

282
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,962
Soon, two of my sisters
were leaving the family nest.

283
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,563
Mary entered Carmel.

284
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,404
And be good.

285
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,569
God bless you.

286
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,341
And Leonie among the Franciscan Sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament,

287
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,077
I love you both.

288
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,120
From our big, happy family...

289
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,486
There wasn't much left...
than the two younger ones.

290
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,692
I just don't understand
why everyone's leaving.

291
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,463
That's what kids do.
They always leave.

292
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,333
Don't cry, little one.

293
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,209
The doves must leave the nest.

294
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,370
You and Celine
will also fly away one day.

295
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,659
God had a little miracle in store for me
to allow me to mature.

296
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,603
This took place during a
unforgettable Christmas Eve.

297
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,200
That night...

298
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,645
I have received the grace
to leave my childhood behind.

299
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,652
It was a beautiful mass.

300
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:37,151
But being up till two o'clock
in the morning, it's a little long for me.

301
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,230
I'm going to bed.

302
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,695
Celine, there's nothing in the slippers!

303
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,704
Oh, that's right, the slippers...

304
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,872
Go upstairs and tell Santa Claus...
can bring the gifts.

305
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,140
But hurry, it's late.

306
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,578
Thank God it's the last time.

307
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,847
She's a little old for that.

308
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,842
In an instant, I changed.

309
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,513
I realized that I had to forget myself...

310
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,675
and make other people happy.

311
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,987
Therese?

312
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,923
What's going on?

313
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,420
Celine...

314
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,433
I'm not the same.

315
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,799
I've decided not to cry.

316
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,881
Merry Christmas, Celine.

317
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:29,563
I had an immense thirst
to save souls.

318
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,508
I was burning to tear out souls...
great sinners...

319
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,906
to the flames of hell.

320
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,011
We were talking about a terrible murderer...

321
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,916
sentenced to death.

322
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,014
He seemed certain that he was going to...
to die without repentance.

323
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,926
I wanted to save his soul
at all costs.

324
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,995
My God, I'm sure
you'll forgive Pranzini.

325
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,769
I thought it was...

326
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,175
even if he went to his death without
give a sign of repentance...

327
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,510
or without confessing.

328
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:25,147
Lord Jesus, I trust
absolute in your pity.

329
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:31,161
But make him repent,
that would be a consolation to me.

330
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,430
Please, Lord...

331
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,401
he's my first child!

332
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,068
Father give me the crucifix.

333
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,153
Pray for me when I'm dead.

334
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,197
My son, God will not abandon you.

335
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,314
Celine...

336
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,321
What am I going to do?

337
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,460
You're gonna follow your heart.

338
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:24,371
He'll think it's because of Pauline.

339
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,081
It's not, is it?

340
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,191
What's more...

341
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,287
he won't be alone. I'll be with him.

342
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,897
Don't worry.

343
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:49,321
What is it, my little queen?

344
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,560
Tell me.

345
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,262
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

346
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,371
Tell me.

347
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,308
Don't be afraid.

348
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,576
I have to fly away.

349
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,716
You're young enough to take
such a serious decision.

350
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,350
Maybe in a few years,
when you're older...

351
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,292
No, Daddy. I'll be right there.

352
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,296
Jesus is calling me to the monastery.

353
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,201
I can't resist His Love.

354
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,331
All I want...

355
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,672
is for you to be happy,

356
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,905
and please God.

357
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,248
Look at this little flower.

358
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:57,555
Imagine how God loves him,
for creating it...

359
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,095
and keep her alive in the moss.

360
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,961
It still has its roots.

361
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:12,736
Maybe it's his destiny
to live in another land...

362
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,175
more fertile than moss.

363
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,016
Daddy, thank you.

364
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,220
Let's go ask the bishop.

365
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,294
And if he objects
we'll ask the Pope.

366
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,368
Mr. Martin l Nice to see you.

367
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,460
Please, sit down.

368
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,344
What can I do for you, my child?

369
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:02,218
My lord, permission to enter
to Carmel immediately.

370
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:07,286
Jesus is calling me, and I can't resist...
longer to His Love.

371
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,233
How old are you, my little girl?

372
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,533
I'm fifteen years old, Monsignor.

373
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,541
You look like a big girl!

374
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,669
She pulled her hair up for you.

375
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,715
Oh, I see. I see.

376
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,547
You've longed for a long time...
get into Carmel?

377
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,453
Yes, my lord, a very long time.

378
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,288
Mr. Martin, don't worry.

379
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,761
I'm with you against
your daughter's whim.

380
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,562
I can assure you, my lord,
that this is not a child's whim.

381
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,762
I'm convinced that God
called her.

382
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,470
That's highly unusual.

383
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,744
I need approval
of the superior of the monastery...

384
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,010
before you even think about it.

385
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,517
He already said no.

386
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:22,898
I'll talk to him again,
We'll see what I can do.

387
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,172
Thank you, Monsignor.

388
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,977
Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.

389
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:03,643
Once we get to Rome,
I begged Jesus for a miracle.

390
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,410
I prayed that the Pope
accept my request.

391
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,582
But when the final day arrived...

392
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:16,251
They told us that he was defended...
to talk to the Holy Father.

393
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,076
Speak up.

394
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,832
Most Holy Father...

395
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,096
...I have a huge favour to ask you.

396
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,632
In honor of your Jubilee...

397
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,265
let me come in
in Carmel at the age of 15.

398
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,678
I don't get it.

399
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:13,716
Holy Father, this child wants to enter
in Carmel at the age of 15.

400
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,377
The superiors are in the process
to consider the issue.

401
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,088
Do what your superiors tell you

402
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,023
Holy Father, if you say yes,
everyone will agree!

403
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,153
Mademoiselle Martin,
pull yourself together.

404
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:34,430
Come on, you're going in,
God willing.

405
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,098
But, Holy Father...

406
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:59,657
After this great disappointment
I was filled with sadness.

407
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:04,564
But I never gave up hope
that God would grant my wish.

408
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,072
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

409
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,213
Thank you

410
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,115
It's for you! The Bishop's seal!
Come on!

411
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,848
Open it.

412
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,161
<< Dear Miss Martin.

413
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,596
I am pleased to inform you
that after seeing the superiors...

414
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,100
I've decided to let you in.
at the Lisieux Carmel...

415
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,797
at the unusual age of 15.

416
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,542
However...

417
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,809
in view of the extraordinary circumstances
of your situation...

418
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,783
your entry will have to wait three months...

419
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,616
until Lent.

420
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:25,342
At first, I didn't know how
I could handle waiting three months.

421
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,917
But I was so grateful to God...

422
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:32,318
that I gave myself
to a life of sacrifice.

423
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,483
It's not that I'm accomplishing
great things.

424
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:45,329
My sacrifices consisted of small
acts that no one noticed.

425
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:53,036
I can't express how much
this waiting...

426
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,374
left me with fond memories.

427
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:11,413
Daddy, I love you so much.

428
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,979
You know how happy I am,
and yet...

429
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,287
I'm heartbroken to leave you.

430
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,531
Life is so short, my darling.

431
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,405
We will be reunited...

432
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,841
for all eternity...

433
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,406
very soon.

434
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,464
Go, my queen.

435
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,207
Go, I bless you.

436
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,349
Deo Gratias.

437
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,565
I'm here forever.

438
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,664
You anoint my forehead with oil

439
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:21,403
my cup runneth over

440
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:26,574
Glory be to the Father,
to the Son,

441
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,743
and to the Holy Spirit.

442
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,651
Now

443
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,816
and forever

444
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,829
Amen.

445
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,307
It's extremely important...

446
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,045
to clean up the choir.

447
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,153
I don't want to see a squall
of dust when this is over.

448
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,590
Yes, sister, I'll do my best.

449
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,288
Yeah, we'll see about that.

450
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,694
I know you'd rather have been
with your sisters...

451
00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:00,293
But the Mother thinks you'll be
more useful here with me.

452
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:04,032
Sister Augustine, I'm
very happy to be here.

453
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,835
Let's get to work. I'll be back in a minute.
in a few minutes.

454
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,488
Sister Therese!

455
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,358
how negligent of you to break that vase...

456
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:04,900
and then cover it up.

457
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,526
I'm surprised at you.

458
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,901
But Sister I...

459
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,501
Yes, Sister, I'll do more
be careful next time.

460
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,618
This little victory of will...

461
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,161
cost me a lot.

462
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,829
I saw that when I was doing
my duty without flinching...

463
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,802
no one was paying attention.

464
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:46,239
But every mistake was
immediately noticed.

465
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:52,108
<< But the English attacked
...and the French retreated.

466
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,241
"" "Don't be afraid to hit them.
shouted Jeanne.

467
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,844
"" "Their defeat is in your hands.

468
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:02,220
<< On the Levis Bridge.
Jeanne was always fighting.

469
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,522
A whole troop attacked him.

470
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,687
"" Surrender! they shouted

471
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:12,734
"I swore an oath and gave my faith
to another," she says bravely.

472
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,566
"" and vowed to keep my promise. ''

473
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,983
<< But she resisted in vain.

474
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,577
They grabbed his clothes...

475
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:36,591
knocked her off her horse
and captured her. <<

476
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,464
Not long after I came in...

477
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:52,200
the health of our dear Father
began to decline.

478
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,642
We lost him little by little.

479
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:05,754
His mind, always so clear and sharp...

480
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,551
became foggy and dark.

481
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,229
You take the beater...

482
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,357
and you beat the laundry, hard, like this.

483
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,307
- Yes, Sister.
- I want to see you do it.

484
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:35,140
No, harder, like this.

485
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,584
Just like that?

486
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,487
Yeah, well, sort of.

487
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,765
My striving for perfection...

488
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,843
were greeted by more than
of thorns than roses.

489
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,516
Pleasing God and the other sisters
was difficult.

490
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:19,289
I knew how to be a very small soul...

491
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,887
who could only offer
little things to God.

492
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:29,629
and I was wondering if it was enough.

493
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,352
You can't not see...

494
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:24,222
that our cloisters are being swept away
by a 15-year-old child.

495
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,257
Sister...

496
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:31,356
clean this up,
and pay more attention to the future.

497
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:15,035
Then I found him on the floor.

498
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,704
That's how he died, poor Papa.

499
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,375
I was only five years old.

500
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,975
I must have grown up fast, that's for sure.

501
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,755
I was neither coddled nor spoiled.

502
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:37,664
I never have a single moment
doubted my calling.

503
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,635
But suddenly, to the old lady of
...to take my final vows...

504
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,504
I was overcome by fear and doubt.

505
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,049
My mother! My mother!

506
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,548
I need to speak to you urgently,
do you have a moment?

507
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,056
Of course, my boy,
What's up?

508
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,489
What's going on?

509
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:08,496
I can no longer avoid
to face the truth.

510
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,657
What's happened?

511
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,259
I just realized
that I don't have the vocation.

512
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,497
I have to go back to the world...

513
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:19,370
and not stay here at Carmel
and do what I want.

514
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:24,777
I'm worthless, I fail
...to all my duties.

515
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,442
My dear girl!

516
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:33,215
God didn't bring you here
to take away your calling.

517
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:48,031
Tomorrow is the day
of your final vows.

518
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,368
Are you happy here, child?

519
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,637
You can leave if you want.

520
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,678
But do you want to stay?

521
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:02,011
I find this life difficult, but...

522
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,916
my heart grew here.

523
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,546
Let me tell you what I think.

524
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:12,458
You're a simple soul, child.

525
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,530
and while you're growing up in love...

526
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,064
you'll become even simpler.

527
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:20,829
The closer you get to God...

528
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,269
the simpler you get.

529
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,708
I don't need to grow up.

530
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:34,647
I need to become
smaller and smaller and weaker.

531
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,690
Now go get ready...

532
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,886
to your profession of faith.

533
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,121
Yeah, I remember his hot chocolate.

534
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:20,352
Sister, your altar cloths...
are so pretty!

535
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,549
How do you do it?

536
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,220
I have years of experience.

537
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,857
Embroidery requires a lot
patience and skill.

538
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,231
I can see that.

539
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,304
Not everybody gets it.

540
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:40,865
I was wondering if you
could teach me.

541
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,274
To you?

542
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,346
If you have time.

543
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:53,285
Maybe I could teach you
simple points.

544
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,517
Thank you, Sister,
I'd like that very much.

545
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,621
>> Let me come to me...

546
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,599
little children. <<

547
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,569
I finally found in these words
my own way...

548
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,936
to become a saint.

549
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,601
It's ten to six.

550
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,804
I need someone to
take me to the mess hall.

551
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,745
Let me help you, Sister.

552
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,148
I don't need to reach
the level of the great saints.

553
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,150
Here you go, Sister.

554
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,813
I just have to be myself...

555
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,891
a small child.

556
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,392
- Be careful.
- Yes, Sister.

557
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:38,793
- Easy, you're pulling me!
- Forgive me, Sister.

558
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,597
I'll try like this.

559
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,202
It's too abrupt!

560
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,005
Give me your arm.

561
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,750
I'm not made of wood, you know.

562
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,722
Well, let's go.

563
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,407
On winter nights when
I was doing my job...

564
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:28,381
I heard music.
and I imagined a ballroom...

565
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,750
filled with elegant young ladies
conversing with each other...

566
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:36,689
trying hard
of compliments...

567
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,885
and doing mundane things.

568
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:43,398
Stop it! You're going too fast!

569
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,296
I'm out of breath.

570
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,767
I'll go slower.

571
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:53,633
But the music I heard
was the music of my heart.

572
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,804
and I wouldn't have traded
one minute of humble charity...

573
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:02,247
against a thousand years of festivities
and social events.

574
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,082
What are you looking at that's so beautiful?

575
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,624
- Get moving!
- Forgive me, Sister.

576
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:12,717
That night I felt
such love...

577
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,956
that I couldn't have
do better...

578
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,557
that if I was leading Jesus himself.

579
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,024
Thank you very much, Sister Therese.

580
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,289
Thank you, child.

581
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,457
You're very kind to help
an old lady like me.

582
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,866
Sister Therese!

583
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,936
There you are.

584
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,331
I've been looking all over for you.

585
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:36,002
I'm so happy to see you!
Could you help me?

586
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,273
Sister Vincent needs it
in the kitchen.

587
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,650
You don't seem to have
a lot of energy.

588
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:52,420
I don't know what I'd get
done without you.

589
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,932
Tell me, Sister Therese.
what do you see in me?

590
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:08,203
Every time I see you,
you smile.

591
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:17,810
I'm smiling because I'm
Good to see you.

592
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,797
Can he hear us?

593
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,300
I don't know about that.

594
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:18,033
I talk to him all the time...

595
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,768
and sometimes he shakes my hand.

596
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:23,367
Oh Celine, what a burden to you.

597
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,489
Daddy.

598
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:42,021
You remember our
evenings in the garden?

599
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,826
Mom used to make lace...

600
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:47,265
and you were gardening
while we were playing.

601
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:50,998
I wish we were
all together again!

602
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:02,711
I have to go, he's very tired.

603
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,450
I'll bring him back soon.

604
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,387
It's getting very difficult.

605
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,654
He seems to be declining every day.

606
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,427
Take care, sweetie.

607
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,148
Bye, Daddy.

608
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,315
Bye, Daddy dearest.
I love you, Daddy.

609
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,740
Heaven.

610
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,503
Heaven.

611
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,361
Must weigh a ton.
Here, let me give you a hand.

612
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,438
It's not too heavy for me.

613
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,976
After Dad died...

614
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,071
My dear little sister was free
to enter Carmel...

615
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,118
She's wanted him for so long.

616
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:23,648
What a joy for me to live
under the same roof again...

617
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:28,662
and to share the joys and sorrows
of my childhood companion.

618
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:44,035
Ah, the Martin sisters,
how bourgeois you are!

619
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,841
You should all
put you to work...

620
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:50,408
instead of wasting your time
...to play actresses.

621
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,249
Wait till you see
our program tonight.

622
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,854
It was so realistic!

623
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,263
I can't wait to see
the developed photo.

624
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,494
Let's hurry, we have to
be ready by 7:30.

625
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:10,697
We must surprise our Mother,
she doesn't suspect a thing.

626
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,434
Another picture of the actress
and the author please.

627
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,136
The rest of you can go.

628
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,306
You're beautiful!

629
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,007
One more.

630
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,090
I can hardly wait.

631
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,357
We have to tie him up.

632
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,487
There, that's good.

633
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,266
A little higher.

634
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,771
No, get a little more
...to the left.

635
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,773
There, that's better.

636
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:02,249
- Are you all right?
- Must be the smoke.

637
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,450
It's all right now.

638
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,718
Jesus Christ.

639
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:11,356
What's your response
to my follies?

640
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:16,529
Is there a smaller soul,
more helpless than mine?

641
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,232
Not all of them are apostles...

642
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,833
Isn't that right?

643
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:27,143
Not all of them are prophets.
Aren't they?

644
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:32,084
Not all of them teach
Isn't that right?

645
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:36,647
Not all have the gift of healing...

646
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,123
Isn't that right?

647
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:44,028
And yet they desire
sincerely have gifts...

648
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:49,263
And I'll show you
a more excellent way.

649
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,464
We can kiss...

650
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,669
faith, hope, and love...

651
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,439
The three of us...

652
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,482
But most importantly...

653
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,551
is love.

654
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,821
Well, I mean...

655
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,187
I feel at peace.

656
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,422
I understand that the Corps
of Christ has a heart...

657
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:18,431
and this heart burns with love.

658
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,099
At the heart of the Church
my Mother...

659
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,105
I will be Love.

660
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,732
And so it will be all...

661
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,142
and so my dream
will come true.

662
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,819
Fire!

663
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,193
Water!

664
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,974
Sister, quickly,
help me!

665
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,943
Cough please.

666
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,365
Try to get some rest.

667
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,284
How long has this been going on?

668
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,258
For several months now.
I must confess...

669
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:31,731
that she coughs a lot, but
I didn't think it was a big deal.

670
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,994
Sister Pauline...

671
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:39,005
this is an advanced case
of tuberculosis.

672
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,836
Oh no!

673
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,509
God have mercy.

674
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,108
I had no idea.

675
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,788
My beloved.

676
01:19:57,692 --> 01:19:59,489
Thank you, Doctor.

677
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,713
I'm gonna die, Mom.

678
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,213
I know, I know, I know, I know.

679
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:51,312
Jesus allowed my soul
or invaded by a thick night.

680
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,518
The thought of heaven...

681
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,452
once so sweet...

682
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,217
is nothing but torment.

683
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:19,100
Everything I wanted so badly
has disappeared.

684
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,703
All I have in front of me
is death...

685
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:26,872
and emptiness.

686
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,076
I can't eat anymore...

687
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,480
and I want all kinds of things.

688
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,816
A chocolate éclair for example...

689
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,925
I didn't expect to suffer this much.

690
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,138
I'm suffering like a little child.

691
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:20,050
I'll see you again...

692
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,023
and your heart will rejoice...

693
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:28,289
and no one's gonna take that away from you.

694
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,159
You'll see.

695
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,498
I will send to Earth...

696
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,196
a shower of roses.

697
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,278
May God in his mercy...

698
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,511
delivers you from all your sins.

699
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:59,290
God save you...

700
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:03,888
and loves you, gives you eternal life.

701
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,363
Amen.

702
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:19,972
Sister, Corpus Domini
nostri Jesu Christi custodiat...

703
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:27,848
Father, she can't swallow anymore.

704
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:30,815
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

705
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:06,159
Mama... (Sighs)

706
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:11,292
Mom, I'm suffocating.

707
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,196
Oh, my darling.

708
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,772
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I love God.

709
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,375
Yes, he's very good.

710
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,221
My God will never forget me.

711
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,558
He never gave up on me.

712
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:47,800
My God won't abandon me.

713
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,808
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

714
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,309
Anything you want...

715
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,918
But have mercy on me!

716
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,940
My mother.

717
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,704
Is it agony?

718
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,214
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

719
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:41,844
Yes, my dear, it's agony.

720
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,519
I love her.

721
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:21,127
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

722
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,592
I love You!

723
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,584
Heaven.

724
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:52,373
My mission is about to begin...

725
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,474
That others love God
just the way I like it.

726
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:59,849
My Heaven will happen on Earth...

727
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,855
until the end of the world.

728
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:09,390
Yes, I want my heaven...

729
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:12,796
is to do good on Earth.

730
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:49,494
After Therese Martin's death in 1897,
the Carmelites published his autobiography...

731
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:53,199
which became a spiritual classic
all over the world.

732
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,942
She's loved by millions
of people of all faiths.

733
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:00,036
In fact, Mother Teresa of Calcutta...
took the name Therese...

734
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:02,240
and dedicated his mission
â << The little way <<.

735
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,847
<< Therese's little way of loving...
God can be followed by all...

736
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:08,683
and many miracles attributed to his
intercession confirm his promise:

737
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,257
<< I'll send a shower of roses to Earth. <<
