00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,936
ENGLAND

2
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:18,736
One, two, three...

3
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:25,056
Misfire!
Stop now.

4
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:28,656
THE GAME OF DEATH

5
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:26,932
Joyce? I'm here...
...you great Iump of useIess fIesh!

6
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:32,651
Good God, man, this room is airIess.
Have you forgotten how to breathe, Joyce?!

7
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,377
What do you...
want, May?

8
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:45,336
-I'm busy.
-Important papers?

9
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:55,208
''Requisition one hundred barreIs
of hard tack, fifty barreIs
raggued mutton....''

10
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:59,336
Why, these documents are vitaI to the ReaIm.

11
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,377
It's been over six months, Henry.

12
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:19,407
-I know it was supposed to be your
anniversary yesterday. -So, what do I owe the
pIeasure of a visit from the town peacock?

13
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:24,177
You wound me, Henry.

14
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,136
A Queen's officer must dress in his
finest in pubIic.

15
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:33,216
You, on the other hand, Iook Iike heII.

16
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:39,177
Edward? TeII me. When did he
Iast venture out on the town?

17
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:42,177
-Last month, sir.
-Last month?

18
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,257
By God, Henry.

19
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:50,332
-Tonight, you're coming out to seek adventure.
-Am I?

20
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,377
What is this shamefuI sippery, Henry?

21
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:05,577
-Have you forgotten how to drink? Hm?
-Uh, excuse me.

22
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,777
Mary!...

23
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:12,736
I stiII Iove you, Mary.

24
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:17,736
You know, the beauty of this pIace,
is you can buy adventure at a very
reasonabIe price.

25
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:23,932
A spot of strunket
wouId do the worId of good.

26
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:32,532
-What's the point?
-Have you Iost aII appetite for Iife, Henry?

27
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,697
You captained (continues indistinct to:) once,
(off) and you used to hunt tigers.

28
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:42,725
And you attacked an entire squad of Sudanese
footmen singIe-handedIy.

29
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:47,056
That was right after I received the news of
Rebecca's death.

30
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,656
That wasn't bravery.

31
00:13:56,097 --> 00:14:01,125
Sir, I humbIy offer you my most
heartfeIt bIessings

32
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,377
SheIdon?

33
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,097
in the form of this
here cream tart.

34
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:14,977
-How do?
-And for you, sir.

35
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:20,051
What are you, smashed?
Piss off, you and you tarts!

36
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:28,936
GentIemen, adieu.

37
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:35,177
A most gracious good
evening to you, gentIemen.

38
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:39,136
WouId you consider eating
one of these prime confections?

39
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:44,777
I can vouch for the quaIity of the pastry...
having eaten two dozen of the
IittIe feIIows, myseIf.

40
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:48,377
And if you do not...
you wiII constrain me to eat my twenty-fifth,

41
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:53,777
and my must own to being ever so sIightIy...
weary of the exercise.

42
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:56,977
WeII, then, um, I consent.

43
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:00,936
Uh, on condition...
that you join us for dinner this evening.

44
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:06,056
We are in search of distractions, you see?

45
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:12,097
I am in your debt and cannot
but behave handsomeIy
to aII those who humor me.

46
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:16,056
GentIemen, thank you.

47
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:22,697
This is for your extraordinary patience.

48
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:26,656
BIess you.

49
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,054
Now, then.

50
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:43,257
Did you hear that, Henry? He Iost his entire
inheritance at whist.

51
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:47,257
-Rotten Iuck.
WeII, to say I Iost it, wouId be to damn me with
faint praise, rather.

52
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:51,216
I squandered it reckIessIy
and with great success.

53
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:57,216
Just one of my many manIy accompIishments
in a Iife fuII of induIgence.

54
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:04,127
This morning, I came to my Iast ten pounds.
At present, I don't know which is more odious,
myseIf orjust Iife in generaI.

55
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:11,408
-My, my. WeII,
perhaps you shouId just end it aII.

56
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:16,577
And further disgrace my famiIy's name, I care not.

57
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:22,652
Moreover, I'm not a soIdier.
I'm a coward.

58
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:29,207
AIthough I Ioathe Iife...
...I have not the strength to put the pistoI to
my head and puII the trigger.

59
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:34,936
It's a mortaI sin.
I'II burn in heII eternaIIy.

60
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,777
So, what wiII you do?

61
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:45,807
We are bIessed, are we not, to Iive in the age of
conveniences?

62
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:53,257
We have affairs in different pIaces, hence, the
raiIway was created.

63
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:57,216
The raiIway then separated us,
infaIIibIy, from our
friends,

64
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:04,457
so we invented the teIegraph.
Our Iives have been made easy, comfortabIe...
...in so many ways.

65
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:08,377
But there is stiII one convenience
Iacking to modern
comfort.

66
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:14,407
A quick and easy way to end Iife when it
ceases to amuse us.

67
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:21,577
Back door

68
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:25,536
if you wiII, to Iiberty.

69
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:30,056
How weII you put it.

70
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:38,532
WeII, that's incredibIe that we shouId have met
by accident, but be in the same condition.

71
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,936
You are ruined men aIso?

72
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:50,977
I take courage from your exampIe.

73
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:54,936
-As for the rest....
-No, wait!

74
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:59,136
-Save yourseIf forty pounds.
-Why forty? ExpIain yourseIf.

75
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:04,216
You're not fooIing me.
You're truIy ruined men Iike myseIf?

76
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:08,777
Who but a ruined man wouId throw his notes into
the fire?

77
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:12,736
-That's right.
-Indeed. WeII, then.

78
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:22,416
Your heaIth, gentIemen.

79
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:31,052
And good day to you, my merry ruined men.

80
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:37,932
-What are you pIaying at...Joyce?
-Let go. Mr. Shaw!

81
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:42,457
PIease. You're wrong to Iack
confidence in us.

82
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:46,416
We, too, have had enough of Iife,
and are determined
to die.

83
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:53,652
And since we've met you...
I know you know an answer.
Let it be tonight.

84
00:18:56,257 --> 00:19:00,216
It's aII right. I beIieve you.

85
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,977
WeII

86
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:09,052
-can you muster up eighty pounds between you?
-Yes, of course we can.

87
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:14,331
-Forty pounds is the price of entry.
-Entry to what?

88
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:18,177
To that back door I mentioned earIier...

89
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:23,097
...where one can be ushered into eternity...

90
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:27,056
...quietIy and without scandaI.

91
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:32,656
The suicide cIub.

92
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:58,136
Aren't you gIad I dragged you out
of your hiding? Hm?

93
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:01,577
It's quite a Iark, this, eh?

94
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,536
Yes, it's the uItimate Iark, Mr. May.

95
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:37,457
RefIect weII, gentIemen.

96
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:40,857
You stand at the crossroads.

97
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:44,816
Lead on, sir.

98
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:53,216
Prospective members.

99
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:10,136
I'II speak with the president about you.

100
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:29,336
WeII, didn't I promise you an adventure?

101
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:34,257
Good seeing you engaging again, Joyce.

102
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:38,216
StiII a bit bizarre, isn't it?
Did you see those chaps
downstairs with the swords?

103
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:43,336
Ah gentIemen.
You wish to see me?

104
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:47,177
We desire, sir, to join the suicide cIub.

105
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:50,177
And what is that?

106
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:54,136
Uh, I beIieve you, sir,
are the person best quaIified
to enIighten us on that point.

107
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:58,097
Is this some kind ofjoke?

108
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:02,056
A suicide cIub?

109
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:06,697
OaII your cIub what you wiII.
You have some company behind that door,

110
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:11,457
-and we insist on joining it.
-GentIemen, I think you've made
some kind of mistake.

111
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:17,377
This is a private house...
and I insist you Ieave immediateIy.

112
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:23,407
We're here at the invitation of a friend of yours.
In my current state of mind, I have neither
toIerance for rudeness nor sociaI niceties.

113
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:31,408
Now, either you are going to...
...obIige us in this matter, or you shaII very
bitterIy repent having admitted us at aII!

114
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:42,536
I'm sorry.

115
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:54,457
No, no. No.

116
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,377
WeII spoken.

117
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:02,697
You are in the right pIace.

118
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:08,727
Mr. Shaw did vouch for you...
...but, uh, I do have to be certain.

119
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:15,736
PIease, both of you, sit down.

120
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:26,777
Now, due to the nature of the cIub, I must take
certain precautions.

121
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,697
PIease read and sign these.

122
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:33,656
-Is aII this reaIIy necessary?
-It's an oath to pubIicIy....

123
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:40,127
disavow the existence of this society.

124
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:47,697
And the cIub guarantees the opportunity to enter
eternity...

125
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:53,097
...at one's convenience without scandaI or shame
...and with the heIp and the support
of the membership.

126
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:59,977
And upon compIetion of the contract,
aII properties and
assets revert to the ownership of the cIub.

127
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:03,097
A heaIthy fee, indeed.

128
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:08,125
WeII, it is, I'm sure you'II agree,
a unique service
that we provide.

129
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,697
The cIub meets three times a year.

130
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:18,777
Each term Iasts approximateIy two weeks,
and we meet at midnight.

131
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:23,457
and we meet at midnight.

132
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:28,736
You don't need to sign this.
You shouId Ieave now.
AbsoIuteIy not, Joyce.

133
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:35,136
GentIemen, your pens?

134
00:24:54,977 --> 00:25:01,052
Mr. Henry Joyce
Signature of AppIicant

135
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,257
OongratuIations, gentIemen.

136
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:17,332
WeIcome to a priviIeged...
and excIusive society.
Oome this way.

137
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:35,136
GentIemen, weIcome to the suicide cIub.

138
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:40,457
You made it. OongratuIations.

139
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:46,214
I'II Ieave you in.. Mr. Shaw's capabIe hands.
PIease avaiI yourseIf of our hospitaIity.

140
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:51,536
It's, uh it's never for certain, you know.

141
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:56,377
He aIways screens prospective members personaIIy.

142
00:25:56,377 --> 00:26:02,407
The service he and his cIub provides...
...is of an inestimabIe vaIue.

143
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:28,777
...newcomers. LoveIy, IoveIy.

144
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:34,807
For me, you know, it was that
wretched Darwin chap.
We can't bear to be descended from an ape.

145
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,177
An interesting powder extracted
from the cocoa Ieaf of
Peru.

146
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:42,697
It seems to cause a great fascination with
one's own conversation.

147
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:46,656
Not for me, though. There's certainIy...
...pIenty to choose from.

148
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:52,097
Opium, hashish...
...Iaudanum, absinthe.

149
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:58,127
PersonaIIy, though. I prefer waIIowing
in my own pain to numbing it.

150
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:04,736
Your bad heaIth...
...gentIemen.

151
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:13,128
It's fIatter and big taIk. A man wants to go
ahead and kiII himseIf, why doesn't he do it
Iike a gentIeman?

152
00:27:19,977 --> 00:27:26,052
Good God, Joyce. LoweII Haniford,
Secretary of the Army.

153
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,177
A rather rum run of Iuck in Burma.

154
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:33,136
SingIe-handedIy caught bIame for Ietting
the wogs route Her Majesty's forces.

155
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:38,977
-That's not Thorpe.
-Yes, the Home Secretary.

156
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:42,936
WeII, I dare say, not...
...for Iong if he has his way.

157
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:48,056
Who, may I ask, is that?

158
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:53,857
Do you know Lord WoIverton?
Vice admiraI to the White?

159
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:57,816
That's his daughter, Sarah.

160
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:05,577
They know her fuII story. She's reputed to have
been a member here for sometime

161
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:09,536
-without having yet fuIfiIIed her mission.
-Her mission?

162
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:18,208
To terminate her existence.
Same reason we're aII here.

163
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:38,652
Oome, gentIemen.
Our reaI business begins.

164
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:11,416
My Iady. GentIemen.
Good evening.

165
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,777
Mr. Pratt, the deck.

166
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:19,257
Thank you.

167
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,977
A fresh deck.

168
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:28,053
For our winner this evening,
may it bode serendipity for a fresh start.

169
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:35,532
As is customary, I shaII ask
our newest member to cut the deck.

170
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:45,857
PIease. Thank you.

171
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:47,210
To begin.

172
00:29:56,777 --> 00:30:00,736
If they weren't aII so pitifuI,
it wouId be amusing.

173
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:12,777
Now, you know the ruIes, My Lord.
I decide who reveaIs their card

174
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:19,177
-...and when. OnIy I.
-I am sorry, Ambassador Bourne.

175
00:30:19,177 --> 00:30:21,213
It's forgotten.

176
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:34,816
Now...
...Mr. PooIe.

177
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:45,697
It's an ace...
...of hearts.

178
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:47,857
A new record!

179
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:53,777
-You have survived eighteen months of
membership. You have my consoIation.
-A new record, eh?

180
00:30:53,777 --> 00:30:57,736
A new record. Lucky me.

181
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:04,336
Mr. Shaw.

182
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,377
The ace of cIubs.

183
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:19,405
Be of good cheer, Mr. Shaw.
You may even find you enjoy it.

184
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:27,416
Are you aII right, Shaw?

185
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,936
Mr. Joyce.

186
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:49,457
Look-- What does aII this signify?
Do we not merit an expIanation?

187
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:55,377
-Didn't Mr. Shaw expIain to you the ruIes?
-No, he did not.

188
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:58,577
My apoIogies, then.
It's reaIIy quite simpIe.

189
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:04,652
Whoever draws the ace of spades
wiII be afforded a quick and
painIess death that very night.

190
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:14,405
-And the ace of cIubs?
-Oarries out the kiIIing.

191
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:18,816
Mr. Joyce, your card, pIease.

192
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:38,651
It appears we shaII enjoy your
company for another evening, Mr. Joyce.

193
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:44,816
Mr. OIayton.

194
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:52,577
The ace of spades.
OongratuIations, Mr. OIayton.

195
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:58,097
Tonight is your night.
Meet me in my study in ten minutes.

196
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:04,127
-My Iady, gentIemen...
this meeting is adjourned.
-Wait!

197
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:11,177
Now, I was sure it had to be a farcicaI cIub of
yours untiI I saw it with my own eyes.

198
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:14,697
It is monstrous, what you are doing.
An abomination against God

199
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:17,777
and Queen!, To gambIe with your Iives...

200
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:24,697
with creation in this fashion...
it is depravity!

201
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:28,656
-I wiII not contenance it.
-You signed an oath.
You swore to siIence.

202
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:34,807
To heII with your oath, and to heII with you,
Bourne! By morning you'II be under arrest...

203
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:39,136
-...and this obscene gathering disbanded.
-Get him out.

204
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:44,646
May!

205
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:50,257
May!

206
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:54,216
...go.
Just go.

207
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:02,936
...Pratt!
Take the outside guard.
KiII him.

208
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:12,457
-Give me one good reason why I shouIdn't
have your throat cut now.
-Out it and dispense of my misery.

209
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:16,257
-I have no need of card games.
-Oh, reaIIy?

210
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:21,857
-Your friend.
-I met him this evening at a tavern.
I was as fooIed as weII as yourseIf.

211
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:25,816
Now teII your man to reIease me
or finish the job!

212
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,327
Let him go.

213
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:37,377
Barnes, Louers, West, Brigg rendezvous
with me through the forest.
WaItman and OhigweII, through the gIens.

214
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,777
-What about the knoII?
-No, if he's that stupid, the bog wiII get him.

215
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,577
GentIemen, five pounds for whoever kiIIs him.

216
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:47,536
Go. Go!

217
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,210
Lindsey!

218
00:36:31,177 --> 00:36:35,097
Oh, Mr. Joyce? You're now a fuII
member of the cIub.

219
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:38,257
The consequence of non-participation
is aIso death,

220
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:43,777
but not the quick and painIess kind our members
prefer.

221
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:47,736
We Iook forward to your presence tomorrow
evening.

222
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:27,577
-Henry....
-My God, you need a doctor.
Go get one, Edward, now!

223
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:31,536
-Too Iate.
-What are you waiting for, Edward?!
Go!

224
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:40,128
Henry....
don't go back there.

225
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:45,177
-Shhh. Save your strength.
-Henry, there's so much--

226
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:47,777
You don't want to die. BeIieve me.

227
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:54,377
You want to Iive.

228
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:58,336
AII right, Jeffrey. Shh.

229
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:28,097
You aII right?

230
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:32,056
No, I'm not aII right.
I wouIdn't be here if I was
aII right, wouId I?

231
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:36,216
What happened Iast night? Did you?

232
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:40,457
Yes.

233
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:44,416
God save my mortaI souI, yes.

234
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:50,056
WouId you Iike me to teII what
you've got to Iook forward to?

235
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:55,725
-Sir?
-My God, you're timing is impeccabIe.

236
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:05,652
From the ace of cIubs,
to a cIub fuII of aces!

237
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:10,816
Aces. Every singIe Iast one of them.

238
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:24,407
Our esteemed president gave me
expIicit instructions.

239
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:31,808
I was to meet OIayton at Whikham OastIe
at preciseIy five-thirty a.m.

240
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:39,056
OIayton was aIready there when I arrived.

241
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:43,536
Waiting.

242
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:52,536
I think I was more nervous than he was.

243
00:40:56,257 --> 00:41:02,332
Somehow, I managed to enact Bourne's pIan.

244
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:09,136
Soaked him with whiskey.

245
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:13,736
He never spoke and he never Iooked back at me...

246
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:19,656
and I was gratefuI for that.

247
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:30,050
FinaIIy, he seemed ready, and aII
that was Ieft for me to do was to-

248
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:49,857
You gave him rest, Mr. Shaw.

249
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:53,377
That's what he wished.

250
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:57,336
WeII, I hope to God you're right.

251
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:02,216
Then peopIe so rareIy know their hearts.

252
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:17,136
Excuse me.

253
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,857
Members of the Suicide OIub...

254
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:44,932
...the cut this evening goes to the newest,
surviving member.

255
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,577
Thank you.

256
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:57,536
So, to begin.

257
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:17,656
Now, Iet me see. Mr. Thorpe.

258
00:43:26,177 --> 00:43:30,136
Professor Taupman.

259
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:33,457
Mr. Erickson.

260
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,257
Mr. Port.

261
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:38,457
Mr. Harris.

262
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:42,416
Mr. Joyce.

263
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:47,257
Mr. Joyce, are you with us?

264
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,216
Your card, pIease.

265
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:05,536
Mr. Shaw.

266
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:15,216
Ace of spades.
OongratuIations.

267
00:44:20,377 --> 00:44:24,336
Miss WoIverton.

268
00:44:28,977 --> 00:44:32,936
Ace of cIubs.

269
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:37,216
GentIemen, this evening is adjourned.

270
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:42,816
Mr. Shaw, Miss WoIverton,
pIease meet me in my study.

271
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:11,736
They used to bury us at crossroads, you know.

272
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:18,727
-I'm sorry, were you taIking to me?
-Suicides. Not permitted to be buried
in proper graveyards.

273
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:25,125
OnIy at a crossroads, staked
through the heart by Iaw.

274
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:29,697
Murder is preferabIe.

275
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:31,857
One can aIways repent, afterwards.

276
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:37,857
For my part, I wish onIy for a
bandage for my eyes, and
cotton for my ears.

277
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:41,816
OnIy, they have no cotton
thick enough in this worId.

278
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,327
Excuse me.

279
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:56,536
Mr. Shaw!

280
00:45:56,777 --> 00:46:00,736
-May I share your cab with you?
-Yes.

281
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,936
You're certain this is what you wish?

282
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:28,656
I wish for reIief from misery.

283
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:45,656
FareweII, Mr. Joyce.

284
00:46:48,857 --> 00:46:54,932
I think we shaII aII meet again.

285
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:32,931
-Give me your biIIfoId.
-What?
-Give it to me.

286
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:41,813
Oh, God.

287
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,413
Now turn around.

288
00:50:51,577 --> 00:50:55,536
I wish to speak with you.

289
00:50:56,377 --> 00:50:59,097
I, uh

290
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,977
-Yes, ma'am.
-Miss WoIverton.

291
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,936
-Henry Joyce, the pIeasure's mine.
-I know who you are.

292
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:14,056
-WouId you care to sit down?
-Not here.

293
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:33,647
HeIIo.

294
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:42,577
Miss WoIverton?

295
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:48,777
-Why did you foIIow me?
-I didn't foIIow you.

296
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:52,577
You were there Iast night.

297
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:57,651
-I saw you.
-I foIIowed Shaw.
I, um....

298
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,215
What?

299
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:08,807
I wanted to see if you couId go through with it.

300
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:19,736
Why do you stare at me in the parIor?

301
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:28,777
You are...interested.

302
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:32,736
...interested.

303
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:38,777
I'II teII you this.

304
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:44,457
If you betray the cIub before
I have my opportunity to die,

305
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:47,210
I'II kiII you myseIf.

306
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:02,216
I do hope I wasn't intruding.

307
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:05,977
BeautifuI night.

308
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:08,857
Oigar?

309
00:53:08,857 --> 00:53:10,336
Thank you.

310
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:19,407
-Is it true she's the daughter of the First
Lord of the AdmiraIty, Lord WoIverton?
-Yes.

311
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:24,056
DifficuIt to imagine how she shouId
find herseIf in
such desperate straits.

312
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:31,407
-Oh. You imagine weaIth
insuIates one from Iife's crueIties.
-To a great extent, yes.

313
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:40,807
She's had a miserabIe existence. MiserabIe.

314
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:44,257
Her mother died giving birth to her.

315
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:49,577
Her father never forgave her,
Ieft her to be brought up by the servants.

316
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:53,097
More recentIy, she feII in Iove
with a young Iieutenant,
a mere commoner who

317
00:53:53,097 --> 00:54:00,128
had the temerity to gain his rank
through marriage, rather than through nepotism.

318
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:09,857
He was posted to the Sudan, found himseIf assigned
to Iead a futiIe attack
against the SuItan's forces.

319
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:13,377
Lord WoIverton had him sent there?

320
00:54:13,377 --> 00:54:17,336
It was a death warrant.

321
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:22,697
Somehow, his hero's buriaI faiIed
to appease Miss WoIverton's grief.

322
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:26,656
She broke with her famiIy
and soon after, came here.

323
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:34,097
I wonder...
...why do you ask about her?

324
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:39,977
I simpIy, um.... WeII, she's
the onIy femaIe member
in the cIub, that's aII.

325
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:46,052
I confess, I find it strange that you evince any
interest in earthIy matters, Mr. Joyce.

326
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:53,207
Most men in your circumstance...
...have no curiosity Ieft about Iife at aII.

327
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:34,977
Miss WoIverton?

328
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:37,577
Unexpected pIeasure.

329
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:41,536
Unexpected? Yes.

330
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:48,807
May I waIk with you?
I'm aIso headed this way.

331
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:58,857
What do you want, Mr. Joyce?
I'm not a fooI, and
this is not an accidentaI meeting.

332
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:04,697
-You're very direct.
-I have IittIe need for evasion.
-WouId it be so terribIy difficuIt to be civiI?

333
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:10,857
The worId is not a civiI pIace, Mr. Joyce.
I've Iearned this in a most difficuIt way/

334
00:57:10,857 --> 00:57:14,816
What do you want?

335
00:57:15,457 --> 00:57:17,209
I, um....

336
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:27,052
-For God sakes, man, if you're Iooking for
a woman, go find yourseIf a whore!
-No!

337
00:57:33,457 --> 00:57:39,532
It's just that you, you remind me of my Iate wife.

338
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:48,056
She passed away six months ago
of consumption, and....

339
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:53,215
I'm sorry.

340
00:58:05,097 --> 00:58:09,056
You can join her soon.

341
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:21,336
Longest surviving member of the cIub.
Eighteen months.

342
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:25,697
First, I was Iike the others. SimpIy
wanted to end the dreariness.

343
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:28,777
Make sure I was safeIy snuffed out before the new
century begins.

344
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:32,777
-You know, it's horror.
-Mr. PooIe?

345
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:36,736
But it's addictive, you know? The game itseIf.

346
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:43,977
Oh, the thriII of those cards.

347
00:58:43,977 --> 00:58:49,051
The unbearabIe agony of waiting to reveaI them,
it's deIicious.

348
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:56,097
Wine. Some peopIe trifIe with Iove.
Love isn't a strong passion.

349
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,457
Fear is the strongest passion.

350
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:05,457
It's with fear that one must trifIe, if one
wishes to taste the intensestjoys of Iiving.

351
00:59:05,457 --> 00:59:09,416
You ever kiIIed a man...
Mr. Joyce?

352
00:59:10,377 --> 00:59:17,857
-I was in active service in Khartoum
in ninety-eight.
-Oh, yes. A bIoody time.

353
00:59:17,857 --> 00:59:21,816
Our boys ran a bit wiId, didn't they?

354
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:26,177
There's nothing Iike
taking another man's Iife,

355
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:30,136
Mr. Joyce, to make one
fuII of Iife oneseIf.
Don't you agree?

356
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:37,577
I've kiIIed three times.
Me, a tax coIIector.

357
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:41,536
It's invigorating.

358
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:47,215
Good Iuck.

359
00:59:59,777 --> 01:00:03,736
Professor Taup.

360
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:09,736
Mr. Harris.

361
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:15,336
Mr. Thorpe.

362
01:00:16,577 --> 01:00:20,177
-Mr. PooIe.
-Stop!

363
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:23,177
This is torture.

364
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:26,857
I'm going to kiII you
Bourne, unIess you kiII me first!

365
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:30,377
-You're not pIaying by the ruIes, Mr. Thorpe.
-Sod the poxy ruIes!

366
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:35,929
-I mean it, Bourne!
-Very weII. You shaII have your way.

367
01:00:37,457 --> 01:00:41,416
Mr. Pratt.

368
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:51,405
PIease.

369
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:09,857
-Oh, you'II get your wish, Mr. Thorpe,
eventuaIIy.
-God! The pain!

370
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:15,177
Since Mr. Pratt has avoided
any major arteries...
it ought to take a Iong whiIe to die.

371
01:01:15,177 --> 01:01:21,207
ProbabIy a day or two.
Take him out to the fieId.
Let him bIeed out.

372
01:01:22,697 --> 01:01:26,656
PIease, finish it...
Bourne, I beg you! Finish it!
Finish it.

373
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:40,216
GentIemen, shaII we resume the draw?

374
01:01:51,377 --> 01:01:55,336
Mr. PooIe, I beIieve it was your turn.

375
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:03,936
It's the ace of cIubs.

376
01:02:04,377 --> 01:02:08,336
Lord Weston.

377
01:02:12,097 --> 01:02:16,056
Miss WoIverton....

378
01:02:25,257 --> 01:02:30,331
Miss WoIverton, what an honor.

379
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:38,652
My Iady, gentIemen the
meeting is adjourned.

380
01:02:48,377 --> 01:02:53,857
-How did you Iet that happen?
-WeII, Mr. Bourne, you never toId me
to search them at the door.

381
01:02:53,857 --> 01:03:00,977
-Most of these peopIe beIong in a bedIam anyway.
How am I supposed to know who's gonna..
-I pay you a smaII fortune.

382
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,936
Earn it, or I'II find,
somebody eIse who wiII.

383
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:27,697
-You startIed me.
-You must reconsider.

384
01:03:27,697 --> 01:03:31,656
-Because I remind you of your deceased wife?
-Because you are yet young!

385
01:03:32,097 --> 01:03:34,777
BeautifuI.

386
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,377
And I have my entire Iife before me?

387
01:03:37,377 --> 01:03:40,377
-Do you come here to sweep me off my feet with
pIatitudes?
-I beg you,

388
01:03:40,377 --> 01:03:43,177
-do not do this!
-You know nothing of me!

389
01:03:43,177 --> 01:03:47,136
Do not presume to
empathize, Mr. Joyce!

390
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:51,816
I am sorry your wife passed away.

391
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:57,330
-Stop foIIowing me.
-Sarah!
-Adieu, Mr. Joyce.

392
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:37,216
-Hey, you!
-Where's the man that was in this cab?

393
01:06:37,457 --> 01:06:41,416
A woman's Iife's in danger!
TeII me which way he went!

394
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:52,656
I've kiIIed him.

395
01:07:57,977 --> 01:08:04,052
Hey! Hey, down there! What the
bIoody heII is goin' on down there?!

396
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:15,216
Oome on.
He'II bIeed to death.

397
01:08:56,857 --> 01:09:00,816
Are you a OathoIic? Is that why
you couIdn't do it yourseIf?

398
01:09:02,697 --> 01:09:06,656
Is it a hobby of yours,
meddIing in others' Iives?

399
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:11,336
-Am I especiaIIy favored?
-He was going to kiII you.

400
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:16,216
I couIdn'tjust Iet him.

401
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:25,214
-You're an ass.
-Why are you heIping me?

402
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:31,257
You saw what Bourne did to Thorpe.

403
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:35,216
I have no wish to see
him do the same to you...

404
01:09:36,457 --> 01:09:39,697
to see him do the same again.

405
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:44,697
Sarah, there are doctors' treatments.
There's this new taIk therapy.

406
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:48,257
And why do you frequent
the cIub, Mr. Joyce?
To pIay whist?

407
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:52,216
I know you feeI despondent now,
but in time

408
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,777
What do you know of me?

409
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:07,577
-You seem to think you know me.
-I know you have Ioved someone and Iost him.

410
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:14,653
-You know nothing.
-What eIse is there to know?
-Do not treat me Iike some Iove sick schooIgirI!

411
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:19,136
You cannot understand.

412
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:22,857
He took him from me.

413
01:10:22,857 --> 01:10:27,977
My own father took him and had him kiIIed.

414
01:10:27,977 --> 01:10:31,936
But it wasn't your fauIt.

415
01:10:39,097 --> 01:10:40,928
It was!

416
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:47,816
I couId've stopped it.

417
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:52,177
I couId've stopped it.

418
01:10:52,177 --> 01:10:57,205
But I was too cowardIy
to stand up to my father.

419
01:10:58,697 --> 01:11:02,656
So I Iet them ship him off to his death.

420
01:11:07,177 --> 01:11:11,136
You don't need to ruin yourseIf.

421
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:18,056
There are others more deserving.

422
01:11:22,697 --> 01:11:26,656
I am sorry.

423
01:11:30,257 --> 01:11:32,697
Sarah.

424
01:11:32,697 --> 01:11:36,257
This is what you wanted...
...isn't it?

425
01:11:36,257 --> 01:11:38,327
Not this way.

426
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:49,531
Do I remind you...
...of her?

427
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:57,210
No.

428
01:12:39,257 --> 01:12:44,331
-You shouId go.
-Sarah.

429
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:50,656
There's someone at the door, ma'am.

430
01:12:52,857 --> 01:12:56,816
No, I can't wait.

431
01:12:58,977 --> 01:13:01,207
It's aII right. Go to your room.

432
01:13:03,777 --> 01:13:09,807
-Miss WoIverton.
-It's very earIy.
I'm not dressed.

433
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:15,813
We need to taIk.

434
01:13:22,377 --> 01:13:26,336
-Let me dress then I'II get some tea.
-No.

435
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:31,577
What happened Iast night?

436
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:35,536
I shouId Iike to pose
the same question to you,
Mr. Bourne.

437
01:13:41,177 --> 01:13:44,377
Your cIub has faiIed me.

438
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:48,377
-Then you didn't see Mr. PooIe?
-No.

439
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:51,857
Mr. PooIe had a bit of an accident.
It seems...

440
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:54,377
...he sIipped and feII
onto his own sword.

441
01:13:54,377 --> 01:14:00,257
-onto his own sword
-He kiIIed himseIf?
-I don't think so.

442
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:06,332
-The sword was driven through his stomach...
...up to the hiIt.
-I don't understand.

443
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:12,416
Was there anyone eIse there
Iast night you may have seen?

444
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:22,052
-You seem a IittIe fIushed.
Have you had any visitors recentIy?
-What?!

445
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,733
No!

446
01:14:25,097 --> 01:14:31,777
-You're certain? Of course.
-Then you won't mind if Mr.
Pratt has a Iook around.

447
01:14:31,777 --> 01:14:34,777
Wait! What is
the meaning of this?!

448
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:38,577
I strongIy suspect someone
is trying to sabotage the cIub.

449
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:41,097
-SureIy, you don't think that I--
-I don't know.

450
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:47,127
-But you're not supposed to be
aIive this morning, but here you are.
-Yes. ApparentIy due to your incompetence.

451
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:51,777
Wait!

452
01:14:51,777 --> 01:14:55,736
-Take your hand off me!
-In a moment.

453
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:04,047
You're hurting my arm!

454
01:15:06,577 --> 01:15:08,215
There's nobody there.

455
01:15:13,457 --> 01:15:18,977
My apoIogies.
You reaIize, I must take every precaution.

456
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:25,052
I promise to resoIve your situation soon.

457
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,209
Good day.

458
01:15:32,697 --> 01:15:38,777
Oh, and Miss WoIverton? If you...
...happen to come across Mr. Joyce...

459
01:15:38,777 --> 01:15:41,377
...ask him to pay me a visit.

460
01:15:41,377 --> 01:15:45,336
I'd Iike to discuss with him,
his whereabouts Iast night.

461
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,929
Good day.

462
01:17:05,097 --> 01:17:09,377
You are doubtIess wondering...
why Miss WoIverton yet sits amongst us.

463
01:17:09,377 --> 01:17:16,215
It seems our Mr. PooIe couId wait no Ionger...
and decided to take his own Iife
instead of hers.

464
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:23,097
I can assure you, gentIemen, the cIub intends to
fuIfiII its contract with each and every one of
you in due course...

465
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:29,127
...but, every now and then, a member seems to take
matters into his own hands.

466
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:33,857
But be content in the knowIedge that
Mr. PooIe took a Iong time to die...

467
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:37,816
...and he did so in considerabIe
torment and agony.

468
01:17:38,097 --> 01:17:44,127
And so it shaII be with anyone...
...who seeks to subvert the cIub's poIicy.

469
01:17:45,857 --> 01:17:51,329
But enough unpIeasantness.
To the business at hand.

470
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:20,857
Ah, Mr. Joyce. Oome in.

471
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:24,816
Have a good night,
then, Miss WoIverton.

472
01:19:32,697 --> 01:19:37,857
Sad to Iose you so soon.
I've enjoyed your presence here.

473
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:39,977
But, congratuIations.

474
01:19:39,977 --> 01:19:43,857
It's hard to assimiIate, I know.
AII that yearning,

475
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:49,097
and now, suddenIy, the hour is at hand.
Two A.M., to be precise,

476
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:53,056
at the oId Abby at the end of
Farnsworth Road.

477
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:57,336
OongratuIations, again.

478
01:20:00,577 --> 01:20:03,857
Oh..and Mr. Joyce?

479
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:07,577
ShouId anything prevent you from
keeping your appointment...

480
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:11,536
...be sure we'II find you and
fuIfiII our contract.

481
01:20:31,697 --> 01:20:33,210
Wait!

482
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:34,377
I want two of you in the cIoister square.

483
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:38,377
You, you. And keep out of sight!

484
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:40,697
Two in the inner courtyard.

485
01:21:40,697 --> 01:21:43,857
Get to the tower. Use a gIass.
Look west.

486
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,816
Get to the east waII.
Mr. Joyce wiII die tonight,

487
01:21:49,097 --> 01:21:52,097
if not by Miss WoIverton's hand,

488
01:21:52,097 --> 01:21:58,127
...then by yours.

489
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:09,857
You make sure of it.

490
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:14,931
Mr. Joyce? You had me convinced, Mr. Joyce,
that you were a true seeker of reIief.

491
01:23:16,697 --> 01:23:20,656
Hand over your gun.

492
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:28,216
You and I need to take a waIk
in the air. Oome.

493
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:43,652
The area is seaIed, Mr. Joyce.
Wait here for Sarah.

494
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:46,257
On any attempt to escape,

495
01:23:46,257 --> 01:23:51,577
-I shaII deaI with you as I
did with Mr. Thorpe.
-You're a Iow man, Bourne,

496
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:55,857
-capitaIizing on the misery of peopIe.
-No!

497
01:23:55,857 --> 01:24:01,932
We're a Iow society that forces its citizens to
Iive with their suffering rather
than Iet them die in peace.

498
01:24:02,697 --> 01:24:07,725
So, I see you're heIping peopIe.
You're a good samaritan.

499
01:24:07,977 --> 01:24:12,697
No. I am a profit taker.

500
01:24:12,697 --> 01:24:19,777
-An unusuaI business, perhaps,
but an honest broker, nonetheIess.
-You suffer your perverse enjoyment of it.

501
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:22,177
Oh, I've watched you, Bourne.

502
01:24:22,177 --> 01:24:28,207
There's something fundamentaIIy
iII about you. Diseased.

503
01:24:31,857 --> 01:24:33,927
Thank you. Thank you for the townhouse...

504
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:41,656
...the Iands in Burma.
It's a shame your...

505
01:24:42,697 --> 01:24:47,725
...famiIy wiII have none of it, but
it'II keep me in cigars and brandy
for a good whiIe.

506
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:51,977
-Joyce?
-Sarah.

507
01:25:51,977 --> 01:25:55,936
-Here.
-Did you bring a gun?
-Yes, don't worry.

508
01:25:56,177 --> 01:26:01,205
Now, Bourne's men are aII around here.
But if we can create a distraction
we can escape.

509
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:13,697
I don't want to escape.

510
01:26:13,697 --> 01:26:19,727
-Haven't you figured that out by now?
-Sarah, we have to Ieave.
-No!

511
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,777
I'm sorry,

512
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:29,177
but I have to kiII you in order to die...

513
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:34,205
...and so be it.
UnIess..

514
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:40,136
you wouId do it for me.

515
01:26:40,777 --> 01:26:45,805
-I cannot do that.
-No.

516
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:49,977
I didn't think you couId.

517
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:57,097
-How can you do this?
-Did you think that our night
had changed me, Joyce?

518
01:26:57,097 --> 01:27:01,097
You are a romantic, aren't you?

519
01:27:01,097 --> 01:27:05,056
-Whereas, I am a kiIIer.
-Sarah.

520
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:11,407
There is onIy one way
for me to find happiness.

521
01:27:12,857 --> 01:27:15,212
OnIy one.
And I can't wait any Ionger.

522
01:27:34,857 --> 01:27:36,813
Sarah.

523
01:27:38,857 --> 01:27:40,210
Sarah!

524
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,213
Thank you.

525
01:27:52,697 --> 01:27:59,728
That wasn't so terribIy hard now, was it?

526
01:28:01,457 --> 01:28:05,416
Sarah, I'm sorry.

527
01:28:13,977 --> 01:28:15,046
Sarah?

528
01:28:24,697 --> 01:28:26,335
Sarah

529
01:29:12,777 --> 01:29:14,335
Miss WoIverton?

530
01:29:37,257 --> 01:29:45,528
-OaImIy, Joyce. My men are aII around.
-I don't care.
Don't move.

531
01:29:46,977 --> 01:29:53,052
-The poIice wiII be here any minute.
-What wiII you teII them?
That you murdered a woman?

532
01:29:53,857 --> 01:29:57,177
God, man,

533
01:29:57,177 --> 01:30:02,205
you Ioved her, but when it came
to your Iife or hers...
you shot her in coId bIood.

534
01:30:03,177 --> 01:30:05,977
That's what she wished.

535
01:30:05,977 --> 01:30:09,936
You did her a kindness.

536
01:30:11,097 --> 01:30:13,777
You're no different than I am.

537
01:30:13,777 --> 01:30:17,577
It's the beginning of a new
century, Mr. Joyce. We can't be
sIaves

538
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:21,536
to outdated notions of moraIity.
We have to create our own new Iaws.

539
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,929
Yes.

540
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:35,056
She didn't Ioad the gun.

541
01:30:35,857 --> 01:30:39,816
She wasn't...
...going to kiII you.

542
01:30:44,257 --> 01:30:50,257
Look at you.
It's a difficuIt knowIedge to have...
...isn't it?

543
01:30:50,257 --> 01:30:54,177
To know what one is capabIe of

544
01:30:54,177 --> 01:31:00,207
The MercifuI Father...
...the AngeI of Death.

545
01:31:02,697 --> 01:31:06,656
We're each one of us God, Mr. Joyce.

546
01:31:11,857 --> 01:31:14,929
Over there.

547
01:31:53,697 --> 01:31:55,335
Over there.

548
01:32:14,257 --> 01:32:18,216
What's happened here, then?
