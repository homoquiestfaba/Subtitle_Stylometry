1
00:00:01,828 --> 00:00:04,661
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:20,538
(cheerful music)

3
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,168
(horn blares)

4
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,860
(smacks)

5
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,808
- Have you got that rat with you?

6
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,168
Have you?

7
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,688
If you brought that rat with you,

8
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,258
the captain's gonna turn
this boat right around

9
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,469
and no one'll be going anywhere.

10
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,458
You understand?

11
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,526
Be a nice start to a
vacation, now wouldn't it?

12
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:22,859
Let me see the other pocket.

13
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:24,939
- Hi, Mom.

14
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,919
(dramatic music)

15
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,769
- [Captain] On behalf of Catalina Cruises,

16
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,489
this is your captain.

17
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:51,769
- Seasick?

18
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,437
- [Captain] As promised,
it's been a smooth crossing.

19
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,758
We're only a few minutes
away from Catalina Island,

20
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,737
here in the sunny southern California.

21
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:02,497
Thank you, have a good
visit on the island.

22
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:04,529
- Hi, how are you doing?

23
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,416
Are you going to Catalina too?

24
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,777
I'm going to see my dad.

25
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:08,610
He lives there.

26
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,277
- Billy, who are you talking to?

27
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:14,521
- No one.

28
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:17,832
- Right, thank you.

29
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,048
We need to have a little talk.

30
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,118
You wanna live with your father, fine,

31
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,940
but you're gonna have to grow up.

32
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,718
One of you will have to.

33
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,219
Every toddler talks to their toys.

34
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,588
You're still doing it.

35
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:39,009
(laughs)

36
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,518
- Mom.

37
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,188
- Broccoli can't talk.

38
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,591
Nor can trees, frogs,
caterpillars, white mice, rats,

39
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,230
snakes, cats, or dogs.

40
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,063
- I know.

41
00:03:58,663 --> 00:03:59,823
- What do you think?

42
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,240
(dog whines)

43
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,354
Yeah, me too.

44
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,402
(sighs)

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
15 across.

46
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,973
Over your head and on top of your mouth.

47
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,951
Must be an American word like
popsicle or Ranch dressing.

48
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,271
- Roof.

49
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,104
- Roof?

50
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:32,522
Roof!

51
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,533
Over your head and the roof of your mouth.

52
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,002
Okay.

53
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:40,585
12 down, where you get tied up.

54
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:43,464
- Wharf.

55
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,058
- Wharf?

56
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,310
Wharf!

57
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,621
Where you tie up boats.

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,454
No, wharf doesn't fit.

59
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,050
- How many letters, huh?

60
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,633
- How many letters?

61
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,303
Four.

62
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,386
- Okay, fort, pier, dock.

63
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,495
(whirring)

64
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:18,162
- William dear, could you
get me some dog food, please?

65
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,162
- Of course, no problem.

66
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:36,173
(dramatic music)

67
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,684
- There you are.

68
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,613
So, welcome to Catalina.

69
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,551
- What's with the golf carts?

70
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,040
- It's a way small island.

71
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,960
- We patrol in golf carts?

72
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,793
- No way.

73
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:11,429
Hey, golf carts are the best.

74
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:15,012
Way less pollution,
cheap, no traffic jams.

75
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,371
- What's with your foot?

76
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,251
- Golf cart.

77
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:29,887
- Mrs. Bent--

78
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,720
Mrs. Bentley!

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,585
Look out!

80
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:33,668
Mrs. Bentley, behind you!

81
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,396
Stop, stop, stop that thing!

82
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:45,229
Stop that!

83
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,416
(crashes)

84
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,649
(grunts)

85
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,948
- What's the cop doing?

86
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:14,177
- He's getting in the truck.

87
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,356
- What's that dog doing?

88
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:16,828
- He's sitting on the ground.

89
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:18,916
- [Man In Black Shirt]
Man, I hate police dogs.

90
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,749
- Come on.

91
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,348
- Come on, come on.

92
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:24,329
- Now you're talking.

93
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,137
- [Mike] Let's go check out the ferry.

94
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:30,970
They have to be getting the
drugs onto the island somehow.

95
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,676
Hey, what's going on?

96
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,509
Let us out!

97
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,814
I'm a police officer!

98
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:38,647
Hey!

99
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,189
Get up there.

100
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,499
(mumbles), what can you see?

101
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,579
- What do you think?

102
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,412
Houses.

103
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,585
- [Mike] Now what can you see?

104
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:58,355
- More houses.

105
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,188
Oh!

106
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,506
- [Mike] Sherlock?

107
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:05,339
Sherlock!

108
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:08,409
Sherlock!

109
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,805
(grunts)

110
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,218
(groans)

111
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,435
(gasps)

112
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,066
(screams)

113
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,239
- There's rats out there!

114
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,479
(groans)

115
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,766
(horn blares)

116
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,678
(gagging)

117
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,879
(sirens)

118
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:29,362
- I don't know what happened.

119
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,089
I don't want to know.

120
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,922
I just know it's always something.

121
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,043
Here.

122
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,528
Towards food.

123
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,361
- Oh no, thanks.

124
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,010
I'm fine.

125
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,631
I got a part time job here.

126
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,549
- [Announcer] We are now
boarding Catalina Island,

127
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,969
return to Los Angeles.

128
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:51,922
We apologize for the delay.

129
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:55,089
We remind you again, no pets on board.

130
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,730
And please use extra care
when walking on the dock.

131
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,563
- Love you.

132
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:02,890
- [Announcer] It may still
be a little slippery.

133
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,404
Thank you.

134
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,612
- Oh, I'm cooking lunch!

135
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:07,445
Sausages.

136
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:12,731
(gagging)

137
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,977
- How's the Turt?

138
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,247
- Turt's good.

139
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:22,414
I think I've got all the glitches out.

140
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:32,777
Billy, you know this
is just a trial visit.

141
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,610
- I know.

142
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:35,836
But you're gonna sell the Turt

143
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,316
and you're gonna have lots of money

144
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,828
and I can come live with you.

145
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,314
- But your mom has to agree.

146
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:44,897
She thinks I'm a bad influence.

147
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,480
- I don't think so.

148
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,012
(calm music)

149
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,253
- So, what happened on the ferry?

150
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:36,408
- Stuff.

151
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,778
What happened to the car?

152
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,486
- Stuff.

153
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:49,590
- Oh, whoa!

154
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:54,626
- Oh!

155
00:12:57,797 --> 00:12:59,880
(groans)

156
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,951
(dogs barking)

157
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:11,784
- Doctor.

158
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,942
- (mumbles) that end.

159
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,107
Are you okay?

160
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,690
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

161
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,268
- Is he yours?

162
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:35,730
- We were just coming back from the ferry.

163
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,120
- [Sally] Thanks for bringing him in.

164
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,617
Most drivers don't.

165
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,117
- Is he gonna die?

166
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,974
- Looks like a survivor to me.

167
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:48,393
No license tag.

168
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,093
- Is that bad?

169
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:52,322
- Means he's probably a stray.

170
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:55,122
Means I won't get paid for treating him.

171
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:58,372
And it means he'll end up in the pound.

172
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,481
- Then what?

173
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,253
- No one claims him or adopts
him, he's put to sleep.

174
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:10,336
(whines)

175
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,151
- Mom, Mom!

176
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,162
It was so gross, there's vomit everywhere.

177
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:19,914
They had to hose down the whole dock.

178
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:20,794
- My daughter.

179
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,983
- This mutant moron was talking
to his rat on the ferry.

180
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,160
- [Sally] Mutant moron?

181
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,442
- Mom, talking to a rat?

182
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:29,192
The kid's special ed.

183
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:34,485
Oh, hi.

184
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:39,034
- I don't think anything's broken.

185
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,034
This'll make him sleepy.

186
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:45,794
I'll take him in there and X-ray him,

187
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:49,870
and I'll put a couple of
stitches in that wound.

188
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,923
- [Man] Excuse me, Doctor?

189
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:52,792
- Right.

190
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,625
There.

191
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,925
(kisses)

192
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:57,994
While we're waiting for this to work,

193
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,895
maybe Emma could fix you something?

194
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,813
- Peanut butter and jelly shake?

195
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:02,646
- Ah.

196
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:05,189
Can I help?

197
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,186
(gentle music)

198
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:22,474
- Hey, let's see him.

199
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:23,307
- Who?

200
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:24,140
- The rat.

201
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,993
- Oh, he ran away.

202
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:29,493
- Maybe you said something he didn't like.

203
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:33,303
- [Sherlock Bones] Psst, psst.

204
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,393
- Go away.

205
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,653
- Hey buddy, go get the telephone.

206
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,965
Go on, lad, I've got to make a phone call.

207
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:41,893
Hurry, before the injection kicks in.

208
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,976
Go on, lad, fetch, fetch.

209
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,386
- Dad, Dad, Dad!

210
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,165
Dad, he can talk!

211
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,165
He can talk!

212
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,503
- Billy, I thought the place was on fire.

213
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,423
- He can talk!

214
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,394
- Who can talk?

215
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,834
- He can.

216
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,584
He just talked to me.

217
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,547
- The dog?

218
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:09,962
- Go on, this is my dad.

219
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,872
Go on, say something.

220
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:18,522
- Billy.

221
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:19,362
- He can talk.

222
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,911
He has a funny accent and everything.

223
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,391
Say something.

224
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,808
Tell him to go get the phone.

225
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:31,696
- Billy.

226
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,867
- I'd better get back.

227
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,783
- Quick.

228
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:49,822
- [Billy] Why'd you do that?

229
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,572
- I no talk to people, lad, okay?

230
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,124
- I no what?

231
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:57,291
- I do not talk to people.

232
00:16:58,906 --> 00:16:59,986
- You talked to me.

233
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,426
- You're a kid.

234
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,259
- So?

235
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,342
- So no one believes you.

236
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,405
This is urgent.

237
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:09,822
Go get the phone.

238
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:17,375
Come on, the injection's
making me very sleepy.

239
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,314
- You're gonna make a phone call?

240
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:21,481
- No, I'm going to eat it.

241
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:23,259
911.

242
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:25,805
- That's the police.

243
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,626
- [Sherlock Bones] Dial.

244
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,258
- 911.

245
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,317
- Come on, come on.

246
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,734
Code 38, code 38.

247
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,200
Police officer kidnapped.

248
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,114
- [Operator] Hello, hello?

249
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:43,947
Hello?

250
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:44,780
- Hi.

251
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:46,934
This is Billy.

252
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:54,058
I think he said a police
officer had been kidnapped.

253
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,891
He's sort of a friend.

254
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,211
I'm 10.

255
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,087
Come on, come on.

256
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,826
Say something.

257
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:03,659
Please.

258
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,287
- I hope that's not long distance.

259
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,120
Mom hates it when dogs
run up big phone bills.

260
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,940
(shouts)

261
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,607
- I'm sorry, I'll have it towed.

262
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,202
- Whoa, Waynester.

263
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,029
Neighbor's cat got caught up a tree.

264
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:40,279
Let's go, dude.

265
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,162
- Excuse me, sir!

266
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:44,995
- What?

267
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:46,082
- Has anybody been kidnapped?

268
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:46,915
- What?

269
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:48,706
- I think your police
officer's been kidnapped.

270
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:49,549
- Go away.

271
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,351
- Like yesterday, or today.

272
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:52,851
- [Wayne] Go away.

273
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,439
- Mom's got a car phone if he needs it.

274
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,272
- Who?

275
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,430
- The dog.

276
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,263
- Shut up.

277
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,064
- What's your dad doing?

278
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,499
- He designs toys.

279
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:16,166
- What kind of toys?

280
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,368
- Well, this is one of them.

281
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,819
It's a Turt.

282
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:23,859
- A turd?

283
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:24,909
- Emma.

284
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,458
- Sorry.

285
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,910
- Turt.

286
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,743
Totally Underwater Robotic Turtle.

287
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,899
- What's it do?

288
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,568
- Teaches kids to swim.

289
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:37,608
And Dad's gonna sell it
to a big toy company.

290
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:41,858
- Dad's gonna try and sell
it to a big toy company.

291
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,217
Excuse me just a moment.

292
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:56,630
Mrs. Bentley.

293
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,950
Mrs...

294
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,533
Mrs., Mrs. Bentley.

295
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,659
I forgot to get your dog--

296
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,633
- After any kind of shock,

297
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,985
animals and people can
get very dehydrated.

298
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:15,532
Do you know what dehydration is?

299
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,974
Give him lots of water when he wakes up

300
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:20,134
and keep an eye on him.

301
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,545
If he starts to bite off the splint,

302
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,684
you'll have to distract him, talk to him.

303
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:24,851
- Talk to him?

304
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,412
- Oh, yes, right.

305
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:34,643
You see, there's talking to animals

306
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,155
and then there's talking to--

307
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,334
- Neat house.

308
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,625
What are these for?

309
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,636
- They're spare eyeballs for the Turt.

310
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,204
- Alright!

311
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:45,396
Mom, can we stay for dinner?

312
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:46,873
- Oh, I didn't know we'd been invited.

313
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:47,945
- We haven't yet.

314
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,862
Can we stay for dinner?

315
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,524
- Dinner?

316
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:53,396
Dinner!

317
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:54,916
Oh, yes.

318
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,224
Right.

319
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:57,494
- [Emma] Come on, I'm starved.

320
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:58,327
- Emma.

321
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:01,913
For some reason or other,
we're not invited out often.

322
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,292
Try not to blow it.

323
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,463
- Okay.

324
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,593
I'll bet you're a terrible cook.

325
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:08,694
- Don't get too attached.

326
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:10,777
He may belong to someone.

327
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,264
- Um.

328
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,325
Could he be a policeman's dog?

329
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:21,668
- Yeah.

330
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:26,105
The police use Airedales a
lot, especially the British.

331
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,412
It's a Scottish breed.

332
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,245
- Scottish?

333
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,406
- Like my grandfather.

334
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:32,931
Aye, lass, I don't think
you're gettin' any bigger.

335
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,368
- Can you talk to people?

336
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:37,248
- Where'd you learn Scots?

337
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,808
- Oh.

338
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:39,808
Um, from TV.

339
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,087
- Did you know that you can cook food

340
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:50,928
by passing electric current through it?

341
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:52,760
- (mumbles) of course.

342
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,657
If you want to stay,
you should wear these.

343
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:55,490
- Ah.

344
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,510
Maybe I should have my calls forwarded.

345
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,651
Can I use your phone?

346
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:07,699
- Of course.

347
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,282
Everyone like corn?

348
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,290
(shouts)

349
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,193
- Got it.

350
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,707
- [William] Over there.

351
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,328
Good!

352
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:27,470
- Dad took it apart to make this one.

353
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,092
It's for kids' use.

354
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:31,101
It's unbreakable.

355
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,429
- That's a phone?

356
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:33,262
- Yeah.

357
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,718
You have to kinda dribble.

358
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:39,685
Like that.

359
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,113
- [Operator] Good evening.

360
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,196
At the tone, Pacific
daylight time, 6:57 exactly.

361
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,686
And that's how you hang it up.

362
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:58,559
Okay?

363
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,392
- Oh.

364
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,479
- [William] There's one!

365
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,398
Over there, on the brick!

366
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:15,951
No, no the other one.

367
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:16,940
- Got it.

368
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,440
- Yeah, that's it.

369
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:21,752
No.

370
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:24,770
Over here.

371
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,853
You get those over there.

372
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,626
I got this one here.

373
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:30,564
Yeah, on the right.

374
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:34,231
- Do you think there
are any animals that...

375
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,898
- Any animals that what?

376
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:38,731
- Talk?

377
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,559
- You know the main difference
between animals and people?

378
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,660
There isn't one.

379
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,324
Different species are
better at different things.

380
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:52,096
Humans do certain kinds
of thinking better.

381
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:53,596
- [Emma] I got it!

382
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:57,421
- But--

383
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,298
- [Emma] Keep going, keep going!

384
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,565
- The animals do communicate.

385
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,645
(glass breaking)

386
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:03,478
- Stop.

387
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,676
Dinner's ready.

388
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,525
- The theory behind
plug in food isn't new,

389
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:13,192
it's making it work.

390
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:18,105
- No, no, no, they taste fine.

391
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,274
You been on the island long?

392
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:25,184
- Oh, it's my second year.

393
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,434
It's a great place to work.

394
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:31,565
How about you?

395
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:33,466
- Oh, I was born here.

396
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:36,565
I went away to school but I was born here.

397
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:38,794
- Then when she knew she was
gonna have me, she came back

398
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,135
so I could be an islander too.

399
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:44,495
- A shock the island
may never recover from.

400
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,725
- Because she wasn't married.

401
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,045
I'm illegitimate.

402
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:48,878
Neat, huh?

403
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,643
- Emma belongs to the hit them
over the head with a brick

404
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:55,310
school of chit chat.

405
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:58,695
- Dad, can we try the Turt?

406
00:24:58,695 --> 00:24:59,528
- Sure.

407
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,464
Tomorrow's the big day.

408
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:04,762
- You try to sell it?

409
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:05,595
- Right.

410
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,204
- Then I can come live with him.

411
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:10,704
- That's the plan.

412
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:19,896
- I think the gearing's broken again.

413
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,628
- It's just a loose screw.

414
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:30,933
- So, does it have a temperature?

415
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,873
- Coffee?

416
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:37,773
- That'd be great.

417
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,253
Here, let me give you a hand with this.

418
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:40,451
- Oh, no, no!

419
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,034
We've got a system.

420
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:44,067
- Alright!

421
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,896
(laughs)

422
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,164
- Billy, did that plant just move?

423
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,674
- Yeah.

424
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:05,874
They're on a turntable, so
that the sun gets to all sides.

425
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:09,485
- You suppose your dad
has any wine glasses left?

426
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,903
(glasses whistling)

427
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,153
(laughing)

428
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,031
(whines)

429
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:09,985
(ominous music)

430
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:55,683
(dog barking)

431
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,528
(calm music)

432
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,028
- Hey, wake up.

433
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:06,445
Wake up, come on, talk to me.

434
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,099
(rattling)

435
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:48,068
- [Man] Hello, hello?

436
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,588
What kind of pizza you want?

437
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:50,887
Hello, hello, hello?

438
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:53,049
Come on, I don't got all day, I'm busy.

439
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,906
What kind of pizza you want?

440
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,656
- What are you doing?

441
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:01,796
You were calling the
police again, weren't you?

442
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,140
(moaning)

443
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,212
What's the matter?

444
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,129
Don't you talk anymore?

445
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:12,671
- Billy.

446
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,041
- Oh.

447
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,708
- This is Sergeant
Turner and Officer Quail.

448
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,558
You didn't call 911 yesterday, did you?

449
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,825
I'm really sorry, will
you let me talk to him?

450
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:34,242
- Go for it, dad.

451
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,329
- Why did you think a
policeman had been kidnapped?

452
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:48,998
Did someone tell you to call the police?

453
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,008
So you were playing a game.

454
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,980
(whines)

455
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
- I'm sorry.

456
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:07,021
- Billy, I keep trying to
remember what being 10 was like.

457
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:09,405
- I know, I know.

458
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:13,245
I promise not to do it again.

459
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,169
- I have to go to work.

460
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:19,002
First day.

461
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:21,369
Mrs. Bentley's gonna fix you lunch.

462
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,727
You're gonna be okay for
a couple hours, right?

463
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:26,560
Okay.

464
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,336
We'll talk later.

465
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,621
Bye.

466
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:35,621
- Mmhm.

467
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,740
Right then, dad's gone.

468
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Get dialing.

469
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:45,820
- No.

470
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,653
- [Sherlock Bones] No?

471
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:50,820
- I promised Dad I wouldn't
call the police again.

472
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,379
Well, maybe if you'd talk to Dad.

473
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:55,212
- No.

474
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:56,111
- Why not?

475
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,769
- I no talk to people.

476
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,020
Keep telling them.

477
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,208
- Hey, where are you going?

478
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,249
- [Sherlock Bones] Down to the harbor.

479
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:04,082
- Hey!

480
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:06,747
Hey.

481
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:07,580
- What?

482
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:14,761
- I'll help you.

483
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,329
So, what's your name?

484
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:25,162
- What?

485
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:25,995
- What's your name?

486
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,408
I'm not gonna help you if
you don't tell me your name.

487
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,241
- Sherlock.

488
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,420
- Sherlock.

489
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,111
Sherlock what?

490
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,191
- You're a pedantic wee--

491
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,300
- Sherlock what?

492
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,133
- Bones.

493
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,327
- Sherlock Bones.

494
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:38,679
That's neat.

495
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,012
- Don't push it.

496
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:00,625
- What do you smell?

497
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,458
- Drugs.

498
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,567
- Drugs?

499
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,706
How do you know?

500
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:05,665
Oh yeah, that's right.

501
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,487
You're a police dog.

502
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,996
It must be great to be able to do that.

503
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,026
- [Sherlock Bones] No, it's not.

504
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:11,859
- [Billy] Why not?

505
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,586
- There's a lot of very
nasty things on sidewalks.

506
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:15,419
- Billy?

507
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:18,530
(crashes)

508
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,628
- Come on, come on.

509
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:29,677
- Where are we going?

510
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:33,094
- [Sherlock Bones] I've sniffed out Mike.

511
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:38,378
- And now, if you will
look up and to your left,

512
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:41,119
you'll be enthralled by
a rare and unique example

513
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,157
of Catalina tile.

514
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:46,138
Catalina tile is tile
made out of Catalina.

515
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,888
- Sorry, tour's full.

516
00:32:48,908 --> 00:32:50,548
- The Avalon Casino,

517
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:53,079
which is a registered historic monument,

518
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,258
only has two floors because
they have very high ceilings.

519
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,091
- Sherlock.

520
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:59,526
- [Emma] Downstairs is
the famous Casino Theater

521
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:03,109
and upstairs is the
famous Casino Ballroom.

522
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:05,230
- Come on.

523
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:11,168
- The Avalon Casino, which is
almost completely circular,

524
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,988
was built by William Raven,

525
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:15,571
who was famous for chewing gum.

526
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,359
He started building it in 1928

527
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,026
and didn't finish it until 1929.

528
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,508
Because he had to remove a mountain first.

529
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,719
- Excuse me.

530
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:34,318
But if there's no gambling,
why is it called a casino?

531
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:35,438
- Beats me.

532
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,108
And now, before we go upstairs

533
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,999
to the spacious Casino Ballroom,

534
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,877
we'll have a few minutes to buy some

535
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:43,719
of the very modestly
priced, tacky souvenirs

536
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,219
at the other end of the foyer.

537
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:52,159
No dogs allowed.

538
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,708
- But we're looking for Mike.

539
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,898
- Mike?

540
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:56,587
- The police officer that was kidnapped.

541
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:58,970
- What police officer?

542
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,387
- Sherlock Bones.

543
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,290
This is Sherlock Bones.

544
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,687
He sniffs out drugs.

545
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:06,698
Except his handler, Mike, was kidnapped

546
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,397
by the two drug smugglers
and now we've gotta find him.

547
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,647
- How do you know all this?

548
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,142
Let me guess, the dog told you.

549
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:19,850
I thought you were gonna be fun.

550
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,683
Grow up.

551
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:24,490
- Sherlock, say something to her.

552
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,930
Please, she's a kid too!

553
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,763
- What?

554
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:30,010
- I said I wouldn't kid you.

555
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,138
- Ha.

556
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,748
- No, no, it wasn't the dog.

557
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:34,038
I overheard this man.

558
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:34,871
- A man?

559
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,338
What man?

560
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:38,599
Talking to himself?

561
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,432
- Yes.

562
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,279
No.

563
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,329
Two men, talking to each other.

564
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,608
- I don't believe you.

565
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:44,730
- No, really.

566
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,813
One was fat, had a beard, and a limp.

567
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,716
And the other one, well, he didn't.

568
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:55,866
They were on the ferry yesterday

569
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:57,578
and I overheard them talking

570
00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:00,250
about how they were keeping
this policeman prisoner.

571
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,608
- Prisoner?

572
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:02,441
Where?

573
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,683
- Um...

574
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,137
In the casino.

575
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:16,908
- Here?

576
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,741
Where, in a trash can?

577
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,306
(grunts)

578
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,139
- No.

579
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,349
Uh, upstairs.

580
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,428
- That dog's got ear mites.

581
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:37,519
- And Sherlock Bones is gonna
track him down upstairs.

582
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,936
- They're never gonna let a dog upstairs.

583
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:43,977
Quick, I've got an idea.

584
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,644
(playful music)

585
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:50,170
Sorry, I'm sorry!

586
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,708
Come on, follow me.

587
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,799
Follow me, come on.

588
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,588
Up here, come on.

589
00:35:54,588 --> 00:35:56,356
This way, this way.

590
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:57,856
Come on, hurry up.

591
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,850
On our way upstairs to
the spacious ballroom,

592
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,696
you'll notice that there are no stairs.

593
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,696
(gasps)

594
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,079
The ballroom was used
extensively by the big bands

595
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,159
in the 30s and the 40s.

596
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,317
- Excuse me.

597
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,039
What kind of music did they play?

598
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,539
- Sorry, you're only allowed one question.

599
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,788
These ramps were specially designed

600
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:40,119
to help move the large
groups of dance goers

601
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,010
and avoid people being trampled.

602
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,446
The ballroom dance floor is
also almost completely circular,

603
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:47,613
180 feet wide.

604
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,464
- Stop staring.

605
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,297
- Why?

606
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,630
He can't see me.

607
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:07,584
- If you'll all pass through
the doors onto the balcony

608
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:12,417
you'll be treated to a
breathtaking view of Avalon Harbor.

609
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,077
- Aha.

610
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:27,958
- Where are we going?

611
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,187
- Come on, lad.
- Sherlock.

612
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:30,553
- Over here, over here.

613
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:33,970
- Ow, oh, ow, oh, ow, oh, uh, oh, ow, oh!

614
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,162
- Come on, lad.

615
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,995
Come on, come on, you weigh a ton.

616
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:45,438
Come on, try to keep up.

617
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:47,521
(shouts)

618
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,624
- Are you really blind?

619
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:02,249
(barks)

620
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:11,608
- Uh, Miss, that's not
a real seeing eye dog.

621
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,941
- Shh, he doesn't know that.

622
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,329
And now if you'll all step
outside onto the balcony,

623
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,627
you'll be treated to yet
another breathtaking...

624
00:38:20,627 --> 00:38:23,257
(shouts)

625
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,590
- Right, bingo, here we are.

626
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:29,438
Come on, stop lying around.

627
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:31,049
Yes, yes, yes.

628
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:32,489
- What can you smell?

629
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:36,406
- Beer, pizza, anchovies,
old socks, dead rats.

630
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:39,442
Hey!

631
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:41,919
Hey!

632
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:47,329
- Oh, sorry.

633
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:49,412
There's a door back here.

634
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:53,297
- Can you see anything?

635
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,415
- [Billy] There's someone in there.

636
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,248
- [Sherlock Bones] And?

637
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:56,297
- [Billy] And he's tied up with a rope.

638
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:57,657
- [Sherlock Bones] Does he have any hair?

639
00:38:57,657 --> 00:38:58,638
- [Billy] No.

640
00:38:58,638 --> 00:38:59,886
- [Sherlock Bones] That's Mike.

641
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,577
Go on, lad, now, would you?

642
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,609
- [Billy] He's got something.

643
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:04,768
- [Sherlock Bones] And?

644
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,601
And?

645
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,769
- [Billy] And he's
pushing it under the door.

646
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,852
(grunts)

647
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,827
- [Sherlock Bones] Right on my head.

648
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:15,417
Get it, get it.

649
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,250
- Got it.

650
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,529
It says Scotland Yard.

651
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:20,128
It's his police ID.

652
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:21,827
- Look out, lad, over there.

653
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,225
See the man with no neck?

654
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:25,315
- Who's that?

655
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:28,003
- One of the drug smugglers
who kidnapped Mike and me.

656
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:30,086
Get ready, get ready, go!

657
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:35,149
(squeaks)

658
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:37,937
- Hey!

659
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:40,020
(shouts)

660
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:51,611
(screams)

661
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,122
- The rat boy!

662
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:38,928
- No, no, I'm fine.

663
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:41,095
I've got it under control.

664
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,274
It's okay, it's okay.

665
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:57,524
(crashes)

666
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,037
Billy?

667
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,805
- Excuse me, sir, but
there's a policeman locked up

668
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:02,972
in the casino.

669
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,565
He's a police officer
and they've locked him up

670
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,296
behind where the band floor is.

671
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,129
- What?

672
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:10,962
- Mike.

673
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:11,854
- What Mike?

674
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:13,816
There's only two officers
on this stupid island,

675
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,184
Tom and Wayne.

676
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,434
- He gave me his police ID.

677
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:27,496
- He gave you his police ID?

678
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,424
Okay.

679
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,165
- It fell into the water.

680
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:31,403
Honest, I saw it.

681
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:32,965
And he's all tied up
with tape over his mouth

682
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:34,416
so that he can't call out.

683
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,736
- Billy.

684
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:37,936
- Tape over his mouth?

685
00:41:37,936 --> 00:41:42,904
How'd he tell you this,
sign language with his toes?

686
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:45,485
- Smugglers have been using
Catalina for 200 years.

687
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,568
Shouldn't we take a look?

688
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:51,698
Let's go.
- Let's go.

689
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:58,824
- Excuse me, wait a minute, please.

690
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:02,805
Excuse me, oh, wait a second, excuse me.

691
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:05,222
- It's okay, they're a group.

692
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:09,134
(dramatic music)

693
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,404
- [Wayne] 1912-11, 7F,

694
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:26,136
causing a disturbance in a public place.

695
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:28,419
- That was on the Catalina Ferry.

696
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,252
- Creating a panic, 19, 12-11-688,

697
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,874
causing a disturbance in a public place.

698
00:42:34,874 --> 00:42:36,006
- That was in the restaurant.

699
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:37,617
- Creating a panic.

700
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:42,316
172-14, making a false
report to a police officer

701
00:42:42,316 --> 00:42:45,737
concerning two nonexistent
men overheard on the ferry.

702
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:46,937
- Restaurant again.

703
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:50,937
- Creating a panic, 173-16,
sub-paragraph three,

704
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,489
making a false 911 call.

705
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,300
- Oh yes, well, we talked about that one.

706
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,108
- Didn't do much good, did it?

707
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:04,941
- Emma, why don't you
wait for me at the Jeep?

708
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:07,354
Tom.

709
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:15,856
- Come on, Wayne.

710
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:19,272
(calm music)

711
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:42,006
- Dad, I swear.

712
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,754
There was a man locked up in that room

713
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:50,266
and he gave me this, like,
wallet with a heavy metal badge

714
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:52,766
and it said Detective, honest.

715
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:59,007
- What about the two men you overheard?

716
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:01,396
The two men on the ferry?

717
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:03,313
- Well, I made them up.

718
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,967
- If I sell the Turt today,
things will be different.

719
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:15,384
We'll have money.

720
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:20,756
How can I tell your mom
you should live here

721
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:22,996
if you don't know the
difference between playing

722
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,163
and imagining?

723
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:30,738
- Dad, if I told you the truth...

724
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:34,709
- Try me.

725
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:39,915
- You wouldn't believe me.

726
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:45,378
- Why don't the kids come up to the house?

727
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:47,485
We've got a pool, the housekeeper's there,

728
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,067
and at least they could swim.

729
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,468
- Mom.

730
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,628
- [William] Very kind, thanks.

731
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:54,897
- But what about Sherlock Bones?

732
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:55,730
- Who?

733
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:57,552
- The dog.

734
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:04,468
- It's a very small island,
I'm sure someone will spot him.

735
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,268
- But only if you promise
not to go off again.

736
00:45:08,268 --> 00:45:10,101
Wanna hear you say it.

737
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:14,365
- I promise I won't go anywhere.

738
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:20,128
- Billy, it's when you
wander off by yourself.

739
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:22,559
I want you to promise not
to go anywhere without Emma

740
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,559
for the rest of the day.

741
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:27,839
- Promise not to go anywhere without Emma

742
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,839
for the rest of the day.

743
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,723
(gentle music)

744
00:46:01,732 --> 00:46:04,191
- [Emma] You coming in or not?

745
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,212
- I can't swim.

746
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:06,551
Look, the most have moved Mike somewhere

747
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:08,321
when they saw Sherlock Bones and me.

748
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:09,738
- You can't swim?

749
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:11,641
- No.

750
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:13,451
If we go together, we
can find Sherlock Bones

751
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:14,751
and he'll find Mike.

752
00:46:14,751 --> 00:46:16,501
- Why can't you swim?

753
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:18,972
- I don't know.

754
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:20,783
- Don't believe you.

755
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:22,283
Everyone can swim.

756
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:26,321
I'm gonna talk to your dad.

757
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:28,820
- If we got Mike's ID
back out of the harbor.

758
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,653
- Psst.

759
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,751
Psst.

760
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:33,860
Over here.

761
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,159
- What are you doing over there?

762
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,673
- [Sherlock Bones] Trying to get down.

763
00:46:36,673 --> 00:46:37,964
- Where have you been?

764
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:38,797
- Where?

765
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:39,924
The harbor.

766
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,257
- What were you doing there?

767
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:44,583
- Tracking Mike down.

768
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,541
- You found him?

769
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,611
- [Sherlock Bones] I'm a police dog.

770
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:47,975
Stop lying around.

771
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,174
- Where are we going?

772
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,615
- To rescue Mike.

773
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,575
We've got to get back to the harbor.

774
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:54,364
- Sherlock, wait, I can't.

775
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:55,362
- Come on, lad.

776
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:56,455
Nothing but excuses, excuses, excuses.

777
00:46:56,455 --> 00:46:58,823
- I promised Dad I wouldn't
go anywhere without Emma.

778
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:01,284
You've got to ask her to come too!

779
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:02,701
Sherlock, please.

780
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:06,255
If you just talk to Emma,
then she'd believe me

781
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:09,423
and we can all go and
look for Mike together.

782
00:47:09,423 --> 00:47:10,256
Please.

783
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,655
- I don't talk to people.

784
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:15,983
- You talk to me and I'm a person.

785
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:17,543
- Barely.

786
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,463
Come on, lad.

787
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,546
- Whoa, whoa!

788
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:21,305
Whoa!

789
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:26,513
- I called your dad at the restaurant.

790
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:29,063
You're right, you can't swim.

791
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,646
What are you doing?

792
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:37,713
- Emma, you've got to swear
not to tell a living soul.

793
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:40,356
- You've just discovered
you're from outer space, right?

794
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,743
Don't you hate it when that happens?

795
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,295
- Swear!

796
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,887
- Is this gonna be
something really retarded?

797
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:47,847
- Swear!

798
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:49,474
- Okay, okay.

799
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:51,345
On my mother's grave.

800
00:47:51,345 --> 00:47:52,486
- But your mother's not dead.

801
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:53,977
- Get on with it!

802
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:54,810
- Right.

803
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,465
Well...

804
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:59,487
Sherlock Bones has something
he wants to say to you.

805
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,320
Okay?

806
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,545
- Oh well, okay.

807
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:05,878
- See, see, see?

808
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:08,049
Go on.

809
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:11,196
- To be or not to be,
that is the question.

810
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:12,785
(smacks)

811
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:14,145
- Ow.

812
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:16,167
- My uncle does that at parties.

813
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,000
- What?

814
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,495
- Talks without moving his lips.

815
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,217
- Ah, but can he do the complete speech?

816
00:48:21,217 --> 00:48:22,050
- See?

817
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,327
You can see his lips moving.

818
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:25,244
- Dogs don't have lips.

819
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:29,530
- Oh, I find that very, very hurtful.

820
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:34,985
- Go on, say something, please.

821
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:39,985
♪ Oh say can you see by
the dawn's early light ♪

822
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:47,915
♪ What so proudly we hailed at
the twilight's last gleaming ♪

823
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:50,697
- Wow.

824
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:53,396
♪ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ♪

825
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:55,905

826
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:57,017
- Wow!

827
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,956

828
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:03,687
♪ And the liars were squealing ♪

829
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:04,935
- [Sherlock Bones] Or
words to that effect.

830
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:06,314
I don't think that's right.

831
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:07,767
Oh, never mind.

832
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:09,775
Let's go kick some American butt.

833
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:11,344
Come on, lads!

834
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:13,594
(whirring)

835
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:18,247
- Mom says animals talking
is theoretically possible

836
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,509
because we've all got language
centers in our brains,

837
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,437
even animals.

838
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:22,647
- Hey!

839
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:23,487
- Sorry.

840
00:49:23,487 --> 00:49:25,327
Ours are on the left except
in left-handed people,

841
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:26,160
they're on the right.

842
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,917
But everyone's got a language center.

843
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:31,498
- Oh, you probably have two or three.

844
00:49:31,498 --> 00:49:32,498
- Whoa.

845
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:35,407
- Yo kid, got your dad's wheels here.

846
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:39,824
- [Sherlock Bones] Oh, you
can just leave it outside.

847
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:44,138
- Sherlock, what are you doing?

848
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:45,075
- Oh yeah, you sure?

849
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:47,717
- Aye, my dad will be right back.

850
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:48,858
- Okay, here.

851
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:51,176
Take the page for me, will ya?

852
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:52,257
Dog friendly?

853
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,117
- Uh huh.

854
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:54,716
- Yeah?

855
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:57,567
Where's your accent from, kid?

856
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:58,400
- Scotland.

857
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,858
- Oh yeah?

858
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:02,298
Watch them play soccer on TV.

859
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:04,357
What a bunch of bozos!

860
00:50:04,357 --> 00:50:06,440
(growls)

861
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,605
Thought you said your dog was friendly!

862
00:50:13,605 --> 00:50:15,272
- This isn't my dog.

863
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:26,055
- Sherlock.

864
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:27,146
What are you doing?

865
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:28,586
- Get in.

866
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:29,525
- Sherlock!

867
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:31,077
- I'm driving.

868
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:32,994
- It's against the law!

869
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:38,877
- Billy, there's no law against
dogs driving golf carts.

870
00:50:38,906 --> 00:50:40,445
How old are you?

871
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:41,278
- 47.

872
00:50:42,725 --> 00:50:43,558
- See?

873
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:45,526
- Come on.

874
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:50,445
Right.

875
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:51,725
- Sherlock!

876
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:53,015
- What, what?

877
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:56,495
- [Emma] Your legs are too short.

878
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:58,215
How are you gonna reach the pedal?

879
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:00,034
- I'm not, you are.

880
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:01,106
Go on, lass.

881
00:51:01,106 --> 00:51:02,725
- Alright!

882
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:03,558
- Oh no!

883
00:51:03,558 --> 00:51:07,095
- Put the pedal to the metal, lass, go.

884
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:08,428
Oh, this is fun.

885
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:12,474
Relax.

886
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:13,935
Enjoy yourselves.

887
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:17,102
That's a bonny good view from up here.

888
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,026
- Left, left, turn left!

889
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:22,645
(honks)

890
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:23,728
- Mellow out.

891
00:51:27,026 --> 00:51:29,026
(honks)

892
00:51:39,085 --> 00:51:40,085
- Watch out!

893
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:45,815
(screams)

894
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:48,362
(honks)

895
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:49,195
Whoa!

896
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:51,874
Okay, no, stop!

897
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:53,909
- [Sherlock Bones] Relax,
I got it under control.

898
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:56,076
Now which one's the brake?

899
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,036
- All of 'em.

900
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:21,066
(honks)

901
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:21,899
- Hello.

902
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:30,354
- Right turn, right!

903
00:52:30,354 --> 00:52:32,521
(screams)

904
00:52:37,283 --> 00:52:39,116
- Right, everyone out.

905
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:45,386
- Go, go!

906
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:48,803
Go, go, go away, go, go, go, go away, go.

907
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:54,096
Get out of here, get out of here.

908
00:52:56,664 --> 00:52:58,747
(groans)

909
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:07,281
(screams)

910
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:33,351
(slaps)

911
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:37,732
- Mr. William Anderson,

912
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:40,633
I'm here to see your
remote control turtle.

913
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:41,466
- Oh!

914
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:43,549
(groans)

915
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,882
(dramatic music)

916
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,378
- That's the dog.

917
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:11,801
Keeps finding us.

918
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,092
- It's a police dog.

919
00:54:13,092 --> 00:54:15,332
That's what he's supposed to do.

920
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:16,999
Go back to the boat.

921
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:39,748
- You found Mike?

922
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:41,388
- [Sherlock Bones] Aye.

923
00:54:41,388 --> 00:54:43,100
- [Billy] You can smell Mike from here?

924
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,598
- [Sherlock Bones] Aye.

925
00:54:44,598 --> 00:54:46,024
- Wow!

926
00:54:46,024 --> 00:54:47,350
Which boat is he on?

927
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,183
- No idea.

928
00:54:50,231 --> 00:54:51,064
- Great.

929
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:53,180
- Oh, get down!
- Ow!

930
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,763
(gentle music)

931
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:13,256
- But how are we gonna get past Dad?

932
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:14,376
Ow!

933
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:15,626
- Another idea.

934
00:55:42,837 --> 00:55:45,004
Alright, he didn't see us.

935
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,458
Billy.

936
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:49,375
Lighten up.

937
00:55:50,406 --> 00:55:51,739
- I feel stupid.

938
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:54,187
- Billy!

939
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,187
There are people around.

940
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:01,417
(sighs)

941
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:04,458
- Ha, to think you look stupid.

942
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:08,469
♪ Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream ♪

943
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,917
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

944
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:12,338
- Can you smell anything yet?

945
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:13,520
- Hey, keep rowing!

946
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,821
(humming)

947
00:56:15,821 --> 00:56:18,738
- Look, it's the man in the casino.

948
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:41,846
Ow!

949
00:56:43,102 --> 00:56:45,852
(dramatic music)

950
00:56:58,192 --> 00:57:00,359
(squirts)

951
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:03,625
Ow!

952
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:06,326
- Shh.

953
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:19,007
And let me tell the police.

954
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,674
No one believes you.

955
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:23,368
- Hey!

956
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,386
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

957
00:58:27,386 --> 00:58:28,367
He's not yours!

958
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:29,200
- He is now.

959
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,607
- Let him go!

960
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:35,127
- Get out of here, kid,
before I have you arrested.

961
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,906
- Hey, let him go!

962
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:38,276
Come back.

963
00:58:38,276 --> 00:58:39,716
Let him go!

964
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,026
No!

965
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:42,786
Hey, come back!

966
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,047
We need help!

967
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:47,306
Can you come right away, please?

968
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:49,223
He's kidnapping my dog!

969
00:58:50,676 --> 00:58:52,807
- Sorry, boys, he got off the boat.

970
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:54,895
- That's not his dog!

971
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:57,194
- He's a good guard dog but
he's not real fond of kids.

972
00:58:57,194 --> 00:58:59,027
- I know how he feels.

973
00:59:00,487 --> 00:59:03,410
- Captain Gavin Keene, Ice Breaker,

974
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,666
Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles.

975
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:08,833
- I'll see he doesn't get loose again.

976
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,733
(whines)

977
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:17,621
- Dad, Dad!

978
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:18,978
They kidnapped Sherlock Bones.

979
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:20,947
Now they have Sherlock and Mike.

980
00:59:20,947 --> 00:59:22,028
- Billy.

981
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:25,156
- No, really, they took him over there.

982
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:26,739
- Where's the Turt?

983
00:59:27,908 --> 00:59:29,741
- Out there somewhere.

984
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:31,956
- Okay.

985
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:34,906
- Dad, this man had a rope
and he lassoed Sherlock Bones

986
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:39,258
and he put on this fake
collar with this fake name.

987
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:41,108
- What do you mean fake name?

988
00:59:41,108 --> 00:59:43,538
How do you know it wasn't his dog?

989
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,467
The dog slipped his collar and ran away

990
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:49,001
and his owner caught him and
put his collar back on again.

991
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:50,001
- He didn't.

992
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:53,294
- How do you know?

993
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:03,308
If you told me, I wouldn't believe you?

994
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:05,771
Emma!

995
01:00:07,956 --> 01:00:10,684
He must have bumped into a
rock and turned himself off.

996
01:00:10,684 --> 01:00:13,017
- How do you know it's a he?

997
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:15,221
- Well...

998
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:19,116
- You tell him?

999
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,098
- He thinks I'm a liar.

1000
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:21,931
- Billy.

1001
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:25,767
- What part's he having a problem with?

1002
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:27,316
- Well...

1003
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:30,744
- The policeman tied up in the casino?

1004
01:00:30,744 --> 01:00:31,577
- Well.

1005
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,087
- The dog talking, right?

1006
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:35,268
- Well.

1007
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:37,436
- How about the time the
policeman gave him his ID

1008
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:39,378
and he dropped it in the sea?

1009
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:40,211
- Well.

1010
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:42,441
- Be right back.

1011
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,564
- Billy, you can still
come here for vacations.

1012
01:00:57,647 --> 01:00:59,567
Your mom is right.

1013
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,817
Maybe I am a bad influence.

1014
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,394
- I had a first grade teacher like that.

1015
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:33,962
- Oh!

1016
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,581
- What are they saying?

1017
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,312
- Warm up the engines.

1018
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,479
(mumbles)

1019
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,901
Got to go forwards and
sideways to get out to sea.

1020
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:49,472
The dog?

1021
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,472
Oh, the dog.

1022
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,324
- They're leaving and they're
gonna throw the dog overboard.

1023
01:01:56,324 --> 01:01:57,844
- But how does he know?

1024
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,677
- Gunter can lip read.

1025
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:04,074
- I bet they're gonna
drown the policeman too.

1026
01:02:04,074 --> 01:02:04,907
- Come on.

1027
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:12,935
- So what do you have here?

1028
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:14,063
- Well, I got this for you.

1029
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,480
It's a dog leash.

1030
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:19,122
It's a really nice one.

1031
01:02:19,122 --> 01:02:22,180
I bought one for my great aunt Dorothy.

1032
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,639
Just clip that on there.

1033
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,472
- Right.

1034
01:02:24,472 --> 01:02:27,271
- And then there's this cord
and it's got this button.

1035
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,690
- Oh, you're going to
have such a good time.

1036
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,607
Go, Caesar, off you go.

1037
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:34,355
Wonderful.

1038
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,751
- You don't wanna do that.

1039
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:46,641
Push the, you gotta hold the button--

1040
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:48,808
(honking)

1041
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:54,460
- Hey.

1042
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,293
Hey!

1043
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:57,591
What do I do with these things, huh?

1044
01:02:57,591 --> 01:03:00,508
- Alright, I see, alright, alright.

1045
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,183
Oh, oh, there he goes, Caesar.

1046
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:05,016
Oh no, no.

1047
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,633
Caesar!

1048
01:03:21,442 --> 01:03:22,743
- Officer, quick!

1049
01:03:22,743 --> 01:03:23,943
We need your help.

1050
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,943
(thuds)

1051
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:28,754
- Come on.

1052
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:44,391
Excuse me, but I think you should know

1053
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:45,492
we have called the police

1054
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,040
and you should save
yourself a lot of trouble

1055
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,903
by letting the policeman and the dog go

1056
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:51,343
and giving yourself up.

1057
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:53,426
(smacks)

1058
01:03:59,031 --> 01:04:00,562
Ow!

1059
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:01,395
- Sorry.

1060
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,961
- I'll be fine.

1061
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:13,924
I'll just look after Caesar.

1062
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:21,957
- Dad, how far does the
Turt work underwater?

1063
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:22,874
- 100 feet?

1064
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:25,978
Why?

1065
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:28,888
Why?

1066
01:04:34,564 --> 01:04:36,015
I think I get it!

1067
01:04:36,015 --> 01:04:36,848
- Yeah.

1068
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:39,408
- Hey!

1069
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:41,676
- Oh, sorry.

1070
01:04:41,676 --> 01:04:42,509
Come on!

1071
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:43,342
- Men.

1072
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,306
- Okay.

1073
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:57,255
- Okay.

1074
01:04:57,255 --> 01:04:58,634
- Good luck.

1075
01:04:58,634 --> 01:05:01,384
(dramatic music)

1076
01:05:53,803 --> 01:05:58,053
- [Captain] Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen...

1077
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:18,371
(gasps)

1078
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,862
- See, you're not really blind!

1079
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:32,445
- No, that was my twin brother.

1080
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:47,647
- Did you know I used to be
a professional ice skater?

1081
01:06:47,647 --> 01:06:49,507
- Yes, I think I did.

1082
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:50,698
- It's all balance.

1083
01:06:50,698 --> 01:06:51,531
- Can you drive a--

1084
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:53,698
(barking)

1085
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,238
- I don't know what does what.

1086
01:07:32,388 --> 01:07:34,305
- Forward, to the head.

1087
01:09:00,576 --> 01:09:02,845
(barks)

1088
01:09:02,845 --> 01:09:04,784
(growls)

1089
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:05,701
- Hey, dog!

1090
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:19,460
- Ow!

1091
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,293
- Shh.

1092
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,569
- I think I'm getting the hang of it!

1093
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:30,819
- Just hang on.

1094
01:09:35,108 --> 01:09:36,191
- Turn, turn!

1095
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,260
- Uh, turning!

1096
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,093
Hold on!

1097
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:55,784
- Shh.

1098
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,827
(panting)

1099
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:19,130
- Hey, hey!

1100
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:22,839
(shouts)

1101
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,178
(laughs)

1102
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,477
- Alright, keep going!

1103
01:10:39,124 --> 01:10:40,207
- Behind you!

1104
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:43,284
- Come on, come on.

1105
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:45,751
Grab the rope.

1106
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:47,001
Hold it steady.

1107
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:52,154
Mind now, here I come.

1108
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:56,640
Give me the oars.

1109
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:01,081
Row, row.

1110
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:02,040
- I can't!

1111
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,898
We'll go round in circles.

1112
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:04,731
- Well...

1113
01:11:06,284 --> 01:11:07,117
Wait.

1114
01:11:27,475 --> 01:11:29,558
(shouts)

1115
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:34,603
(beeping)

1116
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:52,389
- Row, row, quick, he's getting closer.

1117
01:11:54,336 --> 01:11:55,664
Row!

1118
01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:56,497
Row!

1119
01:11:56,497 --> 01:11:59,247
- If this is as fast as you
can go, we're dead doo-doo.

1120
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:01,008
- [Mike] Yeah, well, I
don't see you rowing.

1121
01:12:01,008 --> 01:12:02,339
- [Sherlock Bones] Come on, come on!

1122
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:03,256
- Row, row!

1123
01:12:09,728 --> 01:12:10,561
Help!

1124
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:29,990
(scrapes)

1125
01:12:55,156 --> 01:12:56,748
Sherlock!

1126
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:57,581
Over here!

1127
01:12:58,887 --> 01:13:01,304
(calm music)

1128
01:13:04,795 --> 01:13:07,545
- Yeah, alright, we did it, yeah!

1129
01:13:09,796 --> 01:13:10,629
- Hey!

1130
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:13,029
Yay!

1131
01:13:14,388 --> 01:13:16,943
- You did great, you got him, Dad!

1132
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:18,110
You did great!

1133
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:20,336
We did it!

1134
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:39,549
(shouts)

1135
01:13:45,493 --> 01:13:46,410
- Mom, Mom.

1136
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,625
Over here, Mom.

1137
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:55,848
- Hang on, I'm coming.

1138
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,775
Give you a hand.

1139
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:01,858
I'm so proud of you guys.

1140
01:14:03,116 --> 01:14:04,366
You were great.

1141
01:14:07,074 --> 01:14:08,657
- Where's Sherlock?

1142
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:14,706
Come on, come on.

1143
01:14:14,706 --> 01:14:16,244
Come on, buddy.

1144
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:17,876
That's it.

1145
01:14:17,876 --> 01:14:18,959
There we are.

1146
01:14:21,716 --> 01:14:22,716
There we go.

1147
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:29,543
(coughing)

1148
01:14:29,543 --> 01:14:30,710
- Can he swim?

1149
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:32,916
- Probably not.

1150
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:45,461
- Who's that?

1151
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:46,741
- Mom.

1152
01:14:46,741 --> 01:14:48,179
- But who's that, Dad?

1153
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,596
- [Emma] Not yet.

1154
01:15:20,947 --> 01:15:23,447
(dog barking)

1155
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:49,966
- Just thought I'd say thanks very much.

1156
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:52,393
Thought I was a goner there for a minute.

1157
01:15:52,393 --> 01:15:53,715
Ow!

1158
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:54,548
Sherlock!

1159
01:15:55,806 --> 01:16:00,056
He doesn't like all that
sensitive emotional stuff.

1160
01:16:02,342 --> 01:16:03,175
Well...

1161
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,159
Ta-ra.

1162
01:16:07,024 --> 01:16:07,857
Bye.

1163
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:10,762
Thanks.

1164
01:16:10,762 --> 01:16:11,952
Cheers.

1165
01:16:11,952 --> 01:16:13,119
Come on, mate.

1166
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:29,604
- Hey.

1167
01:16:30,811 --> 01:16:33,561
Are you not going to say goodbye?

1168
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:37,404
Well?

1169
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:44,022
- Bye, Sherlock.

1170
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:52,456
(gentle music)

1171
01:18:21,224 --> 01:18:24,057
