1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,712
and so shall be saved
from mine enemies !

2
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,639
The waves of death
have closed about me !

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,950
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,356
and the snares of death
have overtaken me !

5
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,998
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,917
and the snares of death
have overtaken me !

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,149
ln my tribulation l call to the Lord
and cry to my God

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,193
and He heard my voice
cry out His temple ... !

9
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,635
Move back ! Clear the way !

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,916
Move back !

11
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,156
Keep in line, woman !

12
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,149
By order of their gracious Majesties,
Queen Mary and King Philip,

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,950
we are come to witness the burning
of these Protestant heretics

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,034
who have denied the authority
of the one true Catholic church

15
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,873
and of His Holiness the Pope.

16
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,909
Let them burn for all eternity
in the flames of hell.

17
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,396
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,034
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,479
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,596
God bless you, Master Ridley !

21
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,434
For the love of God, friends, help me !
l burn too slowly !

22
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,675
Help them !
For God's sake, help them !

23
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,993
Your Grace, the Queen is with child.

24
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,676
They should've consulted me
before they rang the bells.

25
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,196
ls it true ?

26
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,513
She has ceased to bleed, her breasts have
some milk, and her stomach is swollen.

27
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,874
ls it true ?

28
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,238
The King has not shared her bed
for many months.

29
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,233
He has a repugnance for it,
as lately Your Grace has for mine.

30
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,278
Norfolk...

31
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,391
Your Majesties,
this is most wondrous news.

32
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,913
lndeed.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,391
We do thank God for this,
our most happy condition.

34
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,914
We must also thank His Majesty
for this event

35
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,389
which is nothing short of a miracle.

36
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,038
What news, my Lords,
of the rebellion against our authority ?

37
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,638
Sussex ?

38
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,996
Madam, it is safely dispatched,
thanks to His Grace.

39
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,834
Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other leaders
are already dealt with.

40
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,833
lf they had succeeded,
these Protestants and heretics

41
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,911
meant to place your sister

42
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,036
upon the throne.

43
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,836
There is no proof
against the Lady Elizabeth.

44
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,310
- She is plainly guilty.
- What need is there of proof ?

45
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,358
lf she remains alive,
there will be plots to raise her

46
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,078
to the throne.

47
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,115
Ambassador ?

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,196
l agree with His Grace.

49
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,353
She is a heretic.
She must never be allowed to succeed.

50
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,714
But if she...

51
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,593
lf she were brought properly to trial,

52
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,194
she would not be found guilty,

53
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,033
and we would be condemned.
She has friends in Parliament.

54
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,635
My sister was born
of that whore Anne Boleyn !

55
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,474
She was born a bastard !
She will never rule England !

56
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,954
Your Grace will find some proof
of her treachery. l am most sure of it.

57
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,198
lt was so fast !

58
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,396
May l join you, my Lady ?

59
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,196
lf it please you, sir.

60
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,393
My Lady !

61
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,833
My Lady !

62
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,398
Princess Elizabeth !

63
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,356
Princess Elizabeth !

64
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,311
You are accused of conspiring
with Sir Thomas Wyatt

65
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,960
against Her Sovereign Majesty

66
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
and are arrested for treason.

67
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,038
l am commanded to take you hence
from this place... to the Tower.

68
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,916
Remember who you are.

69
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,436
Do not be afraid of them.

70
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,596
My Lady.

71
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,956
Prisoner to the steps.

72
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,155
l cannot confess to something
l did not do.

73
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,593
Your denials are in vain.

74
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,832
You knew of the rebellion, Madam.
lt is plain enough.

75
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,592
Where is your proof ?

76
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,716
lt was to your advantage.

77
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,756
You must let me see the Queen...

78
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,957
You despise the Queen,
and the Catholic faith.

79
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,995
l am a true and faithful subject.

80
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,758
l attend Mass...

81
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,274
You pretend ! But in your heart...

82
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,949
What's that ? What say you, Madam ?

83
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,678
Speak up !

84
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,878
Madam, if there is some small truth
in these charges,

85
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,430
however innocently or unknowingly
you did proceed,

86
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,476
you had best confess.

87
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,232
l ask you

88
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,950
why we must tear ourselves apart
for this small question of religion.

89
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,031
Catholic, Protestant... !

90
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,908
You think it small,
though it killed your mother !

91
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,158
We all...

92
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,800
We all believe in God, my Lords.

93
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,668
No, Madam,
there is only one true belief.

94
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,830
The other - heresy.

95
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,516
Madam, you are cold.

96
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,034
l do not need your pity.

97
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,231
Accept it, then,

98
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,833
for my sake.

99
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,872
Thank you.

100
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,520
l shall not forget this kindness.

101
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,630
Tonight l think l die.

102
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,476
Madam.

103
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,792
No... !

104
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,155
Save me ! Save me !

105
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,436
l am Your Majesty's most humble servant.

106
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,517
Come here.

107
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,240
Closer, so l might see your face.

108
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,156
When l look at you
l see nothing of the King.

109
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,038
Only that whore - your mother.

110
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,994
My father never did anything so well
as to cut off her head.

111
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,072
Your Majesty forgets
he was also my father.

112
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,995
Why will you not confess
your crimes against me ?

113
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,197
Because, Your Majesty,
l have committed none.

114
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
You speak with such sincerity !

115
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,950
l see you are still a consummate actress.

116
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,475
My husband is gone.

117
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
They have poisoned my child.

118
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,835
They say it is a tumour.

119
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,436
Madam, you are not well.

120
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,479
They say this cancer
will make you Queen, but they are wrong !

121
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,838
Look there ! lt is your death warrant.
All l need do is sign it.

122
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,153
Mary, if you sign that paper,
you will be murdering your own sister.

123
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,200
You will promise me something ?

124
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,559
When l am gone, you will
do everything in your power

125
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,870
to uphold the Catholic faith.

126
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,910
Do not take away from the people
the consolations of the Blessed Virgin.

127
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,996
When l am Queen

128
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,476
l promise

129
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,833
to act as my conscience dictates.

130
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,550
Well, do not think to be Queen at all.

131
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,837
You may return to your house at Hatfield,

132
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,196
but you will remain under arrest
until l am recovered.

133
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,916
Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,353
No...

135
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,309
Feed her to the wolves.
Let her see what they are like.

136
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,959
She is just a child,
and yet still you piss yourselves !

137
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,232
Your Grace,
Protestants are returning from abroad.

138
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,269
Yes, and have made plans to massacre
every Catholic in England.

139
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,753
There would be butchery indeed
if such a plan were even conceivable.

140
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,115
They say Walsingham
will return from France.

141
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,156
Walsingham is nothing !

142
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,476
Be sure he does not.

143
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,190
There is so little beauty in this world,
and so much suffering.

144
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,038
Do you suppose
that is what God had in mind ?

145
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,873
That is to say, if there is a God at all.

146
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,077
Perhaps there is nothing
in this universe but ourselves

147
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,996
and our thoughts.

148
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,116
Think before you do this.

149
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,709
lf you must do it,

150
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,756
then do it now.

151
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,115
And without regret.

152
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,270
But first think carefully

153
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,596
and be certain

154
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,716
why it needs to be done.

155
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,796
Come here.

156
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,916
Look out there.

157
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,680
There is a whole world waiting for you.

158
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,559
lnnocence
is the most precious thing you possess.

159
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,398
Lose that and you lose your soul.

160
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,919
..et Spiritus Sancti...

161
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,069
Amen.

162
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,718
Father...

163
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,234
- Sir William !
- My Lady...

164
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,471
There was nowhere else
we could meet in safety.

165
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,710
Listen to me carefully.

166
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,030
All things move in our favour.

167
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,510
Many of our friends
are returning from exile.

168
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,831
But these are most uncertain times

169
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,150
and your life remains in danger.

170
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,708
You must therefore say nothing

171
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,349
and meet no-one
whose visit may compromise you.

172
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,668
No-one ?

173
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,513
No-one. Not even Lord Robert.

174
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,913
- But he is a trusted friend.
- Child, listen to me. Please.

175
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,879
You are most innocent
in the ways of this world

176
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,951
and we must do all we may

177
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,032
to guarantee the security of your throne.

178
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,112
Now there is someone
l do wish you to meet.

179
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,351
Monseigneur Alvaro de la Quadra,
the Spanish Ambassador.

180
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,429
Why do l...

181
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,232
My Lady,

182
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,357
l bring a message.

183
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,230
The King of Spain is enraptured,
and offers you his hand in marriage.

184
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,709
My sister is not yet dead.

185
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,950
Her bed is still warm.

186
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,273
His Majesty finds it already cold.

187
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,676
You must sign it.

188
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,911
For the love of God, sign it.

189
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,078
Will you leave your kingdom to a heretic ?

190
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,239
He then said that this King
would marry me

191
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,711
but would not expect to share my bed
more than two or three times a year.

192
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,392
As much as that ?

193
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,032
Well, he...

194
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,917
He is enraptured.

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,955
Naturally.

196
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,148
But... his affairs would otherwise
keep him in Spain.

197
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,950
Then the King is a fool.

198
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,599
What could ever be important enough
to keep him from your bed ?

199
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,193
Robert,

200
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,555
you should not say such things.

201
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,596
Then l shall only think them.

202
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,237
Everything is so uncertain !
Sir William says my life is still in danger.

203
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,835
Do not listen to everything he tells you.
Do not listen to any of them.

204
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,558
None of them are of consequence.

205
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,553
- When you are Queen...
- l am not... l am not Queen yet.

206
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,517
You will be.

207
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,238
Elizabeth,

208
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,197
Queen of England.

209
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,589
A court to worship you.

210
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,671
A country to obey you.

211
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,558
Poems written celebrating your beauty.

212
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,111
Music composed in your honour,
and they will be nothing to you.

213
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,916
l will mean nothing to you.

214
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,274
How could you ever be nothing to me ?

215
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,318
Robert, you know
you are everything to me.

216
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,036
All that l am

217
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,076
it is you.

218
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,593
Benedicta tu in mulieribus

219
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,439
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

220
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,276
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei

221
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,318
ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc...

222
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,636
ls she dead ?

223
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,236
Give it to her.

224
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,193
My Lady...

225
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,435
The Earl of Sussex is here.

226
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,516
The Queen is dead !

227
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,916
Long live the Queen !

228
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,716
Long live the Queen !

229
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,270
This is the Lord's doing

230
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,592
and it is marvellous in our eyes.

231
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,513
To the north, l present unto you

232
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,512
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen !

233
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,070
To the south, l present to you

234
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,913
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen !

235
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,116
l crown thee Elizabeth,

236
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,829
Queen of England, lreland and France.

237
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,395
God save Your Majesty.

238
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,438
Your Majesty has inherited
a most parlous and degenerate state.

239
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,876
lt's threatened from abroad
by France and Spain

240
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,270
and is weaker in men, monies and riches

241
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,237
than l have ever known it.

242
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,753
What are you saying ?

243
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,992
Madam, your treasury is empty.
The Navy is run-down,

244
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,231
there is no standing army,
and no munitions.

245
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,472
There is not a fortress
that could withstand a single shot.

246
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,314
- l have no desire for war, sir.
- But that is not the end of it.

247
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,995
Here at home there are those
who wish Your Majesty ill.

248
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,073
Mary of Scots has already
laid claim to your throne,

249
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,991
and Norfolk...

250
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,958
Norfolk covets it relentlessly.

251
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,397
Madam, until you marry
and produce an heir,

252
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
you will find no security.

253
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,156
That's Sir Christopher Hatton.

254
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,910
- There is Sir William Makepeace...
- l do not see...

255
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,399
- Lord Ensley, Your Majesty.
- Delighted.

256
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,870
l do not see why a woman
need marry at all.

257
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,235
Come on, come on !

258
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,396
This is Mistress Quickly.

259
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,354
You will recall His Excellency
the Spanish Ambassador.

260
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,396
How could l forget ?

261
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,435
Excellency.

262
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,476
Your Majesty.

263
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,352
He's French. You'll have to speak up.

264
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,956
Do l know that gentleman ?

265
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,156
That is Sir Francis Walsingham, Madam.
He has returned from exile

266
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,472
and l have appointed him
to have a care for Your Majesty's person.

267
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,112
Ah !

268
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,913
Excellency...

269
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,355
Majesty...

270
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,348
May l present the French Ambassador,
His Excellency Monsieur de Foix.

271
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,158
Your Excellency.

272
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,759
l suppose the French
do offer some suitor to her.

273
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,671
Naturally.

274
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,594
Everything now depends
upon the husband that woman takes.

275
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,750
King Henry of Anjou
sends you brotherly love.

276
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,392
He trusts the relationship between
our countries may be much improved.

277
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,799
That is also my hope.

278
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,635
The King expects that you will
consider the suit of his brother,

279
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,109
the Duke of Anjou.

280
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,875
Her Majesty will consider
the proposal most carefully.

281
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,710
lt is unfortunate, however,
that the Duke's aunt, Mary of Guise,

282
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,190
chooses to garrison Scotland
with French troops.

283
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,393
Ladies...

284
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,032
The marriage of a Queen, Excellency,
is born of politics, not childish passion.

285
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,435
Your Grace.

286
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,476
Walsingham !

287
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,116
Welcome to England.

288
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,873
- Your Grace is surprised ?
- No.

289
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,951
Only a little disappointed.

290
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,996
Play a volta !

291
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,719
When may l see you in private ?

292
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,075
ln private ?

293
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,556
Have you forgot, my Lord ?

294
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,552
l am Queen now.

295
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,639
He's coming.

296
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,835
He's coming !

297
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,631
My Ladies.

298
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,676
My Lord.

299
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,752
You blush, Lady Knollys.

300
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,956
Are you in love ?

301
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,632
No, my Lord.

302
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,678
Then you should be,
or waste all that beauty.

303
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,716
Does Her Majesty sleep ?

304
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,316
Not yet, Sir William.

305
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,550
She is... overwrought.

306
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,558
Show me Her Majesty's sheets
every morning.

307
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,589
- l must know all her proper functions.
- Proper functions, Sir William ?

308
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,636
lndeed.

309
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,840
Her Majesty's body and person
are no longer her own property.

310
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,956
They belong to the State.

311
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,996
Yes, Sir William.

312
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,233
Your Grace.

313
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,595
Your Grace, Her Majesty has not risen.

314
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,432
Your Grace !

315
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,238
Please ! Your Grace ! Her Majesty
is not yet ready to receive visitors.

316
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,072
Madam !

317
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,831
You had best get up.
There is some grave news.

318
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,876
My Lady, l'm sorry...

319
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,556
Mary of Guise has increased the French
garrison in Scotland by 4,000 men.

320
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,029
Perhaps more.

321
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,599
Madam...

322
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,037
l'm afraid the French mean to attack
while we are still weak

323
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,556
and while Your Majesty's reign
is still uncertain.

324
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,436
What is your counsel ?

325
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,150
Madam, we must with all haste
raise an army to march upon Scotland.

326
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,716
Can... can... ?

327
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,556
Can we not send emissaries ?

328
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,838
There is no time for that !
As Queen we look to you for action,

329
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,597
unless you are content to wait for the
French to send more reinforcements.

330
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,079
Here.

331
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,316
Are you all in agreement ?

332
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,235
l say there has never been a better time
to abate the French pride.

333
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,275
Arundel ?

334
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,159
War is a sin,
but sometimes a necessary one.

335
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,749
Lord Robert, you were appointed to the
Council to protect England's interests.

336
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,798
Now it appears
you do not have the stomach for it.

337
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,632
l am in agreement, Your Grace,

338
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,316
ifYour Majesty's throne is at risk.

339
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,837
- What say you, Walsingham ?
- Your Majesty !

340
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,117
l say a prince should rather
be slow to take action

341
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,558
and should watch that he does not
come to be afraid of his own shadow.

342
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,758
You are not, Sir Francis,
a member of Council,

343
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,751
nor are you in the majority.

344
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,636
l do not like wars.

345
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,275
They have uncertain outcomes.

346
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,554
SCOTLAND

347
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,599
Stop !

348
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,150
Go back to England,

349
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,629
and take this to your Queen.

350
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,593
English blood on French colours.

351
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,598
Send him back to his Queen

352
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,117
and make sure he remains alive.

353
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,028
Tell that bastard Queen not to send
children to fight Mary of Guise !

354
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,076
- Where are my councillors ?
- l know not, Madam.

355
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,551
- Where is Lord Robert ?
- Lord Robert, Madam, has gone hunting.

356
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,116
Leave me.

357
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,156
Go ! Go !

358
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,790
l regret to inform Your Majesty
of our miserable defeat in Scotland.

359
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,031
The Bishops still demand
Your Majesty's removal.

360
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,998
They find support in every quarter.

361
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,709
Alas, Madam,
we are come already to catastrophe.

362
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,153
How dare you come into my presence !

363
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,036
Why do you follow me here ?

364
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,476
lt is my business
to protect Your Majesty

365
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,716
against all things.

366
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,679
l do not need protection.
l need to be left alone !

367
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,716
Majesty...

368
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,116
They should never have been
sent to Scotland.

369
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,716
My father would not have made
such a mistake.

370
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,588
l have been proved unfit to rule.

371
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,039
That is what you all think,
is it not, Walsingham ?

372
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,031
lt is not for me to judge you.

373
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,840
Why did they send children ! Why
did they not send proper reinforcements !

374
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,480
The Bishops would not let them.

375
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,632
They spoke against it in the pulpits.

376
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,872
Then... they are speaking
against their Queen.

377
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,192
Madam, the Bishops are against you
and have no fear of you.

378
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,840
They do not expect you to survive.

379
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,076
My Lord ! The Queen !

380
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,356
Where have you been ?

381
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,596
You were not at Court.

382
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,956
Majesty, Monsieur de Foix.

383
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,996
Mary of Guise, Ma'am,

384
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,232
promises to make no further threat
against Your Majesty, but

385
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,276
on one condition.

386
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,636
What condition ?

387
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,872
That Your Majesty considers the proposal
of her nephew the Duke of Anjou.

388
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,509
The Duke is most eager
to meet Your Majesty.

389
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,558
He has heard a great deal of your beauty.

390
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,189
For the love of God, Madam, let not
the care of your diseased estate

391
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,078
hang in the balance any longer.

392
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,517
ln marriage,
and in the production of an heir,

393
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,200
lies your only surety.

394
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,078
The Duke is also most... handsome.

395
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,196
Very well.

396
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,798
lnvite the Duke of Anjou.

397
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,595
We shall see him in the flesh.

398
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,436
Robert !

399
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,036
The Duke will not take kindly
to a rival for his suit.

400
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,795
He is a traitor,
and his father before him.

401
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,590
Lord Robert's head
will end up on a spike,

402
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,194
not on the pillow of a Queen.

403
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,396
Must you leave ?

404
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,233
l would not miss this for the world.

405
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,079
Today l shall watch the fall
of that heretic girl.

406
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,639
l have been placed here
as your sov...

407
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,476
l am your sovereign.
l have been placed here...

408
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,718
l...

409
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,031
God has... God has placed me here...

410
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,793
l am your anointed sovereign...

411
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,190
l am your Queen...
And like my father l mean to rule.

412
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,990
There is one thing higher than royalty,
my Lords, and that

413
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,916
is religion.

414
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,151
l pass this... l pass this Act of...

415
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,071
l ask you to pa... l...

416
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,118
l ask you to pass this Act of Uniformity.

417
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,997
Not for myself. For my people.

418
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,196
They're my people...

419
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,110
There is one God. We have
a common... There is one God.

420
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,956
This is for my people.
My people are my care.

421
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,996
The only care.

422
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,390
My Lords, your votes are nothing
without my consent.

423
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,511
lf there is no uniformity
of religious belief here

424
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,957
then there can only be fragmentation.

425
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,796
Disputes and quarrels.

426
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,717
Surely, my Lords, it is better
to have a single Church of England.

427
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,719
A single Church of England !

428
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,234
With a common prayer book.

429
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,276
And... and a...

430
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,592
And... a common purpose.

431
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,352
l ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity

432
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,829
not... not for myself

433
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,553
but for my people

434
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,513
who are my only care.

435
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,716
Madam, by this Act,

436
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,711
you force us to relinquish
our allegiance to the Holy Father.

437
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,439
Hear, hear !

438
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,829
How can l force you, Your Grace ?

439
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,876
l am a woman.

440
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,117
l have no desire
to make windows into men's souls.

441
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,076
l simply ask

442
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,196
can any man, in truth,

443
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,950
serve two masters

444
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,634
and be faithful to both ?

445
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,836
Madam, this is heresy !

446
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,514
No, Your Grace, this is

447
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,556
common sense.

448
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,598
Which is a most English virtue.

449
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,193
Where is Gardiner ?
Where are the others ?

450
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,713
Let us out !

451
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,756
Open the door !

452
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,954
This is Walsingham's doing.

453
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,236
lt is the devil's work.

454
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,880
lt will not serve her in any case.

455
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,996
The Bishops will pass no measure
which severs us from Rome.

456
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,719
Your Majesty would improve
all these matters

457
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,995
if you would agree to marry.

458
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,036
Aye. Marry, Madam.

459
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,799
Aye. But marry who, Your Grace ?

460
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,473
Will you give me some suggestion ?

461
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,719
For some say France,
and others Spain, and

462
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,116
and some cannot abide foreigners at all.

463
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,115
So l'm not sure how best to please you
unless l married one of each.

464
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,793
Now Your Majesty does make fun
of the sanctity of marriage.

465
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,396
l do not think you should lecture me
on that, my Lord,

466
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,439
since you yourself
have been twice divorced.

467
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,432
And are now upon your third wife !

468
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,519
Each of you must vote
according to your conscience.

469
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,316
But remember this.

470
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,590
ln your hands,

471
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,590
upon this moment,

472
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,479
lies the future happiness of my people,

473
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,755
and the peace

474
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,796
of this realm.

475
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,752
Let that be upon your conscience also.

476
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,754
My Lords, the House will divide.

477
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,556
Walsingham... !

478
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,952
l would know on what authority
you have kept us locked up here.

479
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,828
Your Graces must forgive me,
but you are now free to go.

480
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,277
l am sure this infernal work
has not saved your bastard Queen.

481
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,279
Her Majesty... has won the argument.

482
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,236
By what count ?

483
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,588
By five, Your Grace.

484
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,156
Five.

485
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,115
You will be damned for this !

486
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,159
And l pray God your wretched soul
will burn in hell !

487
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,914
Report back to me at break of day.

488
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,156
Enchanté.

489
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,990
No !

490
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,436
Because... l am Anjou !

491
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,033
Yes, l am Anjou, yes ! l am Anjou.

492
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,436
My God ! She loves it !

493
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,636
And l can't wait...

494
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,271
l dream of the moment
when we are naked together in bed

495
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,909
where l can stroke your thigh
and perhaps even

496
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,991
your quinny ?

497
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,918
Would you like that ?

498
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,070
Remove your hand.

499
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,118
Perhaps, Your Grace,
we shall think on it, but...

500
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,159
- l am deeply religious.
- But l am very religious, too.

501
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,993
Very religious, yes !

502
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,916
THE VATlCAN

503
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,159
Your Holiness,
the priest from England is here.

504
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,198
Tell me, my son, what is the news
of our brothers and sisters in England ?

505
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,515
Do they still support the sovereignty
of that illegitimate whore ?

506
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,158
No, Holy Father.

507
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,677
They pray ceaselessly that England
may be recovered from heresy.

508
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,752
Prayers may not be sufficient.

509
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,149
l will ask for guidance in this matter.

510
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,595
But do not despair.

511
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,516
Was it not truly said
that the righteous shall inherit the earth ?

512
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,756
Such piercing eyes !

513
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,796
And very indiscreet !

514
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,829
My true love has my heart

515
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,796
and l have hers.

516
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,156
My heart in me

517
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,595
keeps her and me in one.

518
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,271
My heart in her,
her thoughts and senses guide.

519
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,510
She loves my heart

520
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,753
for once it was her own.

521
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,756
l cherish hers

522
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,953
because in me it bides.

523
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,835
My true love has my heart

524
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,512
and l

525
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,033
have hers.

526
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,075
Marry me.

527
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,756
Marry me.

528
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,709
The Queen is very intimate
with Lord Robert, no ?

529
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,032
With me she plays the shrew.
With him the lover ?

530
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,029
Her life depends on the feelings
of my heart, yes ?

531
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,669
She is a woman, Sire.

532
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,877
They say one thing but mean another.

533
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,951
No man can unlock their secrets.

534
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,474
Unless they have

535
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,994
a very big key !

536
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,155
Yes !

537
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,232
A very big key !

538
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,716
On a night such as this

539
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,756
could any woman say no ?

540
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,316
On a night such as this

541
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,196
could a Queen say no ?

542
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,477
Does not a Queen sit under
the same stars as any other woman ?

543
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,956
Monseigneur Alvaro !

544
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,153
Monseigneur Alvaro !

545
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,958
Tell me,

546
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,999
as well as Ambassador,
are you not also a Bishop ?

547
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,675
l am, my Lord.

548
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,398
Then you can marry us !

549
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,390
Marry you ?

550
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,717
Perhaps he does not know enough
English to perform the ceremony !

551
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,759
Alas, Madam, in this matter
l can be of no help to you.

552
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,833
Madam !

553
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,639
The Queen !

554
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,790
- Protect the Queen !
- Help her !

555
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,030
Quickly ! Call the Guard !

556
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,274
The Queen ! The Queen !

557
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,510
Look to the Queen !

558
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,712
lsabel, see that the ladies are prepared.

559
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,755
lsabel, go !

560
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,796
Where were you, Sir Francis ?

561
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,830
l only hope that Her Majesty may be
safely delivered from this present danger.

562
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,076
ls the bedchamber ready ?

563
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,469
Be calm, Madam. All is well.

564
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,516
l am perfectly well.

565
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,076
Please do not fuss.

566
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,517
- No-one is to enter.
- Yes, Sir William.

567
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,074
- Stay in here now, and watch.
- Yes, Sir Francis.

568
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,472
Sorry, Lord Robert.

569
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,314
l said no-one.

570
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,351
My Lord,

571
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,032
a word.

572
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,075
To whose advantage was this ?

573
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,957
De Foix ?

574
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,718
No.

575
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,756
Not with Anjou in play.

576
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,829
Then some... madman ?

577
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,753
There is always madness, Master Elyot.

578
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,389
This was devised.
There is reason behind it.

579
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,916
Then Alvaro

580
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,195
for he has most cause.

581
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,316
Yes, but he was present.

582
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,550
He is too subtle for that.

583
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,551
Would Norfolk ?

584
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,553
He is not so subtle
and has even more cause.

585
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,596
lndeed.

586
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,272
So then

587
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,318
he is not in league with the Spanish.

588
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,789
Perhaps. Stay close to him.

589
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,269
The Duke has some other game.

590
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,794
l must find where he plays.

591
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,277
l see it is true that the Queen
favours you above all others.

592
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,919
But you have many enemies here.
ls it not so ?

593
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,355
That is no concern of yours.

594
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,076
lt may be.

595
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,518
lf you would be prepared,
in secret, to renounce heresy

596
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,909
and embrace the true faith,

597
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,278
then you might find
many new and powerful friends

598
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,032
and

599
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,476
keep your Queen.

600
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,678
You are most mistaken, Monseigneur,

601
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,036
if you think
l might so easily be persuaded

602
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,315
to act against my conscience,

603
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,675
and my love.

604
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,316
My Lord,

605
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,233
what will a man not do for love ?

606
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,596
Madam, if only you would heed my advice.

607
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,278
l narrowly escaped with my life, sir.
l cannot now discuss marriage.

608
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,757
Forgive me... the one
cannot be separated from the other.

609
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,037
- Have l not told you ?
- Yes, and l am sick of it.

610
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,556
This entire conversation is ill-timed.

611
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,192
My patience, Sir William, is not infinite.

612
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,955
lt is a great joy to see
Your Majesty is not hurt.

613
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,190
lt was a terrible affair.

614
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,279
The Duke would still
know the answer to his suit.

615
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,713
You may tell the Duke
he shall have his answer shortly.

616
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,030
Madam, the point is pressing !

617
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,272
The Duke cannot love me so much if
he demands my answer so precipitously !

618
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,194
Perhaps Her Majesty's heart
is already set upon another.

619
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:00,190
Do not presume, monsieur,
to know the secrets of my heart.

620
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,915
Monsieur de Foix may leave.

621
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,956
Please, Excellency...

622
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,435
Je vous prie de mes excuses.

623
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,676
Secrets, Madam ?!

624
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,316
You have no secrets !

625
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,949
The world knows Lord Robert
visits your chambers and you

626
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,996
fornicate with him !

627
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,231
lt's even said you already carry his child !

628
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:30,030
Yes, Sir William, l live my life in the open !
l am surrounded by people !

629
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,910
l do not understand how so bad
a judgment has been formed of me !

630
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,877
Madam, you...

631
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,678
You cannot marry Lord Robert !

632
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,276
He is already married.

633
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,275
Here comes our married man.

634
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,800
Lord Dudley is not himself today.

635
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,192
Lord Dudley's cup runneth over.

636
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,115
lmagine being discovered
in another woman's bed !

637
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,839
Aye, and that it to be his wife's !

638
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,359
Lord Robert, we are amazed
you show your face at Court.

639
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,396
The Queen !

640
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,274
Spanish !

641
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,079
Spanish !

642
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,996
English pirate !

643
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,676
English pirate !

644
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,629
ls it not enough that English
pirates attack and rob our ships

645
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,598
but we are to be made fools of
in this Court.

646
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,629
The King, my master, has become
impatient for Your Grace to act.

647
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,517
lf you will not, then others may.

648
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,434
You must reassure His Majesty
the time is close at hand.

649
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,511
He must not act precipitously.

650
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,074
- His Majesty has heard a rumour
- The world is filled with rumours.

651
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:18,837
that Your Grace has made contact with
Mary of Scots to promote your ambitions.

652
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,115
Even that you mean to marry her.

653
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,634
Do you suppose me an idiot ?

654
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,748
Your master is the most powerful man
in the world. l would not cross him.

655
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,109
Will the Duke not come to dance ?

656
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,910
Madam, His Grace is indisposed.
He has some pains of the stomach.

657
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,558
Oh.

658
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,395
l am very sorry for it.

659
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,559
We wish to give the Duke this ring

660
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,035
as a token of our love.

661
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,475
- Madam...
- No.

662
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,994
l shall give it to him myself.

663
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,036
Madam, l should not...

664
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,076
Sir William.

665
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,912
Come along.

666
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,956
What !

667
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,436
What ?

668
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,398
What, er... what !

669
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,556
You stare, Madam.

670
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,236
What is it ?

671
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,276
Do you see

672
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,920
something strange, perhaps ?

673
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,513
You are wearing a dress, Your Grace.

674
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,432
Oh ! Yes, l am wearing a dress.
Yes, yes, l am wearing a dress !

675
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,592
l wear a dress like this,
my mother, and you.

676
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,515
But l only dress like this when l'm alone,
in private, with my friends.

677
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,196
Your Grace...

678
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,357
Although my affection for you
is undiminished

679
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,477
l have, after an agonising struggle,

680
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,839
determined to sacrifice my own happiness
for the welfare of my people.

681
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,194
My God !

682
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,796
Madam, l will explain.

683
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,838
There is no need, Excellency.

684
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,353
l understand everything !

685
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,599
Allez-vous-en, allez !

686
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,396
Jouez ! Jouez !

687
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,556
Up yours !

688
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,159
Madam, is the, er... is the Duke...

689
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,198
There will be no more talk of marriage.

690
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,758
Lord Robert !

691
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,236
Your Majesty ?

692
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,436
Will you dance ?

693
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,716
lf it please you.

694
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,236
Play a volta !

695
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,556
Why will you not see me ?

696
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,435
You must let me explain.

697
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,080
Others will take advantage of this.

698
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,835
You must not believe
what they tell you. They are jealous

699
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,390
and envious,
because l am nothing to them

700
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,914
and everything to you.

701
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,196
Do you love her ?

702
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,198
No, l love you.
l have always loved you.

703
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,989
l was afraid of losing you
because l was not free !

704
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,197
For God's sake,
you are still my Elizabeth !

705
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,795
l am not your Elizabeth !

706
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,556
l am no man's Elizabeth !

707
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,552
And if you think to rule here
you are mistaken !

708
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,991
l will have one mistress here

709
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,556
and no master !

710
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,073
lt matters nothing to me.
l can live without her

711
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,430
most happily.

712
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,988
Better than l could live with her.

713
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,716
l have no need of her love.
Have l not suffered enough already

714
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,109
for loving her and showing it ?

715
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,156
l envy you, my Lord.

716
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,909
To love a woman so deeply.

717
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,232
Monseigneur... envy no man for that.

718
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,869
Such love is hateful.

719
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,272
lt tears the soul apart. Envy a man
who has never known such love.

720
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,433
Perhaps there may still be a way
to reclaim her affections.

721
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,033
Why should l want to ?

722
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,917
And to save her life.

723
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,594
- You jest with me.
- No, l do not.

724
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:44,038
For she will be dead soon enough,
perhaps even at Norfolk's hand,

725
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,076
if you do not help her.

726
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,197
How can l help her ?

727
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,156
She will not even see me.

728
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,229
His Holiness has issued the Bull.

729
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,599
lt deprives Elizabeth, pretended Queen
of England, servant of wickedness,

730
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,636
of her throne,

731
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:15,033
and declares that her subjects
are absolved of their allegiance to her.

732
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,318
His Holiness also decrees that any man

733
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,109
who should undertake her assassination

734
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,159
will be welcomed by angels
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

735
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:33,756
Give these letters of blessing
and hope to our friends in England.

736
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,594
THE COAST OF ENGLAND

737
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,276
Your Grace.

738
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,396
Monseigneur.

739
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,156
And Thomas Elyot.

740
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,675
You serve your master well, Elyot.

741
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,516
As well as l can, in truth.

742
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,876
l mean your real master.

743
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,396
What's this ?

744
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,596
What master ?

745
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,193
Walsingham.

746
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,238
The priest is mistaken, my Lord.

747
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,676
l am Your Grace's servant,
as God is my witness.

748
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,558
- lsabel...
- Sshh, don't fuss.

749
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,630
You should not try them on, lsabel.
They are the Queen's dresses.

750
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,676
Why not ?

751
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,916
You're my secret.

752
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,956
l am Queen, aren't l ?

753
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,476
Say you're mine.

754
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,756
You're my Elizabeth.

755
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,556
Say you're my Elizabeth.

756
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,796
l am your Elizabeth.

757
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,751
l am your Queen !

758
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,036
Ssh... !

759
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,116
Sshh... !

760
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,476
Kat ?

761
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,636
Kat !

762
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,749
Kat ?

763
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,396
Who are you ?

764
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,428
You will declare yourself to me.

765
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,719
Madam !

766
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:33,192
Something has happened !
You must come quickly !

767
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,276
Who was with her ?

768
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,751
One of the guards found her.
He says he saw Lord Robert leave...

769
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,558
No, Madam, no.

770
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,108
The dress was poisoned.

771
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,388
Uncover her.

772
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,200
No... ! That dress was a gift

773
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,156
for me.

774
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,996
French silk.

775
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,398
SCOTLAND

776
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,476
Vite ! Vite !

777
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,756
Sir Francis,

778
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,230
you and l must be honest with each other.

779
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,876
Your Queen is weak.

780
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,916
She has no army,

781
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,912
no friends. Only...

782
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,558
Comment dit-on... ?

783
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,197
- Enemies.
- Enemies.

784
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,998
Mm-hm.

785
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,036
What terms can she propose ?

786
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,193
Madam, Her Majesty was, l believe,

787
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,795
too hasty at rejecting
the Duke's proposal of marriage.

788
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,914
But how can l marry such a woman ?
Huh ?

789
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,752
She is frigid !

790
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:20,197
Yes ! They even say she is really a man !

791
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,357
Go to bed. Leave me with this.

792
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,397
Forgive my nephew.

793
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,789
He speaks when he should not.

794
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,836
He is terrible.

795
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,071
Ne fais pas l'idiot, Henri.

796
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,119
l hear you are a wise man, Sir Francis,

797
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,873
and a creature of the world

798
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,439
like me.

799
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,756
Yes.

800
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,236
l have no illusions.

801
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,398
l know it is only a matter of time

802
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,713
before my Queen is overthrown.

803
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,918
Her Majesty rules with the heart,

804
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,111
not with the head.

805
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,156
l understand.

806
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:41,156
lt is hard for a woman to forget her heart.

807
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,636
But, er...

808
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,276
what of you,

809
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,516
Walsingham ?

810
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:58,757
A wise man would be careful
not to put himself in the way of harm.

811
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,352
And how would a wise man do that ?

812
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:08,231
He would, as l said, change allegiance.

813
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,796
Allegiance ?

814
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,911
There are but two choices.

815
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,833
He would get into bed
with either Spain or France.

816
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,876
And whose bed

817
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,712
would you prefer ?

818
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,638
Your Majesty, may l speak with you ?

819
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,517
ln private.

820
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,996
Speak.

821
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,600
You are in the greatest danger.

822
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,395
You must believe me.

823
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,596
But you have a friend.

824
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,672
Someone who can guarantee your safety

825
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,916
and your throne.

826
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,996
A friend ?

827
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,516
The King of Spain.

828
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,836
Leave us.

829
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,515
How would he guarantee it ?

830
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,916
He would marry you.

831
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,275
Only to make an alliance. Nothing more.

832
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,550
He would not expect to...

833
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,556
He would live in Spain.

834
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,474
Why do you do this, Robert ?

835
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,233
Because l love you.

836
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:17,155
And though you will not see me,
l am the only one who would care for you.

837
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:21,392
You love me so much
you would have me be your whore ?

838
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,559
For God's sake, l do this for us.

839
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,438
l ask you to save some part of us !

840
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:39,072
Lord Robert, you may make whores of my
Ladies but you shall not make one of me.

841
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,716
Your Majesty.

842
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,836
Elizabeth is a witch !

843
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,716
A witch !

844
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,994
And her servant is the devil !

845
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,116
Get out ! Get out !

846
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,435
Of course l shall deny it.

847
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,353
Your Majesty must publicly dissociate
herself from this most bloody act.

848
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,396
l never ordered it.

849
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,675
Of course, Madam, of course.

850
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,038
You must also make conciliatory gestures
towards the Spanish.

851
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:49,238
Your dependence upon their goodwill
is greater than ever.

852
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,676
- l must...
- The word ''must'' is not used to princes.

853
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,869
l have followed your advice
in all the affairs of my kingdom, but

854
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:07,034
your policies would make England
nothing but part of France or Spain.

855
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,716
From this moment
l am going to follow my own opinion.

856
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,917
Forgive me, Madam,
but you are only a woman.

857
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,916
l may be a woman, Sir William, but
if l choose l have the heart of a man !

858
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,915
l am my father's daughter.

859
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,029
l am not afraid of anything.

860
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,072
l...

861
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:40,229
l deeply regret, Madam,
if l have caused you such offence

862
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,312
though God knows
all my advice has only ever been

863
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,354
to secure Your Majesty's throne.

864
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,910
And l am grateful for it.

865
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,078
l have decided to create you
Lord Burghley,

866
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,118
so you may enjoy your retirement
in greater ease.

867
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:10,159
- Madam...
- That will be all, Lord Burghley.

868
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,633
Majesty...

869
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,876
Madam, if l may ?

870
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,715
A prince should never flinch
from being blamed

871
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,033
for acts of ruthlessness which are
necessary for safeguarding the State

872
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,076
and their own person.

873
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,833
You must take these things so much
to heart that you do not fear to strike

874
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:11,318
even the very nearest that you have

875
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,835
if they be implicated.

876
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,876
lt has been made known to me

877
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,556
there is a priest abroad in the land,
carrying letters from Rome

878
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,393
to those who mean to harm you.

879
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,398
Norfolk's power in Court is growing.

880
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,040
lt is said that he and his foreign allies

881
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,032
are raising an army
to outnumber your own.

882
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,634
lfYour Majesty does not act soon

883
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,676
then he will.

884
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,354
Find the priest,
and those who harbour him.

885
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,149
Right, search every room !
You two, upstairs !

886
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,750
Where is Lord Arundel ?

887
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,116
He's not here, sir.

888
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,274
Do you know where your father is ?

889
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,958
You were carrying letters from the Pope.

890
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,600
To whom were you told to give them ?

891
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,116
Tell me,

892
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,470
what is God to you ?

893
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,790
Has He abandoned you ?

894
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:39,678
ls He such a worldly God that
He must play at politics and conspiracy ?

895
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,190
ls He not divine ?

896
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:49,111
Tell me the truth, as if you were
face to face with Him now.

897
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,435
l am a patient man, Father.

898
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,272
Sussex,

899
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,032
Gardiner,

900
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,792
Arundel.

901
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,440
A man will confess to anything

902
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,550
under torture.

903
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,676
And Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester.

904
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:48,518
Madam, this document was also found
among the priest's possessions.

905
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,310
From His Holiness the Pope
to His Grace the Duke of Norfolk.

906
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:02,110
''To legitimise your claim to the throne
of England, His Holiness proposes

907
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:06,318
''Your Grace should take as your bride
Mary, Queen of Scots,

908
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,356
and overthrow Elizabeth...''

909
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,557
The illegitimate and heretical whore

910
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,074
who now sits upon the throne.

911
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:20,679
All Norfolk need do is sign this paper,
and treason will have been committed.

912
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,315
Then let him sign it.

913
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,475
And let it all be done.

914
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,396
ln the future,

915
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,716
when England is safe again and faithful,

916
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,430
they will thank me for this act
and forget the manner of it.

917
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,116
ls it not true ?

918
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,548
Deliver this most carefully.

919
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,989
What is the meaning of this ?

920
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:12,551
Your Grace is arrested.
You must go with these men to the Tower.

921
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,438
l must do nothing by your orders.
l am Norfolk.

922
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,317
You were Norfolk.

923
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,675
The dead have no titles.

924
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,595
You were the most powerful man
in England

925
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,752
and could have been greater still

926
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,752
but you had not the courage to be loyal.

927
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:45,555
Only the conviction of your own vanity.

928
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:50,794
l think, Walsingham, a man's courage
is in the manner of his death.

929
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,038
l am content to die for my beliefs.

930
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,596
So cut off my head

931
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,715
and make me a martyr.

932
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,358
The people will always remember it.

933
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,072
No...

934
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,710
They will forget.

935
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,476
Your Majesty

936
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,916
knows that

937
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,600
l did it only for my faith.

938
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,836
Nothing more.

939
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,836
All your many kindnesses
are remembered.

940
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:41,039
You must not think
we care not for your children.

941
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,471
Your Majesty is merciful and forgiving.

942
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,435
What kept you, Walsingham ?

943
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,236
l have been waiting.

944
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,116
Your Majesty...

945
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,668
They are all gone to the Tower.

946
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,716
Your friends.

947
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,356
Tell me,

948
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,718
how should l serve thee, Robert ?

949
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,110
My course is run.

950
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,075
Just tell me why.

951
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,356
Why ?

952
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,316
Madam,

953
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,516
is it not plain enough to you ?

954
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,753
lt is no easy thing to be loved

955
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,390
by the Queen.

956
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,358
lt would corrupt the soul of any man.

957
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,233
Now, for God's sake, kill me.

958
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,236
No...

959
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,114
l think rather to let you live.

960
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,751
Madam, that is not wise.
Lord Robert has committed treason.

961
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,789
- He must be made example of.
- And l will make an example of him.

962
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,595
He shall be kept alive

963
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,955
to always remind me

964
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,278
of how close l came to danger.

965
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,713
l have rid England of her enemies.

966
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,075
What do l do now ?

967
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,510
Am l to be made of stone ?

968
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,795
Must l be touched by nothing ?

969
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,314
Aye, Madam, to reign supreme.

970
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:32,838
All men need something greater than
themselves to look up to and worship.

971
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,791
They must be able to touch the divine

972
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,916
here on earth.

973
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,358
She had such power over men's hearts.

974
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,390
They died for her.

975
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,511
They have found nothing to replace her.

976
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,954
You will be damned for this !

977
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,632
Tonight l think l die.

978
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,954
Speak up !

979
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,316
Kat...

980
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,000
l have become a virgin.

981
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,635
Observe, Lord Burghley.

982
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,750
l am married

983
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,310
to England.
