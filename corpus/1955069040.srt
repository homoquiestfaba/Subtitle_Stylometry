00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,907
 <i> I think Jack's piece of cake</i>  

2
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,012
      is just way too big.      

3
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,481
          Mom: I think          
      you might be right.       

4
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,951
            Ah, uh!             

5
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,755
  Are you ready for bed, Jack?  

6
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,423
       Mommy tucks me in.       

7
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,425
       Tonight is one of        
    the nights that daddy       

8
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,494
    tucks you in, okay Jack?    

9
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,463
              No.               

10
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,165
     Boy you are stubborn.      

11
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,534
  That is daddy's worst trait.  

12
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,769
        Dad: I do recall        
        that's how I got        

13
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,270
 my prom date with you though.  

14
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,339
         Hmm, let's go.         

15
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,777
      I'll be right down.       

16
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,215
      Hey come here, come       
       here, look at me.        

17
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,618
  Remember, your worst quality  

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,220
     can also be your best.     

19
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,222
             Okay?              

20
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,691
         Give me a hug.         

21
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,996
   And he's in for the score!   

22
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,500
      Good night sweetie.       

23
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,002
          I love you.           

24
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,846
           (rumbling)

     <i> Don't, please. Help!</i>

28
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:54,339
           (growling)           

29
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:14,059

      (footsteps running)       

33
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,989

35
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,232
        Brandon: She is         
    thirsting for my penis.     

36
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,100
         She's hungry.          

37
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,502
      man: She is so bad.       

38
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,070
    She can't see out of the    
   back of her head, Nimrod.    

39
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,471
     Yeah, but I'm saying--     

40
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,041
        Yeah, and I'm a         
    sexual being, big woop.     

41
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,109
         I'm out there.         

42
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,210
 I've put myself in the field.  

43
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,912
        I'm a predator.         

44
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,648
      I'm like, (hisses).       

45
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,816
          Another one.          

46
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,819
         (party music)

49
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,368
         Ah, looks like         
       I'm just in time.        

50
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,704
       Gives me an idea.

        (humming)               

52
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,475
             So...              

53
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,177
        Happy birthday.         

54
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,211
     Happy birthday, Jack.      

55
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,279
         Jack: Thanks.          

56
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,514
           -Hey, man.           
             -Hey.              

57
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,949
        -How you doing?         
             -Good.             

58
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,184
      Why are you sitting       
      here? You feel okay?      

59
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,552
             Yeah.              

60
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,955
     All right, well, I got     
    my eye on a few ladies.     

61
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,024
       You wanna go, you        
     wanna go talk to them?     

62
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,226
    And do a little hunting,    
    a little pussy hunting?     

63
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,494
        -Jack: I'm okay.        
             -Yeah!             

64
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,762
          Go on ahead.          

65
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,497
       I have a favor to        
      ask from you though.      

66
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,165
       Can you watch the        
       door while I go to       

67
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,967
     the bathroom, I really     
   have to use the bathroom.    

68
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,369
           You don't            
       wanna go in there.       

69
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,304
         You know, ah,          
     goddamn, that stings!      

70
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,006
       Does uh, does your       
    bro wanna play flip cup?    

71
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,708
      He's not-- he's not       
      my brother actually,      

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,876
        he's my cousin.         

73
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,211
  I don't care, I don't care.   

74
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,380
     You keep saying stuff.     
         I don't care.          

75
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,547
       Do you wanna play?       

76
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,815
      I'm good, thank you.      

77
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,884
      I'll play. Do I need      
       any dice for this?       

78
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,387
     What's happening here,     
   I like it, it's very good,   

79
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,889
  very passionate, very sexy.   

80
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,024
     If we could just get a     
    little of this left hand    

81
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,559
       down on the titty.       
    Just touch them titties.    

82
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,061
     Just one bit, come on.     
    What-- Hi, how are you?     

83
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,396
  Turner, what are you doing?   

84

        Hi, I'm Turner,         
       nice to meet you.

00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,868
     Whereas Little Turner,     
      he was taken care of      

131
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,738
    by an experienced third     
 party participant last night.  

132
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,540
 What, no way, you f-ed a girl? 

133
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,641
      Turner: Oh, better.       

134
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,109
  You told her you loved her?   

135
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,679
         What, no, man,         

136
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,014
     I got my dick sucked.      

137
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,549
        Nice, you got it        
      on the forehead cam?      

138
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,051
    Oh, every juicy detail,     
      I mean from her head      

139
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,819
   just slowly moving down...   

140
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,388
          Ah, into the          
      point of no return.       

141
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,756
       Oh yeah, brother!        

142
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,823
          Enters your           
     gravitational pull...      

143
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,926
      -Turner: Yeah-heah!       
     -Just wiggling around.     

144
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,094
     I mean if I'm the sun,     
   she is the closest planet    

145
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,262
          to the sun.           

146
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,664
        Whatever planet,        
        it's sucked in!         

147
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,266
       Exactly, you know        
        what I'm saying?        

148
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,001
   Brandon: Or she's like the   
  Millennium Falcon, you know,  

149
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,770
    when she's getting drawn    
    in by the tractor beam,     

150
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:32,904
     and she can't escape,      

151
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,576
    because she's helpless.     

152
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,576
   Jack, you must be reading    
 the longest damn birthday card 

153
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,744
    of all time over there.     

154
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,879
        Yeah seriously,         
        who's that from?        

155
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,781
     It's from Uncle Mike.      

156
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,549
 Oh Uncle Mike, how's he doing? 

157
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,785
    He's okay, he invited me    
   to come over to his place    

158
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,919
       over winter break.       

159
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,721
  Oh, just you and Uncle Mike,  

160
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,523
      that sounds lovely,       
         I'm not going.         

161
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,557
         Can I see it?          

162
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,825
  Okay, he didn't invite you.   

163
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,628
        Brandon: It says        
    he's not gonna be there.    

164
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,396
       Oh, tight as fuck,       
       definitely going.        

165
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,598
All of us, what do you say boys?

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,665
            I'm in!             

167
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:01,933
       I don't think it's       
      really a good idea.       

168
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,934
       Oh come on, Jack!        

169
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,803
   You gotta let me come, man   
         If I don't get         

170
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,171
  to go away for winter break,  

171
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,873
     my dad said he's gonna     
     make me work for him!      

172
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,275
      You know how fucking      
       lame that is man?        

173
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,610
      He works at Quiznos!      

174
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,980
    Look, Uncle Mike is not     
   really the epitome of fun.   

175
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,815
   Fuck Uncle Mike then. He's   
 not even gonna be there right? 

176
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:17,949
    He's not gonna be there.    

177
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,417
       See, just us boys!       

178
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,585
          Three guys.           

179
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,786
            -Hmm-mm.            
          -One cabin.           

180
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,488
             -Uhuh!             
      -Non-stop fellatio.       

181
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,556
           (gargling)           

182
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,091
     All night, from girls.     

183
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,726
        My God, with the        
     fucking touching man,      

184
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,394
      I'm trying to do my       
     own thing here, shit.      

185
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,462
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.      

186
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:34,065
        (country music)         

187
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,800
   Hell man, I know my whole    
   family ain't getting into    

188
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,103
     heaven 'cause if I get     
     there, and I see them,     

189
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,638
     I'll know I'm in hell.     

190
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,439
I believe when I get to heaven, 

191
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,075
     I'm gonna get a lot of     
    just all that old pussy     

192
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,144
   I had before I got there.    
   It's gonna be right there    

193
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,412
     waiting for me again.      

194
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,280
    Yeah, but I don't really    
   worry though about dying.    

195
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,516
    It's not so much dying a    
    virgin, it's just dying     

196
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,917
        without like...         

197
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,020
        Doing anything.         

198
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:55,954
       Turner: Nah dude,        
        you'll be fine.         

199
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,088
    I've done a little bit.     

200
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,857
  Turner: You'll be good, man.  
    That's why we're taking     

201
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,358
    this little vacay, man.     
      I'm gonna teach you,      

202
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,193
     you're my little cub,      
      my little baby cub.       

203
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,395
  All right, I can be the cub.  

204
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,863
          Turner: Yeah          
     brother, that's right.     

205
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,297
       Brandon: Suckling        
        on her nipples.         

206
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,166
       Turner: Yeah, no,        
     no, no, none of that.      

207
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,785
           Well well.           

208
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,623
          Oof, oh man.          

209
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,126
   What the fuck is this man.   

210
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,095
   This is my uncle's house.    

211
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,432
   Turner: Well, I mean, was    
it in a fire or something man?  

212
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,567
       Brandon: Come on.        

213
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,735
      Turner: Place looks       
      like a fucking turd.      

214
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,769
        No, it's rustic.        

215
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,906
It's how it's supposed to look. 

216
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,407
    Turner: Okay, all right.    

217
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,180
  I'm just saying, this place   
    doesn't exactly give me,    

218
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,048
you know, warm cuddly feelings. 

219
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,917
    Brandon: Isn't that why     
   you brought your shotgun?    

220
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,052
  You're just a crazy person.   

221
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,354
       Turner: Just wait,       
      I got it, I got it.       

222
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,656
           Good grab.           

223
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,761
      Oh, a little chilly.      

224
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,331
          -Oh, sorry.           
        -Yeah, whatever.        

225
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,632
             Yeah.              

226
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,171
        Turner: At least        
     the inside looks nicer     

227
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,606
       than the outside!        

228
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,941
   Oh, shotgun biggest room!    

229
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,142
        Brandon: No way,        
    that's the coolest room!    

230
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,111
 Uncle's Mike recorded message: 
<i> Hey Jack, it's Uncle Mike,</i>     

231
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,563
  <i> just checking in. I wanted</i>   
<i> to make sure that you got in</i>   

232
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:31,014
    <i> all right. Uhm, look,</i>      
   <i> I'm not gonna be around</i>     

233
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,284
     <i> for the next week or</i>      
    <i> so, and I'm not gonna</i>      

234
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,986
        <i> have any cell</i>          
     <i> service where I am.</i>       

235
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,857
  <i> So I uh, I guess I'll just</i>   
  <i> see you when I get there.</i>    

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,526
       <i> Uhm, be careful,</i>        
       <i> all right kiddo?</i>        

237
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,827
     Brandon: I'll wake you     
    up with my midget porn,     

238
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,696
    You're not complaining.     
  You brought it on yourself!   

239
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,465
             Man...             

240
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,138
     Turner: What the fuck.     

241
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,209
              Bro!              

242
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,978
        -Brandon: What?         
         -Turner: What?         

243
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,313
     Oh, the breaker broke.     

244
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,548
         Turner: Yeah.          

245
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,185
  What are we supposed to do?   

246
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,619
       Live like, fucking       
     Jebediah and his Amish     

247
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,154
  goddamn band mates or what?   

248
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,522
  We'll call someone tomorrow.  

249
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,457
          No, I want a          
     flashlight right now.      

250
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,759
    Where's our flashlight?     

251
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,394
        I don't know.           

252
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,528
   Turner: That's all right.    
         This'll work.          

253
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,831
       No it won't work!        
 I'm in the middle of a battle. 

254
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,932
   Can you pause it, please?    

255
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,066
  Would you pause it, Turner?   

256
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,868
  You're being inconsiderate.   

257
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:09,107
           (heaving)            

258
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,940
     Jack: Oh shit, shit...     

259
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,675
             Shit!              

260
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,589
       I got there, I got       
     there to pick you up,      

261
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,958
      I can get home safe.      

262
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,426
         Dude, you only         
      have your Learner's.      

263
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,660
         You don't have         
        a wallet on you.        

264
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,028
 You're wearing a garbage bag.  

265
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,498
        So where did you        
       sleep last night?        

266
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,167
          A dumpster.           

267
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,002
     Brandon: Why-- Why are     
   you sleeping in dumpster?    

268
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,637
         I don't know.          

269
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,073
You know if it's something weird
    like some fetish thing,     

270
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,575
      I get it, all right.      

271
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,544
    Let's just say I get it.    

272
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:23,147
      So you can tell me,       
     if you want, you know.     

273
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,418
   I'm into some nasty shit,    

274
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,320
      I'm sure you got a--      
         We're related.         

275
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,888
       You must have some       
     weird stuff going on.      

276
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,391
           Sexually.            

277
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,735
        Hey, all right!         

278
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,948
         Jack, honey...         

279
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,389
        Mommy has to go.        

280
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,590
  And I'm gonna take you over   
 to your cousin's house, okay?  

281
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,191
             Okay.              

282
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,595
  Promise me something, Jack.   

283
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,233
       When you turn 18,        

284
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,802
       if you feel sick,        

285
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,905
        don't be afraid.        

286
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,509
        Repeat after me.        

287

288
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,911
         When I'm 18...         

289
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,713
      Jack: When I'm 18...      

290
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,081
       If I feel sick...        

291
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,482
    Jack: If I feel sick...

00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,232
     <i> No, no, I'm the guy</i>       
   <i> that sent you the photo</i>

     <i> Yeah, with the razor</i>

302
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,944
     Hey, come on, I swear      
    I'm not a serial killer.    

303
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,416
 I mean the app I'm using says  
   we're only two miles away.   

304
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,751
   Jack, where are you going?   

305
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,119
     Just out, for a walk.      

306
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,121
  Turner: Okay, tell me more.   

307
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,691
       (laughs) Oh, yeah        
      you're fucking wet.       

308
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,126
     Would you get off the      
  phone with your mom already?  

309
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,028
      Turner: I'll fucking      
    kill you I swear to God.    

310
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,296
         Just hang up!          

311
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,545
  Mike: So what's the status?   

312
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,714
     Mom: He has the gene.      

313
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,449
             Shit.              

314
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,586
    Well, I don't know what     
       we were expecting.       

315
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,620
  Mom: The chains didn't hold.  

316
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,122
  I need you to get the cage.   

317
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,623
          Mike:<i> That's</i>

318
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,059
     Mom: You know I can't.     
  Someone could recognize me.   

319
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,562
      I'll arrange to get       
       it there tomorrow.       

320
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,097
   Mom: He needs it tonight.    

321
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,632
 Well, I can't get it tonight.  

322
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,234
       Mom:<i> Mike, if you</i>        
    <i> don't wanna go back--</i>      

323
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,470
    Look, I've done my best     
     to lead a normal life,     

324
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,873
      and I'm not about to      
   fuck it all up right now.    

325
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,809
         We had a pact.         

326
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,078
        You're lucky I'm        
      even talking to you.      

327
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,247
       He's gonna have to       
      wait till tomorrow.       

328

       Turner:<i> Well, it's</i>

332
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,931
       Brandon: Ah, shit.       

333
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,399
     What the fuck is this?     

334
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,001
  Brandon: Ah, it'll probably   
     turn on in the morning     

335
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,435
        like yesterday.         

336
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,137
  Ah, what the fuck man. This   
    is Jack's uncle's house.    

337
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,439
       He should be here        
    dealing with this shit.     

338
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,175
     Do you know the story      
      about Jack's family       

339
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,509
          by the way?           

340
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,312
   Yeah, his mom like shot up   
  his dad or something, right?  

341
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,047
  No, it goes way beyond that.  

342
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,348
          A lot more.           

343
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,284
     All right, well every      
      family has problems.      

344
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,853
      I mean, shit, my dad      
    used to be an alcoholic.    

345
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,688
 Still is, we just got over it. 

346
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,357
     They have a Wikipedia      
     page, just about them.     

347
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,592
            Oh, God.            

348
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,328
       Yeah, okay, it all       
       started with uhm,

    Yeah, oh, but you know,     

366
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,397
     Jack's mom, that gets

     settled and sobered up     

500
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:16,814
 doesn't mean our guest has to.

513
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,536
        I told your wife        
      I heard the attack.

      half off, didn't it?      

517
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,820
  Maybe you could tell me what  
 happened to her wedding ring?  

518
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,025
       (phone vibrating)        

519
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,627
 This is an important investor. 

520
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,162
          I gotta go.           

521
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,066
       Rose, if you will.       

522
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,505
     What up, motherfucker?     

523
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,074
             Gonzo:             
 <i> Oh, I'm ready to bake cakes,</i>  

524
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,576
   <i> I just need some flour.</i>     

525
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,810
              Hey.              

526
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,914
    If you need anything,       
          let me know.          

527
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,783
  Rose: Thank you for coming.   

528
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,299
    Hey, what are you doing?    

529
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,100
     Just rolling a joint.      

530
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,270
      Yeah, it's kind of a      
     big milestone for me,      

531
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,306
       so, if you cannot        
       just hover over me       

532
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,840
        that'd be great.        

533
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,711
      Why are there Animal      
 Crackers all over the ground?  

534
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,980
       I don't know, I'm        
       not really focused       

535
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,783
    on the Animal Crackers,     
 because this is my second time 

536
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,385
   smoking, so it's gonna be    
  my first time getting high,   

537
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,653
    so it has to be perfect.    

538
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,325
    See it's, not too tight.    

539
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,361
You gotta let the grass breathe.

540
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,031
       Lesson number one.       

541
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,366
      Jack: All right come      
     to my room, all right?     

542
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,335
  Okay, I'll be there as s...   
           Oh, shit.            

543
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,908
         -Howdy-doody.          
     -Jack: Close the door.     

544
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,042
             Okay.              

545
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,015
     What are we watching?      

546
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,083
        Just watch this.        

547
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:09,386
           (growling)           

548
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,289
      Well that's creepy.       
          What is it?           

549
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,323
     Like a YouTube video?      

550
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,658
    No it's from the GoPro.     

551
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,562
           (chewing)            

552
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,035
        Is that the girl        
         from the news?         

553
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,337
           (growling)           

554
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,172
 (screams) You killed someone,  

555
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,640
      you killed somebody.      

556
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,875
    I think I'm a werewolf.     

557
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,512
      That's a really bad       
   legal defense, all right.    

558
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,280
      We're gonna need to       
     get a lawyer. We need      
        to work on that.        

559
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,248
    Look, look at the hands.    

560
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,784
     Those aren't my hands.     

561
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,021
          Oh, my God.           

562
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,288
  Do you think I'll turn soon?  

563
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,024
    We should call someone.     

564
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,210
  What happened to your dick?   
   That's the real question,    
           you know.            

565
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:51,395
    Did that transform too?     
    Did it get much bigger?     

566
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,897
             -What?             
      -That would be good.      

567
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,533
     You should definitely      
         call someone.          

568
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:03,640
       Recorded message:        
     <i> Uh hello, Wade here</i>       
      <i> from Nana's Attic.</i>       

569
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:08,445
 <i> Looks like we've got an item</i>  
   <i> here for you to pick up.</i>    

570
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:12,049
         Oh fuck, okay.         
      I got some bad news.      

571
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,316
          -Jack: What?          
     -I have some bad news?     

572
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,418
          Jack: What?           

573
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,752
 Uh, we got like four more days 

574
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,054
     of you turning into a      
    werewolf, it turns out.     

575
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,656
   Isn't it only supposed to    
   last like one more night?    

576
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,391
     Brandon:<i> No, the moon</i>      
  <i> only has to basically full</i>   

577
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,093
    <i> for you to transform.</i>      
      <i> And I'm looking at</i>       

578
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,261
   <i> the lunar calendar, and</i>     
    <i> it says that we've got</i>     

579
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,763
     <i> four more nights of</i>       
    <i> basically full moons.</i>      

580
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,399
     We're losing sun. This     
    is-- Oh, fucking Christ.    

581
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,434
  Okay, if the sun goes down,   

582
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:31,768
 I'm dropping you in the woods. 

583
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,538
 Because I don't think I should 
  be in the same car with you.  

584
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,705
            Thanks.             

585
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:36,740
      What do you expect,       

586
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,175
   I'm not gonna die for you.   

587
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,243
 Well, I mean I'd die for you-- 
    I'm not gonna just die.     

588
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,245
  I'm not even dying for you,   
  you would just be eating me.  

589
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,613
 I'm not gonna be your dinner.  

590
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,249
     I'd sacrifice myself,      

591
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,918
          but that's a          
      different situation.      

592
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,519
     Anyway, I don't wanna      
    have to explain myself.     

593
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,670
       Jack: Hi, I'm here       
     to pick something up.      

594
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,705
             Name?              

595
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,109
    Jack: Jack, Jack Luskey.    

596
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,111
              ID?               

597
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,213
           I lost it.           

598
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,348
      We're in a big rush,      

599
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,749
       if there's any way       
      you could hurry up,       

600
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,851
         it'd be great.         

601
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,300
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.   

602
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,302
           Out there.           

603
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,371
        Jack: Excuse me?        

604
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,597
              Wow.              

605
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,101
  Yeah that's a nice one, hah.  

606
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,871
Has a little wear and tear,     
    but it's sturdy as hell.    

607
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,675
    Must've been a rich lady    
  to afford a cage like that.   

608
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,077
      Real nice lady too.       

609
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,280
       This is excellent        
       ironwork up here.        

610
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,148
         Son, would you         
      get down from there       

611
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,184
   before you kill yourself?    

612
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,385
             Sorry.             

613
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,722
       Sorry about that.        

614
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,792
    The truck's for me too?     

615
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,464
       I'll drive my car.       

616
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,777
            Fellas?             

617
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,219
           (moaning)            

618
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,853
      Crystal: I'm so hot.      

619
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,956
      Yeah, yeah you are.       

620
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,560
    You're hotter than your     
 profile picture, that's rare.  

621
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,896
     (laughs) That's gotta      
      be the nicest thing       

622
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,431
  anybody has ever said to me.  

623
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,236
        Hey, do you know        
      about law and stuff?      

624
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,239
     Well, that's kinda non     
     sequitur, but I guess.     

625
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,773
         I just, I got          
       this friend Jimmy        

626
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,209
       and he was asking        
        me if, you know,        

627
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,577
      if an intruder broke      
        into your house         

628
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,280
  and, and this intruder, say,  

629
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,716
     had a record, and was      
       wanted for murder,       

630
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,918
   and, and you killed them,    

631
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,586
        is that a crime?        

632
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,588
     Well it doesn't matter     
     if they're a murderer,     

633
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,923
        in order to kill        
   somebody you have to feel    

634
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,291
  like your life's in danger.   

635
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:42,959
  Yeah but it wouldn't matter   
   either way, though, right?   

636
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,428
    He wouldn't get punished    
   if this was a bad person.    

637
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,866
    Okay, well, the Jew that    
    killed Lee Harvey Oswald    

638
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,434
     still got in trouble.      

639
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,636
          Are we good?          

640
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,239
  Yeah, fuck, sorry, I'm just   
a little out of it I guess.     

641
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:59,142
           (moaning)            

642
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,578
    I don't know, maybe I'm     
   just not in the mood, I...   

643
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,914
     Well, that's not what      
     this little guy says.      

644
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,783
           Oh, oh...            

645
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,285
    It's funny you say that,    

646
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,420
     'cause I actually call     
       him Little Turner.       

647
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,122
      Oh, so he's little.       

648
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,623
   Oh, he never stays little.   

649
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,392
       That's the trick.        

650
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,895
           (moaning)            

651
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:19,996
         I got an idea.         

652
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,131
       Now, what's that.        

653
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,633
    You care if I film this?    

654
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,669
     Only if I get a copy.      

655
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:28,872
   (laughs) You are amazing.    

656
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,907
        Hmm, come here.         

657
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,810
     -You stay right here.      
           -Will do.            

658
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,911
          Don't move!           

659
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,079
          All right...          

660
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,919
     Fuck it's not in here.     

661
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,254
   Crystal: Forget about it.    

662
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,589
      I know where it is,       
     just stay right here,      

663
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,891
          don't move!           

664
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,392
       Hold that thought.       

665
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,330
            (farts)             

666
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,546
         What the f...          

667
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,015
             Fuck.              

668
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,376
    -Brandon: What's wrong?     
            -No gas.            

669
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:40,777
           Oh, shit.            

670
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,947
      The car doesn't have      
  a warning light or anything?  

671
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,483
              Man.              

672
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:47,784
      Jack: How much time       
      do you think we got?      

673
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,853
     Oh God, I don't know,      
 when do you usually transform? 

674
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:50,720
         I don't know.          

675
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,525
    Do you think we can put     
   the cage in the other car?   

676
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,161
        Nah no way, it's        
         way too small.         

677
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:02,699
      Ah shit, shit, shit,      
        shit, shit man!         

678
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:03,933
Shit, we're in big trouble here!

679
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,034
          Jack: Relax,          
      we're gonna be fine.      

680
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,035
   No, you're gonna be fine.    

681
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,170
     You're gonna be okay,      

682
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,805
         and I'm gonna,         
      you're gonna eat me.      

683
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,607
  Jack: Help me with the cage.  

684
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,748
      See if the werewolf       
        in you eats me,         

685
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,350
   it's not 'cause it's evil,   

686
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:21,985
  it's because it's a monster.  

687
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,853
      Jack: This is good.       

688
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,357
       Brandon: See, so,        
     if the werewolf in you     

689
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,760
      eats me, it doesn't       
         make it evil,          

690
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,629
 it's just a monster, you know. 

691
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,131
      It doesn't have any       
        control over it.        

692
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,699
       Jack: That sounds        
       pretty evil to me.       

693
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:38,935
     Brandon: No not if you     
 don't have a choice, see like, 

694
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,304
    you know like the Hulk,     
       see with the Hulk,       

695
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:44,607
     you put the Hulk in a      
terrorist base it just destroys 

696
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,377
       everything in it's       
     path, and he's a hero.     

697
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:50,280
     He's off the hook, in      
      a church, and yeah,       

698
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,048
   he's obviously not a hero.   

699
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,150
That's what makes it a monster, 
   he doesn't have a choice.    

700
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:59,289
     Okay, the lock is on.      

701
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,590
          Jack: Good.           

702
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:01,758
          Take off all          
       your clothes then.       

703
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,959
    Jack: Gimme your watch.     

704
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,562
  Brandon: All right but why,   
I really like this watch.       

705
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,564
     Just gimme your watch.     
       I won't break it.        

706
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,365
             Okay.              

707
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,668
           All right.           

708
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,670
         -There you go.         
        -Jack: Thanks.          

709
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,638
 And now take off your clothes. 

710
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,739
          Jack: What?           

711
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,074
      Brandon: I need your      
    clothes, you'll rip 'em     

712
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,008
      when you transform.       

713
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,743
       Come on, hurry up,       
    hurry up, please.           

714
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:21,878
     Jack: All right fine.      

715
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,214
             -Here.             
             -Okay.             

716
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,082
           Thank you.           

717
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,484
      Oh and the jacket, I      
      need the jacket too.      

718
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,985
         Jack: No, I'll         
        keep my jacket.         

719
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,687
     No, no, no you'll tear     
     it when you transform.     

720
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,355
    It's a nice jacket, you     
 don't wanna year that jacket.  

721
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,756
        Jack: I'll take         
         it off before.         

722
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,825
         What if you're         
      not able to, though?      

723
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,461
        It'll be like an        
       experience, yeah?        

724
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,496
  You love experiences, right?  

725
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,130
      I do like ex-- Okay.      

726
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,232
           All right.           

727
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,501
     Jack: Get outta here!      

728
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,002
       No, I wanna watch.       

729
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,371
        No, uh, Brandon         
        get out of here,        

730
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,539
      you saw the footage.      

731
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,075
        Ah, fine, okay!         

732
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,943
           All right.           

733
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,311
             -Wait.             
        -Brandon: What?         

734
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,613
    What do I do about food?    

735
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,282
    Uh, oh I got crackers.      

736
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,885
          Jack: Shit.           

737
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,388
     Brandon: I'll see you      
  later, good luck, good bye.   

738
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,047
    Rose: Can you walk Joey?    

739
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,250
    And what would be the       
   point of that, sweetheart?   

740
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,953
        He needs to get         
       out, it's healthy.       

741
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,455
    That dog ain't healthy.     

742
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,691
       And it ain't never       
       gonna be healthy,        

743
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,027
    'cause I am not spending    
      $10,000 of my money       

744
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,395
     to fix his broke ass.      

745
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,303
           All right.           

746
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:54,871
         I'll walk him.         

747
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,578
    Come here Joey boy, yes.    

748
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,080
      Let's go for a walk.      

749
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:10,219
      Let's me and you go       
    for a walk, Mommy said,     

750
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,921
     "Let's go for a walk."     

751
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,959
 So, let's take you for a walk. 

752
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,530
           Out we go.           

753
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:25,868
          (gun fires)           

754
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,109
         Holy shit, you         
      wouldn't believe it.      

755
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,445
    His legs must've healed.    
          He ran away.          

756
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,113
       Good night, babe.        

757
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:44,687
          (gun fires)           

758
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,956
      All right babe, so,       
     this is the Remington      

759
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,225
 12 Gauge, I'm gonna teach you  
   how to fire this shotgun.    

760
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,260
      Girl as fucking sexy      
     as you, needs to know      

761
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,462
   how to fire a gun, right?    

762
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,763
 Too many predators out there.  

763
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,897
            I know!             

764
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,866
   So you're gonna take-- You   
got your safety mechanism here, 

765
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,001
       the trigger. This        
     is where you're gonna      

766
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,202
       -throw the shell.        
            -Okay.              

767
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,437
       You wanna throw it       
    in there, you cock it,      

768
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,306
       put it up to your        
   shoulder, find your target   

769
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,507
           and fire.            

770
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,242
    All right, so there's no    
   ammo now, I just want you    

771
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,310
        to learn how to         
       like hold the gun,       

772
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,645
get a sense of the weight of it.

773
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:09,679
       Seems easy enough.       

774
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:10,813
       Yeah, yeah, yeah.        

775
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,015
 Here we go. Right, you got it. 

776
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:13,116
   I need like a smaller one.   

777
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:14,350
   Yeah, I'll get you a mini.   

778
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,985
           (laughing)           

779
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,920
   All right, so just aim at    
    like them flock of birds    

780
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,422
   out in the distance there,   

781
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,591
     no ammo, but just you      
    know, get a sense of it.    

782
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:22,892
             Poof!              

783
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,260
     There you go, oh baby,     
     you're so fucking good     

784
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,062
  with a fucking shotgun, hmm!  

785
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,925
          Jack, Jack?           

786
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,660
     Open the fucking cage.     

787
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:58,961
       Okay, one second.        

788
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,103
           It's open.           

789
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,543
         What is that?          

790
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,945
     Oh, sorry about that.      
        That's nothing.         

791
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,514
          Here you go,          

792
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,582
   you should get in the car,   
    it's warmed up for you.     

793
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,119
All right, come here, come here.

794
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,390
This is so Brokeback right now. 

795
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,225
            Oh shit.            

796
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,008
       We can't have him        
      knowing about this.       

797
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,276
         Brandon: Why?          

798
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,011
       Because I fucking        
        killed someone.         

799
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,079
        Oh right, yeah.         

800
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,482
  That's fucked up by the way.  

801
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,751
     Turner: Yeah, morning      
       to you too, Jack.        

802
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,587
              -Hi.              
              -Hi.              

803
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,788
          Hey, hello.           

804
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,590
    So you got a new truck?     

805
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,292
   And what's with the cage?    

806
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:07,964
        Uh, this is for         
       Uncle Mike's cat.        

807
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,599
    Oh my God, I love cats.     

808
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,368
    That cage is for a cat?     

809
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,471
 That cat must be fat as shit.  

810
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:16,939
        Yeah, well it's         
        an outdoors cat,        

811
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,108
       so it just mostly        
      sticks in the back.       

812
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,444
         -Turner: Uhuh.         
        -Hunts rodents.         

813
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,979
     Can we play with her?      

814
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:24,714
      Brandon: Sure if you      
     could find her, yeah.      

815
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,617
     Crystal: Kitty, kitty!     

816
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,020
         Brandon: Who's         
     that girl by the way?      

817
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,823
     What her? Yeah, that's     
      uh-- That's Crystal.      

818
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,558
   Yeah, she's my slam piece.   

819
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,493
       Met her online and       
     God she just gives me      

820
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,228
      the biggest boners.       

821
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,396
        That's romantic.        

822
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:41,831
        Yeah, well I'll         
        let you get back        

823
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,733
  to whatever the fuck Houdini  
     trick you're planning,     

824
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:44,867
        I'm outta here.         

825
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,803
             -Baby!             
      -Brandon: Have fun.       

826
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,237
        (door knocking)         

827
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,639
     Yeah one sec, Brandon.     

828
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,141
        Oh, hey Turner.         

829
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,145
           Hey, man.            

830
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,681
         I feel like we         
      haven't chilled much      

831
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,149
       since we got here.       

832
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,284
          Yeah I know.          

833
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:02,418
              Hmm.              

834
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,686
      Sorry, I've just not      
     been feeling too well.     

835
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,087
    Yeah, that's all right.     

836
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,390
  By the way, you haven't seen  
  the GoPro anywhere have you?  

837
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,760
            No, no.             

838
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,663
     That's funny, 'cause I     
actually found it in this room, 

839
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:16,199
   just the other night. All    
   footage mysteriously gone    

840
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:17,433
           off of it.           

841
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,336
         -That's weird.         
         -Turner: Yeah.         

842
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,271
      Must've been Brandon      
  making one of those movies.   

843
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:23,873
      One of those movies?      

844
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,341
        Jack: You know.         

845
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,443
             Yeah.              

846
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,180
      Well, this was fun.       

847
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:32,982
        Let's chill some        
        more, all right?        

848
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,050
       Jack: Definitely.        

849
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:35,918
             Okay.              

850
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,694
           (groaning)           

851
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,829
        Oh, can I get my        
     watch back by the way?     

852
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,198
   -Jack: Oh I still need it.   
           -Oh, why?            

853
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,939
             Wow...             

854
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,208
      All right, awesome.       

855
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,610
  I'll set the watch for you.   

856
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,047
     And I'm setting it to      

857
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,217
             20:22.             

858
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,218
         -There you go.         
        -(door knocking)        

859
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,453
            Thanks.             

860
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,588
    I got it. Don't worry.      

861
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,139
              Hi.               

862
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,010
 Can I help you with something? 

863
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,118
       Gonzo:<i> Hey Jacky,</i>        
        <i> how you doing?</i>         

864
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,586
    Oh no, this is Brandon.     

865
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,654
            Brandon.            

866
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,422
       What's up, kiddo?        

867
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,590
        Oh nothing much,        
      I'm just mapping out      

868
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,691
        some strategies.        

869
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,426
      Uh, heck strategies.      

870
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,694
   <i> For uh, future tourneys.</i>    

871
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:52,962
   <i> It's Settlers of Catan.</i>     

872
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,063
          Do you play?          

873
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,665
    Yeah that's great homie.    

874
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,770
   Listen, where's Jacky at?    

875
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,272
     Wait uh, who are you?      

876
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,473
     I'm that motherfucker.     

877
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,544
    Hah, could you be           
     more specific please?      

878
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,848
          It's Gonzo.           

879
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,984
  Tell him to come by my spot.  

880
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,820
     He knows where I'm at.     

881
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,162
       Bring Jack out or        
     I'll crush your skull.     

882
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:31,867
    Uh, do you know a Gonzo?    

883
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,209
       I don't think he's       
     gonna come, I'm sorry.     

884
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,878
   If it was me, I would go.    

885
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,520
     Ah okay, well this...      

886
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,591
    I don't know if you need    
     to be this rough, sir,     

887
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,093
         I think it's a         
      little unnecessary.       

888
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:01,530
      So uhm, if you could      
       have him back here       

889
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,632
before eight o'clock, and that's
   really important you know.   

890
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:06,402
  I really-- That's essential.  

891
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:09,905
       If you could have        
       him before eight.        

892
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,909
      (car engine revving)      

893
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,912
      Eight o'clock, okay?      

894
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:01,624
   Hey Jacky, how you doing?    

895
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,428
    Can I get you anything?     

896
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,064
     A cigarette, a scotch?     

897
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,732
   Oh right, you don't drink.   

898
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:11,167
             Coke?              

899
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,736
       I'm fine, thanks.        

900
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,011
              So.               

901
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:24,680
           Jacky boy.           

902
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,919
  What did you see that night   
     at the train station?      

903
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,255
     I don't remember much.     

904
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,826
    You don't remember much?    

905
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,961
      Well Rose was there.      

906
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,099
 And then the black bear came.  

907
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:46,435
       And then Rose came       
        running to help         

908
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,803
 when she heard some screaming. 

909
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:53,442
        So my candy-ass,        

910
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,611
      narrow-behind wife,       

911
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,349
     came running when she      
      heard some screaming      

912
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:03,786
      from a motherfucker       
       she doesn't know,        

913
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,388
     who was being attacked     
        by a black bear.        

914
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,961
    You know Jack, a lot of     
    people are afraid of me.    

915
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,232
    Do you know why a lot of    
    people are afraid of me?    

916
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:37,887
      Because I'm strong.       

917
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,491
     And yet I am a pillar      
       to the community.        

918
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,327
       You know I donate        
     over 10% of my profits     

919
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,862
  to the Boys and Girls club?   

920
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,334
      I love kids, Jacky.       

921
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,939
              See.              

922
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,943
     The key to my business     

923
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:06,015
       is know the truth,       
       avoid the sleuth.        

924
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,450
    Now, I avoid the sleuth.    

925
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,687
     And you best believe I     
     wanna know the truth.      

926
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,193
     So I'm only gonna ask      
       you one more time.       

927
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,197
     Was that motherfucker      
      at the train station      

928
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,398
         with my wife?          

929
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,870
        They were there,        
       but not together.        

930
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,781
             Okay.              

931
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,583
             Okay.              

932
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,822
             Okay.              

933
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,860
          Hey listen.           

934
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,329
   Next time you see my wife,   

935
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,131
         text me, okay?         

936
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,604
       Baby, I think Jack       
    should stay for dinner.     

937
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,075
      I don't see why not.      

938
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:09,078
            I can't.            

939
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,312
             Stay.              

940
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,316
  I made plans with my cousin.  

941
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,518
        -Brandon?               
          -Jack: Yeah.          

942
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,287
           Hmm, well.           

943
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,322
        Is that the kid         
     that followed us here?     

944
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,492
           Uh, well.            

945
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,694
         Bon appetite.          

946
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,066
      Hey, ain't that the       
      chick from the news?      

947
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,635
      No, don't be racist.      

948
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,307
       Did you boys ever        
        try a tapenade?         

949
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:42,711
    I make a mean tapenade.     

950
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,814
       You know, it's my        
grandmother's recipe actually.  

951
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,385
   When my grandmother died,    

952
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,221
she passed it down to my mother,

953
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,823
     and when my mama died,     

954
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,625
        she passed it to        
       my older brother.        

955
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,297
       And when my older        
     brother was murdered,      

956
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,300
       I found the recipe       
         in his wallet.         

957
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,070
            Hmm, so.            

958
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,039
        Brandon, Turner.        

959
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,842
         Where you guys         
      at the train station      
     that night with Jack?      

960
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:14,977
    Brandon: No, we weren't.    

961
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,945
    What night? Who's this?     

962
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,314
   Could we change the topic?   

963
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,349
         No, I'm sorry          
      what night is this?       

964
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,385
        Could you please        
       pass the tapenade?       

965
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,721
 It seems evident that you boys 

966
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:28,190
       were not there the       
    night that Morris Wright    

967
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,193
     was tragically killed.     

968
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,028
         Yeah, why were         
        you there, Jack?        

969
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,564
     You never told me you      
    went to a train station.    

970
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,633
       I thought we told        
    each other everything,      

971
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,201
       all of the sudden        
    you're keeping secrets?     

972
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,003
   Why were you at the train    
   station the other night--    

973
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,705
       Well I would like        
        to make a toast.        

974
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,608
     Never mind, I'm sorry.     

975
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,445
     Nah, go ahead Brandon.     

976
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,512
         Make a toast.          

977
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,513
         No it's fine.          

978
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,614
         Make a toast!          

979
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:53,716
             Okay.              

980
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,219
             Uh...              

981
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:02,825
     Well, this is a lovely     
   house, it's very exciting    

982
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:04,860
    to be here, for dinner.     

983
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:09,198
And uh, I had a tough semester  

984
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,767
        last semester at        
       college, socially.       

985
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,370
        But I made it, I        
    persevered thanks to my     

986
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,438
        two best friends        
       here, who I love.        

987
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:20,042
      And uh, it's really       
        exciting, again,        

988
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,310
   to be meeting all of you.    

989
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:22,544
        Especially Carl.        

990
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:26,048
        And uh, yeah.           

991
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,050
       I'm excited to see       
        where this goes.        

992
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,285
           Thank you.           

993
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,223
              Ah.               

994
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,125
         To friendship.         

995
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,994
   And whatever the fuck that   
 little guy was talking about.  

996
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:47,836
    And now that our palates    
      have been cleansed,       

997
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,806
         the tapenade.          

998
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:56,145
        In a few seconds        
    meet me in the kitchen.     

999
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:58,313
       I'm gonna go check       
        on the chicken.         

1000
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,861
          This is some          
      fantastic tapenade.       

1001
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,364
    I think it's excellent,     
         really great.          

1002
00:57:15,366 --> 00:57:16,498
       It's always great.       

1003
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,169
  Do you need help with that?   

1004
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,050
        Can you help me?        

1005
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,686
             -Yeah.             
        -Not with that.         

1006
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:42,991
       He killed the dog.       

1007
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,561
        He killed Joey.         

1008
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,897
       Uhm, I'm so sorry.       

1009
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,633
       And now he thinks        
       I was with Morris.       

1010
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,137
    I told him you weren't,     

1011
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,672
 so there's no way he'll know.  

1012
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,244
 I'm gonna start showing soon.  

1013
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,650
        You're pregnant?        

1014
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,087
         Babies cost a          
      lot more than dogs.       

1015
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:23,932
       (faint chattering)       

1016
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:31,507
    He wouldn't kill a baby.    

1017
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,941
     Yeah, if it were his.      

1018
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,579
        Can you help me?        

1019
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,849
     Gonzo:<i> Rose, we're two</i>     
   <i> sets in, and no entree.</i>     

1020
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,790
            Please.             

1021
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,065
           I don't--            

1022
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,300
         Get the rice.          

1023
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:03,972
        Turner:<i> And that</i>        
      <i> is the first time</i>        

1024
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,474
<i> Brandon ever sucked on a dick.</i> 

1025
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,543
      That's a true story.      

1026
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:08,844
           I'm sure.            

1027
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,112
        Only last week?         

1028
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,280
       Turner: Yeah man,        
     it was just last week,     

1029
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,149
      she was like, who's       
        this little kid,        

1030
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,049
      and I was like, oh,       
      his name is Brandon.      

1031
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,552
   Brandon: I don't remember    
  saying exactly those words.   

1032
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:17,986
         Turner: Yeah,          
   whatever, you were drunk.    

1033
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,590
  Ah, anyway, that looks nice.  

1034
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,902
    Say, what kind of scotch    
  are we drinking by the way?   

1035
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,305
        Gonzo: Currently        
      Johnnie Walker Blue.      

1036
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:39,308
       Turner: I've heard       
    of Johnnie Walker Black.    

1037
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:41,109
             Gonzo:             
Welcome to the Blue. son.       

1038
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,244
    I'm feeling kinda sick.     

1039
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:43,412
  Brandon can get I the keys.   

1040
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,680
         Oh yeah, yeah.         

1041
00:59:46,517 --> 00:59:47,916
         You're leaving         
    before the entree Jack?     

1042
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,519
         Yeah, stay for         
       the entree, Jack.        

1043
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,489
       I would, I'm just        
     feeling very nauseous.     

1044
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,759
  Thanks for the hospitality.   

1045
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,429
    I enjoyed the tapenade.     

1046
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,398
   Okay, we gotta follow him.   

1047
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,800
    Why, to watch him vomit?    

1048
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,068
 No, no, something ain't right, 

1049
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,336
      and I wanna fix it.       

1050
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,071
      It'd be really rude.      
      We can't just leave.      

1051
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:12,240
        Ahem, excuse me,        
        Mr. Gonzo, uhm,         

1052
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,709
    may I please be excused.    

1053
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,545
       Now what is going        
        on here fellas?         

1054
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,547
Did you not enjoy the tapenade. 

1055
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:21,049
       No, no, I did very       
        much, very much,        

1056
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,118
        thank you again         
      for that, I'm just,       

1057
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,554
   concerned with my friend.    
  I wanna make sure he's okay.  

1058
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,891
           Sure, go.            

1059
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,230
 Hey Carl, I'll call you later. 

1060
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,167
     Thank you for dinner.      

1061
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,615
        Wait, this isn't        
        the fucking way.        

1062
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,250
         Oh, I'm taking         
       the scenic route.        

1063
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:56,818
   The fucking scenic route?    

1064
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,321
   Do I look like I have time   
   to take the scenic route?    

1065
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,922
 I'm calling the fucking cops.  

1066
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:02,491
     No, please don't call      
       the cops, no cops.       

1067
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,192
     Fuck you, man. You're      
     trying to protect him      

1068
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:05,560
    with that cage bullshit.    
 I know something is going on.  

1069
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:06,728
       I'm not trying to        
   protect him, I'm just not    

1070
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,530
     <i> trying to bust him,</i>       
       <i> that's all okay.</i>        

1071
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:09,598
     <i> You know, it's Jack.</i>      

1072
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
    <i> It's gonna be one huge</i>     
<i>misunderstanding, I can feel it.</i>

1073
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:14,036
  No, no, no you have exactly   
    two minutes to get there    

1074
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:15,504
before I call the fucking cops. 

1075
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,838
     Fine, call the police.     

1076
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,473
     Let 'em come and find      
    Jack vomiting, big deal.    

1077
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,741
      That's not a crime.       

1078
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,643
       I mean, we're the        
     ones with weed on us.      

1079
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:22,911
 You think that's a smart idea  

1080
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:24,212
    to call the police when     
      we have weed on us?       

1081
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,515
It's not, it's not a smart idea.

1082
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,849
       Turner: Go, nine.        

1083
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,217
      Fine, I don't care.       

1084
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,886
         -Turner: One.          
    -It's your own funeral.     

1085
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,221
             -One!              
  -All right, all right, okay.  

1086
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,222
             Stop.              

1087
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:35,457
         I'll take you.         

1088
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,259
    Goddamn right you will.     

1089
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,932
    Ssshht, ssshht, shut the    
   fuck up, shut the fuck up.   

1090
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:48,270
     I don't hear anything.     

1091
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,738
    That's really good news,    
     that's such good news,     

1092
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,674
     because that, our job      
 is done here then. That's it.  

1093
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,076
       I don't think so.        
  I wanna know what's in here.  

1094
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,410
  All right, wait one second.   
     Will you, wait, wait.      

1095
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,378
     Let's not go in there.     

1096
01:01:58,649 --> 01:01:59,848
              Why?              

1097
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,048
     I have, I've had some      
   homosexual feelings lately   

1098
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,217
         towards you...         

1099
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,318
  Turner: Oh my God, Brandon.   

1100
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:04,486
        And I wanted to         
     talk to you about it.      

1101
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,620
  It can hurt our friendship.   

1102
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:06,922
         Don't fucking          
       lie to me Brandon.       

1103
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,490
    Don't fucking lie to me.    
  I will open this damn door.   

1104
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,658
   Don't fucking lie to me--    

1105
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,726
 All right, fine, I won't lie!  

1106
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,560
          What, what?           

1107
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,564
      Jack's in there and       
      he's a werewolf now.      

1108
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,066
    And he's gonna turn         
        into a werewolf,        

1109
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,668
       and then we go in        
        and he kills us.        

1110
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,103
          Now you are           
     goddamn full of shit.      

1111
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,437
         He'll kill us!         

1112
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:26,074
  Get off, get off me Brandon,  

1113
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,376
    I'm not fucking kidding.    
  Now open that goddamn door.   

1114
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,678
        All right, fine.        

1115
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:32,948
           Fuck man.            

1116
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,583
  Brandon: Hey Jack, it's us.   

1117
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,084
       What the fuck are        
      you guys doing here?      

1118
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,353
       What the fuck are        
       you doing in here?       

1119
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:41,389
       I'm sleeping here.       

1120
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,692
      What kind of fucked       
    up psycho-creep are you?    

1121
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,861
          Turner, you           
      gotta listen to me,       

1122
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,362
    go upstairs now, please.    

1123
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,565
     Brandon, help me out!      

1124
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:51,666
       No, don't talk to        
       Brandon all right.       

1125
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,268
       I know you two are       
        full of secrets.        

1126
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,803
     Now, tell me what the      
       hell is going on.        

1127
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,205
     Turner, I will explain     
      everything tomorrow.      

1128
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,074
      Right now, you just       
     gotta get outta here.      

1129
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:00,542
      Well, this wouldn't       
       be the first time        

1130
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,611
  a member of your family has   
   had some explaining to do.   

1131
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:07,182
           (beeping)            

1132
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,551
           Oh, shit.            

1133
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:10,652
        Turner: Hey, you        
      know, get back here!      

1134
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:12,888
    -Brandon, get the lock!     
      -Brandon: Oh, shit!       

1135
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,056
       No, no, no, I know       
      something is up man.      

1136
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,492
     This fucking cage, and     
  you're staking out at night,  

1137
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,794
     and the bloody GoPro.      

1138
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,762
     Turner, you should...      
             Aahh!              

1139
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:24,099
           (growling)           

1140
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,267
      -Turner: Oh, my God!      
        -Brandon: Shit.         

1141
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,969
           (growling)           

1142
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,137
         Turn the lock!         

1143
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,478
           Oh, fuck.            

1144
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,655
       Fuck, fuck, fuck!        

1145
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:47,989
           (growling)           

1146
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,191
            Oh, God!            

1147
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,928
       Fuck, fuck, fuck!        

1148
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,032
      Oh my God, oh fuck.       

1149
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:08,710
           (growling)           

1150
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:13,381
          (gun fires)           

1151
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,419
             Fuck!              

1152
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,461
            Brandon!            

1153
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,765
            Brandon.            

1154
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,067
   Brandon come on, come on.    

1155
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,904
       Come on, Brandon,        

1156
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,238
       Brandon, come on.        

1157
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,339
            Come on.            

1158
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:13,074
            Come on.            

1159
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:16,378
       Brandon, hey, hey!       

1160
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,280
      We're gonna get you       
        to the hospital.        

1161
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:19,581
     You're gonna be okay.      

1162
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:23,685
 -You should've seen yourself.  
     -Jack: That wasn't me.     

1163
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:24,986
      You looked awesome.       

1164
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,422
        Jack: It was the        
      werewolf, I'm sorry.      

1165
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,125
            Come on.            

1166
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:32,427
       Call, please call        
       a prostitute, man.       

1167
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:35,864
              Why?              

1168
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:40,468
  I don't wanna die a virgin.   

1169
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,107
     Do you think I'll have     
   enough blood for a boner?    

1170
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,044
    It's gonna be okay.         
    You're gonna have live.     

1171
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:53,348
           (heaving)            

1172
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,798
        (phone dialing)         

1173
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,034
        Come on Brandon,        
        come on Brandon.        

1174
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:18,573
        (phone ringing)         

1175
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:40,528
     Come on Brandon, pick      
     up the fucking phone.      

1176
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,830
            Come on.            

1177
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:42,998
             Fuck!              

1178
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,833
     Come on Brandon, fuck!     

1179
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:15,263
        (phone ringing)         

1180
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,452
     Mike:<i> Hey, it's Mike.</i>      

1181
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:12,787
  <i> I haven't heard from you.</i>    

1182
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,124
     <i> I hope you're okay.</i>       

1183
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,327
     <i> Look, we had a pact.</i>      

1184
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:22,931
     The gene was supposed      
        to die with us.         

1185
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:26,835
   I thought that was clear.    

1186
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:27,802
   <i> I don't know what you're</i>    
   <i> trying to sustain here.</i>     

1187
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:33,475
    <i> Sedating Jack, hoping</i>      
      <i> he finds the cage.</i>       

1188
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:37,712
   <i> This is no way to live.</i>     

1189
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,660
          (gun fires)           

1190
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,013
          (gun cocks)           

1191
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:30,498
         (bell ringing)         

1192
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,267
   What the fuck is going on?   

1193
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:33,835
  The lady, why was she here?   

1194
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,770
     What else do you know?     
     Did she say anything?      

1195
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,172
     And the cage? Why now?     

1196
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,241
    Welcome to Nana's Attic.    

1197
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,179
       You will never get       
      the answers you want      

1198
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,414
       by asking so many        
       goddamn questions.       

1199
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,316
     So you know something?     

1200
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:50,251
       No, that was just        
       a piece of advice.       

1201
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,054
   Unfortunately in this case   

1202
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:56,024
     I genuinely don't have     
    an idea of what the fuck    

1203
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,458
     you're talking about.      

1204
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,570
         You got a map?         

1205
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,737
       Where you headed?        

1206
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:12,207
             West.              

1207
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:13,575
            West?               

1208
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:16,578
      You don't need a map      
     to follow the sunset.      

1209
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,582
     I'm going to Colorado.     

1210
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:22,584
        That's a pretty         
        good road trip.         

1211
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,422
     You'll be on I-80 West     
     for about 2,000 miles      

1212
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:28,890
  till you hit the mountains.   

1213
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:33,561
      I don't imagine you       
       would make a trip        

1214
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,063
     like that by yourself.     

1215
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,898
         I'll be fine.          

1216
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,470
        No son, I don't         
       think you will be.       

1217
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:48,176
 What about that nice lady who  
 bought you those nice things?  

1218
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,978
  Maybe she could go with you?  

1219
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,748
       Or what about that       
        friend of yours?        

1220
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,250
        The strange one.        

1221
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:56,985
      They're not coming.       

1222
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,121
              Son.              

1223
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,625
         10 years ago I         
       had a lot of shit.       

1224
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,963
  My wife was battling cancer.  

1225
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:13,201
      My son went bankrupt      
          in the city.          

1226
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,272
     And my momma couldn't      
       remember my name.        

1227
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:22,910
      A man is measured by      
    the weight of the people    

1228
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,345
        leaning on him.         

1229
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,916
      But too many people       
  leaning can knock you down.   

1230
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:30,285
     You're being a bitch.      

1231
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:33,521
      I'm just going west.      

1232
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,757
      West, north, south,       
      fucking Antarctica.       

1233
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:38,126
    No matter where you go,     
     you're being a bitch.      

1234
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:44,632
       Not so fast, son.        

1235
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,268
      This makes two times      
    you've been in my store     

1236
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,170
     and you haven't bought     
        a goddamn thing.        

1237
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:51,639
    My advice may be cheap,     
       but it ain't free.       

1238
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,500
         We'll fix the          
       problem tomorrow.        

1239
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:29,510
         I forgive you.         

1240
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:10,118
    Turner: Fuck, goddammit.    

1241
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,062
 Remember, your worst quality,  

1242
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:31,699
  can also be your best, okay?  

1243
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,801
 <i> Promise me something, Jack.</i>   

1244
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,204
       <i> Don't be afraid.</i>        

1245
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,475
       <i> If the werewolf</i>         
       <i> in you eats me,</i>         

1246
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,043
  <i> that doesn't make it evil.</i>   

1247
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:44,979
<i>It's just a monster, it doesn't</i> 
  <i> have any control over it,</i>    

1248
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,015
<i>that's what makes it a monster,</i> 
  <i> it doesn't have a choice.</i>    

1249
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:02,563
         Oh, what's up?         

1250
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,939
   Do you have anything else?   

1251
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:14,108
            Not yet.            

1252
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:15,943
    You gotta trust me.         

1253
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:19,580
        Hold on to this.        

1254
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,917
  And drive over to my place.   

1255
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:25,920
    See you in the morning.     

1256
01:15:40,336 --> 01:15:41,669
    Crystal: Check this out!    

1257
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,804
    What, oh babe thank you,    

1258
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,406
 but I'm just not very hungry,  

1259
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:46,874
    I appreciate it though.     

1260
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,312
 Okay, uhm, well, I guess I'll  

1261
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:53,080
just put it in the fridge, uhm, 

1262
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,215
     I'm probably gonna go.     

1263
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,150
         What, no! Why?         

1264
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:57,385
      Well I don't really       
      know why I even came      

1265
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,419
      after the last time.      

1266
01:15:58,421 --> 01:15:59,487
     Oh come on, I'm sorry,     

1267
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:00,821
   and I'm sorry about that,    

1268
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:02,123
      that was total horse      
        shit on my part,        

1269
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,358
   and I know I disappointed    
      you the other night,      

1270
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,828
    and I want tonight to be    
   special for us, all right?   

1271
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,764
Can you give me one more chance?

1272
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:10,998
            I guess.            

1273
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,099
             Yeah?              

1274
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:13,768
    You do look a little off    
        and I feel bad.         

1275
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:15,336
     All right, that's all      
   right, how about tonight,    

1276
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:18,339
      you, me, and Little       
        Turner hang out.        

1277
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:20,441
    Hmm, what do you think?     

1278
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:21,943
            Hmmm...             

1279
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:23,678
     I mean I didn't drive      
   over here for nothing, so.   

1280
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,613
     Oh, I know, oh I know,     

1281
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:27,748
       I'll make it worth       
     your while, all right?     

1282
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,250
       Okay, but this is        
       your last chance.        

1283
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,118
          Okay, so why          
      don't you get ready?      

1284
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,620
       And I'll meet you        
   upstairs in five minutes.    

1285
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:34,188
     -Crystal: Sounds good.     
          -All right.           

1286
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:40,461
           Oh fuck...           

1287
01:16:58,314 --> 01:16:59,614
   Jacky what are you doing?    

1288
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,650
     Jack: I'm just getting     
      myself some scotch.       

1289
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,987
            (laughs)            

1290
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:10,224
    You have got some balls     
      coming here tonight.      

1291
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:16,831
    You lying motherfucker.     

1292
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:22,536
    Well, enjoy that scotch.    

1293
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:25,973
       Because I am about       
       to beat your ass.        

1294
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:30,911
         What the fuck?         

1295
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:36,817
          (scuffling)           

1296
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,689
     I am going to end you,     
         motherfucker!          

1297
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:52,266
           Hmm, damn.           

1298
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,401
           (giggles)            

1299
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,639
   All righty, let's do this.   

1300
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,741
           (clicking)           

1301
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:03,044
            Turner?             

1302
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:12,520
      Well Jack, it seems       
    you like to play games.     

1303
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,022
Let's play one of my favorites. 

1304
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,291
   Now the rules are simple.    

1305
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:23,030
    My boys are gonna press     

1306
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,765
    pressure points on you.     

1307
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,135
     You are gonna scream.      

1308
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:31,372
       And then I'll give       
     you this stress ball,      

1309
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,375
 you can squeeze it, hopefully  
   it'll help calm you down.    

1310
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:39,046
         Carl told me.          

1311
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,383
     You lied to me, Jack.      

1312
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,420
       You shouldn't lie.       

1313
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:51,926
           (beeping)            

1314
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:53,594
             Boys.              

1315
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,902
            Turner?             

1316
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:03,971
             Babe?              

1317
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:17,084
            Turner?             

1318
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,019
 I swear to God if you scare me 

1319
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,488
 I'm not gonna suck your dick.  

1320
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:26,627
          (screaming)           

1321
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:44,845
          (screaming)           

1322
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:49,483
  Oh yeah, you feel that, huh?  

1323
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,986
Do you get the point, Jack?     

1324
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,155
     Don't lie to me Jack.      

1325
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:56,190
             Never!             

1326
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,260
  What the fuck is this guy--?  

1327
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:00,261
             Shit.              

1328
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:01,562
           (growling)           

1329
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:02,830
         What the fuck?         

1330
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:06,534
             Fuck!              

1331
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,270
        Fuck this shit.         

1332
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:14,041
           (growling)           

1333
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,345
          (gun fires)           

1334
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,247
     Oh shit, I shot Carl.      

1335
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:21,482
         Motherfucker!          

1336
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,117
    Carl man, are you okay?     

1337
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,919
      Shit, motherfucker,       
   don't you know how to aim?   

1338
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:29,523
           (growling)           

1339
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:58,786
      Oh my God, is that?       

1340
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,388
     Turner, it's the cat.      

1341
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:03,457
    Turner, I found the cat.    

1342
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:05,025
     You're gonna miss it.      

1343
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:17,738
           (growling)           

1344
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,279
       (popcorn cracking)       

1345
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:30,651
           (heaving)            

1346
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:37,625
          -(growling)           
          -(screaming)          

1347
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,295
          Holy fuck...          

1348
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:49,303
           (growling)           

1349
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:51,972
           (choking)            

1350
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:04,785
            Jack...             

1351
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:09,089
        (gasping)               

1352
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:13,794
           (growling)           

1353
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:24,705
           (growling)           

1354
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:38,519
            Crystal?            

1355
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:41,388
      Holy shit! (laughs)       

1356
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,124
           Oh, baby.            

1357
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,327
     What the hell did you      
      do to me last night?      

1358
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:50,864
      Oh, I can't remember      
        a goddamn thing.        

1359
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:05,512
 All right, baby where are you? 

1360
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:07,881
      You want some milk?       

1361
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:16,156
            (yawns)             

1362
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:40,848
              Oh!               

1363
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,185
      (weeping) Oh, no...       

1364
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,787
         What the fuck.         

1365
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:23,757
         Motherfucker!          

1366
01:24:23,759 --> 01:24:24,825
             Fuck!              

1367
01:24:54,123 --> 01:24:55,522
      Jack: Where's Rose?       

1368
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:56,857
           Follow me.           

1369
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,793
      No, I'll follow you.      

1370
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:01,962
            Inside.             

1371
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,698
          In the barn.          

1372
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,874
          In the cage.          

1373
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,145
   Jack: What are you doing?    

1374
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:19,346
     Just get in the cage.      

1375
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,453
 Still got that watch of yours? 

1376
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,554
          Jack: Yeah.           

1377
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:28,622
         Give it to me.         

1378
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,560
           (beeping)            

1379
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,330
You got an alarm set for 20:22. 

1380
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:39,466
     I'll see you at 20:20.     

1381
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,675
           (heaving)            

1382
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:38,225
           (beeping)            

1383
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:46,567
            Get up.             

1384
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,237
          Over there.           

1385
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:52,105
          Right there.          

1386
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,953
   Get out of the cage, Jack.   

1387
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,623
   Get out of the cage, Jack.   

1388
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:13,827
          Over there.           

1389
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,732
           (beeping)            

1390
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,701
    Jack: Turner, you gotta     
    put me back in the cage.    

1391
01:27:20,703 --> 01:27:22,603
        No, no, no, time        
       to confess, Jack.        

1392
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,004
 And you don't have much time.  

1393
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,739
      Turner, I gotta get       
       back to that cage.       

1394
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,574
   Turner: One more step and    
   I'll shoot you right now.    

1395
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,011
      You won't shoot me.       

1396
01:27:31,013 --> 01:27:32,112
         I'll shoot you         
       right fucking now.       

1397
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:33,447
   Just like I shot your mom.   

1398
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:37,251
     There's my confession.     

1399
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,919
    Now answer my questions.    

1400
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,187
     Did you kill Brandon?      

1401
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:42,022
  What do you want out of it?   

1402
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:43,490
     Did you kill Brandon?      

1403
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:46,960
              Yes.              

1404
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:51,531
      Did you kill Morris?      

1405
01:27:55,204 --> 01:27:56,370
             Yeah.              

1406
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:58,538
   And did you kill Crystal?    

1407
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,906
              No.               

1408
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,441
        She was torn up         
     just like Brandon was.     

1409
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,909
       Did you kill her?        

1410
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,745
       Turner I swear, I        
      didn't kill Crystal.      

1411
01:28:04,747 --> 01:28:06,313
       Okay, I gotta get        
       back to that cage.       

1412
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,981
         No, no, no one         
        is gonna believe        

1413
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:10,150
   there's a werewolf, unless   
     it's caught on camera.     

1414
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:12,119
          Look at him.          

1415
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:15,489
     All these murders are      
  getting put on the werewolf,  

1416
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:18,158
      that I'm gonna kill       
     with my silver bullet.     

1417
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:20,560
         Silver bullet?         

1418
01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:21,628
             What?              

1419
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,729
          (gun cocks)           

1420
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:24,331
 Five seconds till I'm a hero.  

1421
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,099
       Turner, that's not       
      gonna fucking work.       

1422
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,834
       You gotta shoot me
