1
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,728
I'm, sorry?

2
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:42,971
I said don't you wish you could 
paint like your husband? 

3
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,874
Really, you must be so proud of him


4
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,503
Yes they're all fine now, they grew up

5
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,805
Now I don't say that my client

6
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:58,241
is the best landscape
Denmark,

7
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,861
but he is in the top one.

8
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:00,807
Yes.

9
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:03,428
It's going very well.

10
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:04,874
Yes.

11
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,594
Thought that would be impossible.

12
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:08,484
Oh God!

13
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,629
My God!

14
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:18,155
Thank you.

15
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,519
- And Rasmussen...
- Oh, come on, be kind.

16
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:23,524
- At least he agreed to see your work.
- It's only because he was drunk.

17
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:24,386
I know.

18
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:26,586
- Yes you were loving it.
- I was not. 

19
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:31,352
'I'm not saying that my client is the
best landscape artist in Denmark... '

20
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,135
But...

21
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,859
He's in the top one! '

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,082
Quiet! People are sleeping!

23
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,002
Sorry.

24
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,417
Do you know what time it is?

25
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,216
Time you came back to bed.

26
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,369
No.

27
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,438
I'm ready
to start work.

28
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,382
- Gerda.
- What?

29
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,014
Your face.

30
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:19,400
You think
I can't resist you?

31
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
Do you want to resist me?

32
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,145
No.

33
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:28,779
But I'd like you to ask nicely,
so that I'm not such a pushover...

34
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,559
Gerda Wegener,

35
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,127
my life,

36
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,853
my wife.

37
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:55,864
- Logged in?
- Mr. Wegener.

38
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:16,524
Perfect.

39
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,455
Yes, more?

40
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,042
Einar Wegener!

41
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:37,152
Oh, don't worry about him,

42
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:40,377
He's only ever had eyes for one woman.

43
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,662
My guilty secret's out.

44
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:43,712
So...

45
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:46,807
when are you going to breed 
me a godchild?

46
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:48,747
Ulla, you're an atheist.

47
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,507
Have you tried to drink
raw eggs?

48
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,857
- No.
- Do it.

49
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,269
For my sake.

50
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:55,733
- We're trying.
- Try harder.

51
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,983
Anyway,

52
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,407
What are you doing in today? I thought
you had finished last week.

53
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:04,907
I wanted to check on the painting of the backdrop
for the storm scene.

54
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:08,186
And give Gerda
some space.

55
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:10,807
Ah.. she's got a shy one.

56
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,701
You know I'm next?

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,350
Oh so I heard.

58
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,444
I won't be shy.

59
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,794
I imagine not.

60
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,863
She'll need all
her colours for me!

61
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,015
Head up!

62
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,424
I wanted to tell you

63
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,974
I appreciate our being alone


64
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,774
I hope that your husband
does not mind.

65
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:58,924
Not at all.

66
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:04,252
I could see his being here made you.. 
uncomfortable.

67
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:06,499
It wasn't 

68
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,075
personal.

69
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,537
It's not uncommon.

70
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:16,522
It's hard for a man to be looked at
by a woman.

71
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:18,827
Women are used to it,
of course,

72
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,277
but for a man... to...

73
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:21,852
submit...

74
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,164
to a woman's gaze,

75
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,791
it's unsettling.

76
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,438
Although I believe there is some pleasure
to be had from it,

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,340
once...

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,050
you um, yield.

79
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:42,764
Sit!

80
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,069
Good girl.

81
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,470
Good morning!

82
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:21,674
Well?

83
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,372
Perfect.

84
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,001
Almost.

85
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,550
Come here.

86
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:47,398
- Good luck!
- Toodle oo!

87
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,863
All portraits.

88
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,042
That bad?

89
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,613
Not per se.

90
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:35,514
This kind of work
is not really my...

91
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:38,693
Gerda...

92
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,709
I don't think it will benefit 
either of us to show these

93
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,864
It's not a judgement on your abilities

94
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,541
I agree with Einar,

95
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,406
you could be
a first-class painter,

96
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:53,156
if you found the right subject matter.

97
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,351
How was it?

98
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:07,484
Fine.

99
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,848
I finally managed to get the colour for the snow.

100
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,527
A bog in violet.

101
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:18,525
I don't know how you can paint the same thing
over and over

102
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
I suppose I just haven't finished with it yet

103
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,228
- Gerda?
- Could you please not speak to 

104
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,528
Rasmussen about me again?

105
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,662
My work is my business.

106
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,868
- Stay out of it.
- Gerda...

107
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:01,564
I had my period.

108
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,686
Sorry.

109
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,465
- Really?
- Of course I am.

110
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,881
You know I am.

111
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,767
Could you help me with something?

112
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:21,546
Anything.

113
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,550
Ulla has another rehearsal.
She cancelled again.

114
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,688
Would you try on her stockings and shoes?

115
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:32,838
I'm just so behind. I do not know how
I'll be finished in time for her opening.

116
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,278
I'll.

117
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,558
I'll do it.

118
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:38,784
It's fine I'll do it.

119
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:14,771
Stop it! Not now

120
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:17,181
He almost snagged it.

121
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,560
Oh dear.

122
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,440
No.

123
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,463
That's backwards.

124
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:38,213
I saw those in the window
at Fonnesbech.

125
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,626
Smart, aren't they?

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,417
- I don't think they'll fit.
- Well...

127
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,167
you'll do the best you can.

128
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,962
- No I need the dress.
- No.

129
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,053
- I need to see how the hem goes.
- No, Gerda.

130
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,003
I'm not going to put it on.

131
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:19,725
Just relax.

132
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:22,915
The sooner I start,

133
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,819
they sooner I'll finish.

134
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,698
Well, hello there!

135
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,515
Don't worry, my darling.

136
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:29,914
We're going to call you...

137
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,310
Lili.

138
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:57,924
Such concentration.

139
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,223
Sometimes I think you're going to
slip through the surface of the painting

140
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:04,473
and vanish 

141
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:05,963
into the bog.

142
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:11,285
Like your friend's kite when you were a boy.

143
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,722
Hans.

144
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,766
Yes. Hans.

145
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:21,536
I bet he still sits on that rock

146
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,323
- Sobbing his heart out.
- Don't.

147
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,914
He's actually an 
art dealer in Paris

148
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,269
peddling old masters to rich 
Americans.

149
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,066
No we don't need to
worry about Hans.

150
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,166
No, we shouldn't worry.

151
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:42,175
- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- No it's ok. I'm finished.

152
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:45,372
And don't worry,
I won't disappear into the bog.

153
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,082
The bog's in me, silly.

154
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,856
- What?
- Can't a man watch his wife get undressed.

155
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:19,308
It's new.

156
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,721
That's very observant.

157
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:26,809
No no leave it on.

158
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,321
It's pretty.

159
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,501
I might let you borrow it.

160
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:51,412
I might enjoy that.

161
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,880
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

162
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,484
Is there something
you'd like to know?

163
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,234
No.

164
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,689
I'm your wife.

165
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:01,313
I know everything.

166
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,072
Those two, over there.

167
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:15,618
Both of them.

168
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:17,464
At the same time.

169
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:22,065
Oh, people are married
so delightfully easy to shock!

170
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:24,952
Oh can't we just pretend to be shocked
because it encourages you?

171
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,940
I know.

172
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,646
That is why you're the only married couple 


173
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:30,460
- in my party for the Artists.
- No.

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,689
Out of the question.
She can go without me.

175
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,660
Gerda, without an escort?

176
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,427
Why, a scandal!

177
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:38,385
Gerda loves scandals.

178
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:41,031
Look at the way she dresses,
flaunting her ankles.

179
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:44,774
I don't think anyone is likely to be corrupted by 
seeing my ankles.

180
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:45,724
I was.

181
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,116
The first time we met,
I was leaving the Academy

182
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,816
and she was sitting on the steps,
flaunting said ankles.

183
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,013
And she propositioned me.

184
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:57,774
Is that true?

185
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,547
When I said hello to him, 
he actually blushed!

186
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,470
He was so shy, so I asked him out.

187
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,322
- And you said yes.
- Well she made me.

188
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,378
- She seemed so sure.
- I was sure.

189
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,142
- I still am.
- Oh, please, enough.

190
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:16,972
No!

191
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,405
What was it about him?

192
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,505
I don't know.

193
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,613
But we went.. coffee,

194
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:25,663
and after...

195
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,339
I kissed him.

196
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,998
And it was the strangest thing,

197
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,286
it was like kissing myself.

198
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,735
Well, these two won't be staying long...

199
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,420
Unmarried people are

200
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
so delightfully easy to shock..

201
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,890
Leave it.

202
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,933
Were you really
corrupted by my ankles?

203
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,652
You were shameless.

204
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,513
I still am.

205
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:35,577
Beautiful...

206
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,752
shameless... Gerda

207
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:58,384
Wait.

208
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,188
Did I wake you?

209
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,299
Sorry,

210
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,301
I couldn't sleep.

211
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,900
Why?

212
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,120
Wondering about things.

213
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:48,939
What things?

214
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:53,481
Wondering if we made a baby last night.

215
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:55,599
What do you think?

216
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:00,325
Wondering when got so pretty.

217
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,292
I was always pretty.

218
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,708
You... just never noticed.

219
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,501
- Hello?
- In here.

220
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:54,335
These are good, Gerda.

221
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,049
You think?

222
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:01,937
Well thanksyou.

223
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:04,476
I had a coffee with Ulla.

224
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:06,847
She asked me
about the Artists' Ball.

225
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:07,947
I'm not going.

226
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,028
Don't worry,

227
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,364
I told her no.

228
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:15,858
You should go,

229
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:18,653
- You enjoy it.
- With you, I enjoy it.

230
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:21,703
It's good to be seen
at those things, I do understand that.

231
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:25,235
- and that is why you hate them.
- I feel like I'm performing myself.

232
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:29,318
Giving them your... Einar Wegener.

233
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,188
Why not give them
something different, 

234
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,137
go as someone else?

235
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,661
You have someone particular in mind?

236
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,155
No.

237
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,261
You'd be very convincing.

238
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:55,634
No.

239
00:22:57,295 --> 00:23:00,207
- That is outrageous!
- You might even enjoy it.

240
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:01,174
No.

241
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,917
You'll have to shave closer,
next time.

242
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:29,109
Close your eyes.

243
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,141
It  is hard on someone else..

244
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,441
Here let me try.

245
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,676
What d'you think?

246
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,251
Better than
I ever did.

247
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,390
Lili!

248
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:51,412
I want to sketch you.

249
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,500
Sit!

250
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:56,947
Come on, Hvap!

251
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,370
- Come on, you.
- On the other side.

252
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,536
Knee over,

253
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,958
Head up!

254
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,274
Oh, those hands...

255
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:07,526
Relax!

256
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,946
- Don't maker her a slut!
- It's your fault.

257
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:29,754
You excite here.

258
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:31,927
Why, Miss Lilly?

259
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:33,902
You are forward...

260
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,740
You have no idea.

261
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,536
Maybe bring out the hand.

262
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,319
Morning.

263
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:06,725
- Morning, Thorbjorn.
- Good morning.

264
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,049
Forward.

265
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:06,598
Hello?

266
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,342
I was wondering where you were.

267
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:13,594
It's getting late.

268
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,423
We have plenty of time.

269
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,570
Bought you these.

270
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:24,353
Oh, perfect.

271
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:29,665
Are you sure about tonight?

272
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,813
What is it?

273
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:51,536
Am I pretty enough?

274
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,800
Of course you are.

275
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,742
I'll never be as pretty as you.

276
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:02,809
You are so beautiful.

277
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,005
My darling!

278
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:20,867
Ulla,

279
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:23,392
let me introduce...

280
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:25,999
It's Lili!

281
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,360
You're right.

282
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,143
Einar's cousin from Vejle.

283
00:27:31,488 --> 00:27:32,438
My dear,

284
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:34,786
exquisite!

285
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,738
In let's go in, come on!

286
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,959
You won't leave me..

287
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:46,558
No. Never.

288
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:02,558
People are looking.

289
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,606
Well you're a pretty girl,

290
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,170
you'll get used to it.

291
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,240
It's fine.

292
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,198
You're just feeling self-conscious.

293
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,098
Gerda?

294
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,733
Go talk to her.

295
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,117
No, I'll stay with you.

296
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,967
Go.
Go before they come over.

297
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:32,463
Alright.

298
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:31,871
Are you a reporter?

299
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:35,688
No.

300
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,095
A poetette?

301
00:29:57,705 --> 00:30:00,055
Do you know the story of
this oak tree?

302
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:02,693
No.

303
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,529
They say that
if you eat its acorns,

304
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:08,479
you can make a wish

305
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:11,304
and become
anyone you want for a day.

306
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,550
Why would they say that?

307
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:21,641
Henrik Sandahl.

308
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:23,609
At your disposal.

309
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,308
Lili.

310
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,133
Are you here with someone, Lili?

311
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:32,404
Yes with...

312
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:35,007
my cousin's wife.

313
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,254
Who's your cousin?

314
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:40,836
Einar Wegener.

315
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,271
Painter.

316
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:43,987
Yes,

317
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,918
He's.

318
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:49,471
Rather a good one.

319
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:53,023
- Is that right?
- He's better than most people think.

320
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,324
Most people our age adulate him

321
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,124
Don't go back in. It's... cooler out here

322
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:06,958
Besides, I'm a romantic.

323
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:08,123
Really?

324
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:10,661
I prefer the shadows.

325
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,419
I don't mean to presume,

326
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,100
but I've been watching you,

327
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,840
and I think
you might be the same.

328
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:28,565
Come on.

329
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,878
Have you seen Einar?
I can't find him.

330
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:43,046
Of course not, he isn't here.

331
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,852
You're different from most girls.

332
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,279
That's not a very original line.

333
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
It's true.

334
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,089
You're old-fashioned.

335
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:06,397
Provincial.

336
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:10,730
I'm new to the city.

337
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,080
No, it's more than that.

338
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,047
I feel I'd need to...

339
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:18,647
ask your permission
before I kissed you.

340
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,958
I should go and find Gerda.

341
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:33,267
Why don't you tell her... I'll walk you home?

342
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:36,382
No, she wouldn't like that.

343
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,563
- Lili.
- I know...

344
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,075
He might be waiting for us, and he wouldn't like... this.

345
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:45,289
No?

346
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:48,107
No.

347
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:52,989
Lili.

348
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:56,728
Lili.

349
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,025
Lili.

350
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:27,046
You didn't ask permission.

351
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:29,861
I couldn't risk you saying no.

352
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:37,783
What's the matter?

353
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,421
I'm sorry,
I don't know what happened...

354
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,771
How are you?

355
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:33,804
You were late home last night,
so I thought I'd let you sleep.

356
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:35,919
How was it?

357
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:39,351
Did Lili have fun?

358
00:34:57,615 --> 00:35:00,665
I think it would be better
if Lili didn't come here again.

359
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:05,533
Fine.

360
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,144
Exactly what happened 
between you and Sandahl last night?

361
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:10,114
Nothing.

362
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:14,023
- It was nothing.
- Did he know it was you?

363
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,523
It wasn't as simple as that.

364
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:19,643
I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
could you please make an effort?

365
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:26,056
He may have known who I was.
But I wasn't always m-me.

366
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:31,610
There was a m-moment when I was just Lili,
and I think that he could see that..

367
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:35,752
- Do you see?
- But Lili doesn't exist.

368
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:42,052
- We made her up.
- I know.

369
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,122
- We were playing a game!
- I know we were.

370
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:47,358
But then...

371
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:54,204
- Something changed.
- This is absurd. We need to stop.

372
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:57,526
You need to stop, Einar.

373
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,601
I am going to try.

374
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,649
Another headache?

375
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:31,417
It's nothing.

376
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:37,596
Can I get you anything?

377
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:39,868
I'm fine.

378
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,721
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

379
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:53,641
Gerda,

380
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,762
I'm fine.

381
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:13,374
I didn't think you'd come.

382
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:16,265
No.

383
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,268
Nor did I.

384
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:37,703
I thought you might not come back.

385
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,775
That's absurd.

386
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:42,458
Is it?

387
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:19,662
The model...

388
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:24,774
Einar's cousin.

389
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,057
The resemblance is...

390
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,849
- Are there others?
- A series back at the studio.

391
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,239
These are different...

392
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:49,671
For these...

393
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:52,462
I don't know... there may be a market.

394
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,964
- You're taking them?
- Well... yes.

395
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:11,865
Come in.

396
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,855
I haven't got long.

397
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:22,583
Gerda's seeing Rasmussen.

398
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,162
I don't like all these lies.

399
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:32,666
- She's very protective.
- Why don't you tell her about us?

400
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,136
I couldn't do that.

401
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:44,264
Sorry.

402
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,334
I don't want to upset you.

403
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:53,573
Come here.

404
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,266
- No.
- Yes.

405
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:11,991
Einar...

406
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:18,350
- What?
- Come on... it's all right.

407
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,760
I don't understand.

408
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,091
Lili, please!

409
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,783
I don't know what you want.

410
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:37,065
- I...
- I don't know what you mean.

411
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,437
- I want you!
- No.

412
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:42,676
Lili. Lili! Lili, wait!

413
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,220
Are you alright?

414
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:50,845
No.

415
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:02,985
I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.

416
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:47,572
I thought perhaps you knew.

417
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:50,544
No, not this.

418
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,037
So...

419
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,701
Are you in love with Sandahl?

420
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,058
No.

421
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:07,032
No, I love you, Gerda,
only you. It's Lili she...

422
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,970
- Be honest.
- I need you to believe me.

423
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,378
You of all people to understand.

424
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:16,448
Alright, you need to tell me when...

425
00:46:16,744 --> 00:46:18,674
Henrik and Lili...

426
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:22,123
Are together,
They what, they...

427
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:23,766
kiss?

428
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,771
- Has it gone beyond that?
- No.

429
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:34,174
No, Lili has never gone further than that 
with other men. He would not...

430
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,144
There have been other men?

431
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:40,968
There was another,
but it's was a long time ago.

432
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,921
It was that boy, Hans...

433
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:49,791
She fell for him, and...

434
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,445
he kissed her. Just once.

435
00:46:56,222 --> 00:46:58,522
But then my father
came in and he caught them,

436
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:02,117
and he smacked Hans down.

437
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:05,382
He was so angry.

438
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:08,415
I do not know what to say.

439
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:15,285
What?

440
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,104
- I'm so sorry...
- Einar?

441
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,511
I'm so sorry...

442
00:47:22,293 --> 00:47:24,696
- I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.
- Einar, what is it? Einar?

443
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:26,666
Einar Einar......... Einar?

444
00:47:27,715 --> 00:47:29,315
What's happened?

445
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:31,645
What's happening?

446
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:53,288
So you saw Dr. Andersen

447
00:47:53,408 --> 00:47:56,215
after a bout
of severe nosebleeds,

448
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,485
which you have come to believe

449
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:02,110
coincide with
the stomach cramps,

450
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,213
and on a monthly basis.

451
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:08,204
So.

452
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:10,329
How long have you been married?

453
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,366
- 6 years.
- Children?

454
00:48:13,196 --> 00:48:13,846
No.

455
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:17,129
Is there regular copulation?

456
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:19,545
Yes.

457
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:23,941
Perhaps less...

458
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:26,761
less than before you started
to dress as a woman?

459
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:30,424
I am a specialist, Mr. Wegener.
You may be embarrassed,

460
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:31,494
I'm not.

461
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:34,555
Tell me about... Lili.

462
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,149
Where does she come from?

463
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,218
inside me.

464
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:46,042
You know the most likely explanation
for all of this,

465
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:48,186
is a chemical imbalance?

466
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:50,184
Really?

467
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:52,398
On the bed.

468
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,534
That would explain the pain,

469
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,924
the confused state of masculinity
and infertility.

470
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:03,073
Let's hope it is that because that at least we can cure.

471
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:10,264
I don't need to do this. There's nothing wrong with me.

472
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,299
- That's not true.
- Gerda this can't be right.

473
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,969
Radiation is
a miracle, Mr. Wegener:

474
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,709
It destroyst the bad 
and saves the good.

475
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:21,209
I'm sure it'll be over quickly.

476
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:34,723
Lie still, Mr. Wegener.

477
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,921
Mr. Wegener!

478
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,761
How are you feeling this morning?

479
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:11,912
You hurt Lili.

480
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:19,232
I'm afraid your husband's aberrant thinking persists.

481
00:50:21,544 --> 00:50:24,627
- Do you keep a lock on your wardrobe?
- Of course not.

482
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:27,897
Mrs. Wegener, you're not
encouraging this delusion?

483
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:31,546
- You do understand that your husband is insane?
- No.

484
00:50:33,151 --> 00:50:35,501
That's not true.
We trusted you.

485
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,270
We came
to you for help.

486
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:03,573
Gerda!

487
00:51:04,948 --> 00:51:06,198
Where have you been?

488
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:07,458
Away.

489
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,602
Why, what's wrong?

490
00:51:10,896 --> 00:51:12,896
I sold the Lili portraits!

491
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:16,273
I have enough interest now to mount a whole show.

492
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:18,259
That's wonderful!

493
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:19,729
And there's more...

494
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,509
The Gallery Etienne Dufour

495
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:27,853
in Paris, wants to represent you.

496
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:32,419
- In Paris?
- Yes, you must go.

497
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:37,654
I can't travel just now.

498
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:40,671
Gerda, this is
your moment.

499
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,051
You've waited long enough...

500
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:45,971
These art dealers can be difficult.

501
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,004
What are you doing?

502
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,321
I've been asked to exhibit in Paris.

503
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:22,291
- That's wonderful.
- Yes.

504
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,524
We have to go!

505
00:52:25,213 --> 00:52:27,084
Rasmussen said
it will make all the difference.

506
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:29,185
I'm not sure I can.

507
00:52:30,284 --> 00:52:31,357
I'll take care of you.

508
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:35,127
- Surely there's no.
- Can't you just do this one thing for me?

509
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:38,682
What's happening?

510
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:43,044
I had
a letter from Hexler.

511
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,947
He wants to lock me up.

512
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:49,735
Everything will work out for us

513
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:52,242
Really,

514
00:52:52,477 --> 00:52:53,277
I know it.

515
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:58,177
You just have to trust me.

516
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:01,848
I do.

517
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,736
Einar's a painter too.

518
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:30,514
Do you exhibit in Paris?

519
00:53:31,243 --> 00:53:34,929
I think my work's a little
introspective for French taste.

520
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,854
Excuse me...

521
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:38,889
- Is the model her?
- No.

522
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,203
She stayed behind in Denmark.

523
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:44,523
Oh, I was hoping so much
to meet her.

524
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:46,516
Really?

525
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:49,638
Madame Gerda Wegener,
Madame de la Roche.

526
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:51,758
They say it's so feminine.

527
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:53,527
And the passion...

528
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:09,032
No...

529
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,454
I'm sorry.

530
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,456
Will you sit for me?

531
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,394
Just as you are.

532
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:42,097
We haven't done that since art school.

533
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:44,955
The teacher...

534
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:48,333
suddenly at the mercy of the
student.

535
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:50,001
He found it exciting.

536
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:53,489
I can't just now.

537
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:56,429
I'm sorry.

538
00:54:58,198 --> 00:54:59,148
I miss you.

539
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,623
I miss you working beside me.

540
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:08,139
I can't remember the landscape anymore.

541
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,327
I can't remember Vejle.

542
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:18,121
Well, you can help me
with this background.

543
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:21,178
What does it need?

544
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:23,094
A lake?

545
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,820
A farmhouse?

546
00:55:26,427 --> 00:55:27,327
Gerda...

547
00:58:06,575 --> 00:58:08,375
Oh, he is playing with us!

548
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:10,147
He knows the price.

549
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:14,141
Look, I have to go. I have Danish girl
 waiting to see me.

550
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,861
- Alright.
- Madame?

551
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:26,025
Hans Axgil.

552
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:29,761
Thank you for seeing me.

553
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,926
Don't thank me yet,
I can't represent you.

554
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,675
I don't handle any contemporary art.

555
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:35,820
Of course, I know that.

556
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,802
The reviews of your show
they were terrific, but...

557
00:58:38,922 --> 00:58:42,522
Perhaps if you would let me speak, perhaps
things would be clearer.

558
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,152
So when did you arrive?

559
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,721
Six months, almost

560
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:50,557
I do not know why Rasmussen
gave you my number,

561
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:52,727
but I'm glad he did.

562
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:54,775
I asked him.

563
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:58,082
I wanted to meet you,
to put a face to the name.

564
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:02,998
I believe you were a childhood friend
of my husband.

565
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,890
You have a husband?

566
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,550
I'm married to Einar Wegener.

567
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,558
- Einar?
- You remember him?

568
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,605
Of course I remember him.

569
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:19,045
We were such friends. How is he?

570
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,870
- He told me that you kissed him once.
- I what?

571
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:27,717
Oh right...

572
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:30,144
You're right, I remember.

573
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:31,986
We were fooling in the kitchen

574
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:34,047
and he was wearing his grandmother's apron

575
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,213
You know, little boys playing around?

576
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:39,961
He was looked so pretty in that,
I had to kiss him!

577
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:42,131
So yes,
I kissed Einar.

578
00:59:43,926 --> 00:59:46,526
Next think I know, his father's chasing me out.

579
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:50,976
Einar... my God...

580
00:59:51,497 --> 00:59:53,347
Why didn't he come today?

581
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:54,967
He doesn't know I'm here.

582
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,809
I don't think he'd like me asking for help.

583
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,875
We don't really know people here, 
and Einar he's...

584
01:00:04,797 --> 01:00:06,247
He's lost his way.

585
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:07,856
He's not working.

586
01:00:08,264 --> 01:00:10,279
He needs
someone to represent him.

587
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,099
Someone who knows him.

588
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,460
He needs a friend.

589
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:32,312
I have a new dealer coming over later.

590
01:00:32,432 --> 01:00:34,232
I'd like you to meet him.

591
01:00:35,658 --> 01:00:37,897
I, I don't want a new dealer.

592
01:00:38,017 --> 01:00:40,017
Doesn't make sense to me. I'm hardly working. 

593
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:42,327
That might change.

594
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:44,464
I don't think so.

595
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,120
I'm happy, helping you.

596
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,639
It's Hans Axgil.

597
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:55,356
Dinner at La Delphine at 8,
then ack here to see the paintings.

598
01:00:56,038 --> 01:00:58,288
He remembers you
with great fondness.

599
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:13,325
It was handmade and
and I've had it since I was 4!

600
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:16,844
Einar's still stricken with guilt about your kite.

601
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,592
My kite. I'll tease him about that.

602
01:01:19,712 --> 01:01:20,362
No,

603
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:22,238
it's too cruel.

604
01:01:22,732 --> 01:01:24,132
If he ever gets here.

605
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,414
- Perhaps he doesn't want to see me?
- No.

606
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:28,849
No, it's not that.

607
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:34,006
Maybe we should order without him.

608
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,547
Does he abandon you often?

609
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:38,659
Of course not.

610
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:41,528
I was joking.

611
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:52,043
I can come back another time
if you think Einar would prefer it.

612
01:01:52,682 --> 01:01:53,682
Really,

613
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:55,392
He's expecting you,

614
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:57,477
and it will do him good.

615
01:02:02,715 --> 01:02:04,115
I know this.

616
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,259
The Vejle Fjord,
not far from our houses.

617
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:11,079
Yes, he painted it just before we left.

618
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,079
Lili?

619
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:17,419
Hans?

620
01:02:19,011 --> 01:02:20,361
May I introduce

621
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:22,278
Lili Wegener.

622
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:25,246
Einar's cousin from home.

623
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,576
You cannot imagine how happy I am...

624
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:36,335
We actually met once before, in Vejle,

625
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:39,764
but you probably don't remember.

626
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:44,589
Can I take your coat?

627
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:46,384
Of course.

628
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,642
A digestif, Hans?

629
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:56,653
It's so chilly all of a sudden.

630
01:02:57,262 --> 01:03:00,033
Yes I feel the cold these days,
I don't know why.

631
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:00,903
Here.

632
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:03,166
Thank you.

633
01:03:07,737 --> 01:03:10,733
I'm so sorry
that Einar couldn't be here.

634
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,553
He told me that back in Vejle,

635
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,060
you were his great friend.

636
01:03:16,395 --> 01:03:18,152
Always plotting to get away!

637
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:20,722
- That's true.
- Such a hideous place!

638
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,630
He said that you wouldd sit,

639
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,658
and you would look out together,

640
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:29,958
beyond the fjord to the sea,

641
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:32,221
to the future.

642
01:03:33,235 --> 01:03:35,035
We had big dreams, yes.

643
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:36,729
Yes.

644
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:42,574
And you were the only one that would let him
 paint in peace.

645
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,506
You told him that it was alright to be a painter.

646
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,576
He used to sketch my portrait.

647
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:52,218
Take a stone and draw me on the rocks, at the side of the road.

648
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:55,966
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

649
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:02,263
- Would you like to see more of Einar's work?
- Yes.

650
01:04:02,383 --> 01:04:04,583
- Do we have any?
- Of course, Lili.

651
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,801
Can we not do it another time?

652
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:09,021
I want to hear more about you, Hans.

653
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,641
- Are you married?
- Er, no.

654
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:11,879
Well why not?

655
01:04:15,176 --> 01:04:16,776
You don't mind, do you?

656
01:04:16,968 --> 01:04:18,637
I've been on my own a long time now, I'm...

657
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:21,307
too set in my ways.

658
01:04:22,907 --> 01:04:26,707
Yes I think that marriage is the single thing that
we should all hope for in life.

659
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:28,258
Really?

660
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,030
Yes you see it creates someone else,

661
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,783
More than just the two of you.

662
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:39,305
It would be terrible not to

663
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,661
It could be terrible not to...
I'm so.. will you excuse me?

664
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:47,451
Lili?

665
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,431
You ought to go.

666
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,640
Let me help.

667
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,287
Please.

668
01:05:15,402 --> 01:05:16,502
Sorry.

669
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:22,402
Good night, Lili.

670
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:24,925
Good night.

671
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:36,582
I don't think he noticed, did you?

672
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:39,593
I don't know.

673
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,154
I think I got out
just in time.

674
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:47,251
Sleep now.

675
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,861
We'll talk more tomorrow.

676
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:54,269
Can I borrow a night dress?

677
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:02,505
No. We've never done that.

678
01:06:04,508 --> 01:06:06,958
Lili's never spent the night.

679
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,139
It does not matter what I wear.

680
01:06:14,565 --> 01:06:15,715
When I dream,

681
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,610
they're Lili's dreams.

682
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,558
- A new dress?
- And this is for you.

683
01:07:04,297 --> 01:07:05,247
Do you like it?

684
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:06,822
Yes.

685
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,840
It's perfect for you.

686
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:16,032
- We're a little short of money at the moment.
- I know.

687
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:19,719
But now that I'm back,
I can sit for you.

688
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,580
Well it worked
well before,

689
01:07:22,743 --> 01:07:23,893
didn't it work?

690
01:07:26,494 --> 01:07:27,394
Come on.

691
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:35,825
That's good.

692
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,145
Head up.

693
01:07:39,006 --> 01:07:39,692
Now.

694
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,262
- No, back!
- Yes.

695
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:51,039
That ring.

696
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:58,695
Thank you.

697
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:12,311
Oh, I meant that I do not think...

698
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:15,221
There are.

699
01:08:15,768 --> 01:08:17,168
How are you, ma'am?

700
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:24,454
- Mrs. Venort, and magnificent.
- I didn't know you were coming.

701
01:08:24,784 --> 01:08:26,234
It's a good crowd.

702
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:27,954
She's a popular girl.

703
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,172
Thank you for coming.

704
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,260
Thank you for inviting me.
I thought you had forgotten all about me.

705
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:37,283
We've been busy.

706
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:39,711
Is Einar here?

707
01:08:42,022 --> 01:08:44,922
- He hates this kind of thing.
- That's a shame.

708
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,392
For you, I mean.

709
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:49,399
- I don't mind.
- Is he well?

710
01:08:50,741 --> 01:08:51,941
He's excited

711
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:55,111
A friend, is coming to town, Ulla Fonsmarck

712
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,876
the dancer. Maybe you know her.

713
01:08:56,996 --> 01:08:57,996
I don't think so.

714
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:03,269
Can I take you to dinner?

715
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:05,411
To celebrate?

716
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:07,585
I think someone ought to.

717
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:09,061
No,

718
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:10,512
thank you.

719
01:09:10,632 --> 01:09:11,432
Gerda,

720
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:14,906
have I offended you?

721
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,280
No.

722
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,670
Gerda.

723
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:24,294
I am still Einar's wife.

724
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:31,568
Hans!

725
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:35,036
Oh, Henri, how are you?

726
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,057
What a nice evening!

727
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:42,369
Absolutely!

728
01:09:51,656 --> 01:09:53,456
At least take an umbrella.

729
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,475
No, I'm fine, honestly.

730
01:09:56,595 --> 01:09:58,933
Well, if you just wait a minute, someone
will drive you.

731
01:09:59,053 --> 01:10:00,153
No, I'm fine.

732
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:25,726
Oh Gerda, you're soaked.

733
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:28,908
Did it go well?

734
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:31,601
Tell me, how was it?

735
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:35,101
You'd know if you'd been there.

736
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:38,945
I... I made us a little supper.

737
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,719
- You should have come.
- A little.. sort of celebration.

738
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:44,991
This is not how it goes.

739
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:49,931
We do these things together.

740
01:10:51,936 --> 01:10:53,236
That was you and Einar.

741
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:56,649
Stop with that
stupid, stupid game!

742
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,291
Please, Gerda.

743
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:02,309
Don't you think this is a game.

744
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:05,396
You should have been there.

745
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:07,667
How could I?

746
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:12,831
- Look at me.
- Not everything is about you!

747
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:25,956
- I need to see Einar.
- Let me help you, please.

748
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,826
I need my husband.

749
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:29,999
Go get him.

750
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:34,666
I can't.

751
01:11:35,336 --> 01:11:38,936
I need to talk to my husband.
I need to hold my husband.

752
01:11:41,112 --> 01:11:42,512
I need him.

753
01:11:43,536 --> 01:11:44,936
Can't you just get him?

754
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:51,279
Can you at least try?

755
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:57,728
I'm sorry.

756
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:32,582
Gerda.

757
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:35,238
What is it?

758
01:12:47,226 --> 01:12:48,226
Are you alright?

759
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:15,809
Gerda, wait,

760
01:13:16,112 --> 01:13:17,012
wait!

761
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:50,634
I don't think I can...

762
01:13:51,714 --> 01:13:53,664
give you what you want.

763
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:11,261
I don't know how long we can go on like this.

764
01:14:16,437 --> 01:14:17,087
No.

765
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:32,003
- He needs to see someone.
- You know what happened with Hexler.

766
01:14:32,123 --> 01:14:33,373
He's so thin.

767
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:37,166
Something's
wrong with him.

768
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:40,655
Can you work yourself bigger?

769
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:42,422
Look,

770
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:44,423
There's a doctor,

771
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:46,919
He runs the women's clinic in Dresden.

772
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:49,389
He'ss interested in men
like Einar,

773
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:51,357
who are

774
01:14:52,282 --> 01:14:53,182
confused.

775
01:14:55,234 --> 01:14:56,934
And who are different.

776
01:14:58,472 --> 01:15:01,022
He's often in Paris.
Just talk to him.

777
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:10,966
You're awake?

778
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,170
How do you feel?

779
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:16,502
Come.

780
01:15:17,615 --> 01:15:19,008
I've got somewhere to go.

781
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:19,878
Where?

782
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:24,775
S-sorry, I...

783
01:15:27,471 --> 01:15:30,571
I don't know how to hold on to you any longer.

784
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:34,615
I know.

785
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:37,887
I love you.

786
01:15:39,818 --> 01:15:42,318
And I'm going
to find an answer.

787
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:04,743
<I>... </ i>

788
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:12,717
Victor?

789
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:16,564
- Look.
- Love.

790
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:19,749
It's a lesbian.

791
01:16:23,487 --> 01:16:25,037
No, not a woman.

792
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:28,147
Come, come, come!

793
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,183
- Good morning.
- !

794
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:32,403
What's your name, sir?

795
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,390
- English?
- English.

796
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:35,799
Do you speak English?

797
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,573
Are you a boy or a girl?

798
01:16:39,777 --> 01:16:40,727
Do you have a...

799
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,818
What are you? Huh?

800
01:16:45,938 --> 01:16:47,584
- Don't be afraid.
- Kids.

801
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:49,204
Joking.

802
01:16:56,037 --> 01:16:56,887
Stand up.

803
01:16:58,452 --> 01:16:59,302
Stand up.

804
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:17,009
Hold him up.

805
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:36,026
I can't hold the buyer's much longer, I'm sorry.

806
01:17:42,435 --> 01:17:43,235
Einar.

807
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:47,051
You're good at this.

808
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,696
I boxed for a while.

809
01:17:51,503 --> 01:17:53,603
Shame you weren't with me earlier.

810
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:02,783
I'm sorry I've not been to see you before.

811
01:18:02,903 --> 01:18:04,253
It's alright.

812
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:06,580
You're here now.

813
01:18:08,206 --> 01:18:11,256
I couldn't let Gerda see me like this.

814
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:13,368
She's had enough to put up with.

815
01:18:13,615 --> 01:18:15,065
What's happened to you?

816
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:18,927
I don't understand.

817
01:18:21,546 --> 01:18:22,596
Nor do I.

818
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:28,889
But I don't think it's anything new.

819
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:32,176
Even back in Vejle.

820
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,430
Sorry.

821
01:18:39,488 --> 01:18:40,238
What?

822
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,050
I was different.

823
01:18:45,549 --> 01:18:48,285
It didn't take much to be
different in Vejle.

824
01:18:48,405 --> 01:18:51,305
Surely that's why
 we became friends.

825
01:18:53,777 --> 01:18:54,877
Every morning

826
01:18:56,015 --> 01:18:59,776
I promise myself that I will spend
the entire day as Einar.

827
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:04,158
But there's so little
of Einar left.

828
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:07,305
You only think these things
because you're exhausted.

829
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:12,410
Sometimes I think about

830
01:19:13,021 --> 01:19:14,271
killing Einar.

831
01:19:15,604 --> 01:19:19,304
But it's only the thought that
I'd be killing Lili too, that stops me.

832
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:23,826
You need to see someone.

833
01:19:23,946 --> 01:19:25,446
- A doctor.
- No.

834
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:27,562
- Yes.
- No doctors.

835
01:19:27,682 --> 01:19:29,732
I'll help you find someone.

836
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,883
You have to try.

837
01:19:35,223 --> 01:19:37,573
A confused state
of identity.

838
01:19:38,404 --> 01:19:42,134
I drill small holes...

839
01:19:42,634 --> 01:19:44,277
here and here.

840
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:49,582
I listened to you very carefully
and I'm afraid it's not good news.

841
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,010
You are an homosexual.

842
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:57,107
I don't really know
what kind of help I need,

843
01:19:59,088 --> 01:20:02,217
but I can't go on living without knowing who I am.

844
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:03,767
Please excuse me for a moment.

845
01:20:14,215 --> 01:20:16,484
<I> Schizophrenic </ i>

846
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,406
Do you think I'm insane?

847
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:08,711
Did a doctor say that?

848
01:21:08,987 --> 01:21:12,537
I'm sorry, I know that we agreed
no more but...

849
01:21:14,405 --> 01:21:16,881
- Look at me.
- You are not insane.

850
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:24,433
Did I do this to you?

851
01:21:25,721 --> 01:21:26,471
What?

852
01:21:30,975 --> 01:21:33,703
Sometimes I wonder

853
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:36,478
if it hadn't been for the paintings...

854
01:21:36,578 --> 01:21:37,928
Oh, Gerda, no...

855
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:43,646
You helped bring Lili to life, 
 but she was always there...

856
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:49,078
- She was always waiting...
- Now she's making you ill.

857
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,942
I don't know what to do.

858
01:21:56,622 --> 01:21:58,822
The doctors
can't help.

859
01:22:04,029 --> 01:22:06,079
Do you want to try one more?

860
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:18,796
- Warnekros... Einar.
- Pleasure.

861
01:22:19,363 --> 01:22:20,713
Good to see you.

862
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:25,575
So what do you think would explain
what you've been experiencing, Mr. Wegener?

863
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:28,356
Professor Warnekros,
the fact is...

864
01:22:31,302 --> 01:22:33,252
I believe that I'm
a woman...

865
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:35,898
Inside.

866
01:22:38,426 --> 01:22:39,826
And I believe it too.

867
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:49,126
You probably think that I'm insane.

868
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,610
That we both are.

869
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:54,466
Well,

870
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:57,639
there are some people that think that I'm insane.

871
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,827
But I think you're
probably right.

872
01:23:09,008 --> 01:23:11,701
I've met
another... man like you.

873
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,450
I pursued his case...

874
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:18,730
against the wishes of my colleagues of course.

875
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:23,271
I told him I could operate.
To make him fully a woman.

876
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:27,150
That was what he really wanted.

877
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:30,250
- Is it really possible?
- What happened to the man?

878
01:23:30,358 --> 01:23:34,258
- Was the operation successful?
- On the morning of the first operation, he ran away.

879
01:23:35,418 --> 01:23:38,168
- He was too frightened.
- I wouldn't do that. I...

880
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:41,317
Perhaps he was the smart one.

881
01:23:41,522 --> 01:23:44,622
The surgery... it's never been attempted before... Never.

882
01:23:47,113 --> 01:23:49,563
Professor Warnekros,
What is the surgery?

883
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:52,004
Two operations...

884
01:23:52,674 --> 01:23:55,574
The first to remove
the male parts entirely.

885
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:59,263
The second, once you're
strong enough again,

886
01:23:59,585 --> 01:24:01,285
to construct a vagina.

887
01:24:09,028 --> 01:24:10,928
An irreversible change

888
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:14,846
and a high risk of failure,

889
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,030
infections,

890
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,110
- Complications.
- It's too dangerous.

891
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,090
It's my only hope.

892
01:24:25,206 --> 01:24:27,906
I leave for Dresden
lunchtime tomorrow.

893
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:32,541
Mrs. Wegener,

894
01:24:33,988 --> 01:24:36,238
I do believe I can help
your husband.

895
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:41,472
But, he won't be your husband, when I've finished.

896
01:24:57,476 --> 01:24:59,310
It feels strange, going dressed like this.

897
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,610
It's important.

898
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:04,083
Hans says that the Germans won't check your papers.

899
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:05,333
You're nearly there.

900
01:25:06,825 --> 01:25:08,825
I won't be seeing you again.

901
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,256
I've only really liked a handful of people in my life

902
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:17,516
and you've been two of them.

903
01:25:21,794 --> 01:25:23,094
Take care.

904
01:25:27,312 --> 01:25:28,612
Take care.

905
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,923
I wish you'd let me come with you.

906
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:37,903
I can't.

907
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:40,959
You love Einar.

908
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,404
And I have to let him go.

909
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:51,870
Here...

910
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,430
Take this.

911
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:51,815
Hello.

912
01:27:53,295 --> 01:27:56,317
My name's Lili and I'm here to see...
Professor Warnekros.

913
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,437
Lili what?

914
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:00,948
Elbe...

915
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:03,674
Lili Elbe, like the river.

916
01:28:04,462 --> 01:28:05,462
Of course

917
01:28:06,344 --> 01:28:07,894
Please take a seat over there.

918
01:28:35,763 --> 01:28:37,113
Must I really wait?

919
01:28:38,405 --> 01:28:40,005
It's only a week.

920
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:43,341
I need you to rest. Gain some weight.

921
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:46,007
We can't risk an infection.

922
01:28:49,418 --> 01:28:51,368
For what we are attempting,

923
01:28:53,138 --> 01:28:54,788
I need you to be strong.

924
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,957
This is not my body, professor.

925
01:29:01,232 --> 01:29:02,782
Please, take it away.

926
01:29:10,798 --> 01:29:12,148
You're having a baby.

927
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:16,096
And you?

928
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:17,641
Oh, no, no.

929
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:21,251
I'm ill inside.

930
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:23,522
But Professor
Warnekros will help me get better

931
01:29:23,622 --> 01:29:25,622
And will you be able to have children after?

932
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:28,917
D'you know, I don't know.

933
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:34,291
I hope so.

934
01:29:39,636 --> 01:29:41,286
Gerda, why don't you go?

935
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:46,279
- He asked me not to.
- He wanted to protect you.

936
01:29:46,379 --> 01:29:50,229
- You should be there. I'll go with you.
- If I go, it will be alone.

937
01:29:52,737 --> 01:29:56,173
- Now you're sounding like Einar.
- I am like Einar.

938
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:02,306
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to go away.

939
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,250
Really?

940
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:13,856
No... I... sorry...

941
01:31:20,551 --> 01:31:23,101
He regained consciousness
very briefly.

942
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:26,269
We had to give her a great deal of morphine of course,

943
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:27,869
so that's to be expected.

944
01:31:32,355 --> 01:31:35,664
You mustn't move Lili,
it only makes it worse.

945
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:37,021
Oh God.

946
01:31:38,303 --> 01:31:39,203
Breathe.

947
01:31:40,373 --> 01:31:41,273
Breathe.

948
01:31:49,748 --> 01:31:50,698
I'm here.

949
01:31:59,717 --> 01:32:00,917
It's alright,

950
01:32:01,668 --> 01:32:02,968
I'm here now.

951
01:32:07,718 --> 01:32:08,468
Lili.

952
01:32:30,357 --> 01:32:33,357
I can feel myself getting better
when I listen to your pencil.

953
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:43,358
You've always sketched
me better than I was.

954
01:32:45,307 --> 01:32:47,057
But what you draw, I become.

955
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:52,197
You made me beautiful,

956
01:32:54,597 --> 01:32:56,447
Now you're making me strong.

957
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:02,510
Such a power in you.

958
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,510
Shall we go back to Denmark then, Gerda?

959
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:15,159
Shall we go home?

960
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,231
Lili...

961
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:37,151
You're late.

962
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,330
Your pills...

963
01:33:42,328 --> 01:33:44,556
Every 2 hours. And I need to eat something first.

964
01:33:45,414 --> 01:33:47,514
I have some macaroons
in my bag already.

965
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:50,482
And these,

966
01:33:52,057 --> 01:33:53,707
only if you need them.

967
01:34:01,665 --> 01:34:02,865
Good luck.

968
01:34:12,028 --> 01:34:14,878
And remember, making a purchase from Fonnesbech,

969
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:18,046
is not merely shopping,
it's an experience.

970
01:34:19,035 --> 01:34:20,835
You lived in Paris, yes?

971
01:34:21,693 --> 01:34:22,393
Yes.

972
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,074
Let everyone know!

973
01:34:24,174 --> 01:34:27,674
The store is a stage,
we're here to perform!

974
01:34:34,006 --> 01:34:36,850
In Paris, you see a lady
would never dream of

975
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:39,491
spraying scent
directly onto herself.

976
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,587
No, she's spray it in the air,

977
01:34:42,897 --> 01:34:45,470
and then she would walk
through it. Voila

978
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,108
You try.

979
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:56,019
Voila!

980
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:10,537
- Thanks
- That's so unfair, you've got the sweetest tooth,

981
01:35:10,657 --> 01:35:12,493
and the narrowest hips in the whole store.

982
01:35:12,613 --> 01:35:15,139
Really, how do you do manage it, 
eating so much sugar?

983
01:35:15,259 --> 01:35:17,349
Oh the trick is not to 
eat anything else.

984
01:35:17,469 --> 01:35:19,169
- See you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

985
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:23,870
- Goodbye, Lili.
- Bye.

986
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:26,020
Lili, you coming?

987
01:35:32,274 --> 01:35:36,074
You know one night last week, I 
had the strangest dream.

988
01:35:37,247 --> 01:35:39,907
- What was it?
- I dreamed that you were getting married.

989
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,800
- Do you think I ever will?
- Who knows?

990
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:52,242
So many strange things have happened

991
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:55,281
I do want to, Gerda.

992
01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:01,101
It's not so long ago
... that you and I were married.

993
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,652
You... and Einar.

994
01:36:09,521 --> 01:36:11,921
I know it was Einar.
But really...

995
01:36:14,791 --> 01:36:16,844
it was you... and me.

996
01:36:39,055 --> 01:36:39,805
Lili!

997
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:44,847
Is it really you?

998
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,510
I believe so.

999
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:55,320
So, what
you're suggesting...

1000
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:59,477
is that a... a doctor...

1001
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,396
intervened...

1002
01:37:03,516 --> 01:37:05,966
to correct
a mistake of nature.

1003
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,750
- He made you a woman?
- No, God made me woman.

1004
01:37:10,631 --> 01:37:12,668
The doctors... the doctor

1005
01:37:13,048 --> 01:37:16,413
He is curing the sickness that is my disguise.

1006
01:37:20,758 --> 01:37:22,008
A real woman?

1007
01:37:39,397 --> 01:37:42,347
You're going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that.

1008
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:45,136
When Warnekros
suggested I keep a diary,

1009
01:37:45,236 --> 01:37:47,886
I thought I wouldn't have
anythin to write.

1010
01:37:49,137 --> 01:37:50,037
It does help...

1011
01:37:51,176 --> 01:37:54,376
- To make sense of things.
- Maybe I should try it.

1012
01:38:00,328 --> 01:38:01,178
So?

1013
01:38:02,681 --> 01:38:04,631
Do you enjoy working at Fonnesbech?

1014
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,500
For now at least...

1015
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,030
I do sort of enjoy being part of it..

1016
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:11,876
You never think of painting?

1017
01:38:14,759 --> 01:38:17,163
- You might be good at it.
- Gerda, I want to be a woman,

1018
01:38:17,263 --> 01:38:18,563
not a painter.

1019
01:38:19,601 --> 01:38:22,001
Well, people have been known
to do both.

1020
01:38:26,417 --> 01:38:29,166
I'm curious to see what you 
would paint, that's all.

1021
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:31,687
Sometimes it's hard to know what's
in your...

1022
01:38:31,787 --> 01:38:34,277
Didn't you just take one of those
Some minutes ago?

1023
01:38:34,377 --> 01:38:35,977
Gerda, I know what I'm doing.

1024
01:38:40,189 --> 01:38:42,189
I'm going to get some fresh air.

1025
01:38:43,817 --> 01:38:46,147
You know, sometimes I do wonder why
You let me go through all of this,

1026
01:38:46,267 --> 01:38:48,210
if you thought that everything
would be the same afterwards.

1027
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:49,580
I didn't.

1028
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:52,729
But I promised Einar
That I would take care of you.

1029
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:55,215
For goodness sake,
Gerda, Einar is dead.

1030
01:38:55,315 --> 01:38:57,365
We both have to accept that.

1031
01:38:58,247 --> 01:39:01,463
You took care of me,
but now I have to take care of myself.

1032
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:03,283
I have to have a life of my own.

1033
01:39:05,477 --> 01:39:07,227
And you need to do the same.

1034
01:39:10,974 --> 01:39:12,174
Come on, HVAP.

1035
01:39:28,549 --> 01:39:29,249
Yes.

1036
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,590
In London?

1037
01:39:33,591 --> 01:39:35,936
- Is it urgent?
- No, everything's fine.

1038
01:39:37,424 --> 01:39:38,724
Just tell him...

1039
01:39:40,929 --> 01:39:44,129
Tell him it's a beautiful day
in Copenhagen

1040
01:39:48,673 --> 01:39:50,573
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1041
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:16,260
It's not what you think.

1042
01:40:16,414 --> 01:40:19,314
Henrik's homosexual,
so there's nothing between us.

1043
01:40:21,684 --> 01:40:23,950
But I should have told you 
that I'd seen him.

1044
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:25,700
No, you shouldn't.

1045
01:40:26,209 --> 01:40:28,163
It's a friend, Gerda.
Someone to talk to.

1046
01:40:28,263 --> 01:40:30,413
Because you can't talk
to me.

1047
01:40:31,999 --> 01:40:33,649
I've made a decision.

1048
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:37,890
I'm going back to Dresden
for the second operation.

1049
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:40,660
- That's too soon.
- No, it's time.

1050
01:40:41,049 --> 01:40:44,177
- I have to finish what I started.
- You're not strong enough.

1051
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:46,977
Professor Warnekros
thinks that I am.

1052
01:40:47,213 --> 01:40:50,147
Warnekros? Warnekros
hasn't seen you. 

1053
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:51,697
I've made up my mind, Gerda.

1054
01:40:52,845 --> 01:40:56,145
- It could kill you.
- I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?

1055
01:41:00,565 --> 01:41:03,465
I won't help you to hurt
yourself.

1056
01:41:20,287 --> 01:41:21,487
Gerda, will you come?

1057
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:46,730
This will be harder than the first operation.

1058
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,530
You understand that?

1059
01:41:49,828 --> 01:41:51,678
Yes I do.

1060
01:41:54,938 --> 01:41:56,788
It's a complex surgery.

1061
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,422
And I will sleep
 all the way through it.

1062
01:42:05,183 --> 01:42:08,433
- Yes, you will.
- And you will be there when I wake up?

1063
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:12,009
Of course.

1064
01:42:13,558 --> 01:42:15,958
I want a husband
that looks just like you.

1065
01:42:21,164 --> 01:42:23,414
Maybe
a child one day.

1066
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:28,808
Like a real woman.

1067
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,020
One step at a time.

1068
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,629
Get some rest. Good night.

1069
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:56,621
Are you still angry at me?

1070
01:42:57,753 --> 01:42:59,603
I'm not angry at you,

1071
01:43:01,327 --> 01:43:02,927
I'm worried about you.

1072
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:07,366
You heard my wish, Gerda.

1073
01:43:08,576 --> 01:43:10,926
When no one else could hear me,

1074
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,030
you did.

1075
01:43:18,189 --> 01:43:18,939
Come...

1076
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:24,042
We both our rest.
I'll sleep on the chair, there.

1077
01:43:25,954 --> 01:43:28,340
- No, off to your little hotel.
- I don't mind.

1078
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,186
Here, take this,
there's a chill in the air.

1079
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,447
- No.
- Please.

1080
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:37,760
You have it.

1081
01:43:38,451 --> 01:43:39,501
For now.

1082
01:43:40,778 --> 01:43:41,878
I'm going to be fine.

1083
01:43:43,575 --> 01:43:44,275
Yes.

1084
01:43:56,198 --> 01:43:58,701
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

1085
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,760
Good evening.

1086
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:53,860
- Room 9, please.
- Number 9, yes of course.

1087
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,850
Thank you.

1088
01:45:01,922 --> 01:45:02,672
Hans?

1089
01:45:14,121 --> 01:45:15,471
It's alright.

1090
01:45:15,873 --> 01:45:17,823
Everything will be all right.

1091
01:45:36,755 --> 01:45:38,005
Miss Elbe?

1092
01:45:40,108 --> 01:45:40,958
It's time.

1093
01:45:54,088 --> 01:45:55,688
Good luck everybody.

1094
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,140
Professor Warnekros
would like a word...

1095
01:46:21,095 --> 01:46:24,795
He lost a lot of blood. Now we are
struggling to keep the fever down.

1096
01:46:25,826 --> 01:46:28,076
There's a chance it might burn itself out, but...

1097
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:34,052
I have to be honest.

1098
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,190
The prognosis is not...

1099
01:46:45,303 --> 01:46:46,503
Here, just lie still.
It's alright.

1100
01:47:32,647 --> 01:47:33,397
Lili.

1101
01:47:50,471 --> 01:47:51,721
How are you Lili?

1102
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:01,959
I am...

1103
01:48:03,664 --> 01:48:05,909
entirely myself.

1104
01:48:10,196 --> 01:48:12,396
You had us worried there you know?

1105
01:48:14,929 --> 01:48:16,479
Can I go outside...

1106
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:18,440
Gerda?

1107
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:22,277
Into the garden?

1108
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:24,692
You should rest.

1109
01:48:30,939 --> 01:48:31,989
Please.

1110
01:48:52,787 --> 01:48:55,671
You mustn't worry
about me anymore, Gerda.

1111
01:48:58,157 --> 01:48:59,907
It's an old habit.

1112
01:49:01,446 --> 01:49:03,046
I am are slow to change.

1113
01:49:08,428 --> 01:49:10,828
How have I ever
deserved such love?

1114
01:49:18,148 --> 01:49:20,408
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

1115
01:49:22,307 --> 01:49:22,957
No.

1116
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:28,733
Last night...

1117
01:49:30,666 --> 01:49:33,857
I had the most beautiful dream

1118
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:42,149
I dreamed that I was a baby
in my mother's arms.

1119
01:49:45,934 --> 01:49:47,334
She looked down at me

1120
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:53,011
and she called me Lili.

1121
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:56,860
Lili.

1122
01:50:24,078 --> 01:50:24,828
Lili.

1123
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:35,229
Lili!

1124
01:51:50,732 --> 01:51:51,882
No, leave it!

1125
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:59,610
Let her fly.

1126
01:52:19,106 --> 01:52:22,439
<I> Lili Elbe's diaries became
the basis of the groundbreaking memoir </ i>

1127
01:52:22,559 --> 01:52:25,241
<I> 'Man into Woman',
published in 1933. </ i>

1128
01:52:25,361 --> 01:52:28,023
<I> Her bravery and pioneering spirit 
remain an inspiration </ i>

1129
01:52:28,143 --> 01:52:30,544
<I> for today's transgender movement. </ i>

1130
01:52:30,664 --> 01:52:37,324
<I>  Gerda continued to paint
portraits of Lili for the rest of her life. </ i>
