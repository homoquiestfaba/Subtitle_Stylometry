1
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:06,318
Addison Shepherd. OK,
could you try Montgomery-Shepherd?

2
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:09,321
[sighs] OK. What about just Montgomery?

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,889
Great. OK. Thank you. Bye.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,188
Lose your wife?

5
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,696
You could say that.
What are you doing out of bed?

6
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:20,828
Did your mother like Addison
right off the bat?

7
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,099
Yeah, she liked Addison fine.

8
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:26,571
Right up until the sex
with my best friend part.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,074
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:32,202
Well, I don't think
my mother likes Cristina.

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,804
[chuckles] How's your hand?

12
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,042
- My hand?
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,176
Good. It's great, I'm fine.

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,689
You're cold calling hotels?

15
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,885
Four star hotels.
Thank God there's not that many of them.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,951
Yes, I'll hold.

17
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:52,464
If you see Cristina, I...

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,133
Yeah, hi. Do you have a
Montgomery-Shepherd registered there?

19
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,488
[crying]

20
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,937
Dr. Stevens...
How are you?

21
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,975
I'm good, Nurse Tyler.
How are you?

22
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,174
- Good. Good.
- I'm not crazy.

23
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,444
OK... then.

24
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,244
- Ow.
- He's trying to be nice.

25
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,619
- Didn't feel very nice.
- Do you need a break?

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,751
Maybe take a nap in the on-call room.

27
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,920
George.

28
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,088
- Look, Callie.
- Oh.

29
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,463
- Hey, Callie.
- Hey. You're back, that's good.

30
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,867
Yeah. Everything's all good.
Not back, just visiting, but good.

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,169
- OK.
- Hey, you know George really likes you.

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,210
- Are you still mad at him?
- I'm not mad at him, Izzie.

33
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,610
I would feel terrible if you were.
'Cause as good as I am right now,

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,616
I wasn't, really,
very OK the other night.

35
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,346
Gotta love a guy who'd
help his friend when he could be

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,287
spending the night in a hotel room
with a gorgeous woman.

37
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,257
Just stop. OK?
Just please stop.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,001
- She's a little bit of a martyr, huh?
- Looking that way.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,177
- [Joe] Tequila. Double shot.
- I didn't order this.

40
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,354
Joe!

41
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:37,453
Can we have some more peanuts?

42
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:42,900
- What's this?
- You had a hard day. Am I right?

43
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:45,266
Nancy, Derek.

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,331
- I gotta go.
- You can't go.

45
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,843
Didn't you get the memo
about the meeting?

46
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,038
What meeting?

47
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:59,380
Tonight is the very first meeting
of the Dirty Mistresses Club.

48
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:08,383
Thank you.

49
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,195
This is nice...

50
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:13,561
...having everyone together again.

51
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,623
Yeah.

52
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,202
Where's Cristina?

53
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,835
I think I want to be a general surgeon
just like she was.

54
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,279
How sick is that?

55
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,482
Burke proposed.

56
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:05,177
- What?
- I know, so George.

57
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,916
What did you say?

58
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,157
I told him I'd take it under advisement.

59
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:12,251
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

60
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,786
I just can't say yes.

61
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,230
I can't say no, either.

62
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,592
I can't say yes.

63
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:27,070
Everything's different,
everyone's changing.

64
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:30,271
Getting married, proposed to,
opening clinics.

65
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:33,144
I'm just hovering.

66
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:36,117
I have to stop hovering.

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,850
I would kill to have
Ellis Grey as my mother.

68
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,622
Tell my mother
I signed the consent form.

69
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,892
You're doing the surgery in the morning.

70
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,829
- I got a patient.
- OK.

71
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,537
Come here.

72
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,139
Oh, come on.

73
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:15,411
I'm not hypothermic.

74
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,545
Then get out of these wet clothes
before you get hypothermic.

75
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:19,918
You're half frozen.

76
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:22,583
[breathing heavily]

77
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,386
Derek. I'm saying please.

78
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,864
Right.

79
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:43,626
You'll be pleased to hear

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,999
I'm proposing an expansion
to the hospital board this afternoon.

81
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,061
Give you quite a few
more places to hide.

82
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:51,868
I'm not going to hide,
I'm trying to find my resident.

83
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,637
I come to Seattle to see you,
you don't give me a moment.

84
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,804
Didn't come to see me,
you came to get a job.

85
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,744
- I came for both!
- You made a mistake.

86
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:02,177
Too busy wedding planning
for even coffee?

87
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,685
I'm not wedding planning,
I'm just trying to have a life,

88
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:09,213
and you, in your insidious way,
are trying to screw it up, so please.

89
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,782
- Gonna invite me?
- Where?

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,849
To the wedding.

91
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:14,021
How'd we start
talking about the wedding?

92
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:16,930
Brides love to talk about the wedding.
What's the matter?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,228
Are we getting cold feet?

94
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,194
Please leave.

95
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,868
If he's rushing you,
you should tell him.

96
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:28,911
When you marry,
you want to be ready.

97
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,276
He should understand that.

98
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:41,690
Absolutely.
Of course he won't, men don't.

99
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,822
We're horrible egomaniacs,
every one of us.

100
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:48,057
You break off the engagement now
and his ego will never recover.

101
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,361
Oh, well good thing Burke's not you.

102
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,459
[sighing] He's capable
of rational thought.

103
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:56,334
Good. You keep thinking that
if you want to feel better.

104
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,738
You know how I
hate to see you unhappy.

105
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:03,975
Hold that there for a moment.

106
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:07,979
Getting paged 16 different directions
and I got lacs down here for days, so...

107
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:12,381
I need you to handle any non-facial
lacs. Save the faces for me.

108
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,013
- Right.
- OK.

109
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,049
'Cause God forbid anyone
survive a fiery boat crash

110
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:19,591
and have a scar to show for it.

111
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,650
- Hey, Yang?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:25,129
Congrats... on the upcoming nuptials.

113
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,395
What... What did you...

114
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,371
I'm sorry, where did you... Who are you?
Why would you think it's OK

115
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,033
- to shout that across the hospital?
- I didn't shout.

116
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,940
You don't know me, you're the new guy.

117
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,444
And you're the new guy
no one really wants around,

118
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:43,073
so whatever you heard,
it's none of your business.

119
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,673
Right.

120
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,486
- I revoke my...
- It's none of your business.

121
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,491
[water running]

122
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,035
[door opening]

123
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,543
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,978
You think you'll have to
keep her under long?

125
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,406
Well...

126
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:18,543
I believe once I relieve the tamponade,

127
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,282
she'll stabilize,
and I can get out pretty quickly.

128
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:25,224
Good, good. The quicker you get out,
the better the chances are for the baby.

129
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,853
- Better both their chances.
- [sighs]

130
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,756
Dr. Yang?

131
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:37,327
Your post-op and pre-op patients
are all in good shape,

132
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:38,702
so I'd like to scrub in.

133
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:44,302
Dr. Yang, I believe your orders
were to report to the pit.

134
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:48,745
[Addison clearing throat]

135
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:55,115
[clears throat]

136
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,354
Sloan knows.

137
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,593
- I'm sorry?
- Mark Sloan knows.

138
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:09,068
Everyone knows.
Everyone knows before Meredith knows

139
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:11,264
and that's on you,
so you owe me this.

140
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,641
Dr. Yang. Pit. Now.

141
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,803
[chuckles] There is nothing
emergent in the pit. I checked.

142
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,848
Dr. Yang.

143
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:26,082
Fine. I will go to the pit.

144
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:46,056
All this wedding fuss. You think
I don't know what you're up to?

145
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,032
Really, you surprise me. I thought this
kind of foolishness was beneath you.

146
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,569
I'm just trying to plan my wedding.
That's it.

147
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,366
- It does this to people.
- Not to you.

148
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,873
How would you know?
I never said yes to you.

149
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,914
- Wait. No. Can you get this...
- [Cristina] Ow!

150
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,453
- Is it backwards?
- OK, I think it's...

151
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,479
No. I think that maybe this hand
goes in the other sleeve.

152
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:12,957
- [Cristina] Oh, oh.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:17,019
Cristina, dear. Are you thinking
quarter or cathedral length veil?

154
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:21,693
This is the style of dress
I wore on my wedding day.

155
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,998
- Oh...
- OK, the zipper is caught

156
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,300
- on the petticoat.
- That's my hair! Ow!

157
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,603
- [Meredith] Sorry.
- Is everything all right?

158
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,569
- Izzie.
- OK, wait. Here they come.

159
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,044
Grab the skirt,
I'll hide under the layers of...

160
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,809
We're available
if you need another pair of hands.

161
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,977
OK! Oh, no... OK.

162
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,681
Choke me. Zip me up tighter
and then take this dress

163
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,725
and cut off my air so I'll faint
and put me out of my misery.

164
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,555
I think I just peed a little.

165
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,618
Just pee on the dress,
pee on the dress.

166
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:53,132
Iz. Izzie. Can you go
deal with the moms?

167
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,292
Um... What do I say?

168
00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:00,271
OK, you take the dress,
I'll take the moms.

169
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,140
[muffled] Thanks. Meredith, I'm not
joking. My hair. It's in my hair.

170
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,041
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Hey...

171
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,340
Do you guys have a tissue?

172
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:10,247
A tissue? Don't tell me
you got makeup on that dress.

173
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:15,652
Oh, no, no, no, it's Cristina.
She's... She's a little overcome.

174
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,555
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- Overcome?

175
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:23,028
Yeah, you know.
She's a bride and brides cry sometimes.

176
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:29,368
- Cristina overcome?
- She... She really loves your son.

177
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,465
- Oh.
- Thank you.

178
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:37,067
Oh, and if you could give us a few.
Doesn't want you to see her like this.

179
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,805
- Cristina overcome?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:45,348
OK, here.
I bought us at least five minutes.

181
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,511
Just, you know...

182
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:50,682
Oh, you're my hero.

183
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:54,215
Wow. That's just so...

184
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,330
- I hate this so much
...hideously ugly.

185
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,763
[all laughing]

186
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:19,013
- That your toast?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,145
Keep it clean.
Dirty never plays.

188
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,088
Are we almost at the end
of the best man advice?

189
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,219
Because I have to tell you,

190
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,421
considering the source
it's hard for me to take it seriously.

191
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:32,226
I'm your best man, Derek.
Always have been.

192
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,096
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:40,996
In college, we'd go out together,
I'd be talking to a girl,

194
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,235
you'd be standing there like an idiot.

195
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:48,240
And at the end of the night, she
wants to know who my quiet friend is.

196
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,875
- Hmm.
- Assumes you're deep.

197
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,148
I choose plastics
and suddenly I'm superficial

198
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,951
compared to Derek Shepherd,
the great brain surgeon.

199
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,150
And sleeping with Addison?

200
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,421
You wanna be honest about it, Derek...

201
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,986
That's the best thing
I ever did for you.

202
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:06,328
- Oh, come on.
- You had a lousy marriage.

203
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,459
Suddenly, it's not your fault.

204
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,838
You know what the
best man's job is?

205
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:15,033
- No.
- Make the groom look good.

206
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,974
You made a career out of looking good
in comparison to me.

207
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,518
It's too long. Short and sweet, Derek.
Always leave 'em wanting more.
