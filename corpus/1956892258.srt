1
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,962
Give it to me.

2
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:12,199
You've got it,
and I want it back.

3
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:14,098
Aah!

4
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,808
Let's try this again here.

5
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:23,625
Where is my money?

6
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,083
Aah!

7
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,597
Timothy, I'm sorry.

8
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,846
I gotta stake out the Targesons'
apartment again tonight.

9
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,179
Can't it wait just one night?

10
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,095
No, it can't wait one night,

11
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,095
not if I want to get paid.

12
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,053
Have you looked outside lately?

13
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,469
I think this whole
global warming thing

14
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,719
hasn't quite made it to Albany.

15
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,177
Donald...

16
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,551
Damn it, it's my job.

17
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:51,927
It's what I do. You know this.

18
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:53,883
I know, I know, but...

19
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,841
But... But what?

20
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,051
Well, maybe it's time

21
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:00,716
you considered
another line of work.

22
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,298
And give up skulking
in dark alleyways

23
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:05,839
and spying on
cheating housewives?

24
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:08,506
Come on! We can't make
dinner plans with our friends.

25
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,713
I don't remember the last time
that we went out to a movie.

26
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,820
And it's dangerous.

27
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,920
Some nights I can't sleep,

28
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:19,544
worrying that someone's out
there bashing your brains in.

29
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,045
You worry?

30
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,543
Of course I do.

31
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,335
Well,
that's it. There's just one thing to do.

32
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,191
You gonna quit?

33
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,166
No. I'm gonna
take you to a movie.

34
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,791
Tomorrow night. I don't
even know why I bother.

35
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,998
Come on. Just let me finish one more
divorce case. I'll take a few days off.

36
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:38,998
Promise? I promise.

37
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,373
Let's go someplace warm, please.

38
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,580
We can frolic on the beach,
maybe.

39
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:45,413
I like it when you frolic.

40
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,704
More than when I skulk? Much.

41
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,579
Tim,
you're not gonna believe what... Senator.

42
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:52,411
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

43
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,994
Not at all. We were just...

44
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,910
Morning, Senator Platt.

45
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,934
Don. Nice tie.

46
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,534
I've got some terrible news,
Tim.

47
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,200
The state
appropriations committee

48
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,866
just pulled the
Safe Zone program.

49
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,491
What? They can't.

50
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,824
Yeah. How much?

51
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:13,657
All of it. $3 million.

52
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,490
It's the thing with the kids.

53
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,447
At-risk youth. Runaway shelters,
after-school programs...

54
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,614
I'm sorry. I know this
is your pet project.

55
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,779
There are 13 centers
across the state.

56
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,861
There are hundreds of kids.

57
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,302
They can't just shut them down.

58
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,051
You have an idea?

59
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,525
Here's every donor who's given
us anything in the past three years.

60
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,441
If I have to, I will call

61
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,066
every one of them
until I find that money.

62
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,482
I love it when
he gets like this.

63
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:50,648
My little robotic pit bull.

64
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,065
Yeah. And then he gets that

65
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,104
'don't screw with
me" edge to his voice.

66
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,771
Yeah, and if he gets really upset,
you'll see... 'cause the hands go...

67
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,062
And he sort of pulls this?
Yeah. Mm-hmm. See? See?

68
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,895
Enough. Enough.

69
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,269
You two aren't allowed
to talk to each other,

70
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,144
ever.

71
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,833
Hmm.

72
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,791
Call me if you need
help. I love you.

73
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,267
Go get 'em.

74
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,791
Arf arf arf!

75
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:33,346
Mifburns Industries.
This is Ann speaking.

76
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,094
Hi, Ann. It's Tim Callahan
with Sandra Platt's office.

77
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,053
Oh, hi, Mr. Callahan.

78
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:41,010
I need to speak with your point
person for charitable donations.

79
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:43,594
That would be Richard
Sears. Let me transfer you.

80
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,158
Please hold.

81
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:12,694
Mmm!

82
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:16,336
Try Valium with
your morning coffee.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,900
Takes the edge right off.

84
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,041
Kenny, I gotta tail Arnie
Targeson's wife again tonight,

85
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,041
so let's find out when her
last appointment is, okay?

86
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,332
All right. You seem a little
cranky. Everything okay?

87
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,481
Ah, it's Timothy.

88
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,663
Thinks I should change jobs.

89
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,663
Quit the private
investigation business?

90
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,912
Well, let's face it.

91
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,870
All I really do is
ruin people's lives

92
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,786
for a hundred bucks
an hour plus expenses.

93
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,952
I may as well
be a tax collector.

94
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:50,619
Well, honestly, Don,

95
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,619
I mean, not to criticize,

96
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:54,409
but you're doing a
lot of things wrong.

97
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,558
Wrong?

98
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,074
"Client contracts
should be executed

99
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:02,990
"before any actual work begins.

100
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:06,282
Retainers should be
cashed..." I get retainers.

101
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:08,323
"While the remainder
of the fee is placed

102
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,531
into an escrow account."

103
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,488
Private Investigator
Training Seminar?

104
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,196
I started a night class.

105
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,945
Detective school?

106
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,653
I plan to be fully prepared
when you make me partner.

107
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:23,527
I work alone. And that's
working well for you, huh?

108
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,152
Okay. Out.

109
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:28,425
Out, out, out!

110
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,892
You've raised $220,000
in less than five hours.

111
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,808
That's a real accomplishment,
Tim.

112
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:11,558
Not when you're still
$2 1/2 million short.

113
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,848
You know, I haven't seen you

114
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,307
this worked up about
anything in a long while.

115
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,722
This isn't just political,
is it?

116
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,722
No, not really.

117
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:23,430
I guess you could sort of
say it's the settling of a debt.

118
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:24,930
All right.

119
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,845
I'll see if I can
call in a few favors.

120
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:28,845
We'll go after the
money till we get it.

121
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,553
Thank you, Sandra. Good night.

122
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,202
Good night.

123
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,820
Tim Callahan?

124
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,045
I was... till the heart attack.

125
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,962
But you're Tim Callahan, right?

126
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,629
Sorry. Have we met?

127
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,128
You called today
looking for money.

128
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:08,586
Oh,
you mean the... The Safe Zone program.

129
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,210
I'm an attorney. I represent
an anonymous donor.

130
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,042
He wants to stay that way.

131
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,916
Well, that's no problem. The Safe
Zone program is an incredible...

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,149
It helps kids, right? Yes.

133
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,315
That's what he
wants to do... help.

134
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,123
You have to promise me this
money gets directly to the kids,

135
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,770
not caught up in a lot
of bureaucratic red tape.

136
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,829
This money needs
to do some good.

137
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:35,312
How much money does
your client want to donate?

138
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,995
3 million.

139
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,288
Dollars?

140
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,035
It has to stay anonymous.

141
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,119
Look,
we can't accept that kind of gift

142
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:45,475
without knowing where it came
from.

143
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,890
No!

144
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,277
Don, I need your help!

145
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,693
Tim! Timothy!

146
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,692
Don! Oh!

147
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,733
What is going on? Are you okay?

148
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,066
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm fine.

149
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,983
Oh, God, Don, it was terrible.

150
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,399
Whoever it was had a gun.
And I think he killed that guy!

151
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,481
What guy? That's what
we'd all like to know.

152
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,606
It figures you'd be mixed up in this,
Strachey.

153
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,564
What's going on?
Someone was killed?

154
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,980
Well, so says your boyfriend,
only we got no ID,

155
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,937
no body, and no vehicle.

156
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,020
He said he was an
attorney. You know this guy?

157
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,811
Well,
no. He... He said he had... he had a client

158
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:49,603
who was gonna invest some money,
but...

159
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,269
And then this motorcycle
came outta nowhere...

160
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,144
Yeah. And you didn't
get a plate number,

161
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,351
and you didn't get a good
look at the driver, maybe?

162
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,268
No. Look, I told you,
it happened so fast.

163
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,225
It was dark. He had a helmet on him,
and he pulled out a gun...

164
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:02,724
Calm down. Look, Detective,
I gotta take him home.

165
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,849
Sure, fine. Doesn't look like I
got a crime scene here anyway.

166
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,431
You two belong together.

167
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,431
You know, he kind of scares me.

168
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,139
Just do what I do.

169
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,598
Picture him on the
beach in Provincetown

170
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,472
wearing nothing but a thong.

171
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,804
See? It works every time.

172
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,804
You okay? You
need to go to the doctor?

173
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,512
No, I'm fine. I just...

174
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,511
The only prescription I
need is you and a stiff martini.

175
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,493
That I can do.

176
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,550
With that low-pressure
system moving in from the Midwest,

177
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,215
we're expecting this cold weather
to continue through the week

178
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,215
with showers and
freezing rain possible,

179
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:46,381
making our roads through the greater
Albany region pretty treacherous.

180
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,796
So if you have to get in your car today,
be careful.

181
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,046
You don't wanna know.

182
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,587
I've been thinking
about that $3 million.

183
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,545
That's an awful lot of thinking
this early in the morning.

184
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,253
He said he was an
anonymous donor.

185
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:03,252
You think maybe that
was who killed him?

186
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:06,708
We don't know he's dead.
He could've just run off.

187
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:09,584
I saw him go over the side.

188
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,707
Yeah, you know, you did.

189
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,165
From now on,
no going in the parking garages alone.

190
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:17,249
In fact,
no more going anywhere by yourself.

191
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:20,664
Well,
you don't think that whoever did this

192
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,728
would come after me?

193
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,995
Okay, upstairs. Get dressed.

194
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,019
I'm taking you to work.

195
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:37,393
I'm a marked man.

196
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,077
Mmm.

197
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,742
Yes.

198
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:45,866
You know, I was thinking,
with everything going on,

199
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,366
maybe we should take our
vacation a little early this year.

200
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,116
Ah, but I love winter in New
York. 'Cause you're insane.

201
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,490
Oh, I get to wear sweaters,
scarves, and gloves.

202
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:56,947
Tim? Fires in the fireplaces.

203
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:58,323
Tim? Yeah?

204
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,737
That the guy? Oh, my God!

205
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,845
I'll take that as a yes.

206
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,068
He's...

207
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,091
He sure is.

208
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:23,233
Don? Yeah.

209
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:25,315
They know where we live.

210
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,297
They sure do.

211
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,564
Inside.

212
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,420
I'll call Bailey.

213
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:49,185
Well, at least this time you
actually got a corpse. Yeah.

214
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,351
And what exactly
is it they want back?

215
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,558
I don't know. Are you playing
games with me, Strachey?

216
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,558
Look, whatever it is,
we don't got it.

217
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:58,349
Yeah, well, I don't think whoever
did this is gonna like that answer.

218
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,557
There was no
ID on the guy or nothing?

219
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,223
We'll check his prints,
see if he's in the system,

220
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,139
flash his picture
around a little.

221
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,097
And we'll be taking the car,
too.

222
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,763
Come on. How am
I gonna go to work?

223
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:10,678
Well,
it's part of an ongoing investigation.

224
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,513
If it doesn't fall apart before
we get it back to the lab.

225
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,345
I need to get to the office.

226
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,178
No,
you don't. You're not going there.

227
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,011
Not until we figure
out what's going on.

228
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:21,427
It's the state senate
building. I'll be safe.

229
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,134
You stay indoors until I figure out
a car or something to come get you.

230
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,051
You promise? Yes, yes, yes, yes.

231
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,674
Hey, Bailey, make yourself useful,
huh? Give him a uniformed escort.

232
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:32,382
I would do it myself,
but I seem to be without transportation.

233
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,906
We look like a
taxi service to you?

234
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,131
Hey, Morris. Hmm?

235
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,154
Drop him off, would you?

236
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,902
Well,
I should probably ride along with you.

237
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:54,336
So tell me again,
exactly what did this guy say to you?

238
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,001
He said that he had $3 million

239
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,751
from somebody who
didn't want to be named,

240
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:01,501
and that it was very important to
him that the money went to the kids.

241
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,001
He say why?

242
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,856
He didn't have a chance.

243
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,702
I need a car.

244
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,202
Not exactly a news flash.

245
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,368
Rent me a car. What kind?

246
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:32,702
Whatever's got the best heater.

247
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,891
One hot car coming up.

248
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,641
Strachey.

249
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,534
Yeah.

250
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:44,223
Oh, y-yeah, I'm on my way.

251
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,763
I gotta go down to the station.

252
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,821
What's up?

253
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,820
Hey, Kenny,
get outta here, okay?

254
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,488
Just take the day off. Don't
come back till I call you.

255
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,487
Are we in some kind of trouble?

256
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,801
Aren't we always?

257
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,775
You ID'd the guy? Yeah,
it wasn't hard.

258
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,608
District attorney knows him. I know him,
too.

259
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,815
I just haven't seen him in
over 12 years. Who is he?

260
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,023
Jake Lenigan. Mean
anything to you?

261
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:21,814
His grandfather was,
uh, Brian Lenigan.

262
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,772
Lenigan & Lenigan?

263
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:26,147
Lawyers to some of the
biggest names in the city.

264
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,771
So Jake... I take it he's
family. He worked there?

265
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,729
Yeah. Him and his brother Eric.

266
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:32,644
His father worked there, too,

267
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:35,418
until he was
murdered 12 years ago.

268
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,061
Supposedly by their mother.

269
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,018
She disappeared
during the investigation.

270
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,041
She hasn't been
seen in over 10 years.

271
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,932
You don't think she came
back to knock off her kid, do you?

272
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:51,640
No. No. Joan Lenigan was one of
the most decent people I ever met.

273
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:53,931
Other than the "killing
her husband" part?

274
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,765
She was never
charged with the murder.

275
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,265
Wasn't enough evidence.

276
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,288
You seem pretty sure about that,
bub.

277
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,661
It was my case. I spent
a lot of time with her.

278
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:07,828
How come she disappeared?

279
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,511
You sure you have no
connection to Jake Lenigan?

280
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:14,510
No. How about your boyfriend?

281
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,510
Met him for the
first time last night.

282
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,741
I'm more interested in who
Jake's anonymous donor was.

283
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:21,632
Another Lenigan murder.

284
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,758
Things are gonna get ugly.

285
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,089
I understand.

286
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:33,131
You've selected your
charities for the year.

287
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,630
But I...

288
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,297
I think if you just reconsider
this particular project,

289
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,463
you'll find...

290
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,836
Yes.

291
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,878
Yes.

292
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,169
Yes,
I know. Money is tight right now.

293
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,252
But the Safe Zone
project is very important

294
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,275
for our young people.

295
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,083
And, really, aren't our children

296
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,690
our most valuable
natural resource?

297
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,330
Jim,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

298
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,854
Mm-hmm.

299
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,201
What the hell is this?

300
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,159
You said you needed a car.

301
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,492
A car, not the Batmobile.

302
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:33,741
Didn't they have a class
in your little PI school

303
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,906
about blending in,
being inconspicuous?

304
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,906
That must've been the night I
skipped to go to the Madonna concert.

305
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,907
Indulge.

306
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:43,180
Madonna still does concerts?

307
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:53,569
See that? That's a
GPS navigating system.

308
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,569
It'll show you the routes.

309
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,609
It's linked to... Hey.

310
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,775
Magnum P.I.

311
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,359
Hey, honey.

312
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:06,566
Okay, slow down.

313
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,733
Take it easy. I'm...
I'm on my way.

314
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,274
Don, you just need to, um,

315
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,356
unlock the... unlock the door.

316
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,023
I...

317
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:25,503
Don't worry. I'll take the bus.

318
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,930
Morning.

319
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,134
What is going on?

320
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,241
Just get me home.

321
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:26,006
Lock it. What is going on?

322
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,338
Tim? Timo...

323
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,462
Will you talk to me? What...
What is in the envelope?

324
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:37,544
Timothy,
you are freaking me out. What... Shh!

325
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:40,128
What's going on?

326
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,817
Tim!

327
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,667
Eurobonds?

328
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,582
3 million dollars' worth.

329
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,249
Just like cash.
Completely untraceable.

330
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,939
I take it you
didn't get a raise.

331
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,830
Where did this come from?

332
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:05,686
They were delivered to
my office this morning.

333
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,454
I want to hire you. What?

334
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,161
To find out where
those came from.

335
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:14,119
You are not thinking
about keeping this money.

336
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:18,617
I thought about
it... all afternoon!

337
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,451
The attorney... He
wanted the kids to have it.

338
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:24,033
The Safe Zone needs the
money! It's obviously stolen.

339
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,657
We don't know that. Somebody
got killed because of it!

340
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,199
Which means it's dirty money!

341
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:29,700
Which means in the right hands,

342
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:31,722
that money could go
to do so much good!

343
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,199
Here. Wh... What?

344
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,947
Your retainer. Now,
we should have some kind of

345
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,779
PI/client confidentiality
privilege...

346
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,321
Less speech right there.

347
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:43,445
This is the largest
retainer I've ever received.

348
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,236
Just... Just find out
about them for me.

349
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,819
If it's stolen,
we'll give it back.

350
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,985
But if we can use
this to help the kids...

351
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,068
Please.

352
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:02,733
Strachey.

353
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,523
You have something that belongs to us,
yeah?

354
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,440
Who is this?

355
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,921
You'll save yourself a lot
of problems by returning it.

356
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,064
I-I'm sorry.

357
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,146
I don't actually know
what you're talking about.

358
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,688
But maybe if you wanted to tell me,
I could...

359
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:18,396
Wrong answer.

360
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,920
Go!

361
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,710
Oh, shit!

362
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,708
Cover the back!

363
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,724
We should just give
them the money.

364
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,391
They'd kill us anyway.
It's our only leverage.

365
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,164
Get the fire ladder now. Go!

366
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,429
Don, that's a long way down.

367
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,512
Yeah, it's better than a bullet.

368
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,036
Get down there now!

369
00:22:58,784 --> 00:22:59,843
Don't move.

370
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,367
Ah!

371
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:09,342
Hurry.

372
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,866
Go!

373
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:15,091
Donald, hurry!

374
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:17,655
Tim, go to the car.

375
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:23,254
Uhh!

376
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,712
Good job.

377
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,403
Now car.

378
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,081
Yes, one king bed.

379
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:57,413
Thank you.

380
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,954
You said that we should
take our vacation early.

381
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:02,787
I didn't think you meant Albany.

382
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,661
All because someone
is trying to kill me.

383
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,493
You really gave that
guy quite a wallop.

384
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,700
I did, didn't I.

385
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,951
Yes. I didn't even think.

386
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:17,866
I just reacted.

387
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,992
Amazing what'll happen

388
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:20,615
when your body
wants to stay alive.

389
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,240
My whole body feels like it's...

390
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,408
It's tingling or something.

391
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:26,530
It's adrenaline. It'll wear off.

392
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:27,949
Is this what it's like for you?

393
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,780
This sort of rush?

394
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:31,322
Sometimes.

395
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,489
I think I get it. Yeah?

396
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,154
Get what? Why you
love what you do.

397
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:36,613
It's... Okay. Okay.

398
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:39,403
It's intoxicating. Tim,
you, martini. Me, work.

399
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:40,486
I got to go. I'm sorry.

400
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,486
Mm-hmm.

401
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,652
Tomorrow. Tim!

402
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:46,151
Wha... Or I'll get my shovel.

403
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,691
We got to get guys to
shoot at you more often.

404
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,810
Hello, Lilah.

405
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,043
Be sure to smile this time,
yeah?

406
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,392
I'm like, "What,
are you kidding me?"

407
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:27,849
So, I tell him,
if you want some blow,

408
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,353
you got to blow,
you know what I mean?

409
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,330
Somerville.

410
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,663
That is not a happy face.

411
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,163
We didn't get it.

412
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,137
God damn it,
where's my fucking money?

413
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,387
We'll get it back.

414
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,636
We know who's got it.

415
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,012
Well, we knew who had it before

416
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,344
and that didn't help a whole hell of a lot,
now did it?

417
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,260
'Cause I still don't have
my fuckin' money back!

418
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,051
You will.

419
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:57,093
Very soon.

420
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:59,217
Soon.

421
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,008
Right.

422
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:03,634
Get out.

423
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:06,073
Get out! Go!

424
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,960
Hey. Hey.

425
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,859
Morning, bruiser.

426
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,917
God, all that really happened,
didn't it?

427
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:39,481
Seems so unreal.

428
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:43,081
Sitting here thinking about
all this work you're doing

429
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:45,581
on the Safe Zone Project.

430
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,396
How much of that do you
think has to do with your sister?

431
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:53,953
I was never really there for
Kelly when she needed me.

432
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,454
I supposed it's
kind of ridiculous

433
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:57,644
to think that I can
make up for that now.

434
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,451
Maybe it's time I start
looking for her again, hmm?

435
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,826
It's been a while.

436
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,557
It's like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

437
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,949
I know you told me
that she was battling

438
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:16,365
with your folks when she left,

439
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:18,822
but what exactly set her off?

440
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,739
Oh, who knows?

441
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:23,363
Kelly was always
getting into trouble.

442
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:27,362
She was always
battling with my parents.

443
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:30,570
In the end I think
it was the tattoo.

444
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:33,903
She got this circle with
an "A" in the middle of it,

445
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,818
the symbol for anarchy,

446
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:39,193
on the back of her neck,

447
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:42,525
and my parents just freaked.

448
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:45,382
I mean,
they really came down on her bad.

449
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:49,065
She was only 17.

450
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,358
I should have done
something about it.

451
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:53,189
I was her big brother.

452
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,587
Come on, now,
you cannot blame yourself.

453
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:01,146
Well...

454
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,045
when she left the house
she just disappeared.

455
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:07,020
And that's what
happens on the streets...

456
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:09,126
Kids just disappear.

457
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,311
Maybe I'm just being naive

458
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:15,666
thinking that we
can help these kids.

459
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,850
Come on,
now. Where's my pit bull?

460
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:23,040
Hmm? I'm not
feeling very pittish.

461
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:27,556
You're going to stay here today,
all right?

462
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,057
Order up some room service,

463
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:32,264
watch some movies, stay here.

464
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,929
Where are you going?

465
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:36,014
You're my biggest client.

466
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:39,095
I got to go do what
you pay me for.

467
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,619
Oh, right.

468
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,460
Hi. I'm here to
see Brian Lenigan.

469
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:18,544
I'm sorry,
Mr. Lenigan has canceled

470
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:20,294
all of his
appointments for today.

471
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,168
I'm a private investigator,
actually.

472
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,169
I'm wondering if I could just

473
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,441
get a couple
minutes of his time.

474
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:27,959
It's okay, Annette.

475
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,815
I can talk to him.

476
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:36,832
I'm Brian Lenigan.

477
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,022
Ah. I'm really sorry
about your loss.

478
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:42,454
What is it you needed, mister...

479
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,579
Strachey. Don Strachey.

480
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,744
Maybe we could find
a private place to chat?

481
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:51,328
I only have a few minutes.

482
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:52,852
This way.

483
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,934
We can use the conference room.

484
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,266
Strachey. Yeah.

485
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:04,907
You know, the police told us

486
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:08,157
that Jake's body
was found in your car.

487
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,865
I'm afraid so, yeah.

488
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:12,739
Did you know Jake?

489
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:13,865
I didn't know him.

490
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,989
I was hoping you
could tell me about him.

491
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,803
What was it you wanted to know?

492
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:22,736
Anything that would be useful.

493
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,594
What sort of cases
was he working on?

494
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:28,485
That's confidential.

495
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,609
I'm looking for the person
who killed your grandson.

496
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,274
I think we want the same things here,
huh?

497
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,525
You couldn't be more mistaken,

498
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:38,732
Mr. Strachey.

499
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:42,857
You see, Jake gave you something

500
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:43,983
that didn't belong to him,

501
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,940
and I need you to
get it back to me.

502
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,605
Why don't you tell me
exactly what you think

503
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:49,564
Jake gave to me.

504
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,230
Don't play games with me, son.

505
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,646
You don't seem so choked up

506
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,170
about the death
of your grandson.

507
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:57,627
Hmm?

508
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,002
I loved the boy.

509
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,976
I was like a father to him

510
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,892
after his own
father passed away.

511
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,249
Was murdered, you mean.

512
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,390
You're in way over
your head here.

513
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:21,265
You give me back what Jake took,

514
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,931
or more people are going to die.

515
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:24,389
Is that a threat?

516
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,079
That's a statement of facts.

517
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,637
You son of a bitch!

518
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,971
You're the reason my
little brother is dead.

519
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:33,594
Eric, stop it!

520
00:31:33,618 --> 00:31:35,427
I suggest you
listen to the old man.

521
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,969
You talked him into it,
didn't you?

522
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,677
Jake never would have done
something like this on his own.

523
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:41,134
Enough. Now let him go.

524
00:31:41,158 --> 00:31:42,801
What did you say
to my little brother?

525
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:45,591
I never saw your brother before I
found his body in my car. Yes, you did.

526
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:46,968
The night before,
you were at the parking garage

527
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,674
with that other guy,
talking to the police.

528
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,674
I know you were there.
What did you say to him?

529
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:53,048
Eric, shut the hell up.

530
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:54,822
You were there.

531
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:59,547
If you care for your life

532
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:01,838
and the lives of
the people you love,

533
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:04,921
I would advocate returning
what was stolen immediately.

534
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:07,170
Really?

535
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,544
Is that your legal advice?

536
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:11,962
Let me ask you this...
If something was stolen,

537
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,793
how come a bunch of lawyers
aren't just going to the cops?

538
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:15,793
Going to the police
would be very unwise.

539
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,732
The district attorney's
an old and dear friend.

540
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,166
I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

541
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,041
When I get pissed off,

542
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:27,706
I have a very bad habit of
doing incredibly stupid things.

543
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,814
And I'm getting
really pissed off.

544
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:41,037
Yeah.

545
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,369
You know how much I
don't need the D.A. calling me

546
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:45,410
to complain about you
harassing his friends?

547
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:46,578
Look, Brian Lenigan is dirty.

548
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:48,952
You got proof of that?
He threatened me.

549
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:51,474
You generally have that effect on people,
me included.

550
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:53,910
That's him.

551
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,533
Somerville. Yeah.

552
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,908
What do you got to
do with Somerville?

553
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,284
You know him?

554
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:00,032
He's a lieutenant
for Frank Zaillian.

555
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:01,865
Organized Crime's
been after him for years.

556
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:04,614
Pornography, prostitution,
God knows what else.

557
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:05,698
Why haven't they taken him down?

558
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:07,780
He's careful,
very well protected,

559
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:10,072
and because anyone
who speaks out against him

560
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,489
tends to disappear...

561
00:33:11,513 --> 00:33:13,095
Permanently.

562
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:16,136
Print it.

563
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,278
Hey, it's me.

564
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:20,611
Meet me at the office,
all right.

565
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:22,360
Don't go in. Just wait
across the street... Hey.

566
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:25,151
Hey, Strachey, I know you like
to think you're a tough guy and all,

567
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,567
but Zaillian's crew,
these guys are out of your league.

568
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,566
Detective,
it almost sounds like you care.

569
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,756
Well, I've got enough
corpses on my hands without...

570
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,796
Joan.

571
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,503
Joan.

572
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:48,712
Hello, Sean.

573
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:50,812
What are you doing?

574
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:52,336
You shouldn't have come back.

575
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,269
It's true, then? About Jake?

576
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,268
Yes.

577
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,209
Come on.

578
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,516
There... There's
nothing you can do now.

579
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,266
You... You need to
leave the city before...

580
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,932
No. I'm not hiding anymore.

581
00:34:10,956 --> 00:34:13,265
We never officially
closed the investigation.

582
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,514
You could be arrested.

583
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:17,931
I lost the boys, I lost you.

584
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,513
I thought there was nothing
worse that could happen.

585
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,678
And now this.

586
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:27,576
I promise you,
I'll find out what happened to Jake.

587
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,718
Poor Sean.

588
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:33,885
I was never very good for you,
was I?

589
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,801
I'm not running anymore.

590
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,658
I want to see my son now.

591
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:40,926
All right.

592
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,114
Come on.

593
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,168
Oh, darlin',

594
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:15,649
you can't do that
in here anymore.

595
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:19,749
Right.

596
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:21,831
Times change, hmm?

597
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,248
Are you okay?

598
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:26,872
So, um, he was killed

599
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:29,329
when he fell off that building,
then?

600
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:31,788
Actually, no.

601
00:35:31,812 --> 00:35:33,369
What do you mean?

602
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:36,269
The coroner says
the fall didn't kill him.

603
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,684
Well, then, how did he die?

604
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,533
Three hours after his fall,

605
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:48,117
his neck was broken.

606
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:55,531
He... He was just a teenager
when I saw him last, Sean.

607
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:58,906
He was just a boy.

608
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,856
Anything?

609
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,232
Uh...

610
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,646
Uh,
location has been under surveillance

611
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,063
for 36 minutes.

612
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,146
Three vehicles have
arrived in that time period...

613
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,312
A sky blue Toyota Highlander,

614
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:44,895
license plate number HRC...

615
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,728
What are you doing?

616
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:48,435
My instructor said
details are important.

617
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:51,768
Kenny,
is there anybody in my office or not?

618
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,309
Um, no.

619
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,226
Doesn't look like it. Good.

620
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,642
But what if I'm wrong?

621
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,457
I'll shoot 'em.

622
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,871
Shh.

623
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,384
Nice surveillance work, Kenny.

624
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,301
Sorry.

625
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:29,908
Lock the door.

626
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,632
Who exactly is after you?

627
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,216
I need you to
do a little digging.

628
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,923
A law firm called
Lenigan & Lenigan.

629
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:40,008
See if you can
find any connection

630
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:42,131
to a man named Frank Zaillian.

631
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,672
Okay. What are you going to do?

632
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,296
A little digging of my own

633
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,737
into a 12-year-old murder case.

634
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,960
Got it.

635
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,293
The other name on the
deed is a Timothy Callahan.

636
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:02,333
The guy with the bonds?

637
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:03,501
Yeah. We ran his credit cards.

638
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:06,150
One was used last
night at this hotel.

639
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,706
There's not much.

640
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,913
Lenigan & Lenigan
keeps a low public profile.

641
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:23,495
A few court cases and
some IRS appearances,

642
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,871
but mostly they tried to
settle everything out of court.

643
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:29,494
And I can't find any
mention of this Frank Zaillian.

644
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,744
Well, he's connected. I know it.

645
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:36,617
Strachey and
Kwon Investigations.

646
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,975
Just a sec.

647
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:44,323
I just thought
I'd see how it sounded.

648
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,490
Hubby on line 1.

649
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,157
Hey.

650
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:49,698
Strachey and Kwon?

651
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:51,531
It sounds like a
figure skating team.

652
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:52,823
Yeah.

653
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,739
I'm about to try our first throw

654
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:57,155
right through the window.

655
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,904
I'm bored out of my mind.

656
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,320
Just a while longer.

657
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:01,320
We're not finding too much.

658
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:03,070
No records of Lenigan clients,

659
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:04,986
no connection to Zaillian.

660
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,527
So we still don't know
where the money came from?

661
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:08,943
No,
but we're just getting started.

662
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,484
What are you going to do?

663
00:39:10,508 --> 00:39:12,883
Uh, honey,
I'm going to have to call you back.

664
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,591
Get back.

665
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:29,064
Maybe I should come
back another time?

666
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:31,855
Joan Lenigan.

667
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,313
Sean said...

668
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,520
Detective Bailey said
that I should speak to you.

669
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:37,270
He... He seemed to think

670
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,127
that you might know something
more about Jake's death.

671
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,126
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Come in.

672
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,666
I need to know what happened,
Mr. Strachey.

673
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,307
Uh,
let me buy you a cup of coffee.

674
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:54,183
Please, come in.

675
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:56,581
Coffee. No decaf.

676
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:23,717
Excuse me. I'm wondering
if you could help me.

677
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:25,490
I'm looking for a friend.

678
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:34,381
I arrests you

679
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:36,630
in the name of the law.

680
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:41,046
Madam, the case is solved.

681
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,838
My hero!

682
00:41:29,642 --> 00:41:32,058
He must have taken it with him.

683
00:41:44,304 --> 00:41:45,447
Are you certain?

684
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:46,572
All of those?

685
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:48,905
For the entire office.

686
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:52,071
We drew your business
card from a bucket,

687
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,154
and you lucky guys won.

688
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,778
Some place I can put these?

689
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:57,319
Um, I-I suppose the kitchen.

690
00:41:57,343 --> 00:42:00,027
All the way back. Okay.

691
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,319
Pizza!

692
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:03,859
Why don't you come
and have a slice?

693
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:05,734
Everyone,
come on in. It's free pizza!

694
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,233
There's sausage and pepperoni

695
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:09,817
and... and mushroom, cheese.

696
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,673
We all love cheese.

697
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:24,980
Have as much as you like.

698
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,729
Enjoy! Thank you.

699
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,836
Whoever you are.

700
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,140
$3 million?

701
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:54,681
Yeah. He wanted it all
to go to an organization

702
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,263
called the Safe Zone.

703
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:58,429
You have any idea where that
money could have come from?

704
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,804
No. But Jake wasn't a thief.

705
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:03,762
There wasn't a deceitful
bone in his body.

706
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:05,552
Kids grow up, they change.

707
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:07,136
I know my son.

708
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,968
He was always... more like me.

709
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:13,741
Then again,
you're supposedly a murderer.

710
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:17,259
Now,
I know Bailey doesn't think you did it,

711
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:19,466
but I have to tell you in
everything that I've read,

712
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,989
I never once saw where
you said you didn't do it.

713
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:27,798
I'm not ashamed of what I did.

714
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,530
I did kill my husband.

715
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:39,920
Daniel was so handsome
and successful...

716
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:42,568
and had a very dark side.

717
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:45,752
And anger that didn't come out

718
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:47,276
till after we were married.

719
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:51,149
Mostly I learned
to live with it.

720
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:54,316
But then I discovered...

721
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:57,499
he was hitting the boys.

722
00:43:57,523 --> 00:44:01,373
Jake showed me horrible bruises

723
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,455
and said it had been
going on for years.

724
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:08,245
He was 12, Mr. Strachey.

725
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:11,371
And I... I didn't know
anything about it.

726
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,787
How can a... How can
a mother not know?

727
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,226
Okay,
so what happened after you found out?

728
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:23,785
I confronted Daniel,
and he threatened me.

729
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:26,200
He said he would kill me...

730
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:28,449
If I tried to take

731
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:29,866
the children away from him,

732
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,117
and I just...

733
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:33,323
I lost control,

734
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:35,615
and...

735
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,906
I grabbed a marble bookend,

736
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,387
and I hit him.

737
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,905
And afterwards I panicked,

738
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:47,011
and I tried to make
it look like a burglary.

739
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:50,468
Bailey was the
lead investigator.

740
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,904
Did you seduce him

741
00:44:52,928 --> 00:44:54,509
because you needed
someone on your side?

742
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,359
You're a jaded man,
Mr. Strachey.

743
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:00,216
I prefer to think
of it as realistic.

744
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:07,482
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:08,566
What?

746
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,689
You sent me to voice mail?

747
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:12,272
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

748
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,648
Well, I'm kind of in the middle

749
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,172
of Jake Lenigan's office.

750
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,564
What are you doing?

751
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:19,270
Detecting.

752
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:21,687
I found a file with Frank
Zaillian's name on it.

753
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:23,227
You broke into his law firm?

754
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:25,728
Well,
it seemed like something that you'd do.

755
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,393
Just tell me what it says.

756
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:29,852
Did some kind of
corporate work for him,

757
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:31,268
setting up offshore companies.

758
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:33,893
Okay,
we need to know what kind of companies.

759
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:34,893
What do they do?

760
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,350
Looks like internet, mostly.

761
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:37,767
Some media.

762
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:38,975
There are companies
in the Bahamas,

763
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:41,058
The Netherlands,

764
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,082
Venezuela...

765
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,764
Is there an address?

766
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:51,995
They're mostly
out of the country.

767
00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:55,744
Hold on.

768
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:58,511
There is one that looks
like a personal residence.

769
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:00,218
Give it to me.

770
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:02,927
Uh, number 14 Neff Lane.

771
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:04,593
What else do we need?

772
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:07,283
You to get out
of there right now.

773
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:12,424
Was that about Jake?

774
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:13,675
The Lenigan law firm.

775
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:15,674
How much do you know
about the business they do?

776
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:17,673
N-Nothing.

777
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:20,256
Daniel never shared
that part of his life with me.

778
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,172
Oh. Well, I'm afraid

779
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,671
your family's been working
for some very bad people.

780
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:26,838
My son was an
honorable young man.

781
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:28,879
If he stole anything,

782
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:31,319
I promise you it was
for a very good reason.

783
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,732
Hey.

784
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:51,356
Thank you.

785
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:53,373
Oh.

786
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:54,897
You're welcome.

787
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:56,774
Come on,
guys. Let's get a move on.

788
00:47:56,798 --> 00:47:59,608
We got two shoots tonight.

789
00:47:59,632 --> 00:48:01,189
What?

790
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,464
Get this done. Get it done.

791
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:38,973
Hey!

792
00:48:38,997 --> 00:48:40,015
Well?

793
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,016
He was there.

794
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,539
Someone must
have tipped him off.

795
00:48:48,078 --> 00:48:49,721
So what do I pay you for anyway?

796
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:51,261
Hey.

797
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:52,262
Jesus!

798
00:48:52,286 --> 00:48:53,785
Over here. This way.

799
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:55,867
Hurry up.

800
00:48:57,076 --> 00:48:59,491
It's fucking
incompetence is what it is.

801
00:49:00,825 --> 00:49:03,009
We've got a man on the hotel.

802
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:05,133
We'll know if they come back.

803
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:07,257
I want to talk to Lenigan,
all right?

804
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,632
If this fucking prick had
better control over his family,

805
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,196
none of this shit
would have happened.

806
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:21,254
Now find me this
Callahan asshole

807
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:23,069
and get me my money back.

808
00:49:29,443 --> 00:49:31,459
Thanks.

809
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:35,126
You look pretty young
to be in a place like this.

810
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,650
You live here?

811
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,500
You're not with the crew,
are you?

812
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:41,732
I'm more of an
independent contractor.

813
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,541
Did, um...

814
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,832
Did Jake send you?

815
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:49,163
How do you know Jake?

816
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:52,454
Why were you sneaking around?

817
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:54,979
Do you ever answer questions?

818
00:49:56,436 --> 00:49:58,662
To a guy that's been
sneaking around the hallways

819
00:49:58,686 --> 00:49:59,704
grilling me,

820
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:00,870
and has a gun

821
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:03,744
pretty poorly concealed under his jacket,
no.

822
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,535
I'm almost 16. I
live where I want.

823
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,660
Besides,
you smell like a cop to me.

824
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:11,141
Let's not start calling each other names,
now.

825
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:14,616
I'm Don. I'm not a cop.

826
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,723
I'm a private detective,
and yeah, I know Jake.

827
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,949
Is he coming?

828
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,014
Jake helping you out with something,
somehow?

829
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,679
Oh, shit, they got him,
didn't they?

830
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:32,136
Is he okay?

831
00:50:35,343 --> 00:50:37,319
I told him.

832
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:40,384
I told him that it
was too dangerous.

833
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,842
Well, what's your name?

834
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:48,966
Lilah.

835
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,274
It's pretty.

836
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:54,232
Yeah, do you like it?

837
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:58,981
Frank Zaillian gave it to me.

838
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:01,462
Zaillian put you in the movies?

839
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:06,169
Yeah. I'm a fucking star.

840
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:11,227
I'm going to get
you out of here.

841
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:12,978
I tried once, and they hurt me.

842
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,710
They're not going to this time.

843
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,708
That's what Jake said.

844
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,873
Hold it.

845
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:36,389
Lilah.

846
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:38,221
What are you doing?

847
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:39,846
You're supposed to
be down in makeup.

848
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,971
Get your ass downstairs now.

849
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:44,495
Now!

850
00:51:46,743 --> 00:51:48,135
You got to get out of here.

851
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:49,134
They'll kill you, too.

852
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:50,135
You're coming with me.

853
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:51,176
No, I can't.

854
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,510
They think I'm trying to leave,

855
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,509
then they'll know I
helped take all that money.

856
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,551
They'll hurt me again.
I can't let that happen.

857
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,800
They're not going to hurt you.

858
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,448
What do you know
about these bonds?

859
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,590
Well,
I told Jake how he could take them

860
00:52:04,614 --> 00:52:07,130
without Frank
realizing it for a while,

861
00:52:07,154 --> 00:52:09,171
but if I hadn't told him,
then he wouldn't...

862
00:52:09,195 --> 00:52:11,964
Jake was trying to do the right thing,
all right?

863
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:13,338
I'm going to help him finish it,

864
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:15,337
but first we got to get
you someplace safe.

865
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:17,128
No, wait, wait,
wait. Just let me check

866
00:52:17,152 --> 00:52:18,902
in case somebody's there, okay?

867
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,669
Uh-uh!

868
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:24,418
I wouldn't try
that if I were you.

869
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:25,942
Get him.

870
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,191
Frank would like to talk to you.

871
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,399
Sock him.

872
00:52:50,395 --> 00:52:52,245
You know who I am?

873
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,078
Yeah, you're a scumbag.

874
00:52:54,102 --> 00:52:55,537
Ouch.

875
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:57,327
You hurt my feelings.

876
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,576
So you prefer slimeball?

877
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,077
Sleazebag, huh?

878
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:03,909
I want my money.

879
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:05,766
I don't know where it is.

880
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,325
Give it to me.

881
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:11,115
You've got it,
and I want it back.

882
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:13,073
Aah! Ha ha!

883
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:14,597
Hmm.

884
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,989
Let's try this again here.

885
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:20,613
Where is my money?

886
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:22,154
The cops have it.

887
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:23,363
Bullshit!

888
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:24,655
If the cops had it,

889
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,278
you wouldn't be
sneaking around here,

890
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,486
You make all this
money on kiddie porn,

891
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,986
or is that just a
sideline for you?

892
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,195
Hey, I just make the movies.

893
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:32,902
Plenty of people
lining up to buy them.

894
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:34,985
Fuck you. They're kids.

895
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:36,110
Ahh!

896
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:38,067
They grew up way
before I found them.

897
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,799
Besides, nobody misses
them after I'm done with them.

898
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:46,106
Hmph!

899
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,941
See,
you might find this surprising,

900
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:49,731
but, uh...

901
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,713
I'm actually a very
conservative businessman.

902
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:55,813
Very.

903
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:59,979
No loose ends,
no... unnecessary risks.

904
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,102
And I suppose your lawyers
help you with that, huh?

905
00:54:02,126 --> 00:54:04,394
Some shell companies move
your fucking money around?

906
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:09,643
Well, Lenigan is the best
cover-your-ass attorney in the city.

907
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,059
Has been for decades.

908
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,934
Well, actually...

909
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,308
actually except for his grandkid,
you know.

910
00:54:16,332 --> 00:54:19,641
He, uh,
he got all self-righteous on us.

911
00:54:19,665 --> 00:54:21,098
So you killed him?

912
00:54:21,122 --> 00:54:22,306
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

913
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,307
Huh?

914
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:25,389
Ah, yeah.

915
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:28,639
Well,
I haven't killed anybody this week.

916
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:29,640
Uhh...

917
00:54:29,664 --> 00:54:32,161
You might very well be my first.

918
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:36,595
Because, you see, I...

919
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:38,511
I'm running out
of patience here,

920
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:41,385
and I'm getting pretty fucking ticked off,
you know?

921
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:42,760
Zap him.

922
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:44,219
Rrrh!

923
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:46,259
So...

924
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,491
I'm going to ask you
this one more time.

925
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,217
Where's my fucking money,

926
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:55,590
you cock-sucking piece of shit?

927
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:57,215
It's so far away,

928
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:59,905
you won't see a
penny of it ever again.

929
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:02,464
Yeah.

930
00:55:02,488 --> 00:55:03,988
Yeah?

931
00:55:06,695 --> 00:55:09,212
Let's just see what your
boyfriend has to say about it.

932
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,420
Leave him alone!

933
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:11,944
Aah!

934
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,586
Hello, handsome.

935
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,250
Aah!

936
00:55:21,274 --> 00:55:22,418
Don?

937
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:23,959
You want to see
Donnie boy alive again,

938
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:26,166
get me my money back.

939
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,958
What did you do to him?

940
00:55:27,982 --> 00:55:29,291
I haven't killed him yet,

941
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:31,081
but his life's going
to be a living hell

942
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:32,956
until you bring me
back my bonds!

943
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:35,123
Please don't hurt him.

944
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:36,955
Be outside your
hotel in 30 minutes.

945
00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:39,914
Hey! You call the cops, he dies.

946
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:41,853
Don't give them anything!

947
00:55:48,936 --> 00:55:51,118
Excuse me. I left
a package here.

948
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:52,536
I need to pick it back up.

949
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,910
Annette, I'm going to go.

950
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,493
Be sure to forward the phones.

951
00:55:56,517 --> 00:55:59,098
I don't want a repeat of
what happened last time.

952
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,658
Mom.

953
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:06,472
Eric.

954
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:10,722
Oh, my God.

955
00:56:11,346 --> 00:56:13,262
I'm so sorry.

956
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,155
Mom, Jake is...

957
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,844
I know. I know.

958
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:22,593
I know.

959
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:41,506
Get in.

960
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:57,186
You're making this very difficult for me,
Lilah.

961
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,083
Yeah, well,
I can't help it if I have to go again.

962
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:04,643
All right, listen up.

963
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,434
I want everybody out of here.

964
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,643
What? Huh?

965
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,266
But, Frank,
we're just supposed to start. We...

966
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,224
I don't c... Get them out.

967
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:12,748
You got five minutes.

968
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,266
How about it?

969
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,348
Guys, that's a wrap!

970
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:17,931
You know the drill.
Move it out fast.

971
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:19,182
Come on!

972
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:21,037
Let's get out of here. That's it,
guys.

973
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:23,662
You heard the man.

974
00:57:38,575 --> 00:57:40,909
If you get your hands loose,
I'm going to shoot you.

975
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,050
I bet you'd miss.

976
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:45,757
You look pretty stupid to me.

977
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:47,299
Mm-hmm.

978
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:49,530
You know,
I'm going to have fun hurting you.

979
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,005
I figured I was too old for you,

980
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,321
that you like them little kids,
huh?

981
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:59,921
Fuck you. That's just
for fucking perverts.

982
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:02,003
Don't tell me
they don't give you

983
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:04,837
free copies of those movies
to take home with you.

984
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,002
It'll be a lot healthier
for you right now

985
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,878
if you just shut the fuck up.

986
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,003
I promise you that!

987
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:12,334
Yeah? What about
telling me the truth?

988
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:14,168
Your kennel's full of those tapes,
isn't it?

989
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:16,065
Fuck you. Uhh!

990
00:58:28,396 --> 00:58:30,914
Don? Find something
sharp to cut me down.

991
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:32,438
Hurry.

992
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:38,561
Can you get me
out of here? Yeah.

993
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:41,227
Come on.

994
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:00,489
Come on. Get out.

995
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:02,013
I said get out!

996
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:05,780
There's no need to be rude.

997
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:07,572
Where's Don? I want to see him.

998
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:09,154
Which piece?

999
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,428
Come on. Let's go. Inside.

1000
00:59:21,717 --> 00:59:23,152
Detective Bailey?

1001
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:25,716
I'm calling for Don Strachey.

1002
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:33,839
Bring it to me.

1003
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:37,273
How about that?

1004
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:39,754
They're not here.

1005
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,921
What?

1006
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:44,856
You son of a bitch.

1007
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,645
I have them. I have them. I do.

1008
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:48,729
Just not on me.

1009
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,644
You fucking pouf,
where are they?

1010
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,418
Close. Very close by.

1011
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:57,726
Once Don and I are released,

1012
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,308
they will be delivered to you.

1013
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1014
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,100
What do you think this is,

1015
01:00:02,124 --> 01:00:03,392
some sort of a negotiation?

1016
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:06,015
Maybe I'll just cut
off one of your hands

1017
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:08,223
and see if you bleed
out while we wait for it.

1018
01:00:08,247 --> 01:00:10,056
Well,

1019
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,264
it's not a perfect plan.

1020
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,972
But it was the best I
could come up with

1021
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:15,264
under short notice.

1022
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:17,430
Do you want the money or not?

1023
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:19,554
Let's just kill one of them,
yeah?

1024
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,512
That's a good
idea. I vote for you.

1025
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,344
Man, this thing is just getting
more and more fucked up.

1026
01:00:25,368 --> 01:00:26,969
Don,
let's just give them the money.

1027
01:00:26,993 --> 01:00:28,469
They'd still kill us.

1028
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,033
No loose ends,
isn't that right, Frank?

1029
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:34,884
Uh, Donnie boy,

1030
01:00:34,908 --> 01:00:36,883
I'm sure we can
work something out.

1031
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:39,823
Why don't you listen to
your girlfriend here, huh?

1032
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:42,132
Tim, go!

1033
01:00:42,156 --> 01:00:43,258
God damn!

1034
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:45,113
Get Strachey!

1035
01:00:46,155 --> 01:00:47,655
Damn it!

1036
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:53,880
What...

1037
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,045
Aah!

1038
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,569
Come on.

1039
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,900
Callahan!

1040
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:36,577
Go around in front of the house

1041
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,034
and wait for me.
I will come back.

1042
01:01:38,058 --> 01:01:39,159
What are you going to do?

1043
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:40,683
Go get my boyfriend.

1044
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,390
Callahan.

1045
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:02,886
Oh, I'll find you.

1046
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:09,968
Don't move!

1047
01:02:10,802 --> 01:02:11,820
Shit.

1048
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:13,443
Shit.

1049
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:14,967
Fucking get out of here.

1050
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:33,296
Put it down, Strachey.

1051
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:37,104
You hear those sirens?

1052
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,813
They're about a
minute away. It's over.

1053
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:41,311
Oh, yeah? Well,
that gives you 60 seconds

1054
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,043
to tell me where the money is.

1055
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,875
Hello, Lilah.

1056
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:56,416
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1057
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:59,997
Somerville! Let's go!

1058
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:14,370
Aah!

1059
01:03:31,365 --> 01:03:32,865
Stop it.

1060
01:03:34,614 --> 01:03:36,114
You'd better do it.

1061
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:41,465
No spine.

1062
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,463
It's all right.

1063
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,295
I got enough for both of us.

1064
01:03:49,985 --> 01:03:51,485
Aah!

1065
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:03,792
Don, you okay?

1066
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:05,316
Yeah.

1067
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:07,648
I'm sorry.

1068
01:04:08,398 --> 01:04:10,832
For what? I couldn't...

1069
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:13,456
I couldn't pull the trigger.

1070
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,954
That's why I love you.

1071
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,978
It's okay.

1072
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,995
Where's Zaillian?

1073
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:25,496
I don't know.

1074
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,142
He heard the sirens and...

1075
01:04:29,142 --> 01:04:31,577
Lilah.

1076
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,493
Get... get... No!

1077
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:34,827
No, no!

1078
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:38,116
Hurry up!

1079
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,450
Get on the floor.

1080
01:04:39,474 --> 01:04:40,699
Get on the floor. What?

1081
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:41,825
No, please! I don't want...

1082
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:43,407
Get on the floor!

1083
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:02,926
Lilah? Lilah!

1084
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:10,342
Who's Lilah?

1085
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:15,215
Girl I made a promise to.

1086
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:24,439
There's going to be paperwork on this one,
Strachey.

1087
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,646
Let's find
Zaillian and the girl first.

1088
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,021
Put out an APB.

1089
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:29,397
He was heading west.

1090
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:30,978
Airport,
maybe. Alert the airlines.

1091
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:32,812
Come on, he's got so many ways

1092
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:34,229
to get out of the country,
you know that.

1093
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:36,770
Yeah, well,
there's not much else we can do.

1094
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:38,311
The Lenigans.

1095
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,811
They know more
about him than anyone.

1096
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,810
Yeah, well,
Brian Lenigan's a friend of the D.A.

1097
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:43,975
Come on,
he's protecting a child pornographer.

1098
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,998
The D.A. is going to
get so far away from him.

1099
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,264
Connect me through the law
offices of Lenigan and Lenigan.

1100
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,431
Where are the bonds?

1101
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:57,890
Kenny's got them.

1102
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,888
They're in the seat of
my ride. I'll go get 'em.

1103
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:02,096
You're not gonna be
able to keep this money.

1104
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,430
I don't want it.

1105
01:06:03,454 --> 01:06:05,054
Not like this.

1106
01:06:05,078 --> 01:06:07,095
You all right with getting
a ride in with Kenny?

1107
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,803
Not really. Where are you going?

1108
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:12,159
Finish this.

1109
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:17,200
You'd better goddamn
well do something.

1110
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,884
I swear to God, if I go down,

1111
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:22,425
I'm taking your
entire family with me!

1112
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:25,365
Yeah,
I'll be out of the country within an hour.

1113
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:28,215
Handle this!

1114
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:29,905
Fuck!

1115
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:32,257
Fuck!

1116
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:38,087
Right now,
you're worth more to me alive than dead.

1117
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,961
But screw around with me,
and that changes fast.

1118
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:45,068
I should've left you in the
street where I found you.

1119
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:52,317
I remember when he'd get really angry,
he'd...

1120
01:06:53,316 --> 01:06:55,167
It was like he
just lost control.

1121
01:06:55,191 --> 01:06:57,648
I know. I remember, too.

1122
01:06:58,898 --> 01:07:02,022
I was so angry at
you for what you did.

1123
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,665
Your grandfather threatened me.

1124
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,539
I was scared,

1125
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:10,705
and then it just seemed

1126
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:12,912
like you were probably
better off without me.

1127
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:14,436
We were,

1128
01:07:15,644 --> 01:07:17,227
all of us.

1129
01:07:19,352 --> 01:07:21,952
You're as much to blame
as I am for Daniel's death.

1130
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:24,035
You created the monster
that was your son.

1131
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,475
I taught him how to be strong.

1132
01:07:28,183 --> 01:07:30,949
Same way I taught his children.

1133
01:07:30,973 --> 01:07:34,782
And Jake was strong, wasn't he?

1134
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:38,282
Strong enough to
do what he thought was right.

1135
01:07:38,306 --> 01:07:40,489
Eric, we need to talk.

1136
01:07:40,513 --> 01:07:42,781
The police phoned. They're
on their way over here.

1137
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,281
We're already here, Mr. Lenigan.

1138
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:46,071
I see.

1139
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,612
I hope you don't mind.
We let ourselves in.

1140
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:50,112
What's he doing here?

1141
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:51,237
Strictly as an observer.

1142
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:52,695
We need to know how
Frank Zaillian travels

1143
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,028
when he leaves the country.

1144
01:07:54,052 --> 01:07:55,446
How on earth would we know that?

1145
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:58,027
I mean,
even if we knew this Frank...

1146
01:07:58,051 --> 01:07:59,693
You know damn
well exactly who he is.

1147
01:07:59,717 --> 01:08:01,526
Mr. Lenigan, we believe Zaillian

1148
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,067
is a client of your firm.

1149
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:04,443
Anything you can do to help us?

1150
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:07,025
Our clients lists
are confidential.

1151
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,399
Shall we call the
district attorney

1152
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:11,190
so he can explain that to you?

1153
01:08:11,214 --> 01:08:13,315
Look,
you can call whoever you need to.

1154
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,023
Now we've got a teenage
girl whose life is in danger.

1155
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:17,772
As a good, upstanding attorney,

1156
01:08:17,796 --> 01:08:21,545
I figured you'd do everything
in your power to help.

1157
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:25,353
I'm afraid I can't help.

1158
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:26,978
Brian, if you know anything...

1159
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,769
Shut up, Joan.

1160
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:30,145
For God sakes,

1161
01:08:30,169 --> 01:08:31,769
Frank Zaillian's
probably the man

1162
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:33,393
who killed your grandson.

1163
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:35,542
No, he isn't.

1164
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,018
Isn't that right, Eric?

1165
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:40,350
What? How would I know?

1166
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:41,890
Because you killed your brother.

1167
01:08:44,498 --> 01:08:45,683
It's absurd.

1168
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:47,889
Eric, we're leaving now.

1169
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:50,556
First I assumed it
was Frank Zaillian.

1170
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,723
That doesn't add up.

1171
01:08:52,747 --> 01:08:54,971
Zaillian's the kind of guy that
would brag about killing your brother

1172
01:08:54,995 --> 01:08:56,887
and stick his corpse
in my car as a threat.

1173
01:08:56,911 --> 01:08:59,869
He takes what he wants,
just like he tried to do.

1174
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:03,969
No, this was someone
who's afraid of confrontation.

1175
01:09:03,993 --> 01:09:06,011
It was also someone who
knew where Jake might have

1176
01:09:06,035 --> 01:09:07,760
sent that $3 million,
just like you did.

1177
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:09,635
Because you were watching
me and Tim that night

1178
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:11,259
in the parking garage,
weren't you?

1179
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:13,009
You told me so yourself.

1180
01:09:13,033 --> 01:09:14,384
How'd you know where to go?

1181
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:16,717
I didn't, I just...

1182
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:19,507
Your brother tell you what
he was thinking about doing?

1183
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:20,881
Did you follow him?

1184
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:22,216
He was going to
destroy the firm. We...

1185
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,089
Eric!

1186
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:26,131
Don't say another word.

1187
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:28,755
I understand your father
used to hit you and Jake.

1188
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:30,172
Did you get his temper?
Is that what happened?

1189
01:09:30,196 --> 01:09:31,672
Are you good and
pissed off? Shut up!

1190
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,546
Slap him around a bit,
try to teach him a lesson, huh?

1191
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,879
I loved Jake!

1192
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,295
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to...

1193
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,877
Eric, no.

1194
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,211
No.

1195
01:09:40,235 --> 01:09:41,835
Must've destroyed
your brother to find out

1196
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,917
that his family was
protecting drug dealers,

1197
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:45,501
child pornographers.

1198
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:47,833
I demand you to get
this man out of my office.

1199
01:09:47,857 --> 01:09:51,667
The only decent person in
a whole mess full of vipers,

1200
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:52,667
and you killed him.

1201
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:57,039
Keep your damn mouth shut!

1202
01:09:57,063 --> 01:09:59,415
Frank Zaillian's got a girl with him,
Eric.

1203
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:01,080
A girl just as innocent

1204
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:02,581
as you once were. Get him out.

1205
01:10:02,605 --> 01:10:05,288
Now tell me where
to find him. Eric.

1206
01:10:05,312 --> 01:10:08,953
If you know, if you know...

1207
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:10,869
Eric. Tell him.

1208
01:10:10,893 --> 01:10:12,477
Eric.

1209
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,684
There's an airstrip.

1210
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:19,744
There's an airstrip on Conklin.

1211
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:22,766
He flies there so
there's no paper trail.

1212
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:27,533
You idiot.

1213
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:31,556
I'm this man's
legal representative.

1214
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:35,680
There'll be
no further questions.

1215
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,093
Stay in here.

1216
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,318
What the hell's going on?

1217
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:52,527
Can't you do this any faster?

1218
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:53,986
If we have ice on the wings,

1219
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,109
the plane won't even fly.

1220
01:10:56,133 --> 01:10:57,235
If this storm gets any worse,

1221
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:58,816
we're never going
to make it at all.

1222
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,024
I'll get you to Canada,
Mr. Zaillian.

1223
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,400
Don't worry.

1224
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,715
Yeah, don't worry.

1225
01:11:18,503 --> 01:11:21,103
Any units
in the vicinity of Forest Road,

1226
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:22,312
officer needs assistance.

1227
01:11:22,336 --> 01:11:24,668
Vehicle on the shoulder westbound,
code 83.

1228
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:41,556
Joan,

1229
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,014
you need your coat.

1230
01:11:44,455 --> 01:11:47,514
Please don't do this.

1231
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:49,038
I'm sorry, Joan.

1232
01:12:04,284 --> 01:12:05,342
Let's go.

1233
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:06,800
Let's go.

1234
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:08,133
Get up!

1235
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,550
No! Get up!

1236
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:12,007
No, I... Please!

1237
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,424
Please!

1238
01:12:13,448 --> 01:12:15,632
No,
I don't want... Stop it! Let's go.

1239
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:18,715
Shit. No!

1240
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:20,381
Donald!

1241
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:21,673
Start the engine.

1242
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:25,712
Let her go! Like hell.

1243
01:12:25,736 --> 01:12:28,878
How much is it worth? You got
$3 million of untraceable bonds.

1244
01:12:28,902 --> 01:12:30,961
Fuck you! Show me.

1245
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:32,295
Frank, we got to go.

1246
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:34,126
They're right here. No!

1247
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,834
Settle down!

1248
01:12:35,858 --> 01:12:36,876
Let her go,
and they're all yours.

1249
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,126
How about I just shoot you

1250
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,668
and keep the money and the girl?

1251
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:42,166
How about I put a bullet in the side
of your plane and you go nowhere,

1252
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:44,166
and I promise you the
cops are right behind me.

1253
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,542
Frank! Hold on!

1254
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:47,481
Let's go,
Frank. All I want is the girl.

1255
01:12:49,855 --> 01:12:52,331
Please don't hurt him.

1256
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:53,666
All right, bring them up.

1257
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:55,205
But I swear to God,
if you try something,

1258
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:56,665
I'm going to fucking kill you!

1259
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:58,521
Stop it!

1260
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:03,286
They're right here.
Nice and easy.

1261
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,686
Nice and easy.

1262
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:08,369
Here you go.

1263
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:22,347
Strachey,

1264
01:13:23,681 --> 01:13:26,180
3 million bucks for
a throwaway kid?

1265
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:29,388
Swear to God,
I'll never understand you people.

1266
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,654
All right, get me out of here.

1267
01:13:47,509 --> 01:13:50,091
It's okay. It's okay.

1268
01:13:53,715 --> 01:13:56,714
It's over. It's okay, Lilah,
it's going to be okay.

1269
01:13:57,797 --> 01:14:00,172
Amy.

1270
01:14:01,213 --> 01:14:03,213
My name is Amy.

1271
01:15:25,652 --> 01:15:27,835
Dispatch, this is Bailey.

1272
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:29,084
Do you copy?

1273
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,336
Roger, Bailey.

1274
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,566
This is dispatch, go ahead.

1275
01:15:33,566 --> 01:15:35,667
Bailey, do you copy?

1276
01:15:35,691 --> 01:15:36,916
Bailey?

1277
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,440
Stand by.

1278
01:15:47,563 --> 01:15:50,288
I thought it was
quite convincing

1279
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:54,078
that grief-stricken over
the death of one grandson,

1280
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:55,953
the arrest of another,

1281
01:15:55,977 --> 01:15:58,976
family patriarch
takes his own life.

1282
01:15:59,976 --> 01:16:01,619
You didn't have to do it.

1283
01:16:01,643 --> 01:16:03,077
Somebody did,

1284
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,142
and I'm the only one left.

1285
01:16:06,183 --> 01:16:07,992
Don't worry.

1286
01:16:08,016 --> 01:16:11,158
There's no evidence
for you to clean up

1287
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:13,015
this time.

1288
01:16:22,762 --> 01:16:24,262
Bye, Sean.

1289
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:46,442
This is Detective Bailey.

1290
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:48,857
We're going to need
a coroner's wagon.

1291
01:16:48,881 --> 01:16:51,064
The deceased is Brian Lenigan.

1292
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:53,856
Roger that.

1293
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,063
Looks like a suicide.

1294
01:16:56,087 --> 01:16:57,754
104.

1295
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:25,415
I don't know.

1296
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:28,057
Hey, come on.

1297
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:30,139
It beats the streets, right?

1298
01:17:30,163 --> 01:17:32,014
I did okay on the streets.

1299
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:34,013
Before Frank found me,
I was fine.

1300
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:35,888
Please, just give it a shot.

1301
01:17:35,912 --> 01:17:37,304
I'm sure there are
people out there

1302
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:38,554
that care very much about you,

1303
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:39,971
who'd be completely destroyed

1304
01:17:39,995 --> 01:17:42,327
if anything was going
to happen to you.

1305
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,885
Maybe just for a few days, then.

1306
01:17:45,909 --> 01:17:48,302
Excuse me. Hi, this is Amy.

1307
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:51,241
Maybe you could show her around,
get her started.

1308
01:17:52,824 --> 01:17:54,823
Proud of you.

1309
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:02,073
Thank you.

1310
01:18:04,155 --> 01:18:05,632
It's going to be okay.

1311
01:18:05,656 --> 01:18:07,297
We're going to be here for you,
okay?

1312
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:08,590
Okay, bye.

1313
01:18:08,614 --> 01:18:10,403
Bye.

1314
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,795
You see?

1315
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,129
You do the right thing,

1316
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:17,587
and the world just has a
way of looking out for you.

1317
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:20,502
Yeah,
if you give it a good shove

1318
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:21,878
in the right direction, maybe.

1319
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:24,251
Well,
everything turned out for the best.

1320
01:18:24,275 --> 01:18:25,585
That's what's important.

1321
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:26,959
Eric Lenigan donated

1322
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:30,167
the money inherited from
his grandfather to Safe Zone.

1323
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:31,748
We're actually thinking
about building a new center

1324
01:18:31,772 --> 01:18:34,082
and naming it after his brother.

1325
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:36,373
So I guess Jake got
what he wanted after all.

1326
01:18:36,397 --> 01:18:37,707
Yeah.

1327
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:39,289
$5 million in the building.

1328
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,563
These centers are going
to be running for years.

1329
01:18:44,103 --> 01:18:45,871
What is Kenny doing here?

1330
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:47,412
Come with me.

1331
01:18:47,436 --> 01:18:49,911
I gave Kenny his first
official assignment.

1332
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:52,518
Dude,
I'll see you in the center.

1333
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,201
So what did you give him?

1334
01:18:59,225 --> 01:19:02,200
Shooting pictures
of cheating spouses?

1335
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:05,241
No,
I sent him to pick something up for me.

1336
01:19:05,265 --> 01:19:06,492
You know how I was telling you

1337
01:19:06,516 --> 01:19:09,407
how much I admire
that tenacious spirit

1338
01:19:09,431 --> 01:19:10,865
and positive attitude of yours?

1339
01:19:10,889 --> 01:19:12,074
Yes.

1340
01:19:12,098 --> 01:19:14,947
I could be something
of a pit bull myself.

1341
01:19:14,971 --> 01:19:16,280
Bullheaded bully.

1342
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,572
Maybe.

1343
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:18,947
There's nothing I like more

1344
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:21,636
than finding a
needle in a haystack.

1345
01:19:25,468 --> 01:19:26,968
Is that...

1346
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:38,174
Why don't you go say
hello to your sister?

1347
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:09,935
You all right?

1348
01:20:09,959 --> 01:20:11,975
She was arrested seven years ago

1349
01:20:11,999 --> 01:20:15,266
at a protest in New York City.

1350
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,932
So her tattoo was registered

1351
01:20:16,956 --> 01:20:19,931
in the criminal tattoo database.

1352
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:22,140
What if it wasn't?

1353
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:23,787
We would have just
kept looking for her.

1354
01:20:39,617 --> 01:20:41,552
So you still think
about quitting

1355
01:20:41,576 --> 01:20:43,967
the private
investigation business?

1356
01:20:43,991 --> 01:20:47,509
On a beautiful day like this,

1357
01:20:47,533 --> 01:20:49,674
not today, Kenny.

1358
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:51,965
Not today.

1359
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:16,915
