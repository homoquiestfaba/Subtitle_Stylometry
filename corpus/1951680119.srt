1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,993
Name: Landlocked emperor

2
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Be careful, just now when
being the most fanatic in history.

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This evening, will
never leave you any regret.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,993
Will let you enjoy the bright
memory of time in former days.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,993
The stair is very dark

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,993
I do not know this corridor. Where are we?

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is our room.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,991
I have no key

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,993
No, you give it to me. I have keys.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,993
I do not know I have heads

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,993
Is this that room? I can not remember.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,993
- Take off your clothes -

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,992
Do you know what prostitutes should do?

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,991
Make love

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,993
- Do you want to make love with me?
- Take off your clothes.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will tell you the thing that I want to do

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,991
All right

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,991
I fear

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,991
I fear

20
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,993
I did a lot of things in a whole day.

21
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,993
What have you done?

22
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,993
What do you want to know?

23
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,991
What time is it

24
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,993
I keep secret.

25
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,993
There is not even a telephone today

26
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,993
I hear that someone.

27
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,993
I do not think
that lack a lot of things yet.

28
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,991
Look for the things?

29
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,993
- Want to come in? -

30
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Look for the entry?

31
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
- An entry, understand? - Yes, I see.

32
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you know I am
looking for an entry? - Exactly.

33
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,993
It is very good
You can understand on very well.

34
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It is very good!

35
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,993
It is really clever! You understand!

36
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I am sorry, I keep you waiting.

37
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It doesn't matter
I am your new neighbour.

38
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I live here, the bottom in this street.

39
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,991
Madam!

40
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,991
Hello!

41
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I hope I have not bothered you.

42
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No.

43
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I am your new neighbour.

44
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How do you do.

45
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
May I exchange
some things with you privately?

46
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, not

47
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,991
Sit down, please.

48
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, your family is really very beautiful.

49
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thanks.

50
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Very glad that you can like.

51
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,991
Invite.

52
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do you want a cup of coffee?

53
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh. OK. Very happy.

54
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you very much.

55
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Madam what do you want?

56
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have a cup of coffee too, thanks.

57
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I am visiting residents round here in a family.

58
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because I want to know
in some new neighbours more.

59
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I think that it is a very important
thing to get to know the new neighbour.

60
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,993
And this needs to say:
"How do you do. Good luck to you"

61
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This thing sounds a little strange
But you are very friendly.

62
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,993
Which house do you live in?

63
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Now, at the end of the street.

64
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Leaving this has some distances.

65
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
A name is the Buddhist
nun of east contract Rossi

66
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,993
I think I understand which family it is.

67
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,993
But you seldom go shopping.

68
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,991
Thanks.

69
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,993
Whether please taste
and need to put the sugar.

70
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, very excellent coffee.

71
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You, madam?

72
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes. Yes. Thanks

73
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I go to another room to wait

74
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You have any to need to call me at any time.

75
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,991
Thank you.

76
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It is like this.

77
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,993
It is said you have got a new role

78
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just perhaps will have.

79
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I fear very much.

80
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It is very difficult to get this role.

81
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,993
Not, that it is said is in the bag that
this role has already fallen into you

82
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh?

83
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,991
Yes.

84
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is this role very interesting?

85
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,993
Oh, yes, certainly.

86
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,993
Discuss about the question of your marriage.

87
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I also yes, wait, but...

88
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,993
Your husband, just one is good
at covering up one's own person.

89
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,991
No.

90
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
A child in one day, just act as and play.

91
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What time do you
open the door every day?

92
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
With him at that time?

93
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Then cross this door and go out?

94
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Prosecute.

95
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Or is prosecuted.

96
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,993
This is the curse born.

97
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,993
This will follow this child when cursing.

98
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,993
I am sorry, what meaning are you?

99
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,993
This is a very old story.

100
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There is another edition.

101
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
A little girl

102
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,993
Go out to play together

103
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It can on it's a pity very much to miss.

104
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,993
They use the
computer to connect each other.

105
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is not the platform of a market.

106
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What you know is not?

107
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But better than platform on the market.

108
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes, it is that one.

109
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,993
That is a road to enter the palace.

110
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,993
However, such a thing
is not worth your remembering.

111
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,993
Let's forget it
We two know it will be better.

112
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,993
As to me, the one that
will change is more terrible.

113
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,993
Oh, where has it stopped?

114
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,993
Have such a plot too in your film?

115
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, not

116
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have not heard of such a story.

117
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No?

118
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,993
Then do I think I have got it wrong?

119
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

120
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,991
That is too bad!

121
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I do not understand your words very much.

122
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you do not have other things

123
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,993
Can you go now?

124
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, but I am a thing of forgetting today.

125
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,993
Today? Was it two days ago probably?
Or yesterday

126
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Only remember it is 45 past 9.

127
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,993
I can tell you to be after mid-night.

128
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's confirm a thing.

129
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,991
Is today?

130
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Perhaps it is tomorrow

131
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You must do a good job of a plan.

132
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,993
Will stop paying the bill possibly.

133
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A behavior.

134
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,993
And then connect another behavior.

135
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Have not cut off

136
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,991
Glamour perpetuity

137
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,991
It may be tomorrow

138
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,993
You will find everything is futile

139
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,993
Have seen?

140
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I am sorry, madam

141
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,993
I am sorry, madam, the telephone.

142
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,991
Here you are

143
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,991
Your broker

144
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,991
Dose draws the card

145
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Dose draws the card

146
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,991
Dose draws the card

147
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,993
Mine. Heartily heartily

148
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,991
My God it

149
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Buddhist nun can
We are very glad to cooperate again

150
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
In this film, a role has here.

151
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,993
I think we all are very glad.

152
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Do I think whether
you want to say something?

153
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What views do you have to this film?

154
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We should make do
you think how develop film?

155
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,993
This film needs a great director.

156
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,993
Right, do you hear
what this great director has said?

157
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This of the stories
will not have been all finished yet

158
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So our everybody needs to do better.

159
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The work of the completion that in
this way we could be very good.

160
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We could do well.

161
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This film will cause the sensation.

162
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,993
I think this film will be the good
chance that we become famous.

163
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you want to say something?

164
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let us make it well.

165
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It is sure to be very successful.

166
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I have never heard in this way.

167
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,993
I have only heard:
Open the Champagne to celebrate.

168
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Whom we welcomed
will be German Burke this evening

169
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Martha, know how should my hairdo be made?

170
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Plan to begin.

171
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
5,4,3,2,1

172
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Mum, have you imprisoned your daughter?

173
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Buddhist nun can, but the news which
you want to perform cause the blockbuster.

174
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And work with German.

175
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,993
Can you stand his joking for a long time?

176
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Can you stand his harassing
and wrecking for a long time?

177
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, Mei Li

178
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,993
I am very glad to cooperate with
such a professional performer.

179
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,993
Yes. Very professional.

180
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,993
So, German, our small white face.

181
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,993
Do you make adequate preparations?

182
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let me feel an shocked one is:

183
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,993
Unexpectedly Mei Li has
not said the excessive words.

184
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Don't be nervous.

185
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But what I wanted to say is:

186
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Mei Li has a pair of big beautiful eyes.

187
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,993
She can see all truth clearly.

188
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
On one hand this, on the other hand that.

189
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In think absolutely clearly
on one hand while being every

190
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Next week " The plum jasmine takes off the
weakness " Will make an appointment with you

191
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Auliffe in California

192
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
See star's truth of the factory

193
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Fond dream, star's factory.

194
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
His mother is some things

195
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I meet so.

196
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
How is this program famous? Dog's dung

197
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I am so angry as to turn off the TV.

198
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Have you heard Mei Li saying anything?

199
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I do not know

200
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,991
Excellent.

201
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So, this should be offered, clear?

202
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There is no reason to lack.

203
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because his husband is very serious.

204
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Capable turnover

205
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He knows what has happened

206
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Is it groundless not to matter

207
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This story is special.

208
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,991
I want to remind you

209
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
When being very
together with this Buddhist nun,

210
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Must manage your pants well

211
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What ravings are you saying?

212
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
She is very lovely. Very lively too.

213
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Extremely excellent! Too great!

214
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Do we sleep in this way today?

215
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,993
You should think about it

216
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
- A beautiful night. - Good night

217
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The friends meet again

218
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Will get in touch again tomorrow

219
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
OK.

220
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Good-bye.

221
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,991
We left.

222
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How do you do

223
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,993
How do you do
Mrs. Grace, come in, please.

224
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Blue sky of tomorrow.

225
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,991
Very much beauty.

226
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
All very customized.

227
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,993
I could hardly believe.

228
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,989
Is this our film studio?

229
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But has not finished yet.

230
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The role's family in the drama

231
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,993
The role in the drama, certainly.

232
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What brings our protagonist here.

233
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Still sit around the desk like a pair of lovers.

234
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We just boiled their promises of a card cloth

235
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Will boil the most excellent its
promise of card cloth in German.

236
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you want to have a cup?

237
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Thanks, but we just drank a cup of tea.

238
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,993
To don't be put on the operating
room any furniture afterwards.

239
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,993
Function and describing word
as the same one of the furniture.

240
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This is to fix up this family that we come

241
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
In order to ready
for shooting of several scenes.

242
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Should not allow anyone to come in

243
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Prevent someone from letting out the story

244
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The drama is written in this way.

245
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
We write in this way. For example:

246
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,991
35th

247
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,993
German guides the play of home in wheat A

248
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He finds the Buddhist nun
can stand at edge of the window.

249
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, it is that play.

250
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes, quite right.

251
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You had better read,

252
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Then we can try putting the mirror

253
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We can also take some
stage photos to the media today.

254
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Do we plan to strike like this now?

255
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes, very right.

256
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,991
OK.

257
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We can rehearse 57 pages of contents.

258
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Buddhist nun can
look, like ours being different

259
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We will put all this
film once from Oscar to Berlin.

260
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,993
Thank German, let's begin. Come.

261
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,993
I have not expected that this will come.

262
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, I can imagine.

263
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
In addition, you why...?

264
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What?

265
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,993
What do you want?

266
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I told you last night
what I wanted. You know

267
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,991
Yes.

268
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I want to apologize with you.

269
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,993
- Is it necessary for you to apologize?
- Yes.

270
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Have not you told the truth?

271
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have not said this.

272
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,993
What is that truth of the matter?

273
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,991
You are crying.

274
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,991
Eh.

275
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,991
Yes.

276
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,993
Are you still thinking of last night's thing?

277
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,991
How about you?

278
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Why did you cry?

279
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I am very sad, Pele.

280
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I am very sad.

281
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,991
What sad?

282
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,993
Oh. Damnable.

283
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
See this room.

284
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What is that?

285
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Freddy!

286
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,993
It seems that someone is in that

287
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,993
We in the film studio.

288
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,991
I go to have a look.

289
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Who is in that?

290
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,993
Very inconceivable
that person has disappeared.

291
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Perhaps we should have a talk.

292
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We should talk
about some essential things.

293
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
What?

294
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What is that?

295
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,991
You sit down first.

296
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Dish, prophet of Freddy.

297
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You have abundant
emotion and experience.

298
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let Freddy speak while being following.

299
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,993
It is not very apt
to find the suitable person.

300
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Freddy can always think
of any question thoughtfully.

301
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Offer more information for our work

302
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Information is a key thing.

303
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Because we need
to depend on all channels

304
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,993
Broker, producer's friend

305
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Because some will help you

306
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,993
Others are not known

307
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I do not understand the policy, hm,

308
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Fear a bit

309
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So?

310
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,993
I hope I can finish the whole story.

311
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,993
Then what is the
key which you want to say?

312
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Our nightmare is after we finish

313
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But demanded to make again.

314
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,991
Make again?

315
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I have never heard of making again yet

316
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,993
Not, certainly. You may
not understand to this very much

317
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Quite a lot original are unable to finish

318
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Freddy has listened to
the suggestion of our producer

319
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,993
So he can transmit
and give us much information

320
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Have understood?

321
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You two know it will be better in these.

322
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Clear?

323
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, not at all

324
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
No one has told me these

325
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No. I do not understand very much either.

326
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You mean the story needs to be original?

327
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,991
Yes.

328
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The film does not have final result

329
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Called what you understand
there is not final result?

330
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,993
I do not understand very much
why not have final result

331
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,993
We can make the story more interesting

332
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,993
Can also let audiences
produce guessing to the story.

333
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Excuse me, what meaning is this?

334
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,993
Your role will be murdered.

335
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The theme is about vagrant Gipsies.

336
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The name of German is (German)

337
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,991
Four times seven

338
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,993
It is said this figure can bring luckily

339
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,993
This is its value

340
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,991
What?

341
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Have not you understood what I say?

342
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I do not know the language that you say

343
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, will not you say Polish?

344
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No

345
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,991
Half the...

346
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think she knows some other languages

347
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,991
But I will not say

348
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,991
Sit down, please

349
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,993
Then, how is the thing?

350
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I is it pass by to faint, then on so

351
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,991
Fall in a swoon?

352
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,991
I take...

353
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,991
I want...

354
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I will kill someone

355
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,993
Oh, who do you want to kill?

356
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,991
I do not know

357
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,993
Who let you fall in a swoon?

358
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,993
If can go there again, I can remember

359
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The environment
was very black at that time.

360
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,993
Then there is a hand

361
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Then he says: " I...

362
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,993
"I can know your doubt"

363
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,991
How you kill

364
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,993
Use and snipe rifles

365
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,991
Your wife

366
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,993
Eh. We have grown
up together since childhood

367
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,991
While as a child?

368
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,993
Can be with mattering as a child now

369
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,993
Have you heard what they said?

370
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Why did you do so?

371
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What have I done?

372
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,993
No longer play together.

373
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I have a husband,

374
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,993
Your wife, the child

375
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,993
You are like this now in why

376
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because I have
not seen you for a long time

377
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,991
What?

378
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,993
Why I can't say clearly either

379
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,993
I have never
too tried doing anything such

380
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,991
Are you hearing?

381
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,991
Is not it true?

382
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,993
It is essential to do it in this way, Billy

383
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,993
Will only cast
doubt on our future day so.

384
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,991
Stop, stop.

385
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It is very good.

386
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,991
We continue

387
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You feel all right?

388
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I feel it very well.

389
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We should have a rest for a moment

390
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,993
How do you think?

391
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Return, OK?

392
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Everything is good, thank Freddy.

393
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,991
It is very happy.

394
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,993
Very happy, it is this word.

395
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,993
Are you happy? Freddy

396
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The happiness
does not lie in appearance.

397
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,993
Appearance is only a kind of possibility

398
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I raise dogs

399
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I love them
Do you think I will like animals?

400
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They are loyal and clever and vigorous

401
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like young people

402
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,993
I have solved
a lot of problems seeing dogs

403
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But I am very ugly their mood happen.

404
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Can't understand?

405
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,993
When you can go to my home to visit.

406
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,991
Thanks

407
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I know you have a lonely heart

408
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Often with last night like that,

409
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,993
Alone.

410
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The nieces of ten
thousand towers of Buddhist nuns?

411
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yes, when do we begin?

412
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Four times seven
four times seven is lucky figures

413
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,993
Lucky figure that
this foreign language is read out.

414
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,993
Who plays the role of another role

415
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,991
Skin Drake

416
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Where have the gloves all gone?

417
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,993
I am very sorry, your
husband and Mr. Breck bring them up.

418
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,991
All right

419
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I continue talking about the thing just now.

420
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No one will hear.

421
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I am not very sure, do you know?

422
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You can totally rest assured

423
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,993
Let's go to the adjacent place
You will not have anything that regret

424
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What do you want to say?

425
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It is certain to
think in the heart remaining silent

426
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,993
Thing which you are doing the whole night.

427
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I talk about other things now.

428
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I am very serious

429
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,993
Especially on the thing that I speak to you

430
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
My wife is not a free woman.

431
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It is unable to
understand that I have a thing

432
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It is the idea to her

433
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Promise me. You will not tell others.

434
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Especially on this thing

435
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,993
For us, for you

436
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,993
For our victory

437
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Every kind of situation of my wife

438
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
All keys

439
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,993
Have you understood?

440
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Every action which we connect

441
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Have influence on the next action

442
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Must not make mistakes

443
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,991
Implement tightly

444
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,991
Can't make mistakes

445
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,993
This is what I will say to you.

446
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,993
OK. Can you hear above?

447
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
- Is he here? - Yes, he is here.

448
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I think it is not
still the best position on the 2nd

449
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I want to let you move half a meter more

450
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You know that seem better for me like this

451
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
In addition...

452
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
...The head, I have
already moved half a meter.

453
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Do I need to be a bit lower?

454
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,993
Yes. Best lower half a meter

455
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,991
How much lower?

456
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes. It is a bit lower, it is a bit lower.

457
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It is enough for you to get...
- How much should that be low?

458
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
About 30 centimeters.

459
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Can't reach.

460
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,993
Half, then otherwise 30 centimeters

461
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,991
In order to

462
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
What?

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The head, I have received.

464
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Barker, half a meter is enough
Have understood?

465
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Where?

466
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
No, Barker. Upward some.

467
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I just want half a meter
come down half a meter.

468
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I have known. I have known.

469
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
How much time did you wasted

470
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Your wife's telephone

471
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,991
OK.

472
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Having thanked, Barker

473
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I do not have other persons.

474
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You can rest assured.

475
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,993
We spend the time for a moment, OK?

476
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But who?

477
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I think I feel very strange.

478
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yes, I agree. But...

479
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I do not think what this has

480
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,991
There is not the film

481
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
There is not the film. We have
a rest and put and drink a cup of coffee.

482
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,991
OK.

483
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The brothers open the door, OK?

484
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let the sunshine come in for a moment.

485
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
All right. Begin 5 minutes later.

486
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Ready? Have five minutes.

487
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,993
Please be ready
Don't meet with an accident.

488
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Billy, I have left.

489
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
If have nothing.

490
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Only want to give regards to you.

491
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,991
Like this?

492
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Do you drink one more cup if having time?

493
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,993
No. I must walk at once.

494
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh. Or lend at once?

495
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh. Follow my original meaning.

496
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,993
Should I laugh?

497
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What have you done?

498
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
What have you done in the gymnasium?

499
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,991
Fitness.

500
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That is exactly what you should do.

501
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,991
Good-bye.

502
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,993
Oh. Stay and have a drink.

503
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You have listened to me begging like this.

504
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,993
Oh. Little pitiful man.

505
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,991
A cup?

506
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,993
Oh, go to hell.

507
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,993
Do you also want other things?

508
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No, thanks

509
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,991
Please use.

510
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Would you like to stay
and have supper altogether?

511
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,991
Maybe.

512
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I think you should stay

513
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,991
What do you say?

514
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,991
I have said

515
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,993
A fellow with a glib tongue

516
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,991
Will really entice people

517
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,993
The wives children are all hearing

518
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,993
What you said is too much.

519
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,993
I am very sorry, the treasure

520
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,993
I am wholehearted.

521
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,993
It is wholehearted not to matter, Billy

522
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Stop

523
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,993
We have shut down.

524
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,991
OK?

525
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Seeing this, there is not any light.

526
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
When Billy is seeing, you say you know.

527
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,991
Have understood?

528
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,991
Every part is prepared

529
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Draw it more?

530
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Greece. It is Greece.

531
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The brothers all get ready to begin.

532
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The machines all start the machine.

533
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We continue striking.

534
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I leave alone
Anyway machines are all ready.

535
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,993
Every member takes one's place.

536
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,993
Thanks
I know I am cold as ice and frost

537
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,993
Just like last night

538
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
German, thanks.

539
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,991
It doesn't matter.

540
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,993
This is what you want.

541
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
- Are you ready?
- Yes, ready.

542
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
- OK. - It is all right for
you to want to at any time begin

543
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Is there coffee?

544
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yes, coffee has come

545
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,991
Taking

546
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,993
Let's eat something
with me after finishing today.

547
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,993
I know that a place is very good

548
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,991
Pretty good.

549
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Do it very excellently.

550
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Then let's go.

551
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,993
How do you know that?

552
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Have got ready. Madam

553
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,993
Wait for three minutes.

554
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,993
The price is reasonable too.

555
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,991
Every good luck

556
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,991
At the beginning

557
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,991
Billy

558
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,993
Is this what you want?

559
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,993
I do not think of and such you

560
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,991
Stop!

561
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,993
Do you also want to strike?

562
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What's the matter?

563
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,991
I do not know

564
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,991
Tell me

565
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,991
What's the matter?

566
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Some things are unnatural

567
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I think my husband has known you

568
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,993
Have known our thing.

569
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Want to kill you, want to kill me.

570
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,991
He...

571
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
My God

572
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
This dialogue is too frightful

573
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,991
Stop. Stop

574
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,991
What's the matter?

575
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
What?

576
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,993
What happened?

577
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
The truth that we know is very correct.

578
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But there is not a final result forever

579
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Now, continue telling that story.

580
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But stories are full of stories.

581
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Express gratitude to God

582
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
In this case.

583
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
The story has
already been imagined concealing

584
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,993
We are like this everyday

585
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
We want to mix the
spurious with the genuine, you see?

586
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,993
So you should enable
the Buddhist nun to take it seriously

587
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
This is false as to me.

588
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,991
German

589
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,993
This will not influence this film at all.

590
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,991
Hearing.

591
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I am really very glad that you can come

592
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Just a moment, wait a mement

593
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,991
Oh. My God

594
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I cannot but speak.

595
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I am too nervous.

596
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,991
What?

597
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,991
Come slowly

598
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,991
Seeing me

599
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You must remember

600
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,991
Must remember this evening

601
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Remember
what does it take place this evening

602
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You should remember

603
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,991
I know.

604
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,993
Everything of remembering tonight

605
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
There are
stories that happened last night

606
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And I know tomorrow's.

607
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
This is unnatural

608
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That scene

609
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That scene which we patted last night

610
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Have spoken of the price of dinner

611
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Have also explained other things

612
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,991
Have also talked about total value

613
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,993
What? What are you saying?

614
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That play which we made last night

615
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,991
Are not you here?

616
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
We have discussed a lot of things

617
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We have also
said where to want to have a meal

618
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Do you understand my meaning?

619
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Why a face doubt of yours?

620
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,993
What's the matter?
Can not you remember?

621
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,993
Have all forgotten?

622
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The one head blank?

623
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,993
It can be like
this how I do not understand

624
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
German, I am Buddhist nun can

625
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You look unnatural

626
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
What happened?

627
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Me.

628
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
German, me, Buddhist nun can.

629
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,993
Answer I, he of mother.

630
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Ask you. Ask you

631
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Ask you to hold me tightly.

632
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,991
Seeing me

633
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,991
Have asked you.

634
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,991
That room

635
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What?

636
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Freddy!

637
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,991
No, this someones

638
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,993
There should be we in the film studio

639
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,991
I go to have a look

640
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,991
- Sorry. - It's nothing

641
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,991
Billy!

642
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Billy!

643
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,991
Billy!

644
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,991
Billy!

645
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,991
Billy!

646
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,991
Billy!

647
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,991
Billy!

648
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,991
Who are you?

649
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Hey

650
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,993
You think about it
We but knew in the past.

651
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
There are no men here.

652
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,991
I know you.

653
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,993
I think her thigh very attractive to us

654
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Have done this?

655
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Can that let you forget
the thing of everything?

656
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,993
And you are here now.

657
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,991
Excellent.

658
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,991
Yes.

659
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Let us begin.

660
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,993
Let's begin to do some things.

661
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,991
Very strange?

662
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,991
What are done?

663
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,993
So strange?

664
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,991
Come slowly

665
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,994
You think you are dreaming
Then how sleeping are you?

666
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,993
When to open eyes?

667
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,993
Do you still remember family?

668
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,991
This is the street.

669
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,993
Do you want to see?

670
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,993
Let us go to the bottom.

671
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Outside

672
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,991
See

673
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Very beautiful

674
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,991
I know

675
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,993
Let's order a cigarette for me.

676
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,991
A cigarette

677
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,993
Please have a cigarette.

678
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Your idea

679
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,992
Have spread into my heart

680
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,991
Breakfast!

681
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I do not want to talk about
other things. I have only a question

682
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,993
Why do you want to ask this?
You can do, not correctly?

683
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
No, you can do everything

684
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh... I am now

685
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,991
You are always like this

686
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,993
You can lie to me, should not lie
to yourself. You are very clever.

687
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
- Don't push me
- I should push you in the hell.

688
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,991
Don't move.

689
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I can't give the son to you, I know

690
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
- Are you listening to me? - I have left

691
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,993
It is such that I am not that you thought
I will not allow what you did in this way.

692
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,991
Never!

693
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,991
Never!

694
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
- Excuse me
what time, please? - 45 past 9

695
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,991
Thanks

696
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,993
I do not know I do here

697
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,993
I think me very tired.

698
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,993
I hope you can give me some help

699
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,993
My imagination and reality
seem to begin to obscure.

700
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,993
Hope you can let me free

701
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,991
There is a man

702
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
He has been already in that for a long time.

703
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,991
I...

704
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,993
Let anything be unimportant.

705
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,993
A lot of people have changed.

706
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The ones that have
not changed have included me

707
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,993
With the change of time
everything comes to light.

708
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,993
Do you understand what I said?

709
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
This is an old story

710
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,991
Very old.

711
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,993
Perhaps you have heard too.

712
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You can think about it at this meeting?

713
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,993
Suffering I all the time

714
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,993
Have you been cheated?

715
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,993
Some things
that you do not understand

716
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,993
Do you know how many years that is?

717
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Have lived with a
man for 15 years totally

718
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,993
But he often goes out with others.

719
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I can only do blindly

720
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,993
This is my idea.

721
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You are just like a child

722
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,993
Real his mother
of this man of yours is a wretch

723
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Will only open eyes

724
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,993
But does not listen
attentively to others' telling

725
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Your real picture.

726
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Do not do proper business

727
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You have a look, you listen to

728
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,993
Like a piglet

729
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,993
People have all lost the raised angle

730
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It is angry not to have at all

731
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,991
That is a nightmare

732
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
His mother
does some anything everyday

733
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So do I

734
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Do not know every day what is done

735
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
They speak

736
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,993
His mother is anything

737
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,991
Damnable.

738
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,993
You two had better be seated

739
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,993
Am not I very good?

740
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,993
I feel sorry to this voice

741
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,993
His mother's anything

742
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,991
Anything

743
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
No?

744
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Can you win?

745
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,991
Not right?

746
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
A lot of things should know.

747
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Find some things.

748
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,991
It is not easy

749
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,991
Oh. Treasure

750
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
You will go this evening

751
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Yes. Great this evening

752
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Will be hopeful every day

753
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,991
Thanks

754
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
She has smiled.

755
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,991
Forced smile

756
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,993
This one. Like the mushroom?

757
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Eh. Very beautiful
Let me see

758
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,991
Congratulations

759
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Like flower

760
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,991
Thanks

761
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Our money is little

762
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,993
We were not originally rich

763
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,993
Who can give us money?

764
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,993
No one will be so kind

765
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,993
I am waiting for a son

766
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,991
Excellent

767
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,991
I want a son

768
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,993
What meaning is that?

769
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,991
I am uncomfortable

770
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,993
Are you waiting for a son?

771
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
What's wrong?

772
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,993
Some can't
have a son while preventing me

773
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,993
I am only a little shocked

774
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,991
Hello?

775
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,991
Hello?

776
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,991
Billy

777
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,993
I have fallen into the illusion again

778
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,993
I have seen another man this time

779
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I came back home

780
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,993
Live with him

781
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,993
He is unwilling we wait together

782
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Wait for the new life at home

783
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It makes us decorate with colored
silk festoons on one's head to quarrel.

784
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I have opened that damnable door

785
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,993
I see that there is a cape on the chair

786
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
He has taken

787
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I have already got married.

788
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,991
There are families

789
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
This is damnable

790
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,991
Too disappointing.

791
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
A piece of sheer wastes.

792
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Crushing that he made the glass

793
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Have destroyed the whole family basically

794
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,993
I can't prevent him at all

795
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I helplessly look at the damnable one.

796
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,991
Damn it

797
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I really want to kick
several feet of his ruthlessly

798
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,993
Play so that he can't
associate with other women again

799
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,993
Play the wretch can
make love with other women again

800
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,993
Such a man really exists?

801
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,993
I have known several men. But such none

802
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
There are two still very lovely ones.

803
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
They are extremely pleasant in bed

804
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,993
Let you know what is happy

805
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,993
Then will also ask whether
you need to drink a glass of water

806
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It is with them and really happy

807
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,993
There is a factory

808
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,993
The girls all work there

809
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
There is such factory in this city

810
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,993
A special place

811
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,993
Production place of all gloves

812
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Strange taste fills
the air constantly in the air.

813
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,993
People are doing the strange thing

814
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,993
You may see too.

815
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,993
Have a girl second-classly

816
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Rich people happen seeing the thing

817
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,991
Anything happens

818
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
All people around

819
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,993
But leave the thing to happen

820
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,993
You will feel it
was doomsday at that time

821
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
All fire, pain, blood.

822
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,993
The morals were just said in the mouth

823
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,993
Spirit is wounded seriously

824
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,993
Hey, look at me.

825
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,993
Whether we have met

826
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,993
Yes, yes, we have met

827
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,991
Where is paper?

828
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,993
Only link jasmine Asia in?

829
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,993
Go far. Dream of this crime

830
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,993
Who has occupied my heart

831
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,991
Who is that?

832
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,991
Who is that?

833
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,993
I almost recognize you

834
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,993
You let me fear very much

835
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,993
It is really a little
strange to run into you in the street

836
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,991
You are very uneasy

837
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,991
Is it?

838
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Do you think like this?

839
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,993
- No, I only think a person... - Not be such?

840
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,993
But you have uneasy mood

841
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,993
I do not believe
you have not recognized me

842
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,993
Realize my style?

843
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,993
- You are different
to some extent. - You are too

844
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,993
Usually we meet each other at
the our home, but not in the street
