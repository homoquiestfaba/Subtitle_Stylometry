I'm gonna make filet mignon outta you!

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,565
- Those are dairy cows, Corporal.

36
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,998
- I can see that, Private.

37
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,223
- Well, you can't get a filet mignon

38
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:42,761
from a dairy cow, Corporal.

00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:07,512
- Yep, take it to the bank.

42

Got milk, anyway? (pilot laughs)

43
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,040

Okay, it's on the rocks.

48
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,557
Okay, you're right, it's dead.

49
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,677
It's dead, but I've got so many ideas!

50
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,032
Actually, you can't do that.

51
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,500
See, if you stop sending me supplies I can't pay you

52
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:04,143
for the supplies that you've already sent.

61
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,734
Nothing, just the clothes on Jimmy Woo's back.

62
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,896
Now Jimmy Woo's got it all!

63
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:26,148

00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:27,921
Harry, I've got three phone numbers

65
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:29,381

66
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,988
Please call me we're having trouble with the supplier.

67
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:33,171
Thanks.

00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:35,570
God, am I the only one working?

69
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,063
Okay, honey, we gotta go.

70
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:41,166
- [Jimmy Woo] You ladies ready for a martini?

71
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,809
- So, have you thought about what

72
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,407
you wanted to do this weekend?

73
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,528
- Yeah, how about we unpack you?

74
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,092
- What, already?

75
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:53,299
- Dad, that's not funny, it's been six months.

76
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,722
So, um, what's the deal with you and Mom?

77
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,747
- We're separated, what do you mean?

78
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:06,301
- Well, you're not gonna get back together, are you?

79
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,943
- I don't know it's not that simple, we just--

80
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:11,411
- So are you allowed to sleep with other people?

81
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,401
- Ashley, I'm not gonna talk about that with you.

82
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:17,251
Why, is your mother-- - Bye, Dad.

83
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,589
(school bell ringing)

84
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,230
- Wait, wait, why, is your mother--

85
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:24,169
- Bye, Dad!

86
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,422
- Okay.

87
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,367
Hey, Ashley, one more thing.

88
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:29,106
- Dad, you're driving me crazy.

89
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,184
I am leaving now.

90
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,095
- Alright, well, I just wanted to say that--

91
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,860
(crashing)

92
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:38,353
(airbag hissing) (yelling)

93
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,565
- Marion, I've been calling all morning

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,763

95
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:52,259

Hey, Hector.

99
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,891
So?

100
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,767
- Phone company said they never received payment,

101
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,062
but I just bought us another couple of weeks.

102
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,591
- Whew, how'd you do that?

103
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,912
- I cried.

104
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,234
- Yeah.

105
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,625
- Okay, Mr. Steve, that should do it.

106
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,301
- Hey, Hector don't you have that meeting with Compaq?

107
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:13,568
- Your circuit board it got loose.

108
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,593
- Oh, well, thank you, but I told you I can't pay you.

109
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,470
- No, no, no, no charge.

110
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,930
You've been really good to me.

111
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,634
- I don't want you to go, it's just,

112
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,859
they can actually give you money. (laughs)

113
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,223
- (laughs) Also, about my download pre-emptor.

114
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,273
- Yeah, oh, you're what?

115
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,664
- Download pre-emptor.

116
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,951
- Oh, your invention!

117
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,627
Yeah, um, can I offer a little advice?

118
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,053
Hector, I'd wait.

119
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,652
I'd play it safe, get the job,

120
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,676
don't mention it and then mention it later.

121
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,623
- Thanks for your advice, Mr. Steve.

122
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,848
- Yeah, you're welcome.

123
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,941

00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:49,063
Thanks, Hector, thank you.

125
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,844
Okay, you better make your meeting.

00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,096
- Thank you.

127
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,232
- Can you call triple A?

128
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,345
I had a fender bender.

129
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,700
- Oh, sure thing.

130
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,725
Oh, I forgot to tell you, we are out of plastic.

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,671
- Anything else you can use?

132
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,271
Any other silver linings?

133
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:07,175
- No.

134
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,790
(tube bubbling)

135
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,320
- Hello, Steven.

136
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,154
- Hey, Wild Bill.

137
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,032
What are you working on?

138
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,526
- Oh, not sure.

139
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:20,107
- Keep up the good work.

140
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,011
- Okay.

141
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:26,016
(sighing)

142
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,675
- Oh, um, any messages?

143
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,343
- Well, let me see.

144
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,724
No.

145
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,628
- Oh.

146
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,530
(exhaling)

147
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,348
- [Computer] You have no new email.

148
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,389
- [Steve Voiceover] You're right,

149
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,163
the deal with the Army, it's uncertain.

150
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:03,422
Okay, you're right, it's dead, it's dead.

151
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:05,405
Am I the only one working? (heart beating)

152
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,108
- [Marion Voiceover] We are out of plastic.

153
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,499
- [Steve Voiceover] I can't pay you.

154
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,237

155
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,488

156
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:12,461
- [Ashley Voiceover] Are you allowed

157
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,026

158
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:16,842
(tense music)

159
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:19,935
(intercom beeping)

160
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:20,944
- [Marian] Don't forget you have

00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,446
And you're late.

163
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:24,767
I got a taxi for you.

164
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:26,367

165
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:35,753

183
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,067
and we assume the control of the market share

184
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,675
your company has over bovine fertility

185
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:58,630
then the final piece of that puzzle will be in place.

186
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,890
This is a very good deal for all.

187
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,838
- Unless, of course, you're June Cleaver

188
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,749
worrying about the price of milk.

189
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:06,487
(all chuckling softly)

190
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:09,025
- I'd like everyone to hear from my head of legal.

191
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,033
- Thank you, Gordon.

192
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,563
This is a very substantial deal,

193
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,509
one that will likely attract a lot of attention

194
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:15,560
and perhaps even raise a few eyebrows.

195
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,821
But the fact of the matter is,

196
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,906
there's no denying that whoever controls

197
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,782
the technology controls the industry

198
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,521
and as fertility indicators go,

199
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:26,477
well, AFI's the only game in town.

200
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:38,574
(lively jazz music)

201
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,418
- [Steve] Samantha Hardy?

202
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:56,755
- You're late. - Sorry, my car died.

203
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:59,920
I've never hired a business pro before.

204
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,345
How would this work?

205
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,735
- That depends.

206
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,646
Look, I only have a few minutes here.

207
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,177
I've reviewed everything you sent me.

208
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,062
So why don't you tell me about these light sticks?

209
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,704
- Okay, um, not much to tell, really.

210
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,520
You bend a plastic tube and the chemicals mix

211
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,571
and voila, light.

212
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:18,482
- But do you have a patent?

213
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:21,195
- Yeah, all the partners share in it, but yeah, we do.

214
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:22,829
- So all those little glow things

215
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,740
at Disneyland, they're yours?

216
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:28,947
- Actually, we sold the rights for that use a few years ago.

217
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,233
- That was stupid.

218
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:31,484
- Thank you.

219
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,187
- Alright, look here's how I see it.

220
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:34,474
If you can't fix it, sell it.

221
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,178
Normally buyers look at several things.

222
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:39,133
First, there's EBIT, that's profit, you don't have any.

223
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,044
Then there's earn out, that's potential,

224
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,470
and you don't have any of that either.

225
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,973
And then they look at cost to earnings ratio and--

226
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,225
- Wait, don't tell me.

227
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,893
I don't have any of that either?

228
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:48,763
- Bingo!

229
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:49,910
But, you're lucky.

230
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:52,344
You come to me, things happen, that's why I get my 5%.

231
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,908
So, what do you say?

232
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:54,950
- Well, I don't know.

233
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,740
I mean, I have to talk to the other partners.

234
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,486
- What are you, the class safety monitor?

235
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,328
Come on, take charge.

236
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:06,597
It's a slam dunk, no sale, no fee.

237
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,126
- I just, uh...

238
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,646
- Look, I know I'm putting a lot in front of you right now.

239
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,400
And if you're afraid to make a move I understand.

240
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:20,015
But, if you want something sometimes

241
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,735
you just have to reach out and grab it.

242
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:27,559
(tinkling)

243
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:30,443
(Steve exhaling)

244
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,434
Well, gee, this was fun.

245
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,466
So, we have a deal.

246
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:41,465
- Oh.

247
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,775
(water splashing)

248
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,653
- [Radio DJ] You're listening to 102.4

249
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,808
and that was your afternoon business report.

250
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,684
Up next, news, weather and traffic.

251
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,840
Right after a word from our sponsor.

252
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,196
- [Jimmy] Hi, Jimmy Woo here,

253
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,726
unassuming Asian self-made millionaire.

254
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,638
- [Steve Voiceover] I have to talk to the other partners.

255
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,967
- [Samantha Voiceover ] It's a slam dunk, no sale, no fee.

256
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:02,566
Profit.

257
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,061
- [Steve Voiceover] Don't tell me, I don't have any of that.

258
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,139
- And look at me now.

259
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,016
And look at you.

260
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,511
Oh, man!

261
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:10,318
You don't look so good, Steve!

262
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,569
(gasping)

263
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:13,169
Let me ask you a question, my friend.

264
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:16,437
Where are you gonna be when your ship comes in, huh?

265
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:17,966
At the train station?

266
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,635
Don't miss your boat, Stevie.

267
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,277
(laughs)

268
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,224
- That should do it.

269
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:29,403
That last one is the Letter of Intent.

270
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,332
And Mr. Montgomery, we shall proceed

271
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,792
with our due diligence and look forward

272
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:37,122
to seeing you in 45 days when escrow closes.

273
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:40,667
- Until then, J.T., no funny business.

274
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,475
No money in, no money out.

275
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,422
Bear in mind that this letter permits us

276
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,542
to take a walk if anything should change.

277
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,384
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

278
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,748
- If anyone got wind of a takeover,

279
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,974
if anything strange were to happen such as,

280
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,416
let's say, your stock price were to shoot up,

281
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,293
that would really vex me.

282
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,448
- And you don't want to vex him.

283
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,699
- No vex.

284
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,584
Come on, Lu.

285
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,010
Luis, it's me!

286
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:12,477
- I look forward to welcoming you all into the family.

287
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,405
- Because isn't family what it's all about?

288
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,889
- Marion, any sign of Harry?

289
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:25,999
Okay, well if you do, ask him to call me.

290
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,588
Wait, uh, I gotta be at Nora's at four to pick up Ashley.

291
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:31,978
What time is it?

292
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,238
Oh, my God, I got 10 minutes, I promised her.

293
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:37,297
Okay, yeah, alright, thanks, bye.

294
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,080
(playful music)

295
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,486
Oh, come on!

296
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,004
(groaning)

297
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,127
- What the hell, Louise?

298
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,100
That's bullshit!

299
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,568
Bullshit, that's bullshit!

300
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:09,663
What, alright, alright, okay, let's calm down.

301
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:11,193
So what do I get?

302
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:14,251
Oh, oh, I get to keep my share of the business?

303
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,711
Thank you very frickin' much!

304
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,971
I'm the one who started this whole business!

305
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:18,876
(telephone ringing)

306
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,744
Shut up!

307
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,961
Please hold.

308
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,081
Yeah? - Harry, Harry, is that you?

309
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,611
- I can't talk right now.

310
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,010
- Where have you been, did you order the plastic?

311
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:28,018
- Oh, the plastic.

312
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,339
Well, gee, Steve, let me think.

313
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:31,008
I've got a lot of things going on today.

314
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,164
Like, my wife is leaving me and my whole life

315
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,180
is being turned upside-down, thank you very much!

316
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:36,605
- When did that happen? (telephone ringing)

317
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,761
- It's happening right now, please hold.

318
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,089
- Harry, it's me, Jonas.

319
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,792
- I can't talk to you right now, Jonas.

320
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,009
Louise is leaving me.

321
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,887
- Yes, I know, that's why I'm calling.

322
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,790
- Hang on! (telephone ringing)

323
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:47,833
Louise?

324
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:48,703
Listen to me.

325
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:49,572
What?

326
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,267
Screw you!

327
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,518
Please hold.

328
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,943
- Harry, you can't talk with her.

329
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,160
She's got representation.

330
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,003
- Oh, I can't talk to my own wife, can't I?

331
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:57,602
- Well, you can't negotiate with her.

332
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,375
I'm gonna negotiate with her counsel.

333
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,696
- Is that how it works?

334
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,156
I can't talk to my own freakin' wife?

335
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,895
What kind of state do we live in?

336
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,458
(telephone ringing) Please hold.

337
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,475
Louise, that was Jonas and he says I can't talk to you.

338
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,275
Screw Jonas! - It's me!

339
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:10,083
What do you mean, screw Jonas?

340
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,925
- Never mind, she ain't gettin' shit!

341
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,532
- Harry, did you order the plastic?

342
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,896
- Let me tell you a little story about the plastic.

343
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:20,512
Once upon a time, screw you and the plastic, too!

344
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,007
- Screw you, Harry!

345
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,032
(bell dinging)

346
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,846
(playful music)

347
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,707
(doorbell ringing)

348
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,480
(knocking)

349
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:48,948
(sighing)

350
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,781
(woman moaning)

351
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,161
- [Steve] Nora?

352
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:05,878
Nora?

353
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,895
Nora, you alright?

354
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,112
(gasping)

355
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,502
- Who the hell are you?

356
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:13,214
- She's my wife and that, I believe, is my four iron!

357
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,612
- Oh, my God, Steve, what the hell are you?

358
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:16,690
Oh, my God!

359
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:17,976
Tom, it's okay.

360
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,827
I'll be, just give me one second, okay?

361
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:22,427
What are you doing here?

362
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,965
- I'm supposed to pick up Ashley.

363
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,640
- Oh, really, is she in the bushes?

364
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,761
- I rang the doorbell, nobody answered.

365
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:32,299
- Okay, well, your daughter was sitting here waiting for you

366
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,863
and when you didn't show up she went

367
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,740
to spend the night at her friend Rachel's house.

368
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:37,548
- My car broke down.

369
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,801
Who's he?

370
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,555
- That's Tom, he's new in the firm.

371
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,814
- Oh, employee orientation?

372
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,927
(laughs)

373
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,248
- You know what, Steve?

374
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:48,534
I think we're supposed to be moving on here.

375
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,751
So what do you expect?

376
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:52,323
- Well, let's see, um, not this!

377
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,243
- Why don't you come back a little later

378
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:57,364
and we'll just, we'll sit down

379
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:00,179
and we'll have a conversation.

380
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:08,975
(frantic comical music)

381
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,513
(yelling) (horn honking)

382
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:12,903
- [Driver] Get off the road, you idiot!

383
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:13,945
(toy horn squeaking)

384
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,484
- Where'd you learn to drive?

385
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,175
- [Veronica] The perfect ending to a perfect day.

386
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,651
- (laughs) 600 million dollars from the likes of Mr. Gordon.

387
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,737
- Larry, tomorrow morning I want you

388
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,415
to start buying up our shares.

389
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,186
Slowly, carefully.

390
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,829
Small orders.

391
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,776
You know, nothing to raise eyebrows.

392
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,105
- As your lawyer I am obligated to tell you--

393
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,982
- And so you have, counselor.

394
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,860
And so you have.

395
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,954
- J.T., we have a good thing here.

396
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,707
- I want it to be great.

397
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:55,384
Is there something wrong with that?

398
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,236
Hmm, wanting to be great?

399
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,537
- Doesn't that strike you as, I don't know,

400
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:02,650
being just a little bit--

401
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,945
- Just a little bit what?

402
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,266
Oh, come on, say it, Larry.

403
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,247
A little what?

404
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,152
Greedy?

405
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:14,088
Greed, it's just a word, Larry.

406
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:17,252
An ordinary word for ordinary people.

407
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,156
Come here.

408
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,552
Look at them all down there.

409
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,707
Every day it's the same thing.

410
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,958
They get up.

411
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,469
They make their coffee, they get dressed, they go to work.

412
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:35,224
One hour lunch, go home, eat dinner, watch TV,

413
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,527
maybe have a bowl of ice cream.

414
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,996
(sighing)

415
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,097
Ordinary people shuffling around.

416
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,208
Taking only what's given them.

417
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,640
We're not like them, Larry.

418
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:55,074
We are not ordinary.

419
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:55,979
No, sir.

420
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,490
What we are, what we do,

421
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,696
it takes strength, it takes courage.

422
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:08,042
It takes fucking talent.

423
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,612
Go buy those shares, Lar.

424
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:17,428
(tense music)

425
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:34,671
Well, here's to all the ordinary people,

426
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:39,608
without whom there would be no standard of measurement.

427
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:49,966
- Mr. Steve?

428
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,713
- Hector, what are you doing in that thing?

429
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,382
- It's a company car.

430
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,634
- You got the job?

431
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:57,406
- Yeah, I took your advice.

432
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,796
I tried to play it safe.

433
00:21:58,831 --> 00:21:59,979
I didn't say nothing.

434
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:03,212
But the interview ended and I was walking out.

435
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:07,452
Suddenly, something came over me, and then I went for it!

436
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,990
I told them about the download pre-emptor

437
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,485
and they went crazy!

438
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,642
They brought all these people and all these lawyers

439
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:15,170
and they put down some papers

440
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,187
and they offered me six million dollars!

441
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,855
- Six million?

442
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,141
(speaking foreign language)

443
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:23,653
- Please put that in the trunk, Alvin.

444
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:30,571
- Personal assistants?

445
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:34,360
- No, they just have crazy sex with me.

446
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:38,185
Well, thank you, Mr. Steve!

447
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,339
Hey, you the hombre!

448
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,391
I love this country!

449
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:45,798
I can't wait to become a citizen!

450
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:46,841
Adios!

451
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,394
(comical music)

452
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:55,671
(bicycle bell tinkling)

453
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:01,928
(Harry sniffling)

454
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,265
- He got his own Alvin.

455
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:10,932
She said that I've changed.

456
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:14,373
I'm uh,

457
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,511
I'm all closed up.

458
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,664
I don't think that I've changed that much, have I?

459
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,700
- Wow, look at these.

460
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,168
My God.

461
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,027
Look at me back then. (laughs)

462
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,557
Oh, my God! - Wow!

463
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,095
Almost cute. - Yeah, almost.

464
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,945
Oh, look at this.

465
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:56,090
Whatever happened to Mickey Fish?

466
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,133
- Who?

467
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,732
- Class president.

468
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:01,062
Straight A student.

469
00:24:01,096 --> 00:24:04,365
Captain of the baseball team.

470
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,111
This guy could have been anything he wanted.

471
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,223
Probably is.

472
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:10,552
- Reminds me of Louise.

473
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:11,873
Why don't you give the guy a call?

474
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,299
Find out where he's at now.

475
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,323
- He's probably CEO of some big company.

476
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:17,227
- So?

477
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,580
- So, walk in his office, hey, Mick, how you doin'?

478
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:23,623
I'm good, Steve.

479
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,013
How are you?

480
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:29,325
Well Mick, been a long, hard climb to the middle.

481
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,261
- You know, bro, I've been packing up

482
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:36,381
every reference there is to Louise in this office

483
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,510
the last couple hours and I am exhausted.

484
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,987
I think I'm just gonna crash over here.

485
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,583
- God, whatever happened to Mickey Fish?

486
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:53,104
(soft bluesy music)

487
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,217
Harry, we're in trouble.

488
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:11,980
- I know.

489
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:24,946
(banging)

490
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,892
(sniffing)

491
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:39,443
("Thus Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss)

492
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,449
(stick cracking)

493
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:58,320
(cow mooing)

494
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,898
(telephone ringing)

495
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:31,659
- OmniGlow.

496
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,884
- [Herb] Hi there, this is Herb Zissner

497
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:36,282
up here at Zissner Dairy Farms.

498
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:37,429
- Uh, dairy farms?

499
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,611
You got the wrong number.

500
00:26:38,646 --> 00:26:40,767
- [Herb] No, no, no, listen, I think I've

501
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:44,139
come up with an idea for your light sticks.

502
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:45,390
- Okay, hold on.

503
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,553
Harry, it's somebody for our light sticks.

504
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:50,257
Alright, dairy boy, go ahead.

505
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,489
- [Herb] No, you gotta get up here and see this.

506
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,089
- See what?

507
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,662
- [Herb] (laughs) I can't explain it over the phone.

508
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:59,575
It'll sound too strange!

509
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:03,468
You really need to get up here and see it for yourself.

510
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:04,997
- A dairy farm?

511
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:13,862
Where the hell are we?

512
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,225
- I don't know, somewhere near Modesto, I think.

513
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,138
- That's good, here I was depressed

514
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:20,433
all the time thinking we were going to Fresno.

515
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:21,510
(sighing)

516
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:24,674
- Alright, come on, give it a rest.

517
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,628
- Hey, where's the toothless guy with the banjo?

518
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:29,297
(laughs)

519
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:32,148
You got a real purty mouth, boy.

520
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:36,215
- Dear God, I hope we get there fast.

521
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:39,379
(Harry squealing)

522
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:43,029
(upbeat music)

523
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,571
- This farm's been in our family for over 100 years.

524
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,893
- That's amazing.

525
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,734
- Yeah, it's tough these days, though, I tell ya.

526
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:00,237
We just found out feeding supplies are going up again.

527
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:03,992
- The little brown one back there, is she single?

528
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:06,181
- That's just, (laughs) um,

529
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:09,485
so, I still don't see how we fit in to all this.

530
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,579
- Well, the sun's going down.

531
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,846
You'll find out soon enough.

532
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:18,106
- And you guys know where you're taking us, right?

533
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:20,018
- I know exactly where we're taking you.

534
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:24,120
Just relax we'll be there in just a second.

535
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,734
(dramatic music)

536
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:32,637
- Wow!

537
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:39,971
- Son of a bitch!

538
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:48,038
- The dairy industry was worth

539
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:50,401
well over 24 billion dollars last year.

540
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:51,653
- That's a lot of milk.

541
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,939
- Who knew?

542
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:54,190
- Yeah, not one penny of that came

543
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,859
from a cow who wasn't pregnant.

544
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:57,528
- Why's that?

545
00:28:57,563 --> 00:29:01,004
- Biology 101, cow ain't pregnant she ain't producing milk.

546
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,603
- I never thought of it like that.

547
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,863
- [Harry] I never thought about it at all.

548
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:08,201
- [Steve] What the hell is going on?

549
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:11,259
(cows mooing)

550
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:12,233
- What kind of crazy crap

551
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,215
are you good old boys into up here?

552
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,822
- Got your light stick, got your cow.

553
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,873
- You see, it's critical for us

554
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:22,210
to know precisely when a cow goes into heat.

555
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,122
Now once she does, we've only got

556
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:26,765
a very short period of time to inseminate her.

557
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,137
- So you jam a light stick up her ass?

558
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,353
- No, sir.

559
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:32,674
- On her ass!

560
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,185
You see, on a cow's rump there's this

561
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,237
leathery area where she feels nothing.

562
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,696
It's totally numb.

563
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:41,295
You could go in there and pull out

564
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:43,659
a handful of hair, she wouldn't feel a thing.

565
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:44,876
- Where's the fun in that?

566
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:46,963
(laughs)

567
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:48,804
- Go ahead, you wanna try it?

568
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,308
- No, I just washed my hands.

569
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:52,593
- Suit yourself.

570
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:54,507
See, right here on this spot is where we glue

571
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,774
what we call in our industry the fertility indicator.

572
00:29:57,808 --> 00:30:00,695
- Yeah, but instead, that's where we put your light stick.

573
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:04,691
- When a cow comes into heat it attracts another cow.

574
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:06,291
Look over there.

575
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:10,706
- Oh, so the bulls--

576
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:12,027
- We don't got no bulls.

577
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,939
Heck, if we wait around for a bunch

578
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,225
of bulls to bust nut, we go bust.

579
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,581
- Yeah.

580
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,189
- So the females do that to each other?

581
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,170
- Why, you dirty dog.

582
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:23,256
I got that one on DVD.

583
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,168
Prison Heifers! (laughs)

584
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,323
- Actually, there's nothing sexual about it.

585
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,131
You see, when a cow goes into heat

586
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,251
another cow will rise up and mount her,

587
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,545
pressing its chest down onto her rump.

588
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,284
It's called ridin'.

589
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,335
- They made a sequel?

590
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:40,950
(light stick cracking)

591
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:41,959
- And God said,

592
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,142
let there be light! - Let there be light!

593
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,053
Hallelujah! - Yeehaw!

594
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,232
- This is the fertility indicator everybody's using.

595
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,388
- AFI, American Farms International.

596
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:54,266
- Slightly better than nothing at all.

597
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,115
- Real tough to spot during the day, impossible at night.

598
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,236
- But, it's the only thing on the market.

599
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:02,678
- I'm tellin' you, this is a helluva lot better than that.

600
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:06,676
- And AFI sells a gazillion of those.

601
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:08,275
- So what are you guys saying?

602
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,466
- You guys can revolutionize the American

603
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,898
dairy industry with your light stick.

604
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:15,888
- You guys are going to be very, very rich.

605
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:18,149
- You guys are serious?

606
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:19,538
- Yeah.

607
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,173
- But you're talking about competing with this AFI.

608
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,772
This must be a huge company.

609
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,892
- Oh, yeah, one of the biggest.

610
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,770
- Well, they've got financing

611
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,412
and manufacturing and distribution.

612
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,915
- Yeah, but you got the product.

613
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:34,139
- And who says you need to compete?

614
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,225
Kevin called AFI this afternoon.

615
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,241
- I told them we were meeting with you.

616
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:40,536
So if something were to come about

617
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:43,560
from all of this, maybe we--

618
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:46,307
- Oh, well, of course, if something were to come about.

619
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:48,323
- We'll see, I mean big companies like that,

620
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:49,956
they don't pay a whole lot of attention

621
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,278
to little folks like us. - No.

622
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:53,467
- Who knows if they'll even call back?

623
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:54,754
(frantic music)

624
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,535
(watch beeping)

625
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:11,789
(telephone ringing)

626
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:15,022
- Yeah?

627
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:19,194
- J.T., I think we have a problem.

628
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,355
(laughing)

629
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:35,428
This is not gonna be good news.

630
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:37,444
- They do what?

631
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,557
In the ass?

632
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:41,720
- You know I don't do that, honey!

633
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,839
- Remember when we used to come here

634
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,820
every Saturday for breakfast, just you and me?

635
00:32:49,855 --> 00:32:52,253
- Yeah, and I used to put maple syrup in your coffee.

636
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:53,124
- Yes!

637
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:54,201
I miss that.

638
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:56,704
I miss you, Ash.

639
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:59,832
- I miss you too, Dad.

640
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:07,028
Is there anything else you miss?

641
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:11,478
- I saw this great new use for our light sticks, on cows.

642
00:33:11,513 --> 00:33:12,347
- On cows?

643
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:14,329
- Yeah, I swear!

644
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:16,276
No, I mean it.

645
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,806
Honey, this could be it.

646
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,926
- Your big deal?

647
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:21,525
- You never know.

648
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,862
- Have you heard anything, anyone call?

649
00:33:24,897 --> 00:33:25,940
- No.

650
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,278
- It's been two days!

651
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:30,355
- I know.

652
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,075
I tried to get someone interested other than AFI, but,

653
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:38,524
light sticks on cows, people just laugh.

654
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,776
- I knew it!

655
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,863
I knew it, it's just like all the other ones.

656
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,878
Just a lot of crap!

657
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:48,188
You remember when we started this place?

658
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:52,152
We built this business from nothing!

659
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:55,421
All the hours, all the late nights.

660
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,618
We even helped build the building, for Christ's sake!

661
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:00,253
Do you remember that?

662
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:01,920
For what, for what?

663
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,892
This is what we get, huh?

664
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,909
This is what I get?

665
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:12,872
I'm tellin' ya, I can't take it anymore, man!

666
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,748
I'm like a fish!

667
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:17,843
You know, they've already gaffed me and put me in the boat.

668
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:19,268
- Harry, you're talking crazy.

669
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:20,485
- Am I?

670
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,030
I don't think so, bro.

671
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,837
There comes a time when a man has

672
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:30,079
to realize he's not full of potential anymore.

673
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,730
That he's a failure.

674
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,511
- What kind of fish?

675
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:38,318
- What?

676
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:39,744
- You said you were a fish.

677
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,099
What kind of fish?

678
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:42,594
- I don't mean I'm really a fish.

679
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,090
I was trying to make a point.

680
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,566
- Yeah, but what kind, like a shark or a flounder?

681
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:48,852
- That's really funny.

682
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,973
You what man, I'm done, I'm finished.

683
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,641
- Wait, what do you mean you're done?

684
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:53,614
You're not done!

685
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,005
- We have nothing, Steve!

686
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,570
- What do you mean we have nothing?

687
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:57,856
We have our company!

688
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,317
- Are you kidding me, our company?

689
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,853
This pathetic, measly, two-bit rinky-dink company?

690
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,070
- You flounder!

691
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:05,122
- And what are you, huh?

692
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:06,929
What the hell are you?

693
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:08,459
A frickin' puffer fish?

694
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,927
That's what you are, pal, a puffer fish!

695
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:13,812
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and nothing happens!

696
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,316
- Yeah, well something did, 'cause you didn't build

697
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,791
this pathetic, measly, two-bit operation, I did!

698
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:22,852
- And you forgot rinky-dink.

699
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,554
- Flounder!

700
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,424
- Puffer!

701
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:28,031
(door slamming)

702
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:29,699
- I believe that I am entitled--

703
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:30,535
- [Harry] Entitled?

704
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:31,819
- To be supported, yes--

705
00:35:31,855 --> 00:35:33,384
- Entitled to what? - In the manner that--

706
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,193
- What is that supposed to mean, what did you do?

707
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:36,478
- Harry, please!

708
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,529
This is not the way we handle this thing!

709
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:40,094
- Quiet!

710
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:41,137
What did you do?

711
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,145
- I nurtured.

712
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,431
- You nurtured? - Louise, you don't have

713
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:44,578
to say anything. - I did nurture!

714
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:45,864
That's right! - What did you nurture?

715
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,812
- You know exactly what I mean, Harry!

716
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,723
- Oh, gimme a break, will you? - Harry!

717
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:51,010
- You nurtured nothing.

718
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,122
- There were sleepless nights!

719
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:53,617
I have stood by-- - Okay, Nora's here.

720
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,938
Everything's--

721
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:56,155
- I'm sorry. - We'll start.

722
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:57,267
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

723
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:58,867
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

724
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,570
What do you have to do with this?

725
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:02,691
- I'm a lawyer, Harry.

726
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,403
- You're her lawyer?

727
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,376
- [Jonas] Harry.

728
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,801
- Wait a second, wait a second!

729
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,643
She can't do that, she's one of the partners!

730
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:12,007
You gotta ridicuse yourself!

731
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,545
- Recuse, Harry, that's recuse.

732
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:15,796
And no, I don't have to.

733
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,047
- Harry, please.

734
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,239
- I beg your pardon, would you please explain

735
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:22,750
to this bottom feeder-- - Harry, shut up!

736
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:26,330
- Nice.

737
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:29,458
- Let's just make this short and sweet.

738
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,023
- [Jonas] Yes.

739
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:34,152
- My client has instructed me to make the following offer.

740
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:35,960
My client will retain the house,

741
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,045
the car and all personal possessions acquired

742
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,713
during the course of this union.

743
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:40,966
- Hang on a second.

744
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,113
Why don't you just take my balls?

745
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:43,398
Let me put 'em both right here for you.

746
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,755
You take the right one, you take the left one.

747
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,354
And use both hands, you wanna get it all.

748
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:47,780
- [Jonas] Harry!

749
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:48,892
- Are you kidding me, do I get to keep my own balls?

750
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:49,970
- Harry, sit!

751
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:52,194
- In exchange, my client agrees to relinquish

752
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:54,662
any and all claims, now and in perpetuity,

753
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:58,521
against your share of the company, OmniGlow Inc.

754
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:01,094
- You've got a heart of gold.

755
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:04,083
- Honey, I told you not

756
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,752
to let this bother-- - How can he say that to me?

807
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,668
- Calm down, take a deep breath.

808
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:25,885
What's going on?

809
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,570
- Just a few minutes ago. (laughs)

810
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:30,369

811
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:31,760
- You're not gonna believe this!

I just had a phone call from the head counsel

813
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:36,072
of American Farmer's International.

814
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,540
That's AFI on the big board.

815
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,938
They want to meet with us tomorrow morning.

816
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:42,502
- AFI, they do? - Yes, they do!

817
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:43,789
- What else did they say?

818
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,362
- Well, they're considering making us an offer.

819
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:47,404
- They said that?

820
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:50,394
- Well, no, not exactly, but I could tell.

821
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:53,662
What, you don't think I know this stuff?

822
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:56,096
- Jonas, what the hell is the matter with you?

823
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,625
- What is the deal? - I have to pee!

824
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,432
- Well, go!

825
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,379
- Oh, this is big.

826
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:02,632
This is big!

827
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:05,760
Okay, so, I told them that we were

828
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:08,228
willing to listen, entertain offers.

829
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:09,896
You see, you can't get too excited

830
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:11,843
about this because they sense that.

831
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:13,129
See, so I played the game.

832
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:15,354
I was cool, very cool.

833
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:16,537
- You were cool!

834
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:17,336
(laughs)

835
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:18,692
- You should have seen me!

836
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,056
- You son of a bitch, you're a freakin' doll!

837
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,237
- Okay, what's next?

838
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,385
- Well, it's hard to say.

839
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,922
It sounds like they really want OmniGlow

840
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:29,469
out of the bovine fertility industry fast.

841
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:33,014
Fatal flaw number one, gentlemen, enthusiasm.

842
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,954
- Bad, bad.

843
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:35,691
- I am thinking they're gonna make us

844
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,960
an offer, maybe one, one point two.

845
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,262
- Million?

846
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,982
- Oh, yes, babies, 1.2 million dollars!

847
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:48,415
(cheering)

848
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,726
- Sold, to the man with the light stick up the cow's ass!

849
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:55,124
- No, no, no, we ask for three million.

850
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,141
- Jonas, Jonas, don't screw this up!

851
00:40:57,176 --> 00:41:00,861
- Guys, please, you have got to trust me on this.

852
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,980
I know how these things work!

853
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:07,639
This is a slow motion, sensual dirty dance, you know.

854
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:13,132
They offer one, we come back with three million.

855
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,044
They come back with two million.

856
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,903
We end at two point five, cha, cha, cha!

857
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:21,544
- Oh, my God!

858
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,518
- [Jonas] Only one thing, guys.

859
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:23,492
- Yeah?

860
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:24,882
- We are gonna have to include

861
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,203
all the partners in this deal.

862
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,525
- You mean, like, Wild Bill?

863
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,463
- [Jonas] Yes.

864
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:29,506
- And Nora? - Yes.

865
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,765
And me, don't forget my 5% because

866
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,442
you couldn't pay my legal fees.

867
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:36,910
- Two point five mil.

868
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:39,448
- Divided amongst all of us.

869
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:40,734
- I can live with that!

870
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,889
- (squeals) I can live with that, too!

871
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:43,795
(laughing)

872
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,602
Holy crap, I had no idea, Jonas,

873
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,826
you knew how to do such complicated deals!

874
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,077
- It's law!

875
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:52,312
I could do deals like this in my sleep!

876
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,849
(exhaling)

877
00:41:54,884 --> 00:41:56,066
Are you okay?

878
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,577
- Yeah, just, you know, I'm just excited.

879
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:01,732
- I think you got him on the cha, cha, cha.

880
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:02,636

♪ Oh boy, brother you've got it made ♪

900
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:38,344
- How long has it been?

901
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,603
- It's all part of the game.

902
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,393
- It's all part of the game, it's all part of the game.

903
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:45,887
Let's do something, let's go in there

904
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:48,877
and tell 'em come on, two million now, let's do it!

905
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:49,781
Two million, right--

906
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:51,970
- Harry, please, relax!

907
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,706
- Okay, here's what we've got on these guys.

908
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:18,461
It's not much, but we're working on it.

909
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:21,242
- I want everything you can get on these people.

910
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:23,884
- You think they have any idea what's at stake?

911
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:25,101
- Well, I can't say for sure,

912
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,943
but considering what's on the line

913
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:28,994
we have to play this very smart.

914
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:31,255
Greater warriors than I have fallen

915
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,027
because they've underestimated

916
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:36,399
the formidability of their opponent.

917
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,971
(breathing loudly)

918
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:43,803
Oh, God, I love the smell of a deal in the morning.

919
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:51,209
- Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

920
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:53,781
We'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to AFI.

921
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:55,450
Thank you very much for coming.

922
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,605
Just a reminder, what will be discussed here

923
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:00,526
in this room remains in the strictest confidentiality.

924
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,438
This, of course, excludes spouses.

925
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:04,836
- Yeah, but who's got one of those anymore, right?

926
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:05,809
(laughs)

927
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:07,895
- Let's get right down to business.

928
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,955
AFI is prepared to extend a very generous offer

929
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,257
to you for the purchase of OmniGlow Inc.

930
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,969
Now, we have analyzed and evaluated

931
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:19,298
what we believe is an appropriate value

932
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:23,470
for your technology and associated application.

933
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:26,285
Allow me to just jump right past the formalities.

934
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,031
Here it is, short and sweet.

935
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:30,040
20 million.

936
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,124
- 20 million what?

937
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:39,391
- We'll pay you 20 million dollars.

938
00:46:42,243 --> 00:46:43,910
I'm sure everyone will agree that

939
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:46,970
this amount is more than generous compensation.

940
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,500
Veronica will make sure (heart beating)

941
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:50,516
all the necessary documents are drawn up

942
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,767
and we'll have it delivered to

943
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:54,061
your office this afternoon via courier.

944
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:56,634
- Uh, excuse me just a minute.

945
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:06,925
- Excuse me, just, I'll be right back.

946
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,460
- He is, quite apparently, not feeling well

947
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:15,476
and she's gonna probably go out there

948
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:16,763
and try to help him out.

949
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:18,883
20 million dollars is a, uh, well,

950
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:20,621
a very generous offer, I imagine.

951
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:21,595
Where do we sign?

952
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,272
Can we sign now, please?

953
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:27,678
- Will you excuse us a moment?

954
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:30,668
(Steve breathing heavily)

955
00:47:30,703 --> 00:47:31,572
- Steve?

956
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,762
You okay?

957
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:35,918
- I don't know.

958
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,115
Yeah, I think so.

959
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:40,019
- Are you?

960
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:43,114
- Could you turn around for me?

961
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:43,983
- What?

962
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:45,130
- Please.

963
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:47,355
I know, just turn around.

964
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:54,934
That's fine, thanks.

965
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:59,696
I just wanna make sure I'm not dreaming.

966
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:03,416
- No, hon, you're not dreaming.

967
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:06,163
- This is it.

968
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:08,353
(tender music)

969
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:10,124
It's finally here.

970
00:48:12,662 --> 00:48:15,096
This doesn't happen to me.

971
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:23,787
It's what I've always wanted.

972
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:28,758
- Well, what do you know?

973
00:48:30,149 --> 00:48:31,992
- What do you know?

974
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:37,241
- Let's go back in, okay, come on.

975
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:38,423
- [Steve] Yeah.

976
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:43,741
- It's about time.

977
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,689
You'll blow the deal!

978
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:47,635
- He has got to know something.

979
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:48,712
- You think?

980
00:48:48,748 --> 00:48:49,896
- Oh, yeah.

981
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,250
Do you see what he did?

982
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:54,171
He just got up and walked right outta the room.

983
00:48:54,205 --> 00:48:55,840
Oh, he's good.

984
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,092
He is good.

985
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:58,759
How about that other one, huh?

986
00:48:58,794 --> 00:49:02,722
They got the whole good cop/bad cop thing going.

987
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,705
(sighing)

988
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,547
I'm going up to 30.

989
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:09,571
- J.T., I have to remind you that

990
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:12,109
this whole thing is a big risk already.

991
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:14,160
Gordon said nothing changes.

992
00:49:14,195 --> 00:49:17,637
- That's right and what they have changes everything.

993
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,653
If Gordon catches wind of their product

994
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:21,773
this entire deal goes down the drain.

995
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:23,685
And may I remind you, counselor,

996
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,431
it's a 600 million dollar deal.

997
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:31,646
Come on, Lar, don't you wanna be great?

998
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:33,524
(laughs)

999
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:36,165
(tense music)

1000
00:49:45,412 --> 00:49:47,152
I've reconsidered.

1001
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:50,558
- Oh, look, Mr. Montgomery, I have to tell you--

1002
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:53,305
- In light of new revelations I have been forced

1003
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:57,510
to reassess the value of your company and...

1004
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:02,795
Excuse me, what are you writing?

1005
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:07,141
- Uh, uh, well, I've evaluated what

1006
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:11,869
I consider to be a fair value for

1007
00:50:11,903 --> 00:50:15,484
our technology and associated application.

1008
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:16,527
(clearing throat)

1009
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:19,064
- Oh, I'd like to see that.

1010
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:24,418
- Well, yeah, I don't think so.

1011
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:29,425
- Well, I'm not certain we can

1012
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,761
move forward if can't see that.

1013
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,368
- Well, this is proprietary information.

1014
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:36,551
So, no way.

1015
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:39,610
- [Harry] (coughing) Give it to him right now!

1016
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:40,897
- Give it to him!

1017
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:43,573
- [Harry] (coughing) Show him the pad!

1018
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,902
- Another moment. (laughs)

1019
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:47,814
(tense music)

1020
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:50,908
(all whispering)

1021
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:53,968
- [Harry] We'll kill you!

1022
00:50:54,002 --> 00:50:56,122
- I'm making a drawing.

1023
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:58,034
- Alright, this is it.

1024
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,285
Now, mind you, I am not going to offer one penny higher.

1025
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:07,838
40 million.

1026
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:13,436

Was it 2.5 million?

1039
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:10,622
- I think it was 20 million.

1040
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,341
No, no, wait.

1041
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:17,852
It was, um...

1042
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,642
It was 40 million.

1043
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:23,346

1044
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:24,632
(stomping feet)

1045
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,899
- That's quite consistent with my analysis.

1046
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:29,360
- To Wild Bill's analysis!

1047
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:31,132
- [Nora] Yes, hear, hear!

1048
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:31,967
- Dink!

1049
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:38,468
- Does anybody have any idea what really happened up there?

1050
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:42,708
- I don't know and I don't think I wanna know.

1051
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,455
(all laughing)

1052
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:56,058
- 40 million!

1053
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,048
Peanuts, sir?

1054
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,680
40 million!

1055
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:07,948
- Oh, my God, stop it!

1056
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:14,726
- Interesting day, huh?

1057
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:17,959
- Yes, yes, it was.

1058
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:23,210
- It's funny, you work and you work and you work

1059
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:28,492
and you work and you work and you work and you come close.

1060
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:32,351
And then one day (popping).

1061
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:39,826
So are you seeing this Tom guy, or what?

1062
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,615
- Steve, let's not go there, okay?

1063
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:47,891
- I mean, come on, Nora, 3:30 in the afternoon?

1064
00:53:49,178 --> 00:53:51,472
- What, you've never made love in the afternoon?

1065
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,418
- Yeah, I mean, maybe.

1066
00:53:55,748 --> 00:53:57,070
We never did.

1067
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:02,666
We never made love in the afternoon.

1068
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,578
- Well, we could have.

1069
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,645
Why didn't we?

1070
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,732
I mean, I don't know, did we just take all

1071
00:54:10,766 --> 00:54:15,807
of our imagination to the office and leave it there or what?

1072
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:18,414
- I was trying to get somewhere.

1073
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:21,717
I wanted to make something of myself, you know that.

1074
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:22,620
- No.

1075
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:26,235
No, it was just never enough for you.

1076
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,139
Was it?

1077

- When do I get my money? (all laughing)

1089
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,537
- That will be a month from today.

1090

- Harry, I've gotta tell you,

1091
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:08,752
your offer is looking awfully good right about now.

1092
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:10,664
- What offer?

1093
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:12,123
- The one you made to Louise.

1094
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,175
You know, I think she just might take it.

1095
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,740
- Wait a minute, Nora.

1096
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:17,129
What about confidentiality?

1097
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:19,633
- No, no, no, J.T. said except spouses, remember?

1098
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:22,240
- Yeah, I know, but she's my spouse, not yours.

1099

Hey, you two aren't--

1100

Who the hell are you?

1103
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:32,217

1104
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:33,574
I'll explain later.

1105
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:35,208

How much is she getting? - 5% off the top.

1111

- Off the top of what?

1112
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:48,383
- Off the top of my frickin' ass.

01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:12,525
What are you, I'm sorry, why are acting like this, Steve?

1255
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:13,915
- Like what?

1256
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,410
- What do you mean, like what?

1257
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,008
You don't think you've been acting strange lately?

1258
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:18,504
- Well, Nora, I'm moving on.

1259
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:21,285
Isn't that what you said we should do, move on?

1260
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:22,989
- You know what?

1261
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:26,047
This is really hard for me, okay?

1262
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:28,237
- It's hard for me, too.

1263
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:31,506
- Steve, no, you are the one who left me!

1264
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,374
Okay?

1265
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:33,452
You left me!

1266
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:46,835
You know, just for your information

1267
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:49,826
I never cared about 'making it'.

1268
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:53,267
- Well, that's easy for you to say.

1269
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,389
- I'm sorry, what does that mean?

1270
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:58,134
- Well, you had your own thing going on, didn't you?

1271
01:02:58,169 --> 01:02:59,698
You had a law degree.

1272
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:01,368
You could have joined a firm.

1273
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,870
You could have had a career. - Wait a second!

1274
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,226
Wait a second!

1275
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:06,790
I'm sorry.

1276
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,947
Rewind here for a minute, I'm sorry.

1277
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:10,684
Are you saying that this marriage

1278
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:12,492
is a competition of some sort?

1279
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:13,813
- No, not at all!

1280
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:16,177
- Listen to me, I don't care about the cars!

1281
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:18,018
I don't care about the houses!

1282
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:19,409
I don't need that, Steve!

1283
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:21,878
Look, if this was on your shoulders, guess what?

1284
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,477
It's because you put it there.

1285
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:24,520
Not me, you.

1286
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:46,456
(tense music)

1287
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,629
- Has anyone thought about what this really means?

1288
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,124
- No.

1289
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,862
(laughs)

1290
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,323
- Come on, Jonas.

1291
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:10,305
You've never even thought about it?

1292
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:11,590
- Of course, I've thought about it.

1293
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:14,754
I just don't wanna jinx it, that's all.

Who's your captain, baby? - You are!

1313

1319
01:06:22,651 --> 01:06:24,841

1320
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:25,848
It's me.

1321
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:26,961
- Yeah.

1322
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:28,560
- I'm having another one of those panic attacks

1323
01:06:28,595 --> 01:06:30,507
or something and it's bad this time.

1324
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:32,175
I don't know what's going on.

1325
01:06:32,211 --> 01:06:35,408
I mean, now that we have the deal and everything, right?

1326
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:37,042
I don't know why.

1327
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:37,980
Are you there?

1328
01:06:38,016 --> 01:06:39,337
Harry? (Harry groans)

1329
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:40,867
Harry, pick up!

1330
01:06:42,605 --> 01:06:43,369
Harry!

1331
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:44,690
- Who's your captain, babe?

1332
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:46,324
- [Steve] Harry, come on!

1333
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,862
(thudding)

1334
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:52,304
- Steve, it's Louise.

1335
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:53,312
What deal?

1336
01:06:53,346 --> 01:06:56,511
- Oh, uh, Louise, I can't talk right now.

1337
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:58,492
I'm having some sort of attack.

1338
01:06:58,527 --> 01:06:59,952
Need some fresh air.

1339
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:02,420
(panting)

1340
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:05,097
- What deal, Harry?

1341
01:07:05,132 --> 01:07:08,574
- I was just about to tell you about the deal.

1342
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,736
It's funny, it's like we're psychically connected

1343
01:07:11,772 --> 01:07:13,301
or something, you know?

1344
01:07:13,336 --> 01:07:14,622

(panting)

1351
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:34,055
- You just don't get it, Harry!

1352
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,697
Relationships are about trust!

1353
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:41,529

So I gotta say this is quite a surprise.

1370
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,484
- Well, you know, you've popped

1371
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:41,534
in my head a few times recently.

1372
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:44,002
I always wondered what you were up to.

1373
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:45,116
- Yeah?

1374
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:49,843
- Yeah, I just thought I wanted to look you up.

1375
01:09:49,878 --> 01:09:52,103
- Well, I'm glad you did.

1376
01:09:53,284 --> 01:09:56,031
- So, tell me, the last I heard you were at Princeton.

1377
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:56,970
- Yeah.

1378
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,724
- So what are you doing now?

1379
01:10:00,759 --> 01:10:03,957
- Havin' a beer with an old friend.

1380
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,851
- This place is beautiful.

1381
01:10:07,885 --> 01:10:10,249
Must be great coming up here on the weekends

1382
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:12,857
and leaving the stress of the city behind.

1383
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:14,873
- This is where I live.

1384
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:18,002
I built this place from the ground up.

1385
01:10:18,036 --> 01:10:18,906
- Wow.

1386
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:22,522
Mick, I,

1387
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:25,406
what do you do?

1388
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:26,311
For work?

1389
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:29,474
- A little of this and a little of that, you know.

1390
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:31,421
I've been doing some carpentry lately.

1391
01:10:31,455 --> 01:10:32,499
- Carpentry?

1392
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:34,515
- Yeah, I really like it.

1393
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,870
Every once in a while I write

1394
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:39,138
a little piece for the local paper.

1395
01:10:40,494 --> 01:10:42,093
You okay?

1396
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:44,144
Something wrong?

1397
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:46,265
- Nothing, I just, you know.

1398
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,950
So, but tell me, so after Princeton, what?

1399
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,355
- It's funny how easily you can get trapped.

1400
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,074
Expectations.

1401
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,385
Other people's expectations of who you are

1402
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,139
and what you need to be in order to be happy.

1403
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:11,329
(laughs)

1404
01:11:11,364 --> 01:11:14,041
- Mick, you were always,

1405
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:17,900
I mean you were destined for greatness.

1406
01:11:17,935 --> 01:11:20,717
- I'm just an ordinary guy.

1407
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,246
Always was.

1408
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:23,879
- Ordinary?

1409
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:26,382
No, I don't think so.

1410
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,633
(laughs)

1411
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:30,067
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

1412
01:11:30,102 --> 01:11:32,362
- I just, you know.

1413
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:34,934
- Oh, come on, who wants to talk about the past?

1414
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:36,291
It's already been done.

1415
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:38,759
Why waste time talking about it when there's,

1416
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,915
geez, there's so much else to do.

1417
01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:44,043
I haven't even finished half of these yet

1418
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:46,164
and I'm learning how to play this thing.

1419
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:48,075
Did I tell you I was playing the sax?

1420
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:50,195
- No, I didn't know.

1421
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,663
- You wanna hear me play it?

1422
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:57,149
- No, I mean, I'd love to, but I gotta get back to L.A.

1423
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,617
I gotta deal with that thing and I gotta

1424
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:02,988
long trip ahead of me, so I'd better.

1425
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:06,395
- Steve, I'm really glad you came up.

1426
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:10,046
- Yeah, yeah, it was great.

1427
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:18,528
- Whoo! - Whoo!

1428
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,144
- It's something, isn't it?

1429
01:12:22,179 --> 01:12:23,569
- Yeah, it is.

1430
01:12:25,794 --> 01:12:27,011
Very peaceful.

1431
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,835
- I find it all slows down if I let it.

1432
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:35,493
Haven't figured out why yet, but I'm working on it.

1433
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:39,144
Whoo, feel that wind!

1434
01:12:42,168 --> 01:12:45,818
You have to just let it carry you.

1435
01:12:45,853 --> 01:12:47,069
- Yeah, right.

1436
01:12:49,642 --> 01:12:51,901
Well, I'll see you, Mick.

1437
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:52,806
- You too.

1438
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:10,327
(bluesy saxophone music)

1439
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,364
- Shh, somebody's coming!

1440
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:38,555
- Oh, they're here!

1441
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,702
They're here.

1442
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:45,786
- Hey, everybody, Robert Lawson.

1443
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,219
I just thought I'd drop by and see how things are doing.

1444
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:51,174
Oh, my, I forgot it's the big day today, huh!

1445
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,704
- Robert, how are you?

1446
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:54,060
Good to see you!

1447
01:13:54,094 --> 01:13:55,381
- What a coincidence, huh? - Hey, how are you?

1448
01:13:55,415 --> 01:13:57,640
- Good, good. - Let's go.

1449
01:13:59,066 --> 01:13:59,900
- Oh, God.

1450
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:02,889
Stop it!

1451
01:14:11,267 --> 01:14:15,022
- Robert Lawson, I'm the money manager.

1452
01:14:17,108 --> 01:14:20,132
- J.T. Montgomery, I'm the money.

1453
01:14:25,556 --> 01:14:27,225
- That went well.

1454
01:14:29,519 --> 01:14:32,126
(tense music)

1455
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,765
- Mr. Montgomery, good morning.

1456
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:40,122
- Good morning.

1457
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:42,173
- Gentlemen, before we tend to the business at hand

1458
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,928
we have humbly assembled this culinary feast in your honor.

1459
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:48,083
Please, help yourselves.

1460
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:49,439
(slurping)

1461
01:14:49,473 --> 01:14:50,725
- Uh, pass.

1462
01:14:53,298 --> 01:14:54,897
- Well, shall we?

1463
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:02,684
- Can you really get 40 million dollars

1464
01:15:02,718 --> 01:15:04,143
in one of those briefcases?

1465
01:15:04,178 --> 01:15:05,952
- Actually, Harry, that's usually done

1466
01:15:05,986 --> 01:15:08,976
either by a money order or a wire transfer.

1467
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,243
- So, what's it gonna be, a money order or a wire transfer?

1468
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:15,824
- Um, that would be C, none of the above.

1469
01:15:18,502 --> 01:15:19,718
- I'm sorry?

1470
01:15:20,865 --> 01:15:23,820
- You know, the boys on Wall Street have a saying.

1471
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:26,253
It's all a big game, like Monopoly,

1472
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,375
only you get to keep the money.

1473
01:15:28,409 --> 01:15:31,850
Now, you're probably wondering what does that mean, right?

1474
01:15:31,886 --> 01:15:32,893
- Right.

1475
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,431
- Well, it means gentlemen, lady,

1476
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:39,637
that you landed on Boardwalk with four hotels.

1477
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:42,141
The deal is off the table.

1478
01:15:42,175 --> 01:15:43,531
- Wait, off the table?

1479
01:15:43,566 --> 01:15:45,582
You can't do that! - Excuse me!

1480
01:15:45,618 --> 01:15:47,252
We had a deal here, pal!

1481
01:15:47,286 --> 01:15:50,344
You do know what a deal is, don't you, Wall Street?

1482
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,301
- Clearly, you don't understand what you're talking about.

1483
01:15:53,335 --> 01:15:57,229
What you had, technically, was a Letter of Intent.

1484
01:15:57,263 --> 01:15:59,314
- Jonas, straighten this character out.

1485
01:15:59,348 --> 01:16:02,235
- That letter permits us to withdraw.

1486
01:16:02,269 --> 01:16:05,641
We can look at your books, look at your patent, look at you.

1487
01:16:05,676 --> 01:16:07,691
We can turn you inside out,

1488
01:16:07,727 --> 01:16:11,030
but we are not obligated to close escrow.

1489
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:12,906
That's just the way it works.

1490
01:16:12,942 --> 01:16:14,019
Tell 'em, Jonas.

1491
01:16:14,053 --> 01:16:15,688
- [Steve] Jonas, what's he talking about?

1492
01:16:15,723 --> 01:16:16,940
- He's right.

1493
01:16:16,974 --> 01:16:17,774
- Jonas, you gotta be kidding me?

1494
01:16:17,808 --> 01:16:19,234
- He's right!

1495
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:21,876
- You got excited, didn't you?

1496
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:26,986
Busy little bees counting your money.

1497
01:16:27,021 --> 01:16:31,783
And all of those new cars out in the parking lot, very nice.

1498
01:16:31,818 --> 01:16:35,364
Which one of you purchased the Porsche?

1499
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,423
Wonderful choice.

1500
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:40,857
- No, there is no substitute.

1501
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:42,768
- And I'm sure Steve over here isn't

1502
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:45,237
the only one who got a little crazy.

1503
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,489
Show of hands?

1504
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:49,200
- You are such as asshole.

1505
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:51,668
- I'll take that as a yes.

1506
01:16:51,704 --> 01:16:54,936
We all know about the boat, Captain.

1507
01:16:54,971 --> 01:16:55,840
- You bought a boat?

1508
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:57,543
- A small boat! - Oh, my God.

1509
01:16:57,577 --> 01:17:00,359
- Well, as I was saying, I recently had

1510
01:17:00,394 --> 01:17:04,183
the opportunity to review that analysis of yours.

1511
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:08,633
I looked over all of the numbers and well,

1512
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:12,214
frankly, they just don't quite add up.

1513
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:16,177
(tense music)

1514
01:17:18,506 --> 01:17:20,070
You almost had me.

1515
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:39,747
(laughs)

1516
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:43,814
Enjoy it.

1517
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:47,743
It's the most expensive laugh you'll ever have.

1518
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:49,897
- It doesn't mean, it's just Wild Bill,

1519
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:51,705
he doesn't mean anything by it.

1520
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:54,765
- You all thought you had me, didn't you?

1521
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:56,711
But you can't fool me now that I

1522
01:17:56,747 --> 01:17:59,562
know who you people really are.

1523
01:17:59,598 --> 01:18:02,482
Nevertheless, we all know this is business.

1524
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:06,341
So, I'm going to present to you an offer

1525
01:18:06,376 --> 01:18:10,199
with a slightly revised number, 2.5 million.

1526
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:16,909
- 2.5 million, to de divided amongst?

1527
01:18:20,386 --> 01:18:21,499
That's bullshit.

1528
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:24,418
- Let me tell you something, Gilligan.

1529
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,713
You got lucky, all of you.

1530
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:29,424
Your little company is nothing

1531
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,754
more than a fart in a wheat field.

1532
01:18:31,788 --> 01:18:34,917
You should be thankful that I'm going to cover your debts,

1533
01:18:34,952 --> 01:18:38,324
not to mention some of your 'deficit spending'.

1534
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:42,148
- Alright, we'll give you our answer in a couple of days.

1535
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,512
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1536
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:47,016
You will let me know now.

1537
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,961
You have five minutes.

1538
01:18:57,236 --> 01:18:58,418
- What the hell was that, Jonas?

1539
01:18:58,452 --> 01:18:59,912
You're supposed to know what you're doing!

1540
01:18:59,947 --> 01:19:01,616
- Jonas, what the hell is this?

1541
01:19:01,651 --> 01:19:03,980
(all shouting heatedly)

1542
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:05,580
- More champagne, J.T.?

1543
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:07,144
- Don't mind if I do, Lar.

1544
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:08,291
Don't mind if I do.

1545
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,794
- Masterful performance, all of it.

1546
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,357
(laughs)

1547
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:14,478
- Well, you didn't think I was going to let a bunch

1548
01:19:14,514 --> 01:19:16,704
of wanna-bes beat me out of 40 million, did you?

1549
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:18,649
- There was never really any doubt.

1550
01:19:18,685 --> 01:19:22,787
And I must say your sense of timing was impeccable.

1551
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:24,631
- I thought I'd leave them in there for

1552
01:19:24,665 --> 01:19:26,959
a while to ripen on the vine, so to speak.

1553
01:19:26,993 --> 01:19:28,975
And if my hunch is correct they should

1554
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,270
be hitting the ground right about--

1555
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:35,476
- [Nora] Who told you to go out and buy a stupid boat?

1556
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:37,457
- You think this is fun, wait'll we close

1557
01:19:37,492 --> 01:19:40,064
the deal with Gordon tomorrow.

1558
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,254
(glasses clinking)

1559
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:44,272
- Well, J.T., we've talked it over

1560
01:19:44,306 --> 01:19:46,009
and we're wondering if you can do

1561
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:48,095
something about hiding the money.

1562
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,068
- We can do that.

1563
01:19:49,104 --> 01:19:50,876
- Of course, we do that all the time.

1564
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:53,172
The Bahamas, the Caymans, you name it.

1565
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:56,021
- I was thinking about somewhere a little closer to home.

1566
01:19:56,056 --> 01:19:58,212
We'd like you to take the 2.5 million in cash,

1567
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:02,243
preferably small bills, wrap it up into little bundles--

1568
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:05,687
- And stick it up your corporate ass.

1569
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:09,302
(playful music)

1570
01:20:09,336 --> 01:20:10,205
- I see.

1571
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,203
Alrighty then.

1572
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:18,236
- Yeah.

1573
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:22,407
- Oh, there is one little thing I neglected to mention.

1574
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:25,154
It's the craziest thing, really.

1575
01:20:25,188 --> 01:20:27,482
As it turns out, I don't need all of you

1576
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:30,855
to agree on this deal, just one.

1577
01:20:30,889 --> 01:20:34,644
Imagine my surprise when my counsel informed me

1578
01:20:34,678 --> 01:20:37,216
that your patent is registered under the names

1579
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:41,875
of the individual partners, not the company.

1580
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,961
Anyone know what that means?

1581
01:20:43,996 --> 01:20:46,186
Anyone on the crack legal staff wanna

1582
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,133
take a shot at this one?

1583
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:49,384
Jonas, Nora?

1584
01:20:50,462 --> 01:20:52,165
- It means that any of us independently

1585
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:54,320
can transfer the right to make the light sticks

1586
01:20:54,356 --> 01:20:55,989
without the permission of others.

1587
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:59,083
- You are beginning to give me the heebie-jeebies.

1588
01:20:59,118 --> 01:21:00,960
But he is absolutely right.

1589
01:21:00,995 --> 01:21:04,507
Now, whose brain child was it to set it up this way?

1590
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:05,966
- We trust each other.

1591
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:07,322
- Oh, really?

1592
01:21:07,357 --> 01:21:09,409
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

1593
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:13,544
Because I'm going to offer the entire 2.5 million

1594
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,265
to one of you for your rights under the patent.

1595
01:21:17,299 --> 01:21:21,088
No split, kind of a winner take all situation.

1596
01:21:21,123 --> 01:21:24,878
I'll be at the Hotel Piermont tonight enjoying

1597
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:28,563
a scotch and soda until eight o'clock.

1598
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,475
I'm going to bring a cashier's check,

1599
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:34,959
confident that one of you, I don't know which one,

1600
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:38,018
I don't care which one, but one of you

1601
01:21:38,054 --> 01:21:41,321
will show up to seal the deal.

1602
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:44,067
The rest of you can go to hell.

1603
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,306

Sir, there's a change!

- Harry!

1614
01:22:32,008 --> 01:22:33,050
- Louise, I,

1615
01:22:34,302 --> 01:22:35,519
I apologize.

1616
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,482
I'm a scoundrel, I'm a turd.

1617
01:22:39,516 --> 01:22:42,679
I'm humbled in your presence, Louise.

I'm so sorry.

Look, honey, something's happened.

Things have been so good lately.

Baby, we,

1622
01:22:58,185 --> 01:23:01,383
we have some decisions to make.

They don't question relationships.

1668
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:07,683

1675

And your mom.

1679

- That's why you left, huh?

1680
01:27:09,353 --> 01:27:13,629
- I wonder if this thing, this feeling of

1681
01:27:13,665 --> 01:27:17,384
not being enough isn't the inherent human flaw.

I understand, in the area of bovine fertility.

01:35:28,737 --> 01:35:29,815
Off the table?

1785
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:30,684
No.

1786
01:35:30,718 --> 01:35:33,326
No, no, no, you can't do that.

1787
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,412
You can't do that, that's impossible.

1788
01:35:35,446 --> 01:35:37,914
That's, we had a deal.

1789
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:39,688
Tell him we had a deal!

1790
01:35:39,722 --> 01:35:42,156
Tell him we have a contract!

1791
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,346
We have a contract, Luis!

1792
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,475
- Well, that was a Letter of Intent, actually.

1793
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:50,777
- Can you imagine a 600 million dollar deal falling apart

1794
01:35:50,812 --> 01:35:54,497
because of a 45 cent light stick on a cow's ass?

1795
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:59,538
- Come on, Luis, please don't play this, don't do this.

1796
01:35:59,572 --> 01:36:01,346
- Come on, J.T.

1797
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:02,806
This is business.

1798
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,447
This kind of thing happens every day.

1799
01:36:05,482 --> 01:36:06,699
You know that.

1800
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:11,323
You're a professional, you're a veteran.

1801
01:36:11,358 --> 01:36:13,235
I mean, what's the big deal?

1802
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:15,389
It's not like you went out and bought up all

1803
01:36:15,425 --> 01:36:19,318
your own stock based on information that you had.

1804
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,787
You wouldn't do that.

1805
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:23,976
And it's a good thing, too, because with all

1806
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:26,028
these light sticks around the boys on Wall Street

1807
01:36:26,063 --> 01:36:29,226
about to find out that the deal is off.

1808
01:36:29,261 --> 01:36:32,459
Your stock is gonna be worth, well,

1809
01:36:34,614 --> 01:36:35,657
shit.

1810
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:41,636
- No, no, no, hold on a second, wait a second.

1811
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:47,060
You're forgetting one thing, one little minor detail.

1812
01:36:48,172 --> 01:36:50,362
I have the license to make the product, Gordon.

1813
01:36:50,397 --> 01:36:51,962
- That's very true.

1814
01:36:51,996 --> 01:36:55,890
But as you know, any partner can give a license

1815
01:36:55,925 --> 01:36:58,323
and if these guys can give one to you,

1816
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:00,549
they can give it to anybody;

1817
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:03,885
Purina, General Electric, Mr. Magoo.

1818
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:10,630
Sharing is not a concept that appeals to me.

1819
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:13,759
And in light of all these revelations today

1820
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:15,496
I've really just kind of soured

1821
01:37:15,532 --> 01:37:18,521
on the idea of the dairy industry.

1822
01:37:18,557 --> 01:37:22,241
Oh, (laughs) that was a pun.

1823
01:37:22,276 --> 01:37:24,500
- Mr. Gordon, you and I were gonna work something--

1824
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:26,274
- I like your product, I really do

1825
01:37:26,309 --> 01:37:27,977
and I think it was a good pitch.

1826
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:29,228
I really do.

1827
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:32,219
But, I have to tell you something.

1828
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:36,181
We've decided to go another direction.

1829
01:37:36,217 --> 01:37:38,997
We've decided to go into coffee.

1830
01:37:39,032 --> 01:37:42,370
I just, I love those caramel macchiatos.

1831
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:44,560
We have some out in the reception area.

1832
01:37:44,594 --> 01:37:48,801
You oughta try one on your way out, gentlemen.

(clock chiming)

1834
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:24,329
- You could have closed our deal and walked away a winner.

1835
01:38:24,364 --> 01:38:25,859
But you didn't.

1836
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:28,118
You couldn't.

1837
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:31,873
It just wasn't enough for you.

1838
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:33,785
- Who do you think you are telling

1839
01:38:33,819 --> 01:38:37,471
me what's enough, you little prick?

1840
01:38:37,505 --> 01:38:39,312

1841
01:38:39,348 --> 01:38:42,823
me down you're a big hotshot now?

1842
01:38:42,859 --> 01:38:46,612

- Well, apparently Bill didn't tell you the whole story.

1865
