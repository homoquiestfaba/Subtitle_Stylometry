1
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,711
I got nothin'.

2
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,950
Was that a kid?

3
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,890
I thought our ghost
was an escaped convict.

4
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,291
It is.

5
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,838
It's blood.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,306
Oh, Jesus.

7
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,975
Is it yours?

8
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,210
No.

9
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,929
Hamlet.

10
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,164
Hamlet, come on.

11
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,853
Uh, guys?

12
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,988
Shh, Chad.

13
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,629
It's a projection.

14
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,661
What the shit?

15
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,496
Can I help you?

16
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,269
There's no
such thing as ghosts.

17
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,837
Just cruddy old perverts,

18
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,772
politicians,
and real estate developers.

19
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,077
When we first got together,
we hunted ghosts.

20
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,813
Sometimes aliens,
moss monsters,

21
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,749
the occasional scary robot.

22
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:08,120
Now we know what we're
really after is people...

23
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,955
people with something to hide.

24
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:14,793
People who want everyone
to think there are ghosts.

25
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,361
My best friend Gwen and I

26
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,097
co-founded the gang
our freshman year at Oberlin.

27
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,366
She's a great partner
in business,

28
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,069
and an even better partner
in fighting crime.

29
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,938
Chad's our sound guy,

30
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,739
and he also brings the van.

31
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,107
He's the only one of us

32
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,709
who actually believes
in the paranormal,

33
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,744
so he's probably great
to have around

34
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,148
in case we ever
find something real.

35
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,717
Before we found him,
Floyd repaired robots

36
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,520
at a haunted Showbiz Pizza
in Seattle.

37
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,723
Now he's the rocking-est
resident gearhead

38
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,291
a girl could ask for.

39
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,460
Hamlet's his dog.

40
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,829
Part Great Dane,
part something else,

41
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,265
and all affection.

42
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,033
He's the muscle.

43
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,735
And I'm Nancy,

44
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,405
just a few months shy of getting
my private detective's license,

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,842
and already years
into debunking shady shit.

46
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,190
We rip off the masks

47
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:21,426
so the authorities
can slap on the cuffs.

48
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,562
We're really good.

49
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,098
We get to the bottom of things.

50
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
Just ask these assholes...

51
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,003
on visitors day...

52
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,005
at the pen...

53
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,973
in Huntsville.

54
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:39,878
So, you think you busted up
a kiddy-porn ring, huh?

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,546
We're so glad
you guys got here
when you did.

56
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,149
The situation here was,
these guys had a cover story

57
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,250
of a dead convict
haunting the place.

58
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,718
Totally fake.

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,387
We even bought high-8
and actually record the ghosts.

60
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,155
We can surrender
those to you, if you want.

61
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,591
They were
scaring everybody away
from ever coming in,

62
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,359
so that nobody was finding out
what they were doing.

63
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,994
Shut the fuck up!

64
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,230
We've had this
staked out for months.

65
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,765
Fuckin' months.

66
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,401
We have videotape of them
bringing in the kids.

67
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,935
Officer, we have...

68
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,138
We have wiretaps!

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,273
We were building a case.

70
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,343
You waltz in
and fuck it all up.

71
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,477
What do you think this is,

72
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,012
some Saturday morning
cartoon show?

73
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,281
I don't watch television.

74
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,449
We're just doing our jobs.

75
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,684
We're paranormal investigators.

76
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,118
Oh, so you're Ghostbusters.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,454
You know what happens
to real detectives?

78
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,189
They get killed!

79
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:28,193
Listen, we got in there
before anything happened
to those kids, okay?

80
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,961
Nothing happened to them
because of us.

81
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,296
Yeah, where were you guys?

82
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,631
Whoa, you didn't do shit
but taint evidence

83
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,099
and fuck our investigation.

84
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,635
These guys are gonna be
out before happy hour,

85
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,370
probably at the carnival,
in line at the Zipper,

86
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,039
if you know what I mean.

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,375
What, are you trying to get
in touch with your inner child?

88
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:46,011
Fuck your inner child.

89
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:56,388
So I can call my parents again
and get a loan for us at 15%,

90
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,989
but we haven't paid off
the last one yet.

91
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,358
You still owe me money

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,992
for one of those installments,
by the way.

93
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,993
Do you guys think that that was

94
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,495
cow's blood in there?

95
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,030
It was pig's blood,
or something, you know?

96
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,231
This is just total crap.

97
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,466
And who does that?

98
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,467
And you...
And you licked it.

99
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,501
How were we supposed to know

100
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,370
it was a sting operation, okay?

101
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,271
I mean, what the hell?
It's total crap, right?

102
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,173
Right?
It's total crap?

103
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,775
Yes, it's total crap.
Yes.

104
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,009
- Yes.
- It is total crap.

105
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,111
Are we talking about the blood,

106
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,545
or are we talking about...

107
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,880
I think we're talking
about the situation.

108
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,548
No, we're talking
about what happened today.

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,716
Did you hear the way
those cops were
talking to us,

110
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,551
like we were juveniles
or something?

111
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,053
Well...
They weren't very nice.

112
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,388
You save the kids
from pedophiles,

113
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,555
and you don't
even get paid for it.

114
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,157
How would you make
that sustainable?

115
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,425
Well, I was thinking that maybe

116
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,526
we should refine
our business model.

117
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,794
That's a good idea.

118
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,196
Okay, I agree,
but what do we do?

119
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,798
I mean, how do we figure
out a way to?

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,267
Nance, you have to look
on the bright side.

121
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,435
We'll figure it out.

122
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,970
I can call my parents anytime.

123
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,139
No.
Remember that
department store job?

124
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,709
I could work at the pool again.

125
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,978
- Hello?
- Oh, Nancy.

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,180
This is Mike Ryan from
Buford National Bank.

127
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,481
Hi.

128
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,949
Uh, calling about
our haunted house.

129
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,950
Yes...

130
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,521
It is potentially a paying job.

131
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,623
By all means.

132
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,925
All right, sir, I'm
gonna work on this.

133
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,461
You have pig blood
all over you.

134
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,163
We don't know
if it's pig blood.

135
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,831
Ooh, you know what,
I didn't tell you
this, but...

136
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,133
I don't have my period anymore.

137
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,201
Oh, really?

138
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,602
That's great.

139
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,904
Do you think you can do
that for that price?

140
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,338
Yeah, absolutely.

141
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,174
Nancy, that would
be really terrific,

142
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,242
'cause, you know,
this ghost stuff,
you would not believe.

143
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,410
It's just...

144
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,678
We've seen some crazy stuff.

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,713
Yeah, I mean, okay.
Can I ask you one thing?

146
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,817
Um, this place is...
It's really bad, and,

147
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,953
um, it's not like
I believe in ghosts
or anything like that,

148
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,855
but you do have a...

149
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,024
You do have
a contingency plan, right,

150
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,293
just in case...

151
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,494
Oh, no worries.

152
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,095
I mean, we'll figure it out,

153
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,363
whatever it is.

154
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,466
Okay, great, 'cause, you know,

155
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,567
you'd literally
be saving my life.

156
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,068
Yeah.

157
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,169
Shut up.

158
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,437
Well, well.

159
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,806
You guys want to be alone?

160
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,640
Hello.

161
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,942
What are you doin', buddy?

162
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,844
What are you guys doing?
Just hanging out.

163
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,479
Creepy.

164
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,713
Um, were you just hanging out

165
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,482
with the busboy out there?

166
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,485
Who's your new friend?

167
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,653
So I was stuck in this place
for four weeks.

168
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,422
My face is peeling,
I can't take a shit.

169
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,157
Okay.

170
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,092
But it's cool, 'cause I'm
taking like 18 pills a day.

171
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,227
Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,561
18 pills a day...

173
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,462
Look, I'm sorry.
Your card was declined.

174
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,730
I tried it a couple times.

175
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,265
It'd be like
I'm on the tit, right?

176
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,700
- 'Cause it's for cash.
- Okay.

177
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,435
That's great.
Yes.

178
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,736
That's great. I can't
guarantee anything,

179
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,770
but if you can put it to rest

180
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,506
by the end of the weekend,

181
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,875
I might be able to
work out a little bonus
for you, okay?

182
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,078
That would be fantastic.

183
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,113
Okay, okay, so
tomorrow we'll see you.

184
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,281
Tomorrow.

185
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,382
6:30, meet me
at the house?

186
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,650
We can absolutely do that.

187
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,118
Great. See you then.

188
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,488
Bye.

189
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,723
Bye.

190
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,958
Did you have a good call?

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,628
Do you think every place
is your house?

192
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,098
Help me.

193
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,633
Those are like the kind of jobs

194
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,800
that you're
not supposed to take,

195
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,402
and you always take those jobs.

196
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,071
I need money,
or you can't take a shit.

197
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,473
But I couldn't... Okay!

198
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,341
So you hustled?
You hustled, right?

199
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,509
I hustled.
Yeah?

200
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,044
Yeah?

201
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,146
- Oh!
- Yeah!

202
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,616
No, I'm not gonna work
here no more, man.

203
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,784
What are you worried
about, Pedro?

204
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,519
They're coming
this weekend, man.

205
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,954
They're gonna prove
that there's no ghosts.

206
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,056
Naw, Man.
Exterminados fantasmos, man!

207
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,424
I'm not working here anymore.

208
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,559
This house is fucked up, bro.

209
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,227
What?
Come on.

210
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,106
Hey! Pedro!

211
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,509
Come on, man! Please!

212
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,478
No more chupacabra,

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,681
no more spirito,
no more diablo.

214
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,884
Pedro!

215
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,752
Manuel?

216
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,554
Javier.

217
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,256
Shit!

218
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,501
All right.

219
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,437
All right, you're
gonna be that way.

220
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,538
Be that way.
(MUFFLED LAUGHTER

221
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,440
COME ON OUT OF THERE.

222
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,609
COME ON OUT OF THERE, MAN.

223
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,183
All right, show yourself,
come on.

224
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,818
Whoa!

225
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,221
All right, where are you?

226
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,589
Come on out of there.

227
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,057
All right,
you gonna mess with me?

228
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,692
Come on out
where I can see you.

229
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,461
Come on, I'm ready for ya.
Let's go.

230
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,896
Let's go!
Come on, show your face!

231
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,264
Come on!

232
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,399
Aah!

233
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,877
♪ Now maybe

234
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:52,250
♪ I didn't mean
to treat you bad ♪

235
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,120
All right.
Old Kyser place,
let's talk about it.

236
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,055
Um, it was built in 1913.

237
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,325
There's been a history
of some reported
Satanic activity

238
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,559
going on over the years.

239
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,727
Cult rituals,
that sort of thing.

240
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,795
What kind of Satanists?

241
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,965
Aleister Crowley
or Anton Lavey?

242
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,934
Uh, I don't think the bank's hip
to that sort of thing, Gwen.

243
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,104
Um, it sat vacant
for a little while

244
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,306
till the bank hired
some maintenance crews

245
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,408
and construction guys,

246
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,809
but they keep
getting scared away

247
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,377
because of all the weird stuff
that's going on.

248
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,479
Did they order
a full package
or a half package?

249
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,947
Full package, baby.

250
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,683
Yeah. That's
my little saleslady.

251
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,619
- What's wrong, Chad?
- Are you scared?

252
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,187
No, I'm just...

253
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,356
I'm having a little trouble
with the accelerator.

254
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,058
Is that what that noise is?

255
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,926
Did you touch the accelerator?

256
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,029
No, I changed the oil
and put, uh,
antifreeze in it.

257
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,864
I didn't ask you
to change the antifreeze,

258
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,400
because it's
an air-cooled engine.

259
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,403
I...

260
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,604
Equipment, what do we got?

261
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,707
Um, we got tapes,

262
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,775
but we need a shitload
of nine-volts though...

263
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,744
It sorta...
It smells weird.

264
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,945
Chad, what are you doing?

265
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,313
Yeah, well, we gotta pull over.

266
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,715
There's something wrong
with the car.

267
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,183
Hold on, we gotta pull over.

268
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,517
Where are we?

269
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,086
Wait, we're stopping here?

270
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,831
Ah, I hate this.

271
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,871
Shit.

272
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,175
I changed this.
It's antifreeze.

273
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,643
You, you put the oil in...
It's antifreeze...

274
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,878
You put oil in it.

275
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,179
I don't drive your van, man.

276
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,314
This is any car.

277
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,648
Any car is like this.

278
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,117
No, man,
I fix robots, not vans.

279
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,785
Robots have
engines, don't they?

280
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,654
No, they don't have antifreeze.

281
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,796
Are you sure
you put it in here?

282
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,097
No, I mean, I put it
in front of this thing.

283
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,866
Ah, Jesus.
Are you on drugs, Floyd?

284
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,801
Well, that doesn't look good.

285
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,138
Looks like you might
need some coolant
or something.

286
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,307
Yeah, we've
definitely seen
better days.

287
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,209
Be happy to take a look.

288
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,412
Officer, do you know how far
it is to the Kyser place?

289
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,715
Yeah, actually
there's a pretty
good Mexican place

290
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,049
just up the road.

291
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,619
Um, they have
really good enchiladas.

292
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,089
And there's a pretty nice
little reasonable motel

293
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,924
that's attached to it, so...

294
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,194
Oh, no, again, we don't...
We don't need a motel.

295
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,729
We stay the night,
it's what we do.

296
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,330
It's part of our job, so...

297
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,000
It's like video surveillance
throughout the nighttime.

298
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,802
It's part of our deliverables.

299
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,537
Oh, yeah, I guess they
did mention something

300
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,405
about that, yeah.
I guess I thought...

301
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,941
I thought they would
send... maybe send
someone with you,

302
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,843
like a security guard.

303
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,845
Oh, well, that's not necessary.

304
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,180
We don't need that.

305
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,282
I mean, this is our job.
It's what we do.

306
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,184
Yeah, we can take
care of ourselves.

307
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,186
But, I mean, do you have
any sort of suggestions

308
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,022
or information
that you think we might
need to know that...

309
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,090
I would suggest
staying at the motel.

310
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,792
Oh...

311
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:51,062
Yeah, I really don't
think they've told y'all

312
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,397
enough about the place.

313
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,801
So how long you been
into this paranormal stuff?

314
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,505
Oh, you know,
just, like, since college.

315
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,609
I bet you wanted to be a cop
ever since you were a kid.

316
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:09,380
Ah, I don't know.
It's my job.

317
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,002
Wow.

318
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,912
Wow!

319
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,384
I mean, it's amazing.

320
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,685
It's all right.

321
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:51,956
This is beautiful.

322
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,226
This place is
totally fuckin' haunted.

323
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,030
You think the water's
okay to drink?

324
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,033
Yeah.
Yeah, it tastes fine.

325
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,480
Maybe the guy from the bank
is here already.

326
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,216
Yeah, I didn't see
any other cars,

327
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,452
so I think
you guys might be
on your own, actually.

328
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,421
Oh, that's fine.

329
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,889
That's not a problem.

330
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,527
I have a little bit of time.

331
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,930
I could show you around
a little bit if you want.

332
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,232
Yeah. Yeah, that
would actually be great.

333
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,034
I'm sure you'd be better at it

334
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,702
than the guys
from the bank anyway.

335
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,003
Yeah, maybe.

336
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,405
You know, it looks
like the bank's

337
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,140
actually done a pretty good job
of cleaning it up,

338
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,309
because they want to sell it.

339
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,245
But they can't keep
maintenance people around.

340
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:51,582
Hence, a pile of sticks
on the floor.

341
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,351
That's a pentagram.

342
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,121
Yeah, that figures.

343
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,657
Kids are always
breaking in here
with their Ouija boards,

344
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,092
doing their little ceremonies,

345
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,328
trying to scare each other.

346
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,463
Do you know
what kind of occult practices

347
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,131
they're using?

348
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,567
Uh, sticks
on the floor, I guess.

349
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,806
Apparently, a place
is empty long enough,

350
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,574
they forget
it's private property.

351
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,311
Do you know any actual history

352
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,746
about the place
that you could tell us?

353
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,348
It actually has a pretty
interesting history.

354
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,350
There are these people,
the Kysers,

355
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,185
buy the place
back in the fifties

356
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,320
after they come
into a bunch of oil money,

357
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,955
which they apparently took as

358
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,224
some kind of sign
from God or something.

359
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,060
They have this big conversion,

360
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,029
and they have some vision

361
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,965
that this is holy ground
or something,

362
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,768
so they buy the place,
put up a church.

363
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,969
What kind of church?

364
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,904
It was, uh...
It was Christian.

365
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:51,909
Did have a little
bit of Eastern religion
mixed in there.

366
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,344
It was actually pretty popular

367
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,980
with people from
the town for a while.

368
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,749
And then it became unpopular.

369
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,384
Why is that?

370
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,219
Well, you know, some
of the people from town

371
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,887
got weirded out, I guess,

372
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,990
by the whole
Eastern religion thing.

373
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,792
People started saying
it was a cult.

374
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:11,295
It was around that time
that the county decided

375
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,898
they wanted to take
the land to build a mall.

376
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,968
That fireplace is
off the charts.

377
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,737
They had a little school here

378
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,372
that went with their church.

379
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,640
Wasn't bad.

380
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,743
Parents actually had me
out here for a little while.

381
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,412
You went to school here?

382
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,148
Yeah, I was in class
with their daughter Mona.

383
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,116
She wasn't a bad kid.

384
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,852
But, uh, yeah, until
my parents pulled me out.

385
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,487
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

386
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,257
Well,
supposedly the Kysers were
pretty nasty drunks

387
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,692
before their
whole religious conversion.

388
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:45,863
So I guess with the cult rumors
and the, uh, land dispute,

389
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,332
they, uh, got back
on the sauce,

390
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,736
and their kids
started showing up places

391
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,873
with weird marks
on their faces,
shit like that.

392
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,942
So they liked to party, huh?

393
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,978
You do the math.

394
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,020
Anyway,
there's a really cool
staircase over here.

395
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,627
Some really nice
metalwork right here.

396
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,262
Pretty ornate.

397
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,764
Yeah, I was... I was
thinking the same thing.

398
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,132
It's pretty ornate.

399
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,000
Solid oak banister,
too, I believe.

400
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,969
So whatever happened
to the Kyser family?

401
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:30,308
Uh, all that stuff
with the land dispute
and the cult stuff

402
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,009
just kind of got
more and more ugly,

403
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,445
and, uh, next thing you know,

404
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,782
people are saying
that they're Satanists.

405
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,853
They're trying to indoctrinate
kids into Satanism,

406
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,155
involving them
in animal sacrifices.

407
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:47,892
I never saw
any animal sacrifices, but...

408
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,995
Now, obviously, no mall.

409
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,030
Who is this guy?

410
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,936
So people
started saying the state

411
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,304
should take custody
of the kids,

412
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,106
and, next thing you know,

413
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,977
Mona and Frankie Kyser
disappear.

414
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,745
And, naturally,
everyone starts saying

415
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,983
that their parents sacrificed
their kids to the Devil

416
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,818
and burned them up
in the incinerator.

417
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,755
Police show up
a few days later
to investigate,

418
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,124
nobody's here,

419
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,793
and, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kyser

420
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:27,465
turn up in a motel room
a few miles away, dead.

421
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,735
Mrs. Kyser had her head
bashed in with a TV,

422
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:34,071
and Mr. Kyser had, uh,
blown his brains out.

423
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,374
Blah!
Aah!

424
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,142
God damn it, Floyd!

425
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:42,213
Kids come in here and get
all high on whatever,

426
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,183
say they see ghosts, demons.

427
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,654
Kid fell out this window
and broke his neck.

428
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,328
We gotta put
a camera in this room.

429
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,398
They found a leg over here.

430
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,134
Has anyone lived
here since the Kysers?

431
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,669
Yeah, about 15 years ago,

432
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,070
there was a couple
that lived here.

433
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,705
What happened to them?

434
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,373
They died.

435
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,977
Multiple stab wounds
to each other.

436
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,913
In the kitchen is
where we found them.

437
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,349
Well, this place is fucked up.

438
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,886
It's a pain in my ass,
tell you that much.

439
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:27,124
There's people say
that the Kysers opened
up a gate to Hell.

440
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,060
I don't know about that,

441
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,196
but if you guys
find it, maybe you can
charge admission.

442
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,778
Gate to Hell, gate to Hell.

443
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,047
Gate to Hell, that's it!
This place is evil.

444
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,515
The Kysers were Satanists,

445
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,618
so they they built their school
on hallowed ground

446
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,120
and indoctrinated
the children into blood rituals

447
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,521
so they could open
a gate to Hell.

448
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,990
They fear God.

449
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,424
Oh, my God.
My God!

450
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,659
They sacrificed
their own children

451
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,361
to appease
the Prince of Darkness!

452
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,662
They will possess
the weak-minded.

453
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,796
I must warn Floyd!

454
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,565
I must not fear. Must not fear.
I must not fear.

455
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,468
Fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

456
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,779
Guys!

457
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,457
Yeah, so what'd
you think so far?

458
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,259
I think it's amazing.

459
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,094
I'm really excited.

460
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,664
Well, I know what
you're gonna say next.

461
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,665
That, you know...

462
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,866
Oh.

463
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,235
You're professionals,
and this is what you do...

464
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:46,404
You got it.
And you're fine,

465
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,905
staying here all night,

466
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:52,143
but I wouldn't mind stopping by
when my shift is over,

467
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,778
if that's okay.

468
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,112
Yeah.

469
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,280
It would make me feel better.

470
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,448
This place is for real, guys.

471
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,549
Why don't we put
a camera on him?

472
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,551
Can you not do that, please?

473
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,053
Are they flirting?

474
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,120
Nope.

475
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,955
Are you jealous?

476
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,258
No, I'm over that.

477
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,259
Okay.

478
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,493
I have my card here,

479
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,162
if you need anything
in the meantime.

480
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:15,533
It does have
my car phone number,

481
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,101
as well as my office phone.

482
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,235
Got it.

483
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:22,540
So if you need anything at all,

484
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,975
feel free to call
either of those numbers.

485
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,977
All right, I will.

486
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,245
I'm sure we'll be fine.

487
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:31,782
Okay, well...

488
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,417
I'll see you later.

489
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,019
All right, I'll see you later.

490
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,153
Okay, bye.

491
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,621
Bye.

492
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,563
Okay, before we go any further,

493
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,698
can we just acknowledge

494
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,634
that there's really
something in this house
that's real?

495
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,737
There's something here,
and we're gonna
capture it.

496
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,071
If we're gonna
capture something,

497
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,573
it's gonna happen
tonight, okay?

498
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,907
Yeah, listen,
absolutely, I agree.
Can you not do that?

499
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,776
Hey, Floyd...
You're a fucking child!

500
00:22:58,778 --> 00:22:59,977
Would you go find where
to turn the electricity on,

501
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,245
so we can get to work?

502
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,246
Please?

503
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,314
All right.
Thank you.

504
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,448
Goin' to work.

505
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,016
Come on, Hamlet.
See?

506
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,653
Come on, Hambone.

507
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,228
Our work's never done, man.

508
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,296
Let's go.

509
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,539
Huh.

510
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,509
"Hey, Floyd,
go turn on the power.

511
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,245
"Hey, Floyd, fix the van.

512
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,314
Hey, guys, go fuck yourself."

513
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,153
Huh.

514
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,355
Well, I don't see shit.

515
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:47,057
Hey, check it out, Hambone.

516
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,563
It's the Kyser family
incinerator.

517
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,702
Here, kiddy, kiddy.

518
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,672
Well, there definitely was
not a party in here.

519
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,714
Well, this is creepy.

520
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,820
What the fuck?

521
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,095
Huh.

522
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,936
Chad?

523
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,309
Hi.

524
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,543
I'm gonna grab some things.

525
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,878
I'm telling you, babe,

526
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,980
I felt something
in that first room,

527
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:43,814
the dining room,

528
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,449
unlike any of the other places.

529
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,318
Did you feel it right here?

530
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,819
No, I didn't
feel it back there.

531
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,020
I'm telling you.
I told you so...

532
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,583
You sure? Maybe you
felt it right, oh...

533
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,406
Huh.

534
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,411
Goddamn flashlight.

535
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,586
I can promise
you this, Hambone.

536
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,593
We are not going in there.

537
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,334
Can we please not stay
in the pentagram room?

538
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,503
This looks exactly
like the pentagram

539
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,005
in the '52 incident
in Manhattan Beach.

540
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,139
You guys remember it?

541
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,707
It wasn't facing north,
just like this one.

542
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,209
This one's facing north.

543
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,677
North-ish.

544
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,580
It looks like a soccer
ball made out of twigs.

545
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,115
No, this is the top,
right here.

546
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,517
Floyd, did you put
lights on my microphone?

547
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,252
Yes, I did.

548
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,655
I thought they'd match
your sweater vest, Chadwick.

549
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,624
Jeez. Thanks.

550
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,306
Blah!
Aah!

551
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,975
Shit.

552
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,144
No, Floyd, I need it more...

553
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,614
It's fine.
It's all the way open.

554
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,415
I need it more
to the right.
It's fine.

555
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,417
I really think it's important
to get the bathroom over here.

556
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,020
It's all the way open, and
it's wide, Crimson, okay?

557
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:04,388
Let it go.
Oh, you know what?

558
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,589
This is what I do.

559
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,957
Please, really
don't call me that.

560
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,258
What do you
want me to call you?

561
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,227
Come on, we got
more lights to set up.

562
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,261
Aw!

563
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,280
Hello?
Can you hear me?

564
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,753
Hello?
Can you hear me?

565
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:42,192
Can you hear me?

566
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,986
Is that you, Mona?

567
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,790
Mona Kyser?

568
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:18,395
May I speak to Mona
or Frankie Kyser?

569
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,917
Spirits of this house,
please give me a sign.

570
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,121
Spirits of this house,

571
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:55,225
if you can hear me,
knock two times.

572
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,395
Chad?

573
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,938
Mona?

574
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,854
Mona?

575
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:27,291
Are you singing to me, Mona?

576
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,166
Would you like to sing for me?

577
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,434
My name is Chad.

578
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,507
Mona?

579
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,910
What?

580
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,220
Sing to me again.

581
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,833
Aah!

582
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,902
There's something
that we don't understand

583
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,203
that is going on in this house.

584
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,405
This place is dangerous, okay?

585
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,242
- We need to get out of here.
- Worry too much.

586
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,444
Gwen, look, I... I can't
stay here. I'm gonna go.

587
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,712
You can stay here.
I want you to stay here.

588
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,213
Are you serious?

589
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,848
I'm gonna take the van.
What are you afraid of?

590
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,416
I'll be back
in the morning, I'm sorry.

591
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,651
- I just cannot do it.
- Hey, my shit's in that van.

592
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:28,852
I'm gonna leave.

593
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,020
Don't be a pussy.
I'm sorry.

594
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,022
Hey.
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

595
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,191
Yeah, what?
Okay.
All right, okay.

596
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,897
Maybe there is something.

597
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,432
I'm not... I'm not saying
that there is,

598
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,101
but what if there is?

599
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,304
What if there is,
and what if we find it

600
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,407
and record it
and can verify it?

601
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,541
Floyd!

602
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,277
What if we can do that?

603
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,479
And that would
be worth so much more.

604
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,847
It's not about money.

605
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,048
This is not
about money right now.

606
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,483
Okay, it's not about money.

607
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,852
What is the one thing
you told me you've wanted

608
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,421
ever since you were a kid, huh?

609
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,622
The one thing?

610
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,958
Uh, antifreeze.

611
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,227
He wants antifreeze
for his vagina.

612
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:13,997
That you wanted to see a ghost.

613
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,768
And now, it's a possibility.

614
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,469
Are you seriously telling me

615
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,406
that you're willing
to just give it up right now

616
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,540
when you're so close?

617
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,610
I mean...

618
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,312
Please stay.

619
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,356
Okay.

620
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,924
Okay.

621
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,462
Remember when it used
to be just me and you?

622
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,596
I mean, it was us.

623
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,966
Is this about me and Chad?

624
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,567
Come on, Gwen.

625
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,635
Or is it about Floyd?

626
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,370
Because I warned you about him.

627
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,405
Okay, well, I warned
you about Chad.

628
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,642
Yeah, but Chad and I
are still together.

629
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,278
Yeah, I am painfully
aware of that.

630
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,014
Guess we've gone
a little Scooby-Doo.

631
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,649
We used to be more
like The Galloping Ghost.

632
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,317
Mm-hmm.

633
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,654
Two girls conquering
the world's unsolved mysteries.

634
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,191
I thought you
never watched television.

635
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,260
I don't.

636
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,681
Why don't you give me a treat?

637
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,183
I fed Hamlet.

638
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,966
He was hungry.

639
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,206
Mmm, this tastes good.

640
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,545
Why don't you give me a treat?

641
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,715
Are you okay?

642
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:53,123
I'm a good boy.

643
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:58,662
Nancy's my favorite,
but Floyd feeds me,

644
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,465
'cause I'm a good boy.

645
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,699
I'm a good boy!

646
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,769
Scratch me.

647
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:09,039
Just behind my ear,
it's my spot.

648
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,508
Want to go chase a car?

649
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,709
I like chasing cars.

650
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,046
Fuck you!

651
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,221
Don't fuckin' touch me.

652
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,623
I'm cool, man.

653
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,225
I'm cool, I'm cool.

654
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,893
Don't you fuckin' touch me.

655
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,795
I'm cool, man.
Don't.

656
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,599
I'm cool, I'm cool,
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

657
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:39,769
I'm cool.

658
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,973
I'm cool, man.

659
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,808
Okay.

660
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,444
Whoo, all right, I am feeling

661
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,779
a little buzzy from that cig.

662
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,448
Yeah, we never
should have quit.

663
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,516
No kidding.

664
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,684
Help me up.

665
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:55,852
Fuck!

666
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,989
Oh, my God, did...

667
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,257
Oh, my God.
Well, we have light.

668
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,725
We have light.
Give me that.

669
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:02,726
Is Chad upstairs?

670
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,128
I...don't think so.

671
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,297
We did not turn on the lights.

672
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,166
This guy is fuckin' possessed!

673
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,200
Oh, come on.

674
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,234
The lights came on somehow

675
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,369
that had nothing to do with us!

676
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,304
I'm not possessed
It was a joke.

677
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,106
I'm telling you, this place
is fucking haunted, man!

678
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,307
We came to
a fuckin' haunted house!

679
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,975
This is a real
fucking haunted house!

680
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,577
Chad, chill out it's okay.

681
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,312
I'm telling you, man,
this is a fucking crazy place.

682
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,014
Floyd, did you
turn the electricity on?

683
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,182
No...
Yeah, okay, look.

684
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,249
It's just a joke.

685
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,350
We're just gonna calm down,

686
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,818
and we're gonna go upstairs.

687
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,387
Someone turned the lights on,
it wasn't us.

688
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,621
We're gonna figure out
who it was.

689
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,455
Oh, God!

690
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,857
Maybe it was a ghost.
God!

691
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,425
Wouldn't that be interesting,
if it was a ghost?

692
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,560
Come on.

693
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,827
I need you
to tell me right now,

694
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,895
are you fucking with him again?

695
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:39,963
I need you to tell me.

696
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,031
No.

697
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,365
Don't be scared, Chad.

698
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,768
Hey, Floyd,
suck my fuckin' cock.

699
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,603
He's just a scaredy-cat.

700
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,439
Floyd, are you
fucking with him?

701
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,242
Yeah.

702
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,443
You're fucking with him?

703
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,579
Yeah, totally.
Don't fuck with him.

704
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,147
It's funny, though.

705
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,186
But I didn't
turn on the lights.

706
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,775
Did you hear that?

707
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,978
Nope.

708
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,546
I heard something.

709
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,154
That's the window
the kids fell out of.

710
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,891
Man.

711
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,660
Séances are weird.

712
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:48,598
You know, they get all
these leaves from someplace.

713
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,601
It's like, they just want
to connect with something.

714
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,136
That's the same paraphernalia

715
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,739
from that '74 incident
in Munich.

716
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,073
These kids aren't
fucking around.

717
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,341
They bring in this stuff,

718
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,809
and they sit there,
and they actually chant.

719
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,244
They actually call up
something evil.

720
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:05,215
No, they just want
to connect with stuff.

721
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:07,684
I love that you know
about these things,

722
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,386
and I also...

723
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,354
I love that you can
feel things, Chad, you know?

724
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,390
Because I don't feel
that stuff.

725
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,191
I wish I did that.
I don't do that.

726
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,961
I'm always thinking, you know?

727
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,565
I just want to feel things.

728
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,934
And you don't think.

729
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,237
You're not always thinking
all the time, like me.

730
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,471
You know,
I'm always in my mind.

731
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,874
I don't feel.
I don't just like...

732
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,375
feel things.

733
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,576
You feel things.

734
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,611
No, I don't.

735
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:38,214
No, cold spots.
Hot spots, right?

736
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,450
See, you walk into
a room in this house,

737
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,619
and it's like somebody
turned up the thermostat.

738
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:47,691
You know, I start...
I start sweating, and, uh,

739
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:51,795
as I have these, like,
heart palpitations
or something.

740
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,697
And it's just like,
there's just something...

741
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,900
There's... There's
something really
significant going on.

742
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,569
You know, I just want to feel
like I'm inside of this place.

743
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,605
I just want to be close.
I just want to love.

744
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,542
Oh, I just want to be
so close to it.

745
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,477
I want to be like an insect,

746
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,212
and all of my six legs
are gonna gonna touch

747
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,014
the whole inside of this house.

748
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,551
Uh...

749
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,453
What...

750
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,452
It's just kids. Ahem.

751
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:34,397
There ain't shit going on.

752
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,974
All right.

753
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,344
Put some music on.

754
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,393
All the virgins
in all the stories,

755
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:06,129
all the virgins,
they were sacrificed.

756
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,934
Pull it tighter.

757
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,705
Look at me.

758
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:23,980
Whoo.

759
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,040
♪ I've got this feeling

760
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,776
♪ You've got the tools

761
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,490
That's a party.

762
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,007
Come on!
Creepy shit!

763
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,408
Creepy shit!

764
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,584
Chad, you look
like you're on fire.

765
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,197
Chad, you all right?

766
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,567
There was a creep.

767
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,936
Nance, what the fuck?

768
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,607
Ah, fuck!

769
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,209
What the fuck?

770
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,086
Stupid fucking cunt!

771
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,458
Hey, man, tell me there was
a fuckin' ghost or demon

772
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,693
who set my fuckin' van on fire!

773
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:24,894
No, I was going
up there to tell you guys

774
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:25,962
there was something
in the fucking room!

775
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,430
Why the fuck did you do that?

776
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,265
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

777
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,833
You're completely right.

778
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,935
It is all my fault, and I
am a stupid fucking cunt.

779
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,137
No, you can't
talk to Nancy like that.

780
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,973
You used my fucking
equipment and my van

781
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:38,841
to try and disprove
something I believe in,

782
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,743
so I'm the big
fucking joke tonight!

783
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:43,246
I'm gonna make it right!
I'm gonna fix it!

784
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,480
Good, you should!

785
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:45,648
Okay!
You guys
need to calm down!

786
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,216
Look, it's not your fault.

787
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,885
Yes, it is my fault,
and I'm really sorry.

788
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,153
You fucking try
to disprove it every day!

789
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,788
You are making
a fucking joke of me!

790
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,456
I'm a big fucking joke!

791
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,124
Everyone thinks it's hilarious.

792
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,427
Would you listen to me?!
I'm gonna make it better!

793
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:58,761
No!
Hey, guys?

794
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,396
Hey, guys! Hey!

795
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,831
Hey!
You're not a joke!

796
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:02,899
Hey!

797
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,233
So when I was working
on the van

798
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,169
and you guys were
chatting with the cop,

799
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,904
I got rid of my stash.

800
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,573
I threw my pipe in the cooler,

801
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,409
and I put my bag of acid
in this Thermos.

802
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,711
Fuck, Floyd.

803
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,746
I filled that with water.

804
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,849
We're on acid, Floyd?!

805
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,084
It's cool.
It's okay!

806
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,885
It's okay!
It's low-grade stuff!

807
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,253
It means we're tripping balls!

808
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,655
Okay, okay, okay.
We're just seeing shit!

809
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,223
Look, look.
That's all it means!

810
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,791
This is good news!

811
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:31,160
So what you're telling
me is that the van

812
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:34,130
could potentially
not be on fire
out there right now?

813
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,732
No, I'm not saying that.
The van's on fire.

814
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,900
I'm saying you guys
are tripping balls,

815
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,302
and it's cool... No, no!

816
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:40,336
Fucking asshole!

817
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,437
Hey! Hey!
No!

818
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,605
You have fucked me!

819
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:43,906
You have fucking lost it, man!

820
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,374
Don't fucking touch me!

821
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,642
You need to calm down!

822
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:47,944
You're a whore, okay?

823
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,512
You guys just need
to calm down.
What?

824
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,580
It's low-grade shit.
You're a whore.

825
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,981
I'm gonna fucking kill you

826
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:52,982
before the night's over, man!

827
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,283
No, you guys are tripping!

828
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,119
Motherfucker,
I will fucking kill you

829
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,754
if you come near me again!

830
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,622
All right.
Fucking asshole.

831
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,124
I'm out.

832
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,826
What did you call me, Chad?

833
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,295
I called you a whore.

834
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:11,701
I'm gonna assume this is
coming out of... you're upset?

835
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,371
No, it's coming out
of you being a whore.

836
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:20,610
Don't you ever
call me that again.

837
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:23,045
I'm gonna go get
our clothes now,

838
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:27,150
and when I get back,
I expect an apology.

839
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,256
God damn you!

840
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,225
Fuck!

841
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,861
Fuck!

842
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,179
Nancy.
Floyd.

843
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,413
Look, fuck Chad.

844
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,348
He's a dumb-ass.
He doesn't know shit.

845
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,783
Just go back inside, okay?

846
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,018
I don't even know why
you're coming out here.

847
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,886
Look, I'm sorry about the van.

848
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,588
I'm sorry about the van.

849
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,089
I'm sorry about the acid.

850
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:10,560
You're just fli...
You're flipping out.

851
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,161
You're just tripping.
It's cool, calm down.

852
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,930
Okay, I just don't know
why you're out here.

853
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,998
I just want you
to go back inside, okay?

854
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,268
I just want to be
out here by myself.

855
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,436
What are you doing?

856
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,804
I'm standing here.

857
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm gonna sleep
in the fucking fountain.

858
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,946
You're not gonna sleep
in the fountain.

859
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:31,914
Yeah, I am. I'm gonna
sleep in the fountain.

860
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,749
All right, then
I'm gonna stay with you.

861
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,151
No, don't stay with me.

862
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,687
I don't need you to stay
with me, all right?

863
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,522
I don't even know
why you would want to.

864
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,490
I'm fucking everything up.

865
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,892
Everyone is here because of me.

866
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:45,228
Everything is my fault.

867
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,701
Look, I'm here because of you.

868
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,102
Yeah.

869
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,470
Don't.

870
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,840
I know that sucks,
but I'm here 'cause of you.

871
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,377
It's okay.
Will you calm down?

872
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,646
It's gonna be fine.

873
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:06,015
Just concentrate on my voice.

874
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,817
Just calm down.

875
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,686
See? Just have fun.

876
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,388
Just have fun.

877
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,357
It's okay.

878
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,997
You sure?

879
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,532
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

880
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:47,657
Well, I predicted it, didn't I?

881
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,358
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't know.

882
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,060
Like, it just seemed like...
You didn't know?

883
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,561
I told you this place
was dangerous.
I know.

884
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,230
And now we're here,
and we're stuck here.

885
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:56,132
But you get
that feeling a lot, Chad.

886
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:57,833
Like, I can't believe
that every single time
you get a feeling.

887
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,402
I made it a big deal.
I made it clear.

888
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:00,436
Yeah.

889
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,604
So we're stuck.

890
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,205
I know.

891
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,676
Look, what are we doing here?

892
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:09,011
I don't know, I mean,

893
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,746
I think we're gonna try to...

894
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:11,847
Gwen.

895
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,215
We're gonna...

896
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,851
What we're gonna do
is we're gonna... walk.

897
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,020
I mean, that's what we...
We have each other.

898
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:19,221
It's gonna be fine.

899
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,290
We're gonna get the van fixed.

900
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,193
This is bullshit, okay?

901
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:27,630
I know.
This is bullshit.

902
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,664
What?

903
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,633
What is this?

904
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,935
What is... What is what?

905
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:36,238
What we have.

906
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,573
Chad, you're my boyfriend.

907
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,276
You're my lover.

908
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,877
I'm the money.
You're my...

909
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,916
Yeah, I can't do this.

910
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:48,484
I don't know,
you're doing pretty good.

911
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,152
No, not this. This.

912
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,488
I can't do this anymore.

913
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,556
The group.

914
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,660
I can't do it anymore.
I quit.

915
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,763
You quit?

916
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:01,964
Yeah, I quit.

917
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,466
What the fuck are you gonna do?

918
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,534
I don't know, I'm gonna
do something else.

919
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,704
You can't do something else.

920
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,741
Well, I know that, because
I'm not good at anything.

921
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:14,310
No, there's
no such thing as ghosts,

922
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,445
and you're really good
at not finding them.

923
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,515
Well, I want to be really good
at finding something.

924
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,051
Okay.

925
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,553
You gotta take me with you.

926
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,022
Floyd.
Look, I know,
I know, I know.

927
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,356
I know, I know.

928
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,291
Look, I don't care
about any of this.

929
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,359
I don't care about any of this.

930
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,261
I only care about you.
Aw.

931
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,163
And Hamlet.
I don't care about
any of this stuff.

932
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,632
I... I just...
Just take me with you.

933
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,669
I don't know, Floyd.
Come on, no, no, no.

934
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,970
Come on.
I don't know.

935
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:42,471
I don't know if we
can do this again.

936
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,206
No, I won't... I...

937
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,878
Is that a car?

938
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,947
Floyd, that's a car.

939
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,817
Tell me you have
a Slim Jim in that bag.

940
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:58,554
I totally have
a Slim Jim in this bag.

941
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,091
I cannot tell
what's real anymore.

942
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,960
I have just entered this home,

943
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:09,265
where I actually
felt something that I
really wanted to feel,

944
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:11,600
and I don't know
if it was real or not.

945
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:16,439
Look, I know I've just
taken a tab of acid,

946
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,574
and I've never done it before,

947
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,944
but I don't know.

948
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:24,113
Now we've gotten...

949
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:26,315
Look where we've
gotten with this.

950
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:28,150
Chad...

951
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:30,686
are you breaking up with me?

952
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:35,157
I can't lose you, Chad, okay?

953
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,763
You're like... You make me
feel like a full person.

954
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,531
I don't always feel that way.

955
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,133
And I really...

956
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:47,636
I didn't mean to cheat on you.

957
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,407
I'm sorry.

958
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,518
Look, this probably isn't
the right forum for this.

959
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,886
Chad, I love you.

960
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,521
I love you.

961
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,892
I'm just gonna lie
down with this dog,

962
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,560
because he loves me
unconditionally,

963
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:14,330
and he's beautiful,
and he doesn't cheat
on me, either.

964
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,500
Mm, I love you, Hamlet.

965
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:33,048
Can you confirm
that this dog is
eating a human hand?

966
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,686
You got it?

967
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:38,921
Floyd!
What?!

968
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,356
Over here!

969
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,292
Where'd this come from?
We found a hand.

970
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,161
We found a human hand.
You found a what?

971
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,762
You're tripping balls, man.
We got a car, though.

972
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:48,030
Hamlet got it.
Hamlet?

973
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,098
- We got a car.
- It was in his mouth.

974
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,366
I got this, though.
I got this.

975
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:52,968
Where did this come from?
Hey, Hambone.

976
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,403
Whose car is this?

977
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,605
Can you get in?

978
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,340
Floyd!

979
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,376
Oh. We gotta get
the fuck out of here, man!

980
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:01,911
We have got to get
the fuck out of here!

981
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,179
Floyd, you gotta get that open!

982
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,246
Hang on, hang on!

983
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,281
I got it!

984
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:06,715
I got it, I got it, I got it!

985
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:07,950
Oh, yeah, man!

986
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,218
Open the back, please!

987
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,086
You got a Slim Jim in that bag,

988
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,354
and you don't have a knife.

989
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,622
We don't have a knife.

990
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,525
Did anybody find
the fucking keys?

991
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,194
Don't focus on the keys,

992
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,695
focus on hotwiring the car.

993
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,764
Yeah, I can hotwire
the car, Chad.

994
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:24,133
Mike Ryan. Mike Ryan.

995
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,336
The guy from the bank.

996
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,004
What, do you need,
a fucking screwdriver?

997
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:30,940
- Where the fuck are the keys?
- The guy from the bank.

998
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,042
Where the fuck is he?

999
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,376
Yeah, where is he?

1000
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,078
'Cause we'd really
like to use his car.

1001
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,813
Floyd, pop the trunk, please.

1002
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,116
Fuck! Oh, damn it.

1003
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,886
Okay, Floyd,
pop the trunk, please.

1004
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,324
Pop the trunk, Floyd!

1005
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,326
I don't know where it is!

1006
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,392
Floyd, pop the trunk!

1007
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,661
Stop fucking yelling.

1008
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,164
You found pliers?

1009
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,498
Yeah.

1010
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,136
Hey, guys...
Hey, guys.

1011
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,376
Hey, guys, I think
the banker's
in the trunk.

1012
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,479
What?

1013
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,015
I think
the banker's in the trunk.

1014
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,450
Fuck you.

1015
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,802
Oh, fuck, man.

1016
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,172
What the fuck?

1017
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,442
Okay, um, I'm gonna
go call that cop.

1018
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,846
You... You gotta
check him for keys.

1019
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,917
Sorry, man.

1020
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,458
Customer service,
this is David.

1021
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,694
Our records show
a past due balance
on your phone.

1022
00:54:58,696 --> 00:54:59,662
No.

1023
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:00,929
But if you have
a major credit card,

1024
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,131
I'd be happy to take that.

1025
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,099
Okay, I'm trying to reach 911.

1026
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,602
Um, I'm sorry, 911
doesn't appear to be
the number you called.

1027
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:08,270
No. Okay,
I'm aware of that.

1028
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:09,638
I'm just trying
to reach the police.

1029
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,472
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,374
Then... then
can you just...

1031
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,276
Then can you just
patch me through to 911?

1032
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,779
I would really need
some form of payment.

1033
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,581
Get his back pocket.

1034
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:24,119
My records show that you
are over $300 past due.

1035
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,421
I'm very sorry.

1036
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:28,190
Can you please just
put me through to 911?

1037
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,491
I can take your information

1038
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,959
and try to get you
at the front
of the line.

1039
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,362
I cannot do that right now!
It is an emergency!

1040
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,831
Just please,
can you get me 911?!

1041
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,412
Th... There's...

1042
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,214
There's someone at the house!

1043
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:54,783
Guys, there's someone
at the house!

1044
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,219
Motherfucker! Hey!

1045
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,287
Hamlet!
Hamlet!

1046
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,588
They went upstairs!

1047
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,757
He's upstairs!
Guys, he's upstairs!

1048
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,704
Hamlet!

1049
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:16,739
Hamlet!

1050
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:17,806
Hamlet?

1051
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,908
Hamlet!

1052
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,812
Hamlet!

1053
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,268
Fuck!
Do you see him?

1054
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,269
No!

1055
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,303
Hamlet!

1056
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,744
Hamlet?

1057
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,897
No, come on, Hamlet!

1058
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:18,801
Gwen!

1059
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,640
Nancy?

1060
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,675
- Gwen?
- Hamlet!

1061
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,509
Nancy!

1062
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,813
Floyd? Hamlet?

1063
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,247
Hamlet?

1064
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,282
Chad?

1065
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:36,718
Nancy?

1066
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,989
Gwen?

1067
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,358
Floyd?

1068
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,327
Hamlet!

1069
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,396
Hamlet!

1070
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:48,764
Hamlet.

1071
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,034
Floyd?

1072
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:55,437
Chad!

1073
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,974
Chad?

1074
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,809
Gwen?

1075
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,313
Gwen?

1076
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,048
Oh!
Shh!

1077
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,516
Fucking hell.

1078
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,766
Hamlet!

1079
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,237
Chad?

1080
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,471
Hamlet!

1081
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,807
Hamlet!

1082
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,041
Hamlet!

1083
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:37,546
I swear to fucking God,
he came in this room.

1084
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,963
That didn't sound good.

1085
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,485
Tell me you shut this door.

1086
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,353
No.

1087
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,455
Fuck, man.

1088
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,094
No, no, no.

1089
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,200
What the fuck, man?

1090
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,936
What the fuck?

1091
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,877
It's fucking blood.

1092
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,555
Mother... Get him!

1093
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,690
Chad!

1094
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,696
What the fuck, man.

1095
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,904
Unh! You killed
my fucking dog?!

1096
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:11,006
What the fuck is wrong
with you?!

1097
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,975
Fuck you! Fuck!

1098
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,376
You shit! Fuck!

1099
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,212
You want to die?
Die!

1100
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,348
Chad, stop!

1101
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,116
Chad, stop!

1102
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,319
Chad!

1103
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,957
Waah!

1104
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,302
Come on!

1105
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,938
No, Chad!

1106
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,606
Get in there!

1107
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,277
Get the dresser,
get the dresser!

1108
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,347
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1109
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,985
Get down. Shh, shh!

1110
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,854
Turn your lights off,
turn your lights off!

1111
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,003
Shh.

1112
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,508
What the fuck, man.

1113
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,748
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1114
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,723
What the fuck...

1115
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,796
Fuckin' prick.

1116
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,908
It's okay.

1117
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,443
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1118
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:31,446
Fuck, man.

1119
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,111
Someone's outside.

1120
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:07,282
Yeah, what is it?

1121
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,416
It's that cop.

1122
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:16,151
Help me open it.

1123
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,424
Shh, shh!

1124
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:23,758
We gotta get out.

1125
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,694
We gotta get out of here.

1126
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,095
We gotta get out.

1127
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,833
We gotta get out.

1128
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:35,170
We're gonna get out,
We're gonna get out.

1129
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,645
Shh, shh, shh!

1130
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,146
No!

1131
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,848
What the fuck are you doing?

1132
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,496
Okay.

1133
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,766
Okay, okay.

1134
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:06,935
We're gonna get out of here.

1135
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,476
We're gonna get out.

1136
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:17,112
We're gonna get out.
We're gonna get out.

1137
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,080
We're gonna get out.
We're gonna get out.

1138
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:22,417
Gwen, give me that ax.

1139
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,120
We're gonna get out.

1140
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,821
Gwen, give me the fuckin' ax.

1141
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:27,956
We're gonna get out.
Hey, Gwen.

1142
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,725
Come on, give me the ax.

1143
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,827
Okay.

1144
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,363
Gwen, give me the fucking ax.

1145
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,832
Gwen, give him the ax.

1146
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,570
Gwen, give me the fucking ax.

1147
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,739
No.

1148
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,641
Gwen. Gwen!

1149
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:48,476
Gwen!

1150
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,545
No.
Okay... okay...

1151
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,148
Shut the fuck up.
You're gonna get us killed.

1152
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,439
Floyd, it's the cop.

1153
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:20,642
No!

1154
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:23,445
Fuck, man!

1155
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,614
Man! Fuck!

1156
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,064
Run!

1157
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,402
Aah!
Aah!

1158
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,009
Let me the fuck out!

1159
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,457
Nancy!

1160
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,576
Fuck you, man!

1161
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,683
Nancy!

1162
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:39,554
Floyd! Floyd!

1163
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,358
No! No!

1164
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,261
He's taking me!

1165
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:48,563
[sobbing) I can't get it.

1166
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,970
Fuck!

1167
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,908
Okay, okay, okay...

1168
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,043
No!
Shh! Gwen! Gwen!

1169
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,281
I... I need you to help me.

1170
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:07,849
I need you to reach around

1171
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,417
and get the fucking thing.

1172
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,387
Okay? Come on.

1173
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,131
God!

1174
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,204
Shh. Quiet.

1175
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,672
Let's open it up.

1176
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:31,840
There's a thing up there.

1177
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,274
There's a thing up there.

1178
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:35,877
Come on, let's go.

1179
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,645
Come with me.

1180
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,199
Where are your friends?

1181
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,200
Where are your friends?

1182
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,368
They're dead.

1183
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,203
They chopped his head off.

1184
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:05,907
Who's that?
Who's in the house?

1185
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,008
Ghosts.

1186
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,577
He doesn't have a face.

1187
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,354
He doesn't have a face.

1188
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,789
Shh. Shut up.

1189
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,629
Freeze, muthafucka!

1190
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,836
I got him.

1191
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,571
Let's go out the side door.

1192
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,583
Do you have something?

1193
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,719
Get back.

1194
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,755
No, wait.

1195
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,021
Did you call for backup?

1196
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,523
Yeah, it's gonna be awhile.

1197
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,834
Okay.

1198
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:41,102
Come on! Hurry up!

1199
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,740
Aah! Aah!

1200
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,517
Let's go.

1201
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,355
Fuck. All right.

1202
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,545
Let's go.

1203
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:25,780
Let's go.

1204
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,682
No, we can't.
We can't.
Let's go.

1205
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:28,683
No, Gwen!

1206
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:31,519
Okay, no, we gotta go back.

1207
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:32,387
We gotta go.

1208
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,521
We have to check on him.

1209
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:35,056
We have to go see if he's okay.

1210
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,325
Nancy, he's not okay.

1211
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,994
No, you don't know that.
Okay? Nobody's okay.

1212
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:40,995
Gwen, you don't know that.

1213
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,196
He's not okay.

1214
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,032
I can't just
let this happen again.

1215
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,234
I can't let him just die.

1216
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:47,602
I can't do this again.

1217
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,704
You're gonna die.
Don't go back.

1218
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:50,872
Listen.

1219
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,174
Okay, I know you're
not gonna go, all right?

1220
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,542
It's okay.
You don't have to go.

1221
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,844
You stay here, and you go
find help, all right?

1222
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,179
It's okay.
Go find help.

1223
01:11:58,181 --> 01:11:59,580
He said there's gonna
be backup soon.

1224
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,115
It's okay.

1225
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:02,717
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?
Don't leave me.

1226
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,620
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm so sorry.

1227
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:06,454
I'm so sorry.

1228
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,323
I have to go.
I have to go!

1229
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:09,891
Nancy, no!

1230
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:10,925
It's okay.

1231
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,782
What the fuck?!

1232
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,990
Fuck you!

1233
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,531
Fuck!

1234
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:06,033
Jesus Christ, Gwen!

1235
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:08,102
I almost fucking shot you!

1236
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,337
Okay...

1237
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:11,105
I had to find you.

1238
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:14,575
It's gotta be the two of us.

1239
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:17,845
Nancy, I think
I solved the mystery.

1240
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,013
It's the Kysers.

1241
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,749
No, that's crazy.
They're dead.

1242
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,351
No, they're not.
They're dead.

1243
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:24,719
Mona and Frankie.

1244
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:27,788
It has to be
the Kyser children.

1245
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,558
Remember how Officer Lance
said that people from the county

1246
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,527
were always trying to
take away the Kysers' house?

1247
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,428
Right, so they
could build a mall?

1248
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,963
But what
if that was the real reason

1249
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,299
people accused the Kysers
of being Satanists?

1250
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:41,402
And maybe because the family
couldn't take it anymore...

1251
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:44,071
Gwen, that's why
they killed themselves
and their kids.

1252
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:48,276
No, what if they
didn't kill the kids?

1253
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:50,077
What if they actually ran away?

1254
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,915
Right.
And they must have been
hiding here all along!

1255
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:57,084
And, somehow, they
raised themselves, and...

1256
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,220
Gwen, they're just
a couple of little kids

1257
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,855
trying to protect their home.

1258
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:03,157
It's the only explanation
that makes any sense.

1259
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:11,132
Listen to me.
They're upstairs, okay?

1260
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,934
I'm gonna lead,

1261
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:15,436
and I need you to follow behind

1262
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:16,971
and guard us with this, okay?

1263
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,372
Can you do that?

1264
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:19,974
Okay.

1265
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,963
Do I...

1266
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,732
I...

1267
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,904
Do I... know you?

1268
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,808
Ow, what...

1269
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,209
Sss.
Ow. Ow.

1270
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:59,180
Ow.

1271
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:00,381
Ow.

1272
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:01,816
What's your name?

1273
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,177
They're just like little kids.

1274
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:47,962
Mona?

1275
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,666
Kyser?

1276
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:54,669
Mona Kyser?
The Kysers?

1277
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:57,271
It is the kids from the house.

1278
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:02,343
We were in first grade
together.

1279
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,779
Right?

1280
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,881
Mona!

1281
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:10,284
Uh, we're not here
to hurt you guys.

1282
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:14,355
We're just... We just
want our friend back, okay?

1283
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,590
We actually... We know
exactly who you are.

1284
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,759
You're Mona,
and you're Frankie.

1285
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,295
And, um, we're not...
We're not here to hurt you.

1286
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,898
We... We heard. We know
what happened to you.

1287
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,367
We know that... that
what happened to you

1288
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,602
is far worse than anything
that your parents,

1289
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:31,338
your family
was ever accused of.

1290
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,740
You're not Satanists.

1291
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:34,008
You're just...

1292
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:36,811
really messed up.

1293
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,779
And... that's
not your fault.

1294
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,314
We just want to help you.

1295
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:43,250
And if you would just
please put the ax down.

1296
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:46,053
Gwen, I need you
to fucking shoot him!

1297
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,356
Gwen!

1298
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:52,226
No!

1299
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:05,806
Enough!

1300
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,243
Please kill me.

1301
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,478
Please.

1302
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,781
Please, please.

1303
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,183
Please kill me.

1304
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:52,253
Please, please.

1305
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,864
You're my best friend.

1306
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,824
Come on.

1307
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:38,732
Right by the bridge,

1308
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:39,967
could lay down.

1309
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:41,869
Come on!
We gotta go!

1310
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:43,370
I can take a nap.

1311
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:47,208
Nope. Up you go.

1312
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,220
Lance.

1313
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:09,890
You fucking bitch!

1314
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,567
Uh...

1315
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,737
Can I have the keys?
