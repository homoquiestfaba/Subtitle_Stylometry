1
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,501
Dear Daniel Craig,

2
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,171
life did not always
look like this.

3
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:27,640
This marked a moment of triumph,

4
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,842
a way of crushing
an abysmal past,

5
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,178
and daring those with
a stereotypical view

6
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,481
of those with mental illness
to challenge me on any front.

7
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,984
To many, this was
just a documentary.

8
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,988
For me and Missy,
this was our lives.

9
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,945
- Ha ha, very funny. You
know I could use the help.

10
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,950
- Yeah, but it wouldn't
have been as funny though.

11
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,353
- Well that's that.
You both ready?

12
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,322
- You know once we get in that
car, there's no turning back.

13
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,791
This was your idea.

14
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,026
- Maybe, but you weren't
the one who went running

15
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,662
and jumping into the deep end
of the pool without looking.

16
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,534
- The way I have, would
there be any other way?

17
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:36,844
- I love you.

18
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,815
I know she thinks she's
got the world on a string.

19
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,583
But be careful.

20
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,620
- You know I will.

21
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,188
- I love you.

22
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,990
- I love you.

23
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,769
- I know
what you're thinking.

24
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,872
Now who is this, and
why is she so important?

25
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,909
Really, a buddy biopic
about two women? Who cares?

26
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,811
Didn't we see Romy
and Michele already?

27
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,613
This is not Romy and Michelle.

28
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,950
This is about me, Amy,
and my best friend, Missy,

29
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,786
and how we survived
my bipolar breakdowns.

30
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,455
That's right, two breakdowns,
and went on to fulfill

31
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,958
a lot of dreams that
at this time seemed

32
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,962
too far away to
even contemplate.

33
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:33,666
- We'll be commuting every
day into Austin for work.

34
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,001
It's gonna be really
hard on the car.

35
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,604
- But we came out
here to make contacts.

36
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,438
- At least we don't have
to get jobs right away.

37
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,740
- What are you talking about?

38
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,109
- What are you talking about?

39
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,611
- We're good until
the end of the month.

40
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,815
We don't need jobs until
the end of November.

41
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,184
- This is insane.
We can't do this.

42
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,953
I'm gonna call my dad
and have him come get us.

43
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:56,288
- No no no, don't panic.
I got it all figured out.

44
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,191
We can do groceries
for $20 a week,

45
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,060
five nights of spaghetti,
two nights of hot dogs.

46
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,195
It's okay.

47
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,430
- I don't know what if
the car breaks down?

48
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,868
- Public transportation.

49
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,036
- I don't know.

50
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,940
- We came down here to
make a name for ourselves.

51
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,676
So, you still want
that, don't you?

52
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,879
- Yeah, but not while
starving to death.

53
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,214
- We're not gonna starve to
death. I've done this before.

54
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,916
- Made a movie without
a pot to piss in?

55
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,885
- We've done the
bare essentials.

56
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,888
Besides my Aunt Rosie's
down here. We're okay.

57
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,189
- Are you sure?

58
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,191
- Positive.

59
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,293
- All right. Let's get unpacked,

60
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:37,732
But the first time that it
gets hard, I'm crying Uncle.

61
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,070
I can't believe I left
the headlights on.

62
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,072
- Let's just go ask someone
if they have jumper cables.

63
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,974
- Nobody's gonna
have jumper cables.

64
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:53,478
I'm pretty sure we're the
only ones that drove in.

65
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,547
- I'm gonna go ask someone
if they have jumper cables.

66
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,482
And if not, I'll
call a tow truck.

67
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,920
- I don't want to do that.

68
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:05,490
- It's hot. I'm tired.
We have an hour to drive.

69
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,661
What do you propose?

70
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,195
- Do whatever you want.

71
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,014
- Excuse me.

72
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,617
You happen to have
any jumper cables?

73
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,754
No, I jetted in. Did
anyone else drive?

74
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,701
Hi. Yes, I'm gonna
need a tow truck.

75
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:51,937
I think we are at,
yeah, the Ramada.

76
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,906
That one, yeah.

77
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,342
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

78
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,744
- Hey. I'm sorry.

79
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,413
I just felt stupid for
leaving the headlights on.

80
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,782
- I should've stuck around
and talked you down.

81
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,584
- Well, now that
we're both sorry,

82
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,020
we should probably
get back in the car.

83
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,622
- You would not believe the
attitude of people around here.

84
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,191
- Think again.

85
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,359
Remember what uncle Bert
says. We're amongst them.

86
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:14,960
- Yeah.

87
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,117
- Are you okay?

88
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,019
- I can't sleep.

89
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:40,654
I can't relax.

90
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,858
I don't feel right.

91
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,659
- When did you
finally drift off?

92
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,895
- An hour ago.

93
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,597
- Oh honey, you gotta
go get that checked out.

94
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm worried about you.

95
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,603
- We still have to fill
out job applications.

96
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,006
- Yes, you should go today.

97
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,977
- Dear
Daniel, down in Texas,

98
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,612
Missy and I both had
our issues interfering

99
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,448
with how we function
daily in the beginning.

100
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,918
Hers are not mine to share,
as she's asked me not to.

101
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,987
But mine, we were
both soon to discover,

102
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,289
could bring even the
smartest of the smart,

103
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,758
and the strongest of the
strong to their knees.

104
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,293
- Go get cleaned up,

105
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,898
and we'll go out and
fill out applications.

106
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,167
Dear Daniel Craig,

107
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,070
sometimes the Devil has
a way of snaking its way

108
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,805
out of the past, and breaking
you the rest of the way down.

109
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:33,641
- Hey, Daddy?

110
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:35,843
Yeah, it's me.

111
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,678
- What you doing?

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,648
- Just working.

113
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,985
Missy and I are running
low on grocery money,

114
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,955
and we would really like
to have a Thanksgiving.

115
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,661
So, I was just wondering if you
could maybe send some money.

116
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,663
- No.

117
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:57,765
- Why not?

118
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:00,866
- You
shouldn't have moved

119
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,135
down there to begin with.

120
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,639
So, no. I'm not gonna
give you the money.

121
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:14,813
- What's wrong?

122
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,482
- I'm so hungry.

123
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,984
- Well, then eat something.

124
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,321
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

125
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,890
I just got my money back
from my car settlement,

126
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,359
from my car accident.

127
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,562
How much money do you need?

128
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:32,331
- I can't do that.

129
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,066
- Please. I know what it's
like to be in your situation.

130
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,035
Let me help you, all right.

131
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,205
- Hey, are you okay?
What's going on?

132
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:43,041
- I called Jerry,
and he basically said

133
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,843
that he didn't care
if we were hungry.

134
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,845
He didn't care if we
had a Thanksgiving.

135
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,848
And he said, we should
have never moved down here.

136
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,884
- He's a jerk.

137
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,719
Shows what he knows.

138
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,555
- Just pay me back when you can.

139
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,689
There's no pressure, okay?

140
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,324
- I will as soon as I can.

141
00:10:59,326 --> 00:10:59,927
- No pressure.

142
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,063
- It
wasn't just the hunger.

143
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,399
The rejection was too much.

144
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,435
The noise, the lights,
people's voices.

145
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,739
Even when I went home,
I couldn't turn it off.

146
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,908
I hadn't lost my mind,

147
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,978
but I could feel myself
losing my grip on my sanity.

148
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,281
It was as if I were hanging
on by my fingernails.

149
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:25,083
And roadsigns to Crazyville
we're getting closer and closer,

150
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,119
and I couldn't slow down.

151
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,956
And then finally, it happened.

152
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:31,091
I broke.

153
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,495
Some days, even when your
rock is less than perfect,

154
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,430
you find that the fire you're in

155
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,367
shows just how
great she really is.

156
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,277
- You need a friend, I am
here for you. I understand.

157
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,047
- Thank you.

158
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,354
I don't know what
you want me to do.

159
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,257
You cry all the time.

160
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,392
I try to comfort
you, but it's like

161
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,795
you want me to keep talking,
but you want me to shut up too?

162
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:13,232
- It's like my
skin is coming off.

163
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,803
And my thoughts,
they're racing so fast.

164
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,239
I can't keep up.

165
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:24,910
- I'm suffering too, you
know. You're not the only one.

166
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,145
- It's like my mind
is coming apart,

167
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,449
and I can't get it
to come together.

168
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,051
- It's like, you're down at
the bottom of this dark well.

169
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,120
And I've thrown a rope
down to you to pull you up.

170
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,823
But instead you've just yanked
me down in there with you.

171
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,124
Maybe we should just go home.

172
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,327
- No. You wanted to come
here, and I bought into it.

173
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,297
To go home would be
to admit failure.

174
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,065
- What are we
supposed to do, Amy?

175
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,434
We're living on $15 worth
of groceries a week.

176
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,837
The head gasket is
blown in the car.

177
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,573
We're walking everywhere we go.

178
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:56,341
We have no internet.

179
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,144
And we can't even afford
pen and paper to write with.

180
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,148
- I'm trying. I
am trying so hard.

181
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,350
You want me to take you
down to Bill Millers,

182
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,687
and show you the
conditions I work in.

183
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,189
It triggers this. It triggers
everything, whatever this is.

184
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,058
- Don't take whatever
this is out on me.

185
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,228
I didn't do anything.

186
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,330
- You talked me
into coming here,

187
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:21,099
and now you're gonna run
back to mommy and daddy.

188
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,234
- You know,
that's the first thing

189
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,371
you accuse me of
every time we argue.

190
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:31,076
- I'm such a lousy friend.
Why do you stick around?

191
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,579
- 'Cause people argue Amy.

192
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,347
But if you think there's
seriously something wrong with
you,

193
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,282
you've got to go
get it checked out.

194
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,218
Now, you have got to go to work.

195
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,387
So go get cleaned up, get
dressed, and get to the via.

196
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,557
- So now you're
telling you what to do.

197
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,092
Sit and spin.

198
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:47,727
- In retrospect,

199
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,928
I was horrible to deal with.

200
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,197
Missy was human at times,

201
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,468
but that just proves how
great she was, and still is.

202
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,538
- You should have seen
us on the way down here.

203
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,273
We couldn't even see
out of the back window.

204
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,209
- Now, what on Earth made you
come all the way out here?

205
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,977
- We wanted to make a movie,

206
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,913
but we couldn't
afford to move to LA.

207
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,982
And Amy bought passes to the
Austin City Film Festival.

208
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,918
We couldn't get a refund.

209
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,620
- Sound homesick.

210
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,156
- Yeah, I am. I miss my dad.

211
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,158
My parents weren't
too jazzed about

212
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,395
us moving so far away from home.

213
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,997
- Yeah, and I suppose the stress
of needing money for food,

214
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,571
so you can have a simple
Thanksgiving meal seems like a
lot.

215
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,472
- I think it's more
than just that.

216
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:36,676
Amy's been having a
really hard time lately.

217
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,344
She goes on these crying jags.

218
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,180
She explodes without warning.

219
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:46,284
She's so angry and so
paranoid these days.

220
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,990
She's not the happy Amy that
I remember from Kentucky.

221
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:54,861
- I have a lot of people
like Amy in my family.

222
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:58,664
Good hearted, compassionate,
even talented people,

223
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,401
sometimes aren't at their best.

224
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,338
- I think it's more than just
Amy not being at her best.

225
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,609
I think something's
really wrong.

226
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,244
- I mean, do you have anyone
down here that can help?

227
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,447
- Just her Aunt Rosie.

228
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,152
- Now you have me too.

229
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,022
The Wolf had arrived.

230
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:57,525
- Amy.

231
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:03,598
- Missy.

232
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,202
- Oh, honey. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

233
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:11,472
No, it's okay.

234
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,475
Honey.

235
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,746
- You said the car was useless.

236
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:24,884
- Oh, you gotta do what you
gotta do. I drove it anyway.

237
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,919
- What if it breaks down?

238
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,955
- We'll just call Aunt Rosie.

239
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,107
- To call
the mental health system

240
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,777
broken in Texas is redundant.

241
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,746
But I had reached
maximum overload.

242
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,448
I was consumed with blind rage.

243
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,350
I wasn't going to hurt myself.

244
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,485
I wasn't gonna hurt
Missy, or anyone else.

245
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,355
But the pain, I needed
the pain to stop.

246
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,726
- Amy McCorkle?

247
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,098
- So, why are you here tonight?

248
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,668
- I need help.

249
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,870
I feel like my skin
is going to come off.

250
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,104
- I was lonely.

251
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,008
I was jittery. I was terrified.

252
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,377
I hadn't lost my mind, but
I desperately wanted help.

253
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,714
- What's your family history?

254
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,618
- My sister had a
bipolar disorder.

255
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,922
My cousin and her nephew,

256
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:39,759
my grandfather, we all
struggle from mental illness.

257
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,894
- How do you feel now?

258
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:42,396
- Numb.

259
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,567
- Any anger or rage?

260
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:52,406
- Yeah, earlier. I've been on
these eight hour crying jags.

261
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,977
- Do you feel like you're
gonna hurt yourself or others?

262
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:58,478
- No.

263
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,482
- Any abuse of prescription
pills or narcotics?

264
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:04,819
- No.

265
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,621
- Any alcohol abuse?

266
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,990
- No.

267
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:14,494
My biological dad had a PTSD
disorder. He abused alcohol.

268
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,332
- Any sexual activity?

269
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,503
- No. Can you just
make this pain stop?

270
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:27,673
- It's gonna be okay.

271
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,845
- She thinks you're manic
depressive. I however, do not.

272
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,816
I think this is something
you've been obsessing on.

273
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,351
I believe that it's
all in your head.

274
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,519
- This
is not the correct way

275
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:43,355
to speak to a mental
health patient.

276
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,860
- So what I want you
to do now is calm down,

277
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,695
and move on.

278
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:00,773
- You're not okay, are you?

279
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:01,274
- No.

280
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,276
- You want me to find
somewhere else to go?

281
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,279
- A head gasket?

282
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,483
- We do what we have to do.

283
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,119
- I can't do this anymore.

284
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,621
I'm losing it.

285
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:19,457
Look how I'm treating you,
how I'm treating myself.

286
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,861
- If you need to
go now, let's go.

287
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:24,630
I know it's not ideal,

288
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:27,967
but if we're gonna take a
serious go at coming down here,

289
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:31,238
then you probably should
let me take you tonight.

290
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:35,306
- I just wish you
didn't have to go.

291
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,543
- Yeah. Who's gonna
take care of us now?

292
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,512
Take us out for
Mexican pastries,

293
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,448
and cocoa at La
Padoses, or here?

294
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,151
- You'll manage.

295
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,019
You girls will
make it, I know it.

296
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,822
- Right now that feels
a million miles away.

297
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,625
- The Lord gave you both
a very special gift.

298
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,826
- Then how come I
haven't been able

299
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,995
to write squat for
the last few months?

300
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,362
- It's all in the timing, Amy.

301
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,497
You can't rush these things.

302
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,901
- Right now, I'm
working with people

303
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:05,705
that judge small children
with special needs.

304
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:06,906
- I told you, if you
went to dinner with them,

305
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,507
you would hate them.

306
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,011
- What can I say? They're jerks.

307
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,547
- You know what Dad says?

308
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,348
If you're not gonna listen,
you're gonna have to feel.

309
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,517
- As long as we can
put food on the table,

310
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,385
that's not spaghetti
and hot dogs,

311
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,755
and we can afford real cheese.

312
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,355
I mean, we're not
going hungry anymore.

313
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,325
- That's a good point.

314
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,862
- You know, Aunt
Rosie. I don't know.

315
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:33,498
I don't know where we'd
be it it wasn't for you.

316
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,703
- I would never let
my nieces go hungry.

317
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,873
- You consider me your niece?

318
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,609
- You have been such
a support for Amy,

319
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,711
even going through
your own troubles.

320
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,714
Of course, I consider my niece.

321
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:51,851
I love you both very very much.

322
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:55,054
- You can't imagine
what that means to me.

323
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:59,257
- Well, maybe not, but
let's just enjoy our coffee

324
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,459
at this beautiful coffee house,

325
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,828
and smell Cocoa.

326
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,099
- Dear Daniel,

327
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:10,636
I think it's fair to say this
was one of my darkest moments.

328
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:14,372
I had no idea who I
was, or where I was,

329
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,778
desperate for a light
to shine in the dark.

330
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,647
- Crap. You scared me.

331
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,651
What's wrong?

332
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:27,052
- I know I'm supposed
to go to work today.

333
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:27,822
But I'm scared.

334
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,491
I know you're name, but
I don't know my name.

335
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,495
Will you call in for me, please?

336
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:38,866
- It's okay. I'll call.

337
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:47,239
- Missy
was my rock. She still is.

338
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,175
When my family
fails to understand

339
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,845
exactly what we went through
in Texas, they get jealous.

340
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,380
But the fear and the
pain of disorientation

341
00:21:55,382 --> 00:22:00,252
because of the anxiety and
mania was difficult to explain.

342
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:02,788
When they're derisive and call
her Saint Missy it angers me,

343
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,455
because as you can plainly see,

344
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,592
she went through a lot with me.

345
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,840
I didn't know whether to
be scared or relieved.

346
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:23,075
I was alone.

347
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:24,944
Missy had to work, so
this had been the only way

348
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:28,080
to return and get
a proper diagnosis.

349
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,481
I was scared.

350
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,152
What if I was sent
running in circles again?

351
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,621
What if the Texas mental health
system failed me miserably?

352
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:38,624
In truth, it already had.

353
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:41,829
But I held out hope that
this time would be different.

354
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,978
- Go ahead and have a seat.
We'll get you something.

355
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,099
- Amy?

356
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,233
- Yeah.

357
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,136
- You can follow me.

358
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,914
- Took a lot bravery and
courage to come here.

359
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,716
We're gonna get you some help.

360
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:38,753
It's gonna be okay.

361
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:47,159
We do have a diagnosis.

362
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,597
You have rapid cycling
manic depression.

363
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:56,135
It's gonna be okay.
You're not a freak.

364
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,304
And help us here for you.

365
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,540
- I'll take it as it comes.

366
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,509
- I want
you to take this,

367
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,912
once a day for three days,

368
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,583
then I want you
to add the Zoloft.

369
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:12,553
- Yes sir.

370
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:15,721
- You're gonna be okay.

371
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,692
Coming here was the first step.

372
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,347
- What are
you doing here?

373
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,716
- I know you and Amy
have been struggling.

374
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:46,051
So, I figured I help
out a little bit more.

375
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:48,187
Is she here?

376
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:51,390
- No, she's
at the doctors.

377
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,559
- I thought you guys
were having car troubles.

378
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,561
- She took the bus.

379
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,064
Come on in. Glad to see you.

380
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:04,939
- Is Amy sick?

381
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,711
- Yeah. But it's
not what you think.

382
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:14,648
- Is everything okay?

383
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,021
- No. No, it's not okay.

384
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,823
We came down here
with not enough money.

385
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,160
We're hungry every day.

386
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:28,295
And Amy,

387
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,631
Amy's falling apart.

388
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,834
She's really sick, Patrick.

389
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,705
She's at a
psychiatrist's office.

390
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,878
If they can't help her, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

391
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:48,849
- Hey, hey.

392
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:51,852
It'll be okay now.

393
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,490
- We look like
Cindy Lou Who's house

394
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,360
after the Grinch was there.

395
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:04,963
- Whatever. At least
we have a place to live.

396
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:07,900
We have a Christmas tree.
We have Christmas presents.

397
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,902
We have each other.

398
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,004
And tomorrow night we're
gonna have a Christmas dinner.

399
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:14,339
- I wanted a bigger Christmas
tree, six feet tall,

400
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:17,810
icicles, cheap tacky ornaments.

401
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:20,114
- You have a two foot
version of that now.

402
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,450
- I want friends
to celebrate with.

403
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,151
- You have me,

404
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,020
- I know.

405
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:31,023
And as bad as I feel,
without you I'd be miserable.

406
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,792
- Who are you kidding?
You're already miserable.

407
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:34,660
Miserable wasn't the word

408
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:36,462
for how I was feeling.

409
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,263
I felt like I was in
traction, and someone

410
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,799
had thrown me down in
that deep dark well again.

411
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,668
Only this time, there
was no light at all.

412
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,004
And there was no escape.

413
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,675
- You know what would
make me feel better?

414
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,977
Presents.

415
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:54,346
- It's Christmas Eve.
We don't open Christmas.

416
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,482
We don't open the Christmas
presents until Christmas day.

417
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:56,951
- Please.

418
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:02,721
- But Daniel,

419
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,256
in this darkness that
was consuming me,

420
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:08,760
this act was the biggest
mistake in the world.

421
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,796
Everything was
from Mom and John.

422
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,731
As grateful as we were,

423
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,366
there was the overwhelming
depression for me

424
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,269
that I had nothing
to give to Missy.

425
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:20,105
After all she had done for me,
in standing by me as a friend

426
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,040
when most normal
people would have run,

427
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,078
I had nothing to
celebrate her with.

428
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,587
- Merry Christmas.

429
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,222
- I was afraid of that.

430
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:40,092
Look, I mean they paid
for our rent this month.

431
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:42,461
They could have
done nothing at all.

432
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,763
- Yeah I know. I can't help it.

433
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,838
- That'll be 12.56.

434
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,774
- 12.56, plus tip.

435
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,778
It's all there. Merry Christmas.

436
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:04,218
- Well, you got your
Christmas tradition.

437
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,523
- You know,

438
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:14,026
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

439
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,896
- We're really
gonna miss you too.

440
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,199
- You should just
go ahead and kiss.

441
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,601
On the lips.

442
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:26,905
- Want to know what?

443
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:27,441
Amy's right.

444
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,346
I didn't want to
say anything, but

445
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,885
I really, really wish you
weren't moving back to Kentucky.

446
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:43,055
- I can't do it alone,
with just my paycheck.

447
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,122
And Amy can't seem
to hold down a job.

448
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,791
- Hey.

449
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,260
- It's not a criticism. It's
just a statement of fact.

450
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,062
And you're not exactly
Daddy Warbucks.

451
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:53,232
So we have to go
where the help is.

452
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:56,569
- Well, I guess another
time and another place, huh?

453
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,237
- You know, there is
such thing as a phone.

454
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,241
And you could move closer to us.

455
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,143
- You know, Missy.

456
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,946
There's gonna come a time

457
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,282
where you gonna need
me more than ever.

458
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,151
And when that time does come,

459
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,822
I'm gonna be here for you.

460
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,659
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

461
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:20,194
- All right.

462
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:26,733
- I don't want to talk about it.

463
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:27,899
- But this
was your idea.

464
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,636
I said I was willing to stay.

465
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:33,038
- I need help. I need money.

466
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,241
I can't hold a job down.
The job that I had fired me.

467
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,710
This is defeat.

468
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,580
- Watch your mouth.

469
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:43,583
- I'm trying to be respectful.

470
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,151
He came down here and got
us when my parents couldn't.

471
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:49,054
Your parents got us an
apartment. They furnished it.

472
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,692
They put groceries
in the fridge.

473
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:56,729
I can't help but think
this last year was in vain.

474
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:57,998
No movie, no contacts.

475
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:03,001
Everyone that wanted us to
fail got what they wanted.

476
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,438
- You can't think that way.

477
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,341
- How am I
supposed to think?

478
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,376
- Like you're gonna
get the help you need.

479
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,513
Like you're finally gonna
have people who understand.

480
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:16,048
- But they don't, Missy.

481
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,619
If they did, they would
be here, not your dad.

482
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,320
- Cut them some slack, honey.

483
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,388
They tried to visit us
in their Summer vacation.

484
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,090
- Maybe.

485
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,927
- The money just wasn't there.

486
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,929
- At least we'll
have our own place.

487
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,231
- Yeah, thanks to
my mom and dad.

488
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:36,902
- Yeah. I appreciate that.

489
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,705
I couldn't bear to
go back to my house.

490
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,906
It was so tense last time.

491
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:44,109
- I mean, that's to be expected.

492
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,912
He was there. You were
there, four cats, me.

493
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,148
It was a complete zoo.

494
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:52,618
- Maybe it'll be good to go home

495
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,487
for a few days and be with mom.

496
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:59,891
She can help me get the services
I need, whatever I need.

497
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,928
- It's gonna be
okay, Amy. I promise.

498
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,931
- Ready to ride?

499
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,568
- Yeah.

500
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:25,518
- In a few days, I'll be
connected to everything.

501
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,353
It wasn't an epic
failure, was it?

502
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:31,992
- It was epic. But it wasn't
even close to a failure, honey.

503
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,161
- Call you tomorrow?

504
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:46,204
- What is
she even doing here?

505
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,407
I didn't think she was
coming home from Texas.

506
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,877
Like, what's wrong
with her anyway?

507
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,211
- I have a mental illness.

508
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:56,114
Thanks for the sympathy, Sis.

509
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,350
- I don't have time for
this. I'm going to bed.q

510
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:01,854
- Why? 'Cause I make
you uncomfortable?

511
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,756
Get in line, and take a number.

512
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,091
- Amy.

513
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,460
- I just drove 20
hours from Texas,

514
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:10,362
people judging
me, looking at me,

515
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:12,164
people I know,
people I work with.

516
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,332
I'm not taking it from her.

517
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,101
- She's your sister, Amy.

518
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,336
She's your flesh and blood.

519
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,673
- I don't regret
moving to Texas.

520
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,643
I didn't want to move back here.

521
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:24,877
- Come here.

522
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:25,312
Come here.

523
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,318
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

524
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:37,355
Support gave me some
numbers to call tomorrow.

525
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:40,192
Sleep as late as you need to.

526
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,663
We'll get this figured out.

527
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:49,034
- I don't understand
when she comes over here,

528
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,537
why all she does is sleep.

529
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,141
I love her dearly, but
that's wasting a day.

530
00:32:57,478 --> 00:33:01,046
And I hate saying this,
but she just seems so lazy.

531
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,447
- Mom.

532
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,717
She's sick.

533
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,119
She's depressed, and depressed
people sleep sometimes.

534
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,755
- Sick?

535
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,290
No, being sick is
like having a fever,

536
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:15,460
or throwing up,
or having a cold.

537
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,763
She looks pretty healthy to me.

538
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:18,265
- Mama.

539
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:25,239
She has a chemical imbalance
that makes her feel this way.

540
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:32,344
She's just as sick as
say, you having diabetes.

541
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,980
- You know, I just
don't understand it.

542
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,615
- Dear Daniel,

543
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:38,518
My Mamaw was a God fearing,
and God loving woman,

544
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,386
whose faith was the strongest
thing I'd ever seen.

545
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:43,956
It always made me sad to
hear her talk that way.

546
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,525
I knew it was just ignorance.

547
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,994
I knew that she was just
a product of her time.

548
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:50,630
But I had a choice.

549
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,197
I usually stayed there
while Missy worked

550
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,633
at a nearby elementary school,

551
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,668
because I couldn't
handle being alone.

552
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,169
As ignorant as my
Mamaw could be,

553
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:01,139
she was also the kind of woman
that if you put a face on it,

554
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,842
she'd eventually
opened her mind to it.

555
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:17,257
- Oh, wow.

556
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,130
Oh, this is awesome.

557
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:26,433
- This is awesome, yes.

558
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:32,139
- It's our new place.

559
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,711
- Dear Daniel,

560
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:41,413
to say those first few months
back in Kentucky weren't easy

561
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,281
is something of
an understatement.

562
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,585
We handle things
much better now,

563
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,920
but I think that's in
part because we don't have

564
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,422
the pressure of being broke
looming over us constantly,

565
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,791
along with the
worst of the illness

566
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:54,760
having us in its vice-like grip.

567
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:58,564
- You're not the only one who
made sacrifices down there.

568
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:01,266
- You weren't the
only one? I was fired.

569
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,302
You weren't fired for
the same reasons I was.

570
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,404
You were the pet employee.
In fact, you stayed on.

571
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,040
- What was I supposed to do?

572
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:10,009
We had to pay
rent. We had bills.

573
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,679
- I don't know, show some
loyalty, walk out in solidarity.

574
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,915
Instead you let their
treatment of me be justified.

575
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,182
- You're being unreasonable.

576
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,316
- I'm not being unreasonable.

577
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,519
- Yes you are.

578
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:21,386
And keep your voice
down, you're yelling.

579
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:22,922
- I'm not yelling.

580
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:26,892
Indeed, I was yelling.

581
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:28,995
- You need to calm down, Amy.

582
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:30,364
- How's that gonna help?

583
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:35,668
We went to Texas
to make a movie.

584
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,335
We cast three people,
and it falls apart.

585
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,772
How is that a success?

586
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:41,206
- You're looking at
it the wrong way.

587
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,908
- The wrong way?

588
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,511
Are all the other people wrong?

589
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,613
Are the people that were
rooting against us wrong?

590
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:51,249
Jerry, Myra, the others
too, are they wrong?

591
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,085
- You need to stop yelling.

592
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,494
- I'm so sorry.

593
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,463
I'm, I'm so sorry,
Missy. Oh my God.

594
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:06,466
- It's okay, Amy.

595
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:14,807
- Did I break something
of yours? Or is that mine?

596
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,109
- No, you didn't.

597
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:20,112
Come, we got to get
this cleaned up.

598
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:22,648
- I know I
call you my hero, Daniel,

599
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,350
and that my family
wants equal billing.

600
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,318
But they haven't
got the first clue

601
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,822
as to how much Missy
went through with me.

602
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,158
If anyone has earned the
right to be called my hero,

603
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,627
it's Missy.

604
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,363
Mamaw always loved the
fact I wrote stories.

605
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,298
- You know, Josephine
wrote stories,

606
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,400
good ones, just like you do.

607
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,503
- Thanks, Mamaw.

608
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,337
- But what I don't understand

609
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,306
is why you come over
here and sleep all day.

610
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,744
- It's part of the disease.

611
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:54,379
I just don't like being
alone. It's overwhelming.

612
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:59,051
- You know, your Papaw Grizwall
had something like that.

613
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:02,722
But you know what? He got
saved, and it cured the problem.

614
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:05,958
Maybe you don't need meds.
Maybe you just need saved.

615
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,293
- I often
kept my faith to myself.

616
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:09,662
I believed in the sense
of a higher power,

617
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:12,598
the Universe as in a capital U.

618
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,667
But Mamaw, as strong
as her faith was,

619
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:17,335
came attached to Christianity.

620
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:20,338
- Trust me, Mamaw.
I need my meds.

621
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,844
Trust me. It was worse.
It was so much worse.

622
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,981
- You know what? James was
such a good strong man.

623
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:31,617
I see so much of him in you.

624
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,452
- I love you too, Mamaw.

625
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:37,322
- Just keep writing, Amy.

626
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:38,958
- Would you read
anything that I write?

627
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,325
- Is there any
black writing in it?

628
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,628
- What's that?

629
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,098
- Any cursing or
premarital sex stuff?

630
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,833
- Then you probably would not
read anything that I write.

631
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:48,703
- No, probably not.

632
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:51,971
- Not even tell your friends

633
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,339
that your granddaughter's
an author?

634
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,342
- Maybe. I'd have
to think about that.

635
00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:00,345
But maybe you can write
something without that stuff in
it.

636
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,715
- Maybe.

637
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,382
God rest her soul.

638
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,451
She was always
trying to save mine.

639
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,120
Sincerely, Amy McCorkle.

640
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,387
- Quit being paranoid.

641
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,356
Dear Daniel, I was.

642
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,058
- I'm not, I just.

643
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,561
I like things done right.
And I want them right now.

644
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:17,229
- Amy, you know
you're my friend.

645
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:20,733
I love you more than a sister.

646
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:23,202
But I told you that you're
gonna make a mistake

647
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:25,037
if you rush into production.

648
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,740
- Then what was the point
of the auditions today?

649
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,975
- I tried to
tell you not to do it

650
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,778
before we had our ducks in
a row, but you went ahead.

651
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,946
This is something

652
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,548
that hasn't really
changed over the years.

653
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,650
I still make her
crazy with this.

654
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:40,420
We just handle it a whole
hell of a lot better.

655
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,724
- You told me? What
am I, your child?

656
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,727
If we moved at your pace, we
wouldn't get anything done.

657
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,263
- You know, if you weren't
determined to act like a child,

658
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,430
going and running
and jumping into

659
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:53,799
the end of the swimming pool,

660
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,768
without knowing if
there's water in it,

661
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,671
I wouldn't have to
act like a parent.

662
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:01,774
I don't want to be your
mother. I want to be pleasant.

663
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,509
- You want to control
a lot of my life,

664
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,145
what I eat, where
I go, my projects.

665
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,681
You know, we don't
write like we used to.

666
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:12,818
- Amy we're friends. We don't
have to write to be friends.

667
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,187
- Writing is what our
friendship is about.

668
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,190
Without that, what do we have?

669
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,925
- I would come
to learn those were the words

670
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,928
that hurt her the most
up until that point.

671
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,064
- Screw you, Amy.

672
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:28,100
I've been through a
lot of shit with you,

673
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:29,735
stuff that lesser
and better people

674
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,872
would not have stuck around for.

675
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:36,942
For you to say something like
that to me, that just hurts.

676
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:41,714
- Get off the cross,
someone needs the wood.

677
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,449
- You know, for somebody who
wants to be shown sensitivity

678
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:47,853
for them and their issues,
you can act like a real witch.

679
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:50,055
- You sound just like
my dad. Take a number.

680
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,557
- You can't admit
when you're wrong.

681
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,225
The entire time I've known you,

682
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,094
you've never admitted
when you were wrong.

683
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:57,462
- Yes I do, I say I'm
sorry and I'm wrong

684
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:00,099
all the time just to please you.

685
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:01,567
- Now who's on the cross?

686
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,402
- I'm just saying it like it is.

687
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,072
- Get over yourself, Amy.

688
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,540
What I said next

689
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,777
was terrible, awful,
and inexcusable.

690
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,979
It was not the first
time I'd said it,

691
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:17,249
but it was the last time
I uttered such ugly words.

692
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,887
- If you don't shut
up, I'm gonna kill you.

693
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:25,456
I'm so sorry, Missy.

694
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,926
Oh my God, don't hate
me. I'm so sorry.

695
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:29,494
- Amy, you know I love you.

696
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:31,163
Because if anybody else
talked to me like that,

697
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,066
I'd beat their ass.

698
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:36,101
- Love you too.

699
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,770
- More than your luggage?

700
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,106
- More than my luggage.

701
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,311
Sigh to rinse away that
terrible Christmas from Texas.

702
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:45,846
- All right.

703
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:51,786
I didn't have much to get
you, but I hope you like it.

704
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:56,691
- New York?

705
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,692
Together, right?

706
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,627
- Absolutely.

707
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:03,197
And this here is another one.

708
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,534
- Oh my God. A Jane
Austin action figure.

709
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,869
Where'd you find this?

710
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:13,372
- I went down to that Something
Better store in the mall

711
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:15,708
looking for a Gladiator Sandy,
but they didn't have one.

712
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,276
They had this,
William Shakespeare,

713
00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:19,945
and some other author
I can't remember.

714
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,716
All right. And one last one.

715
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,395
- Oh my God. Where
did you find these?

716
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:36,864
- Big Lots.

717
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,566
- Freaking love Big Lots.

718
00:41:58,285 --> 00:41:59,585
- Amy.

719
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:01,620
Amy, wake up.

720
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:04,156
They called Dad
into the hospital.

721
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,324
- Did they find a liver?

722
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:06,692
- Yeah, Mom and Dad
are on their way now.

723
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:08,494
I've got to go pick up
Shannon and Jessica,

724
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:09,661
and take them with me.

725
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,996
- Do you want me
to come with you?

726
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,732
- No, I don't have
time right now.

727
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:14,867
I'll call you when
I know something.

728
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:15,968
Just please make sure the brakes

729
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,337
get fixed in my car today, okay?

730
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,606
- Okay. Call me if there's
any new information.

731
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,307
- I will.

732
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,876
Harold had always seemed

733
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,678
as strong as an ox to me,
and everyone around him.

734
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,014
Missy understood
how sick he was.

735
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,916
But I don't think I
fully appreciated it

736
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,651
until he was called
into the hospital.

737
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:33,187
- Hello?

738
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,222
- He's in ICU.

739
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:37,825
- Is he okay?

740
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:41,528
- He's stable
for the moment.

741
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,229
- Are you okay?

742
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,166
- During the
surgery, I had to get up

743
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:50,035
and walk away from everyone
and calm myself down.

744
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:53,172
I felt like something
really bad was happening.

745
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,374
- You know, I had a feeling
of calm come over me.

746
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:58,110
Things are gonna be okay.

747
00:42:58,112 --> 00:43:00,379
- I wish
you could see him.

748
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:03,348
I'm not used to seeing
my dad like that.

749
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,983
- We lived
on very little money.

750
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,952
Getting the brakes
done was a necessity.

751
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:10,122
It was supposed to cost $99.

752
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,924
And when you're in the
middle of a crisis,

753
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:16,161
it's like the universe
says, let's pile it on.

754
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:17,663
- Hey, can you hold on? I
have to pay for the brakes.

755
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,498
- Okay.

756
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,666
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

757
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:22,434
- How much?

758
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:25,172
- Ah, your rotors were
bad. It's gonna be 291.

759
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:31,511
- Missy, they said the
brakes are gonna be $291.

760
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:33,045
- How much do we have?

761
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:33,347
- 292.

762
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,986
- I could hear
the weariness in her voice,

763
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:42,855
the ache in her tone.

764
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:45,491
This wasn't something
she needed right now.

765
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:48,227
She needed to focus on
her father, on her family,

766
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:52,331
on being together and
taking care of one another.

767
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,334
- Pay it. We'll figure
out everything else later.

768
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:55,836
- You sure?

769
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:01,508
- It's the brakes. Can't
really cut corners on that.

770
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,244
- Okay. I'll talk to you later.

771
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,312
Missy's mom and dad

772
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,748
gave her the money
to get us through.

773
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,817
It was one of the
last things he did.

774
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,621
Sincerely, Amy McCorkle.

775
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,091
- Amy! Wake up!

776
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:20,928
Amy, it's your dad.

777
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,129
- Dear Daniel,

778
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:27,733
allow me to clarify here
that John is my stepdad.

779
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:31,272
But he's raised me from three
years of age. He's a good man.

780
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,943
- Missy called. I
think her dad died.

781
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:39,512
- Why didn't anybody call me?

782
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:40,649
- You didn't answer.

783
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,584
- In the time
of my friend's greatest need,

784
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:47,119
I'd been lulled to
sleep by Ambien.

785
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:50,189
Trust me. After that,
I stopped taking it.

786
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:53,759
Missing out on my friend's
SOS wasn't worth another pill.

787
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,628
- Missy?

788
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,363
- Yeah?

789
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:02,434
- Did you try to call?

790
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:03,170
- Yeah.

791
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,208
Dad died, Amy.

792
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,278
- I know, Sweetie.

793
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:18,217
- No worries.
The Wolf was on her way.

794
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:18,786
Dear Daniel,

795
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:23,789
I wish I could say
death was easy for me,

796
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,358
that I can handle the messy
emotions that come with it

797
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,795
with the grace and aplomb
that others around me have.

798
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,797
But on the morning
of Harold's funeral,

799
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:34,534
I found myself reeling,
and coping with the fact

800
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:36,235
that the surgeons with Coda

801
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:39,071
had treated Missy's
family as an afterthought,

802
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,973
had grown frustrated
with the difficulty

803
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:42,808
of the course of
Harold's treatment,

804
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,043
and that they
handled him roughly.

805
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:48,814
It angered and saddened
me that he was gone.

806
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,482
I knew that he liked me,

807
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:53,285
because he'd given me
the nickname of Amis.

808
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:58,323
He'd been gone less than a
week, and I missed him already.

809
00:45:58,325 --> 00:46:01,594
No more University of Kentucky
Football or Basketball games.

810
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,664
No more cookouts, no more
visits where I could talk,

811
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,699
and he wouldn't listen.

812
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:08,135
- Have you seen him yet?

813
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:15,708
- They're still
getting him ready.

814
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,512
I didn't think I should be
the first one to see him.

815
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:22,517
I thought you and your mom
and your sisters should.

816
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:29,354
- Will you go with me?

817
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,623
- Of course.

818
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:33,025
- But as
hard for me as death is,

819
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,193
and as sad as I was
over the loss of Harold,

820
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,597
nothing compared
to the devastation

821
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,499
I saw in my best friend's face,

822
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,735
and the grief in her
mother's and sister's eyes.

823
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:02,888
It wasn't his face that
didn't look right to me,

824
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,890
but his body that was all wrong.

825
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,491
But after several surgeries,

826
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,927
multiple procedures,
and daily dialysis,

827
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,463
it wasn't a surprise to me.

828
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:14,900
But I understood this
wasn't my father.

829
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:17,135
His death hadn't blindsided me.

830
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,204
My hope hadn't
been robbed of me,

831
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:22,974
and snuffed out so
coldly and callously.

832
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:25,545
Missy had the right to
be angry and grieving.

833
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:28,313
She had, and still does
have, the right to feel

834
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:31,651
any way she wants to about
the loss of her father.

835
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:33,686
- Pam.

836
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:35,187
- I didn't know him.

837
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,122
But you're my friend,

838
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,561
and I felt like I needed
to pay my respects.

839
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:42,196
- Thank you, Pam.

840
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,232
You don't know how
much that means.

841
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:50,068
- In this grief, you find out
who your real friends are,

842
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,671
the ones who find
the time to come,

843
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,539
and at least pay their respects,

844
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:57,075
even when showing vulnerability
isn't in their comfort zone.

845
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,746
Pam is in the inner
circle for a reason.

846
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,095
Missy was, and still is,
a nurturer, a caretaker.

847
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:19,732
I and many others have been
the benefactor of that.

848
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:21,333
I know it doesn't seem like it,

849
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:23,470
but that street goes
both ways for us.

850
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:34,413
- Honey, why don't you
go to lunch with Pam?

851
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:37,284
- And leave before the
funeral? How tacky is that?

852
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:43,155
You need me to be
strong for you.

853
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,991
And I know when my parents pass,

854
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:49,629
I want you to be strong for me.

855
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,167
I don't want you going off
having lunch with another
friend.

856
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:58,504
- You're having a panic
attack right now, right?

857
00:48:58,506 --> 00:48:59,006
- Yes.

858
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:04,376
- Focus on taking
care of yourself.

859
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,712
That's what you can
do for me right now.

860
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,115
- Dear Daniel,

861
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,819
even God rested on
the seventh day.

862
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:49,421
With Missy, in the wake
of her father's death,

863
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:53,893
everyone had been leaning on
her, even me to some degree.

864
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:57,964
Well, the crap was about to
hit the fan in a very big way.

865
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:00,432
- How's your day?

866
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:01,968
- You should know. You
blew my phone up all day.

867
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,604
- Did not.

868
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:06,839
- You want me to show
you where you did it?

869
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:10,143
- No, but I can only do so
much writing and promoting.

870
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:15,113
- You could volunteer.
We've talked about that.

871
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,583
- I don't have a car.

872
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,351
- That's a cop out. I told
you we'd figure it out.

873
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,786
- You can't help me.

874
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:23,823
I don't have a golden
ticket to mom and dad.

875
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:27,158
- Are we feeling a little bit
sorry for ourselves today?

876
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,529
How was your day?

877
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:31,964
- Apparently, I
blew up your phone.

878
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,498
- Amy, I can't do
this right now.

879
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,034
- Fine.

880
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:39,705
I wrote, promoted, and
watched some television.

881
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:41,807
- And blew up my phone.

882
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:42,644
- Screw you.

883
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:46,177
I should have been

884
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:48,313
paying attention to
what she was doing.

885
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:50,315
Harold had died the day
before Christmas Eve.

886
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,785
What a crap deal.

887
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,955
Missy deserves to have a
dad seeing her succeed now.

888
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,156
I digress.

889
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:01,861
I should have been paying
attention to what she was doing.

890
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:04,129
She had yet to express
her grief in an all out,

891
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:07,198
ball out, get the
out of my way vent.

892
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,569
Boy, did I know how
to push that button.

893
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:13,573
Especially that night,
without saying a word.

894
00:51:13,575 --> 00:51:15,140
You know that moment
when you realize

895
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,142
you've messed up big time?

896
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:19,645
Not enough to evoke
a volcanic eruption,

897
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,479
but enough so that if there
are other things going on,

898
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:24,449
there's going to be
a volcanic eruption?

899
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:27,252
There's that flight or fight
that's supposed to kick in.

900
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:30,923
Well, I wasn't smart
enough to heed that.

901
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,158
- What the hell, Amy?

902
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,961
- What?

903
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:36,829
- Did you call Canada?

904
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,497
How long did you talk to her?

905
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:41,166
- Only 15
minutes, I don't know.

906
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,169
- Try 40 minutes!

907
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:48,007
- Sorry, I thought
it was shorter.

908
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,742
- You have to be kidding me.

909
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,812
There is a big difference
between 10 and 40.

910
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:55,748
I told you not to make
international calls!

911
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,783
- It's at this point, I
realize Missy is about

912
00:51:57,785 --> 00:51:59,785
to lose her mind
for a little bit,

913
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:02,622
and there's not a single
thing I can do about it.

914
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,189
So I get still,
and get very quiet.

915
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,592
- Money.

916
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:08,360
Do you think I told you not
to make international calls-

917
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:09,361
- She
is getting wound up.

918
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:10,930
And there's nothing
I can say or do.

919
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:14,033
Although I have the worst habit.

920
00:52:14,035 --> 00:52:17,536
When I'm nervous or
uncomfortable, I smile
involuntarily,

921
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:21,073
which made matters
much, much worse.

922
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:22,908
- You think this is funny?

923
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:23,377
- No.

924
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:29,548
- I don't need this.
You pay this bill.

925
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,249
I already take care
of everyone around me,

926
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,352
my mom, my sisters.

927
00:52:34,522 --> 00:52:37,257
I take care of you. And
I do it all by myself.

928
00:52:39,027 --> 00:52:39,560
I need help.

929
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:42,229
- I'm sorry.

930
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:44,297
- Sorry?

931
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,433
You're sorry?

932
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:49,802
Sorry doesn't cut it.

933
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:11,324
- Can I come in?

934
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:14,796
- Yeah.

935
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,833
- Sorry.

936
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:25,004
- I know. I just
really miss my dad.

937
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,371
And everybody wants to tell
me how much they miss him.

938
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,841
Well, I miss him too.

939
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:29,677
- I know, Sweetie.

940
00:53:32,013 --> 00:53:35,014
- Just do me a favor.
No more calls to Canada.

941
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:35,550
- Okay.

942
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,686
- Don't take this the wrong
way, but I'm really glad

943
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:42,822
that we have Patrick
in our lives again.

944
00:53:42,824 --> 00:53:43,658
- Hey, you got me.

945
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:48,194
- Don't make me punch
you in your face.

946
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,943
- Dear Daniel,

947
00:54:03,945 --> 00:54:05,443
there's something
that happens to you.

948
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:08,013
When the labor of love is
validated and rewarded.

949
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:11,016
In February of 2011,
I received my first

950
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:14,186
publication contract for
"Another Way to Die",

951
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:16,354
My James Bond meets "The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"

952
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,792
mashup, romantic thriller.

953
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:21,361
- Oh my God. Oh my God, Missy.

954
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,998
He's accepted
"Another Way to Die".

955
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,499
I'm gonna be a published author.

956
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:30,169
- Congratulations.

957
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:34,339
- I know I've goon loo loo
and all, but that's okay.

958
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:35,975
- I mean, it's somebody
besides your family

959
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:37,543
telling you it's
worthy of publication.

960
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:38,343
That's a good thing.

961
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:42,480
- Oh, no no. Don't make
me punch you in the face.

962
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:44,717
- Missy is a private person.

963
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,653
She's a warm person, but
she's not much on getting

964
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:49,955
hypomanic kisses from her
out of control best friend.

965
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:52,191
Validation.

966
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:55,127
I wept for joy, for
relief, for every time life

967
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:57,963
had kicked me in the
gut and left me to die.

968
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,365
Dear Daniel, it had been
a year since Missy and I

969
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,967
had made the financial decision

970
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,869
to each move back
in with our parents.

971
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:05,704
It enabled us to
attend more events,

972
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:08,274
conventions, book signings,
that sort of thing.

973
00:55:08,276 --> 00:55:10,643
But it had been a week since
the Fright Night Film Festival,

974
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:12,745
and we were still in
the dark about whether

975
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:15,446
our screenplay had won,
lost, or was sitting

976
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:17,482
in a dusty bin somewhere
forgotten for all times.

977
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:18,918
- Stay calm, Amy.

978
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,619
I mean,

979
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:22,755
everything with the book launch.

980
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:25,057
It was one of the best
times of our lives.

981
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:27,293
- I know. Meeting Grant Wilson
and Adrian Paul was awesome,

982
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:28,794
selling all those books.

983
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:32,131
And at least me and Tim
have a cool story to share.

984
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:34,900
- And you sold 34 books.

985
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:37,503
- That too. And I
graduated therapy.

986
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,472
- That's the most
important thing.

987
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:42,942
- It's the thing
I'm most proud of.

988
00:55:42,944 --> 00:55:44,442
We've come a long
way since those girls

989
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:47,279
who struck it out
for Texas, huh?

990
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:50,115
- I'm proud of you, Amy.

991
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:54,452
- Let's check it just
one last time, okay.

992
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:55,521
- I
couldn't contain the joy

993
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:57,289
that was exploding from within.

994
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,457
How long had we worked?

995
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:01,426
How long have we scraped
by and struggled?

996
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:03,095
- Yes.

997
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:04,263
- No,
this wasn't an Oscar.

998
00:56:04,265 --> 00:56:06,198
And the organization
of the award ceremony

999
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,433
was less than ideal,
as it had been canceled

1000
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:10,236
due to the death
of its organizers.

1001
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:12,204
But there it was, a win.

1002
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:13,572
- Don't cry, Amy.

1003
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:14,940
- An
honest to goodness win.

1004
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:17,176
- This is a good thing.
It's a good thing.

1005
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,111
- No trophy?

1006
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:22,047
- Just take the
win, and go with it.

1007
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,582
- I agree.

1008
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:34,727
- I'm
really proud of you.

1009
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:38,697
- I'm proud of us.
We finally got one.

1010
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,299
- Knowing you,
you'll have us entered

1011
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:42,735
into a million different
contests by this time next year.

1012
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:44,570
And you'll have a
trophy, plus more.

1013
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:46,105
- Man, Daniel,

1014
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:48,774
you need to know this
script, this book.

1015
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:50,643
I can trace directly back

1016
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:52,745
to your working
cowboys and aliens.

1017
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,747
It reignited everything I loved

1018
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,949
about science
fiction and westerns.

1019
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:59,484
As a teenager, my favorite
authors were Vonnegut,

1020
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:03,289
Bradbury, Sue Grafton,
Madeline L'Engle, and more.

1021
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:05,658
Your work put me in touch
with my storytelling roots,

1022
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,395
and for that always be grateful.

1023
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:13,399
- Yeah, I guess I better take
my meds, and go to bed too.

1024
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:14,900
- Award
winning screenwriters.

1025
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:15,502
- Overnight.

1026
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:28,013
- So much more
was to come, so much more.

1027
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:30,816
Dear Daniel Craig,

1028
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:34,019
bipolar disorder, and those
that saw it as contagious

1029
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:38,057
sought to pull me under, snap
me in half, break me down.

1030
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:40,192
Even those well
intentioned do getters

1031
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:43,028
who see therapy and
medication as bad and wrong,

1032
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,432
who see mentally ill individuals
as hapless and hopeless.

1033
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:47,068
They're wrong.

1034
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:52,004
I found hope in your work,

1035
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:55,541
a comrade in Missy, my rock
when no one else understood.

1036
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:57,676
You two are my twin lights,

1037
00:57:57,678 --> 00:58:00,546
when this disease
threatened to take me down.

1038
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:04,316
And treatment was
what got me through.

1039
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,121
Thank you, Daniel, for
your talent and your work.

1040
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,956
Thank you for everything.

1041
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,458
- Runner up,
- Sincerely,

1042
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,127
