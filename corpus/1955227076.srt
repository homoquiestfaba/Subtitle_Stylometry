He won't do anything.

00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,457
I'm serious!

8
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,394
Grandpa, I just want him to do
one trick, and he won't do it!

9
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:50,498
You'll never got a
job with the circus!

10
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,899
Sit down.

11
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,434
Roll over.

12
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,468

00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,807
Dad, should I lock it up, or
are you gonna come with us?

16
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,641
Yeah, I'm coming.

17
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,210
What do you think?

18
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,046
Billy, come on.

Come on.

22
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,319
Can I bring Shaq?

23
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,453
I can train him at the park.

24
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,721
How many times have I told you?

25
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,855
That dog is untrainable.

26
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,256
You're wasting your time.

27
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,124
But you haven't seen him.

28
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,025
He's doing better.

29
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,859

In the truck.

37
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,328
Why aren't you wearing them?

38
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,997
They hurt my feet.

39
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,866
They're too small?

40
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,768
My feet are too big.

41
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,070
I told your mom to
buy 2 sizes bigger.

42
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,673
Now another 20 bucks wasted.

43
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:11,278
You know, when I was your
age, I had three jobs.

44
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,947
I'm not gonna be
a gardener, Dad.

45
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,750
I don't really want
you to be a gardener.

46
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,655
I want to teach you
something... to be responsible.

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,961
What do you think?

48
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,796
All right.

Let's talk price.

50
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,932
You made the right choice.

51
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,603
It's a wise investment and
the buy of the century.

52
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,038
You get a Ford product
with a Japanese engine,

53
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:42,175
Which means you get comfort
and performs for 5,000 less.

You test drove this.

58
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,451
I hate foreign anything.

59
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,885
I only buy American.
No, no.

60
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:52,820
It was made here.

61
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,621
It is American.

62
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,590
You said a Japanese engine.

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,396
It's a Japanese engine made
here in our Georgia factory.

you to my manager.

And what man wouldn't want
to take it off, huh, Don?

68
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,388
This piece was inspired
from the red corvette.

It's hot.

You're on your way,
but you're running

00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,574
15 minutes late, which
is 45 in real time,

75
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,708
And you can't pick Johnny up.

76
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,276
I got stuck.
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,110
I couldn't leave.

78
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,579
I was with a client.

00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,646
What time does the game start?

80
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,647
Well, it's at midnight.

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,915
They moved it just for you.

82
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,450
Richard, why are you
being so difficult?

83
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,718
Because I'm busy, Irene.

84
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,919
Because the game is
always at 2 o'clock,

85
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,287
And you know that
because you failed

86
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,622
To pick him up five times.

87
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,323
Now, I gotta get out of
here and get him there

88
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,092
Because you're not there again.

89
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,393
I'll make it up to you.

90
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,628
I've got a customer
who's been waiting

91

30 minutes for a meatloaf.

92

If he doesn't get
it in 30 seconds,

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,764
He's walking outta here.

The first dent was
with your parking.

remind every day.

phone while you drive.

I had four ups.

I didn't sell a single car.

116

No sales, no
commission, no money.

117
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,337
I blanked.

selling any cars, Daddy.

00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:27,987
I'm gonna be late for school.

371
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,064
Thank you, Marta.

372
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,666
You're welcome.

373
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,868
Marta, what happened to you?

374
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:49,502
Oh.

375
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,137
No, I got robbed.

376
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,171
- You got robbed?
- No, no.

377
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,339
It's OK.
It's nothing.

378
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,373
Just some kid.

379
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:55,775
He took my money.

380
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,843
Are you OK?

381
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:57,544
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,611
I should call my doctor.

Yes, it doesn't hurt.

387

It's nothing.

388
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,719
OK.

389
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,888
Dad, I'm gonna be
late for school.

390
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,256
Hmm.

391
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,257
- Wake up.

392
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,425

OK, what you want for breakfast?

00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:26,038
I already ate two bowls of
cereal your coffee's ready.

I can smell it.

It smells pretty good.

404
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,745
Wait a minute.

405
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,681
Did you just say you
had two cups of coffee?

406
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,448
No.

407
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,049
Two bowls of cereal.

408
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,086
I had a crazy dream
that you dropped me off

409
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,554
At school on your way to work.

410
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,323
Cool, I was driving? 'Cause
I already know how, Dad.

411
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,525
I believe it.

412
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,193
I'm not even gonna
ask how you learned.

413
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,163
It's gonna be a great day.

414
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,634
Today is gonna be a great
day full of opportunities.

415
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:58,304
In fact, I bet I'll make
my first sale before noon.

416
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,839
Well, then, you
better hurry up,

417
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,641
Because I don't think you're
gonna go to work like this.

418
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,610
I guess I should change my
clothes and take a shower, huh?

419
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,911
Give me 7 minutes.

420
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,547
You always say that,
but you take 15.

421
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,414
Not this time.

422
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,448
Time me.

423
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,620
Where's my toothbrush?

424
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,458
Mrs. Rafiki, um, can I
ask if I can work more?

425
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,127
I could use more hours.

426
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,261
Even Sunday.

427
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,765

enough already.

It's not charity.

435
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,410
It's not charity.

436
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,912
It's a raise.

437
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:43,249
I wanted to give you a raise
last year, but I couldn't.

438
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,250
Don't tell Mr. Rafiki.

439
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,020
All right.
All right.

440
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,721

People will mock
you if you're Shaq.

he's clearing the lane.

Will Kobe shoot again?

00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,509
We're not seeing any
clients, you know?

555
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,345
I like to look good.

556
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,179
For me?

557
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,482
Pierce.

558
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,937
Gracias.

559
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,571
Oh, that's for one load.

560
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:33,739
We did two loads.

561
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,606
No, no, no.

562
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,607
No, no, no.

563
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,143
600.

564
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:37,810
All right?

565
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,846
You said $600.

566
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,580
For one load, senor.

567
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,315
$1,200 for two loads.

568
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:46,886
No, you said $600.

569
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,255
I said clean everything.

570
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,790
Now get out of here before
I call the immigration

571
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,525
Office or the police.

572
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,327
I don't care who you call.

573
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,965
You're gonna pay us
the money you owe us.

574
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,766
You threatening me
with a deadly weapon?

575
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,568
You know, just for
pointing that at me you can

576
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,203
Get 10 years in prison, amigo.

577
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,941
OK, so if I stick it in your
fucking stomach like this,

578
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,910
How many years do I get, amigo?

579
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,378
[Non-english speech]
Stop.

580
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,779
Hmm?

581
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,716
Now, please, pay us for
our work what we agree on.

582
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,252
Get off my property.

583
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,455
Pam, call 911.

584
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,524
OK, forget it.

585
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,993
I'll just take the 600.

586
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,494
Yeah, I thought you would.

587
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,829
You're gonna let this small
man get away with this?

588
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,432
You're gonna let him
rob us like this.

589
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:34,433
Let's go, Gerardo.

590
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,267
It's not worth it.

591
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,605
Shame on you, sir.

592
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,241
Get off my property, wetback.

593
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,375
You too, beaner.

594
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,514
OK, Gerardo.

595
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:49,581
There you go.
200 for you.

596
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,649
Oh no.
200, that's too much.

597
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,550
No, no, no.

598
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,551
That's what I told you.

599
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:53,953
It's good working with you.

600
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:54,820
You need a lift?

601
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:55,787
No, I'm OK.

602
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:56,855
OK.

603
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:57,890
Thanks a lot.

604
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:05,364
Billy, I'm gonna give
you three guesses.

605
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,766
What do you think they
had on special this week

606
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,535
At the grocery store?

607
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,669
I don't know.

608
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,538
I'll give you a hint.

609
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,675
On Monday, we had carrots,
and peas, and hot dogs.

610
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:21,480
On Tuesday, we had potatoes,
and coleslaw, and hot dogs.

611
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,716
And what do you think
we're having today?

612
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,452
Hot dog?

613
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,853
It's filet mignon.

614
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,957
Because that's what these
taste like to your dad.

615
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,359
It's mind over
matter... the military's

616
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,427
First line of defense.

617
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,795
Billy likes hot dogs.

618
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,331
You think everything you
push on Billy he likes.

619
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:39,999
It's not true.

620
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,534
Tell him, Billy.

621
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,369
You like hot dogs.

622
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,071
Don't you, Billy?

623
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,905
They're all right.

624
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:50,076
I like hot dogs too, but
not three times a week.

625
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,945
We got hot dogs
coming out of our ass.

626
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,313
Stand up to him, Billy.

627
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,816
Tell him you're sick of
hot dogs... and soccer.

628
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,751
He told me so himself.

629
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,053
I hate soccer too.

630
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,654
It's a faggot sport.

631
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,489
Come on.

632
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,823
Watch your mouth.

633
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,158
Watch what you say in
front of your grandson.

634
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,493
And soccer's not a faggot sport.

635
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,327
It is too.

636
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,328
It is not!

637
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:09,962
It is.

638
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,063
It's a faggot sport.

639
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,165
Football is a manly sport.

640
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,468
Look what the players wear...
Helmets and body armor.

641
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,138
They're like soldiers
going into battle.

642
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:23,475
In soccer, they wear little
shorts and little tank tops.

643
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,177
Need I say more?

644
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,546
In football, a
timeout is so they

645
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,749
Can carry players off the field
on stretchers on their way

646
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,917
To the hospital.

647
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,553
In soccer, timeout is a warning.

648
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:39,091
They wave a little yellow
card or a little pink card.

649
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,859
I don't know why
you want my grandson

650
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,161
To play a faggot sport.

651
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,196
I tried to teach
him how to box.

652
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,032
I tried to teach him how to box.

653
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,168
I don't like to hit people.

654
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,202
See?

655
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,871
He doesn't like to hit people.

656
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,940
He doesn't like to hit people.

657
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,342
You have to hit people!

658
00:32:56,442 --> 00:33:00,179
It's always you or
the other guy, OK?

659
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,447
Now, if I didn't
have this attitude,

660
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,049
I'd be dead right
now, and so'd he.

661
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,750
You understand?

662
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,219
Jesus Christ, Burt.

663
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,021
The kid's 10 years ago.

664
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,922
He's still trying
to find himself.

665
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,691
I don't care how old he is.

666
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,660
I mean, you fought in war, Dad.

667
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,828
I just fought in one.

668
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:21,800
In another 10 years, he'll
be fighting in one, and it...

669
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,072
It's my job to get him ready.

670
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,473
I don't wanna go to war.

671
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,121
Three civilians were
beheaded yesterday,

672
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,022
Oil workers from Kansas.

673
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,557
Well, if they didn't
wanna be beheaded,

674
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,660
Then they shoulda
stayed in Kansas.

675
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,496
And who's going
to rebuild Iraq?

676
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:51,730
You?

677
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,733
Do you think their sole
motive was to rebuild Iraq?

678
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:58,170
I mean, they're getting paid
three times as much over there

679
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,771
Than they are at home, so...

680
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,540
It's barbaric.

681
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,874
It's medieval.

682
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,044
When we dropped thousands of
missiles on Baghdad in Iraq,

683
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,946
We killed thousands of kids.

684
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,515
And what?

685
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,250
It's civilized because we didn't
see them die on television?

686
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,618
It's not the same thing!

687
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,587
It's the same result.
They're all dead.

688
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:19,358
So I don't see the difference
between beheading civilians

689
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,927
Or dropping missiles
on civilians.

690
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:22,961
Here, here.

691
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,795
Cheers.

692
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,900
I think everyone
seemed very happy.

693
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,635
The meat was overcooked.

694
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,138
I thought it was perfect.

695
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,973
It was burnt.

696
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,242
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,677
Is that why you're
sleeping with Sooha?

698
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,448
What did you say?

699
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,550
You heard me.

700
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,689
You are accusing me of
sleeping with your best friend?

701
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,856
You are crazy.

702
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,525
I'm not crazy.

703
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,860
I saw the way you
were holding her hand.

704
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,263
How was I holding her hand?

705
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,366
Very naturally, like you've
been doing it for years.

706
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,103
Between Dr. Phil and
Opera, you are going crazy.

707
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:38,937
You are nuts!

708
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,038
Stop saying that!

709
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,640
What do you want me to say?

710
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,676
I want you to say that you're
not cheating on me, because you

711
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:50,449
Love me, because you respect me
as a wife and as a human being!

712
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,752
I want you to tell me the truth!

713
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:59,124
I want to be kissed, and
held, and looked at the way

714
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,559
You were looking at her.

715
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,809
How can you even ask me that?

716
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,111
She's your best friend.

717
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,613
Do you think she
would betray you?

718
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,251
I'm sorry.

719
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,318
You're right.

720
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,290
Sooha would never do that.

721
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,241
What the fuck are
you doing here?

722
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:56,715
I'm pointing a
deadly weapon at you,

723
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,585
Which will later be referred
to as the murder weapon.

724
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:00,819
Li... listen.

725
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,220
Don't you wanna know how
many years I can get for it?

726
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,289
Don't you wanna know?

727
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,122
Don't worry.

728
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,357
I'll tell you.

729
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,659
Because you won't be
around to hear it.

730
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,728
15 to life.

731
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,030
What comes out of your
mouth next will determine

732
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,067
How much pain I inflict on you.

733
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,403
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:19,004
Dude, I don't wanna hear
your bullshit apology.

735
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,506
I don't wanna hear that shit.

736
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:23,342
What I wanna hear is how you
take advantage of everyone

737
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,544
Around you, like you
did my friend Hector.

738
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,578
OK, OK.

739
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:27,379
I do.

740
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,514
I take advantage of people.

741
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,948
Yeah, because you're
a piece of shit.

742
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,483
I am.
I am a piece of shit.

743
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,718
Get up.

744
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:33,685
Get up.

745
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:34,653
Ow!

746
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,021
God!

747
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,557
God!

748
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,925
Ow!

[Screaming]

750
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,865
I'll give you... I'll
give you your money.

751
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,266
There's $3,000 in there.

752
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,335
You can take it.

753
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,836
Just please don't hit me again.

754
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,705
Why couldn't you just
give us the money?

755
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:54,906
We worked for it.

756
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,577
And instead, all you
wanted to do was push.

757
00:37:58,677 --> 00:37:59,945
Oh god!

758
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,280
Stop.

759
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,782
I just got out the joint.

760
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,150
And now something
like this is just

761
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,353
Gonna send me straight back.

762
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:10,255
I'm afraid you've been
sentenced to death.

763
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,858
No, no, no!

Excuse me, sir.

May I help you?

767
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:24,129
You know, my first
brand new car was a Ford.

768
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,831
Crown Victoria.

769
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,267
It was a burgundy color.

770
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,472

771
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,707
I was just a kid.

772
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,008
Oh wow.

773
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:37,876
What a beauty.

774
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:42,748
My wife loved that car.

775
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,087
Could you spare some change?

776
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,158
Sure.

777
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,794
Sure.

778
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,397

how'd you become homeless?

Yeah, yeah.

MAN: Keep running.

789
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,413
Good try.

790
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,447
It's all right, son!

791
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,122
Oh.

792
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,257

He's terrible.

812
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:22,981
He's bad.

813
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,015
He's bad.

814
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:24,850
MAN: He can't block.

815

Hey.

Hey.

Can I fix you a plate?

No thanks.

eaten anything all day.

821
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,878
I know.

00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,413
It's rare, but I'm
trying to lose a few.

823
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,247
Come on.

824
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,017
You look great.

825
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,786
Thanks.

826
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,288
You know, Kelly, you
don't have to serve me.

827
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,291
It's not part of
your job description.

828
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,292
I don't mind.

829
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:09,795
I love serving you.

830
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,362
Besides, a good man
like you deserves

831
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,833
To be well taken care of.

832
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,434
Yeah.

833
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,740
OK, I'll... I'll take a salad,
and a steak, and maybe, like,

834
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,474
A real small baked potato.

835
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,043
Yeah.

836
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,278
And how about a little piece
of blueberry pie with ice cream

837
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,914
On the side?

838
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:29,748
That'd be great.

839
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,852
I'll bring you
another cup of coffee.

840
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:34,686
All right.

841
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,059
I'll tell you one thing.

842
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,994
When I have sex with my
wife it's like magic.

843
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,429
As soon as I get into
bed, she disappears.

844
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,065
And the last time my
wife drove the car,

845
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:21,733
She cracked it up
and went into a tree.

846
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,669
She told me it wasn't her
fault. She blew her horn.

847
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,073
What a crowd.

848
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,075
What a crowd.

849
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,643
Who is this guy?

850
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:32,811
Rodney Dangerfield.

851
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,412
Who?

852
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:35,480
He's a legend.

Rodney Dangerfield.

854
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,650
I tell you, my wife and
I, we never have sex.

855
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,618
We get undressed, we can't
stop laughing, you know?

856
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,960
I'll tell you.

857
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,929
I'll tell you, with my wife I
never know what's coming next,

858
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:51,963
You know?

859
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,131
Last night, she made
chocolate mousse.

860
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,400
An antler got
stuck in my throat.

861
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,035
And my kids, they
don't help either.

862
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,536
The other day told my
kid, someday you'll

863
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,637
Have children of your own.

864
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:00,672
He said so will you.

865
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,356
Yo, mamacita,
give me that purse.

Good.

Glad to be home.

872
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:10,608
Did you win?

873
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,210
I didn't gamble.

874
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,246
I was too busy with
the convention.

875
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,282
I called your room at
midnight, and no one answered.

876
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,190
I couldn't sleep.

877
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,892
I went down to the
lounge for a drink.

878
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:30,829
Good night.

879
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:36,768
Good night.

880
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,128
Set it down.

881
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:15,173
Marta, sit down a minute.

882
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,344
Yes, ma'am.

883
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,484
I expected him to cheat.

884
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:29,720
It's OK.

885
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,357
He's a man.

886
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:38,830
He comes home with
lipstick on his shirt.

887
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,967
I smell perfume.

888
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,034
I don't say anything.

889
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,236
I... I look the other way.

890
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,810
But... but to humiliate
me with my friend?

891
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:00,085
I knew he was cheating
with her, so that's why

892
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,487
I hired a private detective.

What can I do?

an overseas company trust.

How do you know that?

00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,090
I'm a good judge of character.

909

And I'm sorry to say this but,
your husband, he's a coward.

00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,285
Here, turn.

918
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,954
I don't know what, but
something's still missing.

919
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,123
We should just forget
this one and move on.

920
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,324
It's totally screwed up.

921
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,158
This...

922
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,530
It's the silk.

923
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,535
It's too soft to support the
sleek line you're looking for.

924
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,404
I can fix it.

925
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:02,473
I can put a bow in
there, there, and there.

926
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:06,077
And just give me a crack
at it before you scrap it.

927
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,414
I love the
simplicity of it all.

928
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:10,248
It's perfect.

929
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,583
And I love the way it feels on.

930
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,551
Can I have it?

931
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:14,519
You see?

932
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,753
Everyone's gonna want it.

933
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,622
You've outdone
yourself again, Irene.

934
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:18,756
You think so?

935
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:19,824
Yes.

936
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:20,658
You know what?

937
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:21,626
Maybe it's the bows.

938
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,429
Get rid of the bows.

939
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:25,263
Sure.

940
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:27,632
Uh, Why don't you come with me?

941
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,013
You should try it on yourself.

942
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,881
You'll look better in it.

943
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,782
Try it on.

944
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:45,716
Stop it.

945
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,551
Oh please.

946
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:06,071
You walk out of this house,
there is no coming back!

947
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,939
I'm not planning to come back.

948
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,409
I divorce you, and
you'll never get a penny!

949
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,610
I swear to God!

950
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,879
Oh, stop with your threats!

951
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:16,647
I want a divorce.

952
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,516
I don't want your money!

953
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:21,252
I'll get a job, and I'll
support myself the way I

954
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,255
Supported you all those years.

955
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,025
To hell with your
money and your mansion.

956
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:31,162
When I married you,
you had nothing.

957
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:35,066
But you were a good and a decent
man who cared about people!

958
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:39,070
The more money you
made, the worse you got.

959
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,574
In my eyes, you are
a very poor man.

960
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:44,775
OK.

961
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,610
OK.

962
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,981
I made a mistake.

963
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,783
I will not see Sooha again.

964
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,818
It's not about Sooha anymore.

965
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:01,226
I don't respect you,
and I don't trust you.

966
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,693
She meant nothing to me!

967
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:11,536
You are my wife, and you're
not leaving this house!

968
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:12,637
This is not Morocco.

969
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,240
You don't own me,
and you cannot order

970
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,042
Me like a meal in a restaurant.

971
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,644
What happened to you?

972
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:27,518
You see?

973
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:28,419
Looks better on you.

974
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:52,877
I just wanted to say goodbye.

975
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:56,080
He did not stop you.

976
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:56,914
He did.

977
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:57,848
You were right.

978
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,185
Then why are you leaving?

979
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:03,087
An hour ago, I
didn't want to leave.

980
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:07,091
But now there's
nothing I want more.

981
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:09,927
I just want to get out of here.

982
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,096
Thank you, Marta.

983
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:13,698
So where are you going to go?

984
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,436
I'm going to stay with
my cousin Selma for now.

985
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:19,304
I'm sorry.

986
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:20,505
Thank you, Marta.

987
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:34,585
Irene, what the
hell are you doing?

988
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:35,220
What?

989
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,321
What do you mean?

990
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:38,523
Are you sleeping with Pierce?

991
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:39,357
No.

992
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:40,758
Why are you asking?

993
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:43,794
The way you guys are
looking at each other lately,

994
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,129
The way you respond to him.

995
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,364
It's that obvious?

996
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:48,132
Like a huge smoke signal.

997
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,700
Are you sleeping with him?

998
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,236
No, I am not.

999
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,238
But you're going to.

1000
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,306
And that would be the
biggest mistake of your life.

1001
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,342
No, it's... he flirts with me.

1002
00:52:57,442 --> 00:53:00,445
He finds me very
endearing and sexy.

1003
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:03,548
I mean, it's nice to get
a compliment now and then.

1004
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:06,050
God knows I haven't gotten
one from Richard in a decade.

1005
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,386
You screw him, you
break up your marriage.

1006
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:12,257
He's a calculating
son of a bitch.

1007
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:15,092
It's not you he wants.

1008
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,694
It's this business he needs.

1009
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,128
You are so wrong.

1010
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,697
He's crazy about me.

1011
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:22,900
And please don't give me any
more advice on relationships.

1012
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,503
Your track record doesn't
exactly speak for itself.

1013
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:26,337
Fine.

1014
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:36,647
Hey.

1015
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:44,655
I love you, buddy.

1016
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,557
I love you too, Dad.

1017
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:51,095
You know, when I was your
age, my daddy used to tuck

1018
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:54,432
Me in and tell me he loved me.

1019
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,734
I used to say how much
you love me, Daddy?

1020
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,869
He'd say wait and see.

1021
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,206
I said wait and see what, Daddy?

1022
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:04,174
Until you have a
son of your own.

1023
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:07,712
Then you'll know
how much I love you.

1024
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:11,048
Now, when I was your age, I
thought he was cracking up.

1025
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:15,586
But now every time
I tuck you in,

1026
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,523
I know exactly what
he was talking about.

1027
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,625
You understand what I'm saying?

1028
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:21,292
No.

1029
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:22,560
Are you cracking up?

1030
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,728
I walked right into
that one, didn't I?

1031
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:27,798
All right.

1032
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:30,067
Good night.

1033
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:32,236
Mommy's not coming
back, is she/ she

1034
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:34,238
Ran away because
she doesn't want me,

1035
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:37,274
Because I drive her crazy.

1036
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,275
She told me so.

1037
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,977
Don't ever say that.

1038
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:43,247
No, you drive me crazy.

1039
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:45,115
I still want you.

1040
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,218
Only reason your mom even put
up with me as long as she did

1041
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,389
Is because of how
much she loves you.

1042
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,358
But she called an hour.

1043
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,926
I'm gonna go meet
her for a drink.

1044
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,161
Yeah.

1045
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,830
So you're gonna be
by yourself, OK?

1046
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,833
But I have my cell phone on me,
and I'm only 10 minutes away

1047
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,535
If you need me, OK?

1048
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,805
Is Mommy coming back
home with you tonight?

1049
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,840
Yeah, she is.

1050
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,909
Wake me up when she
gets here, please.

1051
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:15,012
No, I'm not gonna wake
you when she gets here.

1052
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,614
But I'll tell you what.

1053
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:20,050
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
have a big old fashioned family

1054
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,419
Breakfast.

1055
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,188
And that's a promise.

1056
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:25,756
All right, boy.

1057
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:26,757
Mwah.

1058
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:27,925
Good night.

1059
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:28,759
Good night.

1060
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:52,116
What's wrong, Hector?

1061
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,328
I want to go home.

1062
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,964
But we are home.

1063
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:09,667
We are American citizens now.

1064
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:13,638
It doesn't feel like home.

1065
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:17,775
Because of what happened to me?

1066
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:21,579
It's everything.

1067
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,418
I'm so tired all the time.

1068
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:32,490
I feel so old.

1069
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,563
Why do we have to be here?

1070
00:56:38,663 --> 00:56:41,432
But for our kids?

1071
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:42,800
They will have a
better future here.

1072
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:55,680
I can't even provide
enough for my family.

1073
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:01,151
I want to take more
work, but I can't.

1074
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:10,695
Last... last week, a man refused
to pay us for the work we did.

1075
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,566
I lost faith in people.

1076
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,943
Things are going to be fine.

1077
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:29,547
Our kids won't have
it as tough as us.

1078
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:30,581
They'll be educated.

1079
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,588
They won't be
gardeners and maids.

1080
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,557
They'll be professionals.

1081
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:40,958
We have to do this for them.

1082
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:47,998
Sorry I can't give
you a better life.

1083
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,834
Oh, but you have, Hector.

1084
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:53,971
You give me everything I need.

1085
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:58,042
I'm proud of what we have.

1086
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,162
Can you pick me up?

1087
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,635
It could be.

1088
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,070
No, it doesn't start.

1089
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:33,077
No, look I think it's a lemon,
and you have to take it back.

1090
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:36,681
So can you pick me up?

1091
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:41,085
OK.

1092
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:41,919
See you.

1093
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:45,756
Car trouble?

1094
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,227
You scared me.

1095
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,329
I thought everybody'd gone home.

1096
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:59,536
Uh, yes, they have, but I
was just doing some paperwork.

1097
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:02,472
So you need a lift?

1098
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:03,908
My roommate is
coming to get me.

1099
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,745
OK.

1100
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:08,813
Hey.

1101
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:12,416
Uh, can I have that
teddy you promised?

1102
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,618
Yes, of course.

1103
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,721
It's... it's in my
office, but I had

1104
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,589
To do some alterations to it.

1105
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:22,492
Maybe you want to
try it on first?

1106
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,094
Sure.

1107
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,195
Perfect.

1108
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,197
Please, come to my office.

1109
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,702
[Singing in french]

1110
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,023
Wow.

1111
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,625
Putain de merde.

1112
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,060
Tu es belle.

1113
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,628
It's perfect.

1114
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,030
I think it's big in here.

1115
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:00,865
Where?

1116
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:02,066
Here?

1117
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:02,700
Mhm.

1118
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,734
Right here.
No.

1119
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:04,969
No, It's perfect.

1120
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,840
Qu'est-ce que t'es
belle, putain.

1121
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,376
Hey, you wanna hear
the craziest thing?

1122
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:13,210
Yes, yes.

1123
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,949
For the last two
years, I've been

1124
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,418
Living with my boyfriend Josh.

1125
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:22,753
He's a drummer in a band.

1126
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:23,688
I won't tell anyone.

1127
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:24,755
I won't tell anyone.

1128
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,363
We have a German Shepard.

1129
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,801
It hasn't left my side
since we got him as a puppy.

1130
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:40,637
And when Josh fucks
me, the dog goes crazy.

1131
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:43,708
Barks like a maniac.

1132
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,009
I get so turned on.

1133
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,780
You can't fuck without the dog?

1134
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,617
Maybe you could just
bark a little for me?

1135
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:54,651
Get me in the mood?

1136
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,555
Bark?

1137
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,458
Mhm.

1138
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,027
Ruff, ruff.

1139
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:06,296
Arf, arf!

1140
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,933
Hmm, like a big dog.

1141
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:11,702
Louder.

1142
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,804
Arf, arf, arf, arf!

1143
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:19,309
Maybe... maybe if
you get on all fours.

1144
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,144
All fours?

1145
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:20,978
It works.

1146
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:22,279
Yes, yes.

1147
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:27,151
Like a real big dog.

1148
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,019
Arf, arf.

1149
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,787
Oh, louder.

1150
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:30,620
That's a little poodle.

1151
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,590
I want a Great Dane.

1152
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,458
Give it to me.

1153
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,226
Arf, arf, arf!

1154
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:37,227
Louder!

1155
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,195
Arf!

1156
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,063
Louder!

1157
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:39,964
Come on.

1158
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:40,998
- Arf, arf, arf, arf!
- Come on.

1159
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,499
Let me hear you.
Bark, bark!

1160
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:43,333
Big dog.

1161
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,301
It's a big dog!

1162
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,236
[Barking]

1163
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:54,411
Stop!

1164
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,546
It's not working.

1165
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,983
I need a real dog.

1166
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,785
What do you mean
it's not working?

1167
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:01,952
I can be a real dog.

1168
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,153
Please, come back here!

1169
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,188
Look.

1170
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,957
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!

1171
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,092
Please, come back here.

1172
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:08,926
Merde.

1173
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:19,837
Hey.

1174
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:30,680
Thanks for calling.

1175
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:32,582
We were worried sick about you.

1176
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,985
I told you I wanted
to check out Vegas.

1177
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:35,619
Yeah.

1178
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,054
Yeah, you did.

1179
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,455
But you didn't say you were
gonna have an adventure

1180
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:39,489
And clean out the bank account.

1181
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,361
I needed the money.

1182
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,695
What?

1183
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:49,934
You care more about me
or the lousy five grand?

1184
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:51,368
This is a big mistake.

1185
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:52,970
I don't need this shit.

1186
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:53,637
Please.

1187
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,339
Brenda, please.

1188
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,507
We need to talk.

1189
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,442
Just...

1190
01:02:58,542 --> 01:02:59,276
Coffee?

1191
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:02,679
Can I see a wine list?

1192
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,814
Uh, we have house wine.

1193
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:04,949
Red or white?

1194
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:06,050
What kind of red?

1195
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,683
Cabernet?

1196
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,784
Merlot?

1197
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:08,618
Give me a break, honey?

1198
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,453
What do I look like?

1199
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:10,888
A wine connoisseur?

1200
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:11,922
What happened to this town?

1201
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:13,090
Did everyone take a rude pill?

1202
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,858
Hey.

1203
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,426
I'll take coffee, please.

1204
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,228
Fine.

1205
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,664
White, please.

1206
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,033
Cup of joe and a chablis.

1207
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,069
Thank you so much for
dining with us this evening.

1208
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:34,945
Let's go home.

1209
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,417
I have been going
out of my mind.

1210
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:45,189
I have tried to make this work.

1211
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:46,223
I have tried.

1212
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,761
But I got married too early.

1213
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:54,564
You got me pregnant.

1214
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,066
I didn't want a baby at 20.

1215
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,835
I had a singing career, but
you forced me to have it.

1216
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,171
And I hate being a mom.

1217
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:04,141
I'm not the fucking
soccer mom type.

1218
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:05,910
Do you listen to
yourself when you speak?

1219
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:12,983
Our son is 10 years old, and
you're still talking abortion.

1220
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:16,053
Derrick is a beautiful boy.

1221
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:17,387
And he misses his mommy.

1222
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:21,391
Does that mean anything to you?

1223
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:22,526
Don't do this to me, Mark.

1224
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:26,363
Do not lay a guilt trip on me.

1225
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,331
Christ, I need a drink.

1226
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,339
How is he?

1227
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,519
I was happy in Vegas.

1228
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,957
No, I started writing
my own songs again.

1229
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:54,558
And Danny wrote this
beautiful melody.

1230
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:55,492
I mean, you should hear it.

1231
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:56,693
It's awesome.

1232
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:57,827
I sang it at the
Skylark the other night.

1233
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:00,597
People went crazy.

1234
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:02,132
I love being adored.

1235
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:02,967
Adored?

1236
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:04,969
Adored by who?

1237
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,971
A bunch of lounge lizards?

1238
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,041
Is that worth giving
up your family for?

1239
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,210
You think you're the only one
with dreams and aspirations?

1240
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:18,915
You think being a car salesman
was my life's ambition?

1241
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:20,184
I do it to pay the bills.

1242
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:30,227
Baby, if you want to
take a couple weeks

1243
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,297
And sing wherever you
wanna sing, that's fine.

1244
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:37,501
Danny and I are
moving in together.

1245
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,869
We rented a house in Vegas.

1246
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,205
I'm driving back
with him tonight.

1247
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:44,941
I want a divorce.

1248
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:57,854
What about Derrick?

1249
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,823
You're good with him.

1250
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,626
You're a good father.

1251
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:03,693
I want you to have full custody.

1252
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,168
You're not even gonna
say goodbye, are you?

1253
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:12,869
I think it's best not to.

1254
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:13,737
Best for who?

1255
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,174
Best for you?

1256
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:24,114
Normal people don't
act like this.

1257
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,449
You wanna talk normal?

1258
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:30,954
There is nothing normal
about our relationship, OK?

1259
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:32,456
You should stick
to your own kind.

1260
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,094
That's what my dad said
the first day I met you.

1261
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,228
If I'd have listened
to him then,

1262
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,698
I wouldn't be in
this fucking mess.

1263
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,367
No, we have a son.

1264
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:49,139
And you're not gonna toss him
out like an old pair of shoes.

1265
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,708
Haven't you heard what
I've been telling you?

1266
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,910
I do not want you.

1267
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,779
I do not want our son.

1268
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,980
I want a divorce!

1269
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,516
That's what I want!

1270
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:01,951
What are you doing?

1271
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,053
I'm calling the cops.

1272
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,458
[Coughing]

1273
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:16,032
Ouch!

1274
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:49,299
Mr. Johnson, I'm Nadia Baker.

1275
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,868
So terribly sorry
to keep you waiting.

1276
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:52,769
Can I get you anything?

1277
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:53,937
My son, please.

1278
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:54,938
Yes, he's fine.

1279
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:56,473
Derrick's doing quite well.

1280
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,941
May I see him?

1281
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:58,775
No, actually.

1282
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:01,145
Not quite yet.

1283
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,246
I'll be straight with you.

1284
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:04,681
I'm pretty new on the job.

1285
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:07,951
However, I'm trying to
handle this as best as I can,

1286
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,487
But it is a very
serious situation.

1287
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,523
If this is proven to be neglect,
you could lose your son,

1288
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,792
Or you could face up
to six years in prison.

1289
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,594
Spare me what
the textbook crap,

1290
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,430
And please bring someone in
here who is not new on the job

1291
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,166
So I can ask them
some questions.

1292
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:23,467
Like your supervisor.

1293
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:26,303
In fact, I'm not
answering anything else

1294
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:27,671
Until I see Derrick.

1295
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,475
OK, Mark, I want to
reunite you with your son.

1296
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,109
Then do it.

1297
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,078
I can't do it.

1298
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:37,647
My supervisor can't do it.

1299
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,417
No one can do it until
the child undergoes

1300
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:44,788
Psychological and physical
tests to prove it was not abuse.

1301
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:45,955
Abuse?

1302
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,224
You think I would abuse my son?

1303
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,326
I don't know.

1304
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:53,997
If you work with me voluntarily,
things will go smoother,

1305
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,399
And it'll be over in a few days.

1306
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:58,602
If you don't, you're gonna
force us to go to court,

1307
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:01,938
Open up a case, and yeah,
you're gonna get a very

1308
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,473
Experienced social worker.

1309
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:07,344
And it's gonna take you
weeks, maybe even months.

1310
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:08,178
Stop.

1311
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:09,246
Just stop.

1312
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,384
I can't possibly
live without him.

1313
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,154
He's all I've got.

1314
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:22,392
Do you understand that?

1315
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:25,795
He's all I've got.

1316
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,873
How often are you
left alone, son?

1317
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:37,974
Is my dad in trouble?

1318
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:39,543
No one is in trouble.

1319
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:41,578
We just have to ask
these questions.

1320
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,346
It's routine.

1321
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:44,080
I wanna go home with my dad.

1322
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,449
I know you do,
sweetie, but I can't

1323
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,116
Let you do that right now.

1324
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,385
I'm sorry.

1325
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:49,986
I have to keep you
separated from your dad

1326
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:51,187
While we run these tests.

1327
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,822
It's gonna take a few days.

1328
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,258
It's the law.

1329
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:57,394
We're gonna call
your grandparents.

1330
01:09:57,494 --> 01:10:00,029
You'll have to stay with
them for a few days, OK?

1331
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,565
They won't come?

1332
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,399
Why not.

1333
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,833
Because they hate black people.

1334
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,496
You all right, Burt?

1335
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:37,166
Oh yeah.

1336
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:38,001
I'm OK, Dad.

1337
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:41,638
It I'm OK.

1338
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:45,309
Same dream?

1339
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,080
Yeah.

1340
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,516
It's that boy's face.

1341
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,921
It's never gonna leave me, Dad.

1342
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,960
Why didn't... why didn't
he start driving it?

1343
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,562
I don't know.

1344
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:10,266
Maybe he wanted them all to die,
and he was using you to do it.

1345
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:14,404
It's not your fault. You
were just doing your job.

1346
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,505
They were kids, Dad.

1347
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,272
Come on.

1348
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:18,775
They hadn't done nothing.

1349
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:19,676
Why?

1350
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,078
Things happen.

1351
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:23,313
That's all.

1352
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,049
And nobody understands why.

1353
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,016
That's all.

1354
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,685
They just... they just do.

1355
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,120
They just happen.

1356
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,559
30 years I was in the army.

1357
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,695
All those villages
we bombed in Vietnam,

1358
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,666
I don't know what the
hell we were doing there.

1359
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,335
You wanted to follow in my
footsteps and be a serviceman?

1360
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:46,603
All right.

1361
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,071
You could've stayed
here in Chatsworth,

1362
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,139
Opened a hardware store,
some kind of a nice business,

1363
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,541
A luncheonette maybe.

1364
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,377
Whatever you were, you
could have done anything.

1365
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,211
You could have saved
your marriage too.

1366
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,681
Linda wouldn't have run off with
the office manager, whatever

1367
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,216
That putz's name
was, if you hadn't

1368
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,486
Been gone for a year in Iraq.

1369
01:12:02,586 --> 01:12:04,287
If you're trying
to cheer me up,

1370
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:05,689
Dad, you're doing
a really lousy job.

1371
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:09,626
Look at me.

1372
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:13,262
The key to your sanity
is within your reach.

1373
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,365
You have to stop
punishing yourself.

1374
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:18,067
You just have to decide to
stop punishing yourself.

1375
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,102
You have to let go.

1376
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:20,269
Let go.
Let go.

1377
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,304
Let go of everything.

1378
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:22,972
Let go of Billy, first of all.

1379
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:23,973
He's not a soldier.

1380
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,976
He's a 10 year old, a kid.

1381
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,513
And you have to let go of Linda.

1382
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:31,080
You have to forgive her.

1383
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,450
You have to, for Billy's sake!

1384
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,984
The boy needs his mother.

1385
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:46,763
[Phone ringing]

1386
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,503
Hello?

1387
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:54,704
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

1388
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:55,539
Thank you.

1389
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:12,388
OK.

1390
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:19,128
Please, look.

1391
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,096
OK.

1392
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,498
Look at that.

1393
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:22,866
The workmanship is terrible.

1394
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:26,069
It looks like it was
made by a blind person.

1395
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:28,037
Look at these.

1396
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,406
[Inaudible]

1397
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:34,377
And we need it done quick,
quick, quick, quick.

1398
01:13:34,478 --> 01:13:37,246
Oh la la, another day is wasted.

1399
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,749
You could get
down on all fours.

1400
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:40,817
All fours?

1401
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,953
Yeah, you know,
like a real dog.

1402
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,289
No, please.

1403
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:47,991
OK.
Yeah.

1404
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:48,858
Just like that.

1405
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:55,231
You really think he's trying
to take control of the company?

1406
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,500
Yes.

1407
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,137
And it's you who should
be controlling it.

1408
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:02,939
Without you, there
is no company.

1409
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:08,344
I feel like a total idiot.

1410
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,212
I'm sorry.

1411
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:15,218
Richard flipped
a million burgers

1412
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:18,121
So I could have a career, and I
was gonna leave him for a dog.

1413
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,827
Shaq, Shaq, stay.

1414
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:24,528
Watch, Grandpa!

1415
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,295
Watch what Shaq does.

1416
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,364
Sit.

1417
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,232
Now down.

1418
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,470
Roll over!

1419
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,106
Whoever said you can't
teach an old dog new tricks,

1420
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,608
He had it all wrong.

1421
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,209
I can't believe it.

1422
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,979
I've been trying for months, and
all of a sudden he's doing it.

1423
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,380
I know.

1424
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,817
You'd better hurry up if you're
not gonna be late for the game.

1425
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:48,685
Look, Billy.

1426
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,757
You don't have to play today.

1427
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:55,324
He doesn't have to play soccer?

1428
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,393
I finally got it, Dad.

1429
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,195
Just like that old dog.

1430
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,697
Look, son.

1431
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:05,669
I'm not gonna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.

1432
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:09,272
But you love sports, Dad.

1433
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:10,439
That's right.

1434
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,809
I... I love sports.

1435
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,614
I wanna go.

1436
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,650
I wanna play today.

1437
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,851
I think we're going to win.

1438
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:22,986
Let him go.

1439
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,020
Let him go.

1440
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:24,854
The Tigers haven't
won a game all year.

1441
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:25,922
Come on.

1442
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,925
But Shaq never did a
trick before either.

1443
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,628
I can feel it.

1444
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,897
We can win today, Dad.

1445
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:34,731
I wanna play.

1446
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,603
Let's go.

1447
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:40,837
Come on, Shaq.

1448
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:42,772
So let me understand this.

1449
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:46,109
You haven't sold of thing all
month, but you want a day off?

1450
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,611
I'll be back.

1451
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,746
All I need is three hours to
go downtown for a meeting.

1452
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:52,616
You're supposed to
sell 23 cars a month.

1453
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:58,588
The flooring on 23 cars is
$230 a day times 30 days.

1454
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:00,089
You do the math.

1455
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,057
That's over six grand.

1456
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:03,292
That's what you
cost me this alone.

1457
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,694
Last year, I was
the top salesman

1458
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,495
For six straight months.

1459
01:16:06,596 --> 01:16:09,198
I've done great
for this company.

1460
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:12,468
Look, Joe.

1461
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,170
I'm having a hard time.

1462
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,504
I have a problem.

1463
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:17,006
Yes, you do.

1464
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:18,441
You can't sell cars.

1465
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,776
I can sell cars!

1466
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:22,912
Well, then get out
there and sell something.

1467
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,213
I don't have time for this.

1468
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,348
I gotta get downtown.

1469
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,449
I have a meeting
that I can't miss.

1470
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:27,350
Hey, great.

1471
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,685
You just stay downtown.

1472
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,486
They got a lot of car
dealerships down here.

1473
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,489
Why don't you get one of
them to give you a job.

1474
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,358
Are you firing me?

1475
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,593
You know our sales policy.

1476
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:40,163
You bottom out for three
straight months, you're out.

1477
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,405
Perfect.

1478
01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:50,640
Ah, Irene.

1479
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,475
Are you ready for lunch?

1480
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:54,010
Yes.

1481
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:54,844
But not with you.

1482
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:20,970
DERRICK: Daddy!

1483
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:21,805
Hey.

1484
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:28,177
Oh man.

1485
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,212
I missed you, Daddy.

1486
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,614
I missed you too, son.

1487
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:32,749
I missed you too.

1488
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:36,252
Daddy, are you crying?

1489
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:37,520
What?

1490
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,521
No, no.

1491
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:39,488
I'm happy.

1492
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,323
I'm happy, man.

1493
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,060
Daddy, I was not scared.

1494
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,162
I did what you told me
to do in case of a fire.

1495
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:47,630
I'm so proud of you.

1496
01:17:47,731 --> 01:17:49,799
My little man, hmm?

1497
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,869
Hey, I need you to
listen to me now.

1498
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:56,806
This nice lady, she's
a friend of Daddy's.

1499
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,275
I want you to listen to
her and do everything

1500
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,178
She tells you to do, OK?

1501
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,147
And I'll come back.

1502
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,915
I'll come back and
see you to tomorrow.

1503
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,917
I'm not gonna live
with you anymore?

1504
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,152
No.

1505
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:09,919
Come on.

1506
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,822
I need to find us a house.

1507
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:15,191
Can't have you move into
the motel with me, can I?

1508
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,626
Daddy, I did not
burn the house down.

1509
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:18,494
I swear!

1510
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:22,766
Hey, I know, son.

1511
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:29,338
Derrick honey, we have
to go to your soccer game.

1512
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,674
I want my daddy to take me.

1513
01:18:31,775 --> 01:18:33,409
Can I take him?

1514
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:35,344
Yeah, sure you can.

1515
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:38,347
I mean, why not?

1516
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,348
Yeah, I'm going with you, so...

1517
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:51,227
How you doing, Linda?

1518
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,763
I'm fine.

1519
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,965
You're about to see the
first one of the season.

1520
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,066
Really?

1521
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,267
Uh-huh.

1522
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,102
Absolutely.

1523
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:02,571
I have some inside information.

1524
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:03,539
Billy's playing well.

1525
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:07,276
He said you push him hard.

1526
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,677
Look, Linda.

1527
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:11,314
I don't wanna fight
with you anymore.

1528
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,281
I don't wanna fight anymore.

1529
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,218
No more lawyers, OK?

1530
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:17,120
I just want what's
best for Billy.

1531
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,821
That's all.

1532
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:18,955
And what is that?

1533
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,156
For you to have full custody?

1534
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,197
I shouldn't have
fought you for custody.

1535
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:29,665
But I was angry
for you leaving me,

1536
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,534
So I tried to discredit
you as a mother.

1537
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:35,939
And I realize now that all I was
doing was hurting my own son.

1538
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:37,974
I don't wanna do that anymore.

1539
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:40,676
I wanna share Billy with you.

1540
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,610
I wanna be part of his life.

1541
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,112
I'm his father.

1542
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,780
I wanna share him with
you, so we can give him

1543
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:45,882
All the confidence
he needs to get

1544
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,917
Through this difficult time.

1545
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:49,652
I mean, we're his parents.

1546
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:50,486
Thank you.

1547
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,259
Why don't you come
inside and watch the game?

1548
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:57,160
Come on.

1549
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:57,994
Come on inside.

1550
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,532
MAN: All right.

1551
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:04,300
WOMAN: Come on, Tigers!

1552
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,371
MAN: Come on.

1553
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,205
WOMAN: Come on, Jason!

1554
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:14,143
WOMAN: Let's go, Green.

1555
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:14,978
Let's go.

1556
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:16,779
Woo!

1557
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,514
[Whistle]

1558
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:19,482
- Ball game!
- Come on, Kevin.

1559
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:20,349
Let's go!

1560
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,321
MAN: Get after the ball!

1561
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:25,889
Move your feet, Billy!

1562
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,624
Come on now.

1563
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:31,560
[Cheering]

1564
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,561
Yeah!

1565
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,396
All right!

1566
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,537
I lost my job today.

1567
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:42,872
You know what?

1568
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,241
I didn't even hear that
you lost your job, OK?

1569
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,310
OK.

1570
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:50,179
Are you gonna be able
to get another job?

1571
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,647
Tomorrow.

1572
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,083
Are you sure?

1573
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,118
What are you doing here?

1574
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,785
I took the afternoon off.

1575
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:57,786
We just scored a goal.

1576
01:20:57,887 --> 01:20:58,654
We're up one to nothing.

1577
01:20:58,754 --> 01:20:59,755
I saw.

1578
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,656
Go, go, buddy.

1579
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:01,457
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1580
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:05,561
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1581
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:10,533
MAN: Billy, you're
not trying your best.

1582
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:11,367
Move up!

1583
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:17,907
Are you OK?

1584
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:19,075
I'm fine.

1585
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:19,909
OK.

1586
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:25,881
Hey, I'm sorry.

1587
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:29,185
For being a terrible
wife and mother.

1588
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:30,553
You're not a terrible mother.

1589
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:36,725
Get it?

1590
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:37,593
I get it.

1591
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,469
[Whistle]

1592
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:49,072
[Cheering]

1593
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:00,783
I mean, every parent
wants better for their kids

1594
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,051
Than what they had.

1595
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,353
You want better for
Derrick, don't you?

1596
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,990
No, I want him to be
a used car salesman.

1597
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,359
Come on.

1598
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:11,194
Hustle, hustle!

1599
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,135
Yes!

1600
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:20,903
Hey, there you go, son!

1601
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:21,937
Derrick!

1602
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:25,308
Look at that.

1603
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,475
That's my son.

1604
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:27,310
That's my son.

1605
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,144
All right.

1606
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,241
[Whistle]

1607
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,706
Hey, buddy, it's...
It's time for you to go

1608
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:33,076
With Daddy's friend now, OK?

1609
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:35,844
No, I wanna go home with you.

1610
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,146
Derrick, we talked about this.

1611
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:38,881
No, you lied to me.

1612
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:40,083
What?

1613
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:41,250
I lied to you?

1614
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,951
Yeah, you said Mommy
was coming home.

1615
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,087
She's never coming home.

1616
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:45,588
And now you?

1617
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:46,222
You don't want me.

1618
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:47,956
It's not true, son.

1619
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:49,625
Derrick, we have to go.

1620
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:50,959
Come here.

1621
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,161
You'll see your daddy tomorrow.

1622
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,371
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

1623
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,906
I promise.

1624
01:24:04,006 --> 01:24:05,508
You already broke your promise.

1625
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:08,877
Come on.

1626
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:09,712
Come on, Derrick.

1627
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:16,051
Come on.

1628
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:39,642
Mr. Washington,
nice to see you.

1629
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:40,776
It's good to see you.

1630
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,445
This Derrick Johnson.

1631
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:44,247
Well, hello, there,
Derrick Johnson.

1632
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:46,915
He's gonna be staying with
you for a couple days.

1633
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,752
Well, good.

1634
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:50,786
All right, honey.

1635
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:53,456
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

1636
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:54,623
OK.

1637
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:55,458
Bye.

1638
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,370
What do you want?

1639
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:16,645
This reminds me of our
little garden in Casablanca.

1640
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,257
I miss you.

1641
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:31,427
I feel like a big
piece of me is missing.

1642
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:32,895
I... I cannot imagine
my life without you!

1643
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:40,736
I'm so sorry if I
took you for granted.

1644
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:03,592
Son, wait till your
mother gets here.

1645
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:16,705
Here you go, little one.

1646
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:25,614
Bon appetit.

1647
01:26:29,652 --> 01:26:31,554
Whose birthday?

1648
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:32,555
No one's.

1649
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:34,757
But we're having
dinner together.

1650
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:35,991
Just like a family should.

1651
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,393
And no other reason?

1652
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:38,961
And no other reason.

1653
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:44,567
Son, who is this alien and what
did she do with your mother?

1654
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:46,502
I think we should
keep her though.

1655
01:26:46,602 --> 01:26:48,537
Because she has great buns.

1656
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:49,372
All right?

1657
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:04,052
Can I play?

1658
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,321
No.

1659
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:07,790
You're not even supposed
to be in my room.

1660
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,959
Is it true?

1661
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:11,960
What?

1662
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,896
You burned down your house.

1663
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:14,730
No.

1664
01:27:17,433 --> 01:27:19,134
How come you're here?

1665
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,636
My mommy's a junkie.

1666
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,971
She was caught shooting up
in the presence of a minor.

1667
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:23,906
That's me.

1668
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:26,642
I know what a minor is.

1669
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:27,410
I like this room.

1670
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:29,144
I should ask for this one.

1671
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,479
I'm already in it.

1672
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,680
I've been here for a month.

1673
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,715
I have seniority.

1674
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:34,249
I'm only gonna be
here for three days.

1675
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:35,518
You can have it when I leave.

1676
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:36,819
That's what they told me.

1677
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,322
Malcolm was supposed
to be here for one day.

1678
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:41,357
He's been here for
over three months.

1679
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,892
No one's ever been here
for less than three months.

1680
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:44,727
Get out.

1681
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:45,361
Leave.

1682
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:46,729
Leave me alone, OK?

1683
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:47,563
OK.

Mom?

1688
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:11,354
Mom, are you OK?

1689
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:14,089
You're making too much
noise and I can't sleep.

1690
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:15,991
I'm sorry.

1691
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:18,794
Your dad was making me laugh.

1692
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:20,295
Oh, I don't see him.

1693
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:21,196
Where is he?
Oh.

1694
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,731
I'm right here, son.

1695
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:24,733
I was just tickling your mom
and telling her some jokes.

1696
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,336
And I'm sorry if
we were too loud.

1697
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:28,170
We'll be quiet.

1698
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:29,204
No, no, no.

1699
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,273
I like it when you guys laugh.

1700
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:33,208
Me too.

1701
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,309
Go back to bed.

1702
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:35,277
- Go to bed.
- Good night, Mom.

1703
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:36,345
Good night, Dad.

1704
01:28:39,348 --> 01:28:40,282
I better check on him.

1705
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:41,517
OK, all right.

1706
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:42,718
Hey, let's laugh on more time.

Where do you think you're going?

1710
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,306
Let me go!

Oh, where did you
go, my sweet child.

No, don't play
these games with me.

I'm up, then I fall,
and sorry through it

1731
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:07,530
All, for loving so blindly.

1732
01:31:10,766 --> 01:31:14,737
You came for a time, and
you weren't really mine,

1733
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:19,041
So you left me
here just bleeding.

1734
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,744
And I walk through the
snow, too sick to let go,

1735
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:24,813
And I'm not ready
for the healing.

1736
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:31,787
Not ready for you to leave.

1737

You're nothing but
a ghost in my head,

1738

Some hope I had
Something left unsaid.

1739
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:50,405
And I didn't really
know you at all.

1740
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:55,844
So how come I feel so small?

1741

So small?

1742
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,652
I can't feel you at all.

1743

1744
01:33:02,444 --> 01:33:03,178
Thank you.

Marta, please, join us.

1747
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:19,962
I have 20 orange trees
on this property.

1748
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:25,133
And they carry oranges
for eight months a year.

1749

I love orange juice.

1750
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:27,469
I drink it every day.

01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:29,838
I think it is a miracle drink.

1752
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:32,975
I think we take God's creations
for granted sometimes.

1753
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:41,784
With all the technology
in the world,

1754
01:33:41,884 --> 01:33:47,756
Machines cannot manufacture
one orange like this one.

1755
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:53,128
So you see, I am very
fond of my garden.

1756
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:55,630
That's why we need
a gardener like you,

pride in his work.

you work here 4 to 5

You drive here with Marta,
and you leave together.

We will double
whatever you're making,

1762
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:16,384
And plus whatever
supplies you need.

1763
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:17,986
No, that's too much.

1764
01:34:18,086 --> 01:34:20,188
No, it is not.

1765
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,925
That is what we are going to pay
you to take care of our garden.

1766
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:31,133
Yes.
