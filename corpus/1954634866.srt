1
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,475
The world is reeling.

2
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:22,234
Errol Flynn, movie star, matinee idol,
notorious ladies' man,

3
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,695
is dead at the age of 50.

4
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,363
The hero of a generation,

5
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:30,201
equally known for his swashbuckling
in public and in private.

6
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,472
He died true to form, in the arms
of a much younger girlfriend.

7
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:39,145
Now, all of America is asking,
"Who is the girl?"

8
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,433
Just got a few questions out here.

9
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,167
Just a couple questions.

10
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,669
All right,
first let's all just move back

11
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,905
and give Miss Aadland some room,
would you, please?

12
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:09,640
- Miss Aadland!
- Miss Aadland! There she is!

13
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,609
Is it true that Errol Flynn
died in your arms?

14
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,644
- What were his last words?
- How long had you known him?

15
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,279
Miss Aadland,
are you going to the funeral?

16
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,681
Miss Aadland, did Flynn leave you
anything in his will?

17
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,844
Miss Aadland!

18
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,783
- Beverly!
- How old are you?

19
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,449
- Bev!
- Are you going to the funeral?

20
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,722
Beverly.

21
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:27,188
Miss Aadland, what were
you doing in Vancouver?

22
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,693
Don't push! Don't push!

23
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:32,229
- She's gonna faint.
- Beverly!

24
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,028
Please, just get back!

25
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,543
Hey!

26
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,014
Beverly!

27
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,571
What was your relationship...

28
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,391
The girl fainted.

29
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,679
Yeah, it's a pretty crazy scene
over here.

30
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,593
Hey, let me call you back later.

31
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,602
Excuse me, ma'am.

32
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,903
- Are you the mother?
- Yes.

33
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,706
Hi, I'm Tedd Thomey, here's my card.
I was wondering if you could just...

34
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,276
- A few questions about your daughter?
- I'm in a hurry. I...

35
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:19,844
Is it true that she was mentioned
in the will?

36
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:22,246
Well, he wanted to make sure
she was very well looked after.

37
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,581
Well, do you think she's pregnant?

38
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,149
- Pregnant?
- We just saw her faint.

39
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:28,085
We're talking a big age difference here,
do you think that they were in love?

40
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,523
Oh, head over heels in love, yes.
I mean, it was her first love, and his last.

41
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:36,362
I couldn't have done anything to stop it,
even if I wanted to. It was all predestined.

42
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:41,190
Mrs. Aadland, look this way.
Here, take this. And dab your eye.

43
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,682
- Looks great. Thanks.
- Do you need another one?

44
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,592
- Baby, are you close?
- Going as fast as I can.

45
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,244
- Let me see.
- Hold on.

46
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,935
I thought we agreed on the bolero dress,
the Paula Lynn.

47
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,349
What's wrong with this?

48
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,704
Nothing. It's adorable, but it
makes you look too young. Trust me.

49
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,746
Now, this is much better.

50
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,994
- They're here already.
- All right, Herb.

51
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,585
Here you go.

52
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:38,155
I've canceled your dance class
for the next three weeks.

53
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,436
But you can still make the acting class
as long as you don't go over time.

54
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,827
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.

55
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,796
I said I'd go bowling
with some of the gang.

56
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,232
Well, never mind about that.

57
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,335
You know, Mrs. Morgan is so excited.

58
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:55,737
She couldn't believe when I told her
that you were in a movie with Gene Kelly.

59
00:05:56,774 --> 00:06:00,477
- I'm only in the chorus line.
- I know, but that's just for now.

60
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,581
I mean, what's that Natalie Wood
girl have, that you don't have?

61
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:06,714
- Cab's waiting.
- All right, Herb.

62
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,521
- Now, remember your manners...
- But don't fade into the woodwork.

63
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,487
That's my girl. Beautiful.

64
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,990
- Bye bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

65
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,771
Excuse me,
may I talk to you for a moment?

66
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,429
Sure.

67
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,108
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.

68
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:09,747
I'm Orry Kelly, doing costumes on Too Much,
Too Soon over on stage eight,

69
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,317
and there's a certain someone over there,
who would very much like to meet you.

70
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:16,289
- Who?
- Errol Flynn.

71
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,603
You know who he is, don't you?

72
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,363
Sure.

73
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,573
Robin Hood.

74
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,933
- Are you decent?
- Never, come in.

75
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,555
Hello, there. I'm Errol Flynn,
and who might you be?

76
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:54,291
I'm Beverly Aadland.
Pleased to meet you.

77
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,562
Pleased to meet you.
And what exactly do you do, Miss Aadland?

78
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,063
Actor, singer, dancer.

79
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:03,400
Really? All three, that's extraordinary.
Triple threat, yes.

80
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,734
I envy you, I never could dance myself.

81
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:08,372
- Or sing.
- Or act.

82
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:11,141
How long have you been
in this profession, Miss Aadland?

83
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,643
Forever, pretty much.

84
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,596
- A seasoned professional.
- I guess.

85
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:19,266
- I'd better be going.
- What? No, no, no, no. Stay, Orry. Stay.

86
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:23,467
Isn't she an exquisite creature?
She'd be perfect, don't you think?

87
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,971
Yes. Yes, Errol. Perfect.

88
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,515
Aadland residence.

89
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,116
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>
- Hi.

90
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,952
I can't make acting class tonight.
I have an audition.

91
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,922
- <i>What kind of an audition?</i>
- It's for a play.

92
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,158
"Master of" something.
It's with Errol Flynn.

93
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,987
- Who?
- <i>Errol Flynn.</i>

94
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,098
- Don't be nervous, just be yourself.
- Okay.

95
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,200
<i>- And don't smoke in front of him.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,402
- Be a good listener.
- Okay, okay.

97
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,637
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

98
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,236
<i>Bye.</i>

99
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:05,109
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

100
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,116
You'll get a kick out of this lodge
where we're going. It's a...

101
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,718
It belongs to Huntington Hartford,
he's the producer of the play.

102
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,613
Yes, my wife and I are separated.

103
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,659
And he took pity
on this homeless vagabond.

104
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,005
I'll be sad to leave it.

105
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:37,441
Every good, true vigorous feeling I have,
gathers impulsively around him.

106
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,213
I know, I must conceal my sentiments.

107
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:44,751
I must smother hope. I must remember
that he cannot care much for me.

108
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,507
I must repeat continually,
that we are forever sun... sunder...

109
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:50,656
- Sundered!
- Sundered.

110
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,175
- Sundered.
- Very good.

111
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,415
Very good, indeed.

112
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,192
Do you like that speech?

113
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,300
Well...

114
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,259
I think it's kind of corny.

115
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,853
It is, isn't it?

116
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,314
<i>Come on. There must have been
something that made you feel suspicious.</i>

117
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,985
<i>Well, if it turns out to be one of us,
I'm gonna wring his rotten red neck.</i>

118
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,588
- <i>Yeah, maybe you are wringing it.</i>
- I'll get it.

119
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,457
<i>I'm a first class
United States American, see?</i>

120
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,956
<i>Don't even hint I got...</i>

121
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,814
- Aadland residence.
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

122
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,801
- How's it going?
- Everything's fine, we're having dinner.

123
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,337
Dinner? Well, then the audition
must have gone very well.

124
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,403
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

125
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,510
It's just the two of you,
he's not getting any funny ideas, is he?

126
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,712
Mom, of course not.

127
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,948
<i>You come straight home afterwards.</i>

128
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,752
Okay, there's someone
who wants to say hello to you.

129
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:56,523
<i>Hello, is this the charming mother
of a very charming young lady?</i>

130
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,090
I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

131
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,330
Very nice to meet you
over the phone, Mrs. Aadland.

132
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,327
I would love to meet you in person, though.
Perhaps you could come round to the lodge,

133
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:08,335
sometime next week.

134
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,704
Thank you. That sounds lovely.

135
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,707
<i>Wonderful. I'll have my man call you
and make all the arrangements.</i>

136
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,243
- It's a plan.
- Who is it?

137
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,211
It's the producer of the play.

138
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,881
What the hell play is auditioning
at this hour?

139
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,247
<i>We're chasing...</i>

140
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,821
Are you sure you won't have
some champagne?

141
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,623
It'll make the movie
go down much easier.

142
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,425
No, thank you.

143
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,161
Okay, maybe I will.

144
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,379
All right.

145
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,636
You've seen it this color before?

146
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,706
Millions of times.

147
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:51,241
- Millions?
- It's a figure of speech.

148
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,758
You're like a little sprite.
You know that?

149
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:00,117
A wood nymph.
Has anyone ever told you that?

150
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,389
- No.
- Oh, definitely.

151
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,059
Yes, in fact, I think
I'm going to call you Woodsey.

152
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,695
- Do you like that?
- I don't know.

153
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,611
Would you think about it
and let me know?

154
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,666
- Thanks, Woodsey.
- I didn't say "yes," yet.

155
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,840
But it's such a perfect name for you.
Woodsey.

156
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,527
I don't think so.

157
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,274
Oh, Woodsey,

158
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,612
you have to face your destiny.

159
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,666
My destiny.

160
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,976
You're extraordinary.

161
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,047
Errol.

162
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,761
You got any smokes?

163
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,513
No.

164
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,880
There's a gas station down on Sunset.

165
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,651
- Can we stop?
- Sure.

166
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,754
You okay?

167
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,038
Yeah.

168
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,860
Yeah, I guess.

169
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,036
Is he like that with all the girls?

170
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,106
What do you mean?

171
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,401
That's what I thought.

172
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,814
Oh, baby, I was so worried.

173
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,028
- Hi.
- How was it?

174
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,563
Oh, it was fine.

175
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,600
- Yeah?
- I don't think I got the part, though.

176
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,867
Why do you say that? He took you to dinner,
you must be in the running.

177
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,505
- I guess.
- So what's he like, Errol Flynn?

178
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,942
He was nice. He talked a lot.

179
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,579
- And were you a good listener?
- Yes, I was.

180
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,146
But I'll talk to you about it later,
I'm really tired.

181
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,236
I've seen all your movies.

182
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:07,307
The Sea Hawk was my favorite.
I saw it, like, five times.

183
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,409
Really? I could barely
get through it once.

184
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,013
Oh, but you're such a great actor,
Mr. Flynn. Thank you.

185
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,049
Woodsey, I've been
looking for you all day.

186
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,485
I wanted to ask you out
for dinner, if you...

187
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,690
Look, I'm terribly sorry that things
got so out of hand at the audition.

188
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,492
Is that what it was? An audition?

189
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:30,827
Look, I'm so sorry.
I mistook you completely.

190
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,931
- I didn't realize...
- I'm late.

191
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,810
Well, why haven't you seen him?

192
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,342
He's on a different soundstage.

193
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,245
Well, when you do see him,
I want you to remind him

194
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,278
that I'm very excited about meeting him.

195
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,817
- He did say he wanted to meet me.
- Okay.

196
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,553
Yeah, okay. Well...

197
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,287
Make sure that you have lunch,
you're getting too skinny.

198
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,095
One and two and three and four.

199
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:06,263
One and two and three and four.

200
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,176
Sorry to intrude, ladies.

201
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,543
Now at last I find out
where you've been hiding.

202
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,446
I was hoping to have a word
with Miss Aadland.

203
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,817
If you don't mind.

204
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,589
Excuse us, please.

205
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,794
Who was that?

206
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,661
Here.

207
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,838
Beverly, I can't stop
thinking about you.

208
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,143
I lie awake, nights. Really.
I... I haven't slept in days.

209
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,712
I don't understand what the point is.
You already got what you wanted.

210
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,793
What I want is to get to know you,
to spend time with you,

211
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,183
enjoy your company, that's all.

212
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,853
Look, I know my reputation
precedes me, but I promise you,

213
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,989
whatever you've read in the press,

214
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,326
I swear, the man standing before you now,
is a different animal entirely.

215
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,293
Please, believe me.

216
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,155
What's that?

217
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,869
Oh, it's a... It's a question mark.

218
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,541
Yes, I know. Why?

219
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,611
Because I question everything.

220
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,815
Even at my age,
I'm still trying to figure it all out.

221
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,418
I... just never believe
what I've been told.

222
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,854
Someone tells me, "You can't do that,"
I say, "Why the hell not?"

223
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,591
And then I go ahead and bloody well do it,
and I get into a bit of trouble.

224
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:15,125
But I'm just endlessly curious.

225
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm especially curious about you.

226
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,948
- Who is it?
- Hi, Mrs. Aadland. It's Tedd Thomey.

227
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,885
- If I could just ask you a few questions.
- Why don't you all go to hell?

228
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,889
It's Tedd Thomey, ma'am. We met
at the airport. I gave you my card.

229
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,590
Yeah, I'm not a reporter,
I'm the guy that writes the books.

230
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,296
Look, I know it's been
a difficult time for you, ma'am.

231
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,697
I'm a straight-up guy,
I won't misrepresent you.

232
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,539
Things have been so crazy
since Errol died.

233
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,172
It's been a very hard time for me.

234
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,745
- I was very close to him, too, you know.
- I can understand, yeah.

235
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,618
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I have an artificial leg.

236
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,255
My so-called handicap

237
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,908
in an accident, many years ago.

238
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,996
I'm sorry.

239
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,634
I assume you've been reading
all the BS they've been printing.

240
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,318
I mean, they just take your words
and they twist them around

241
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:35,308
until you say whatever
it is they want you to say.

242
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:40,377
- Yeah. That's the gutter press for you.
- I know. I know, but...

243
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,007
I'm worried that Bev will see it.

244
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,684
Where is Beverly?

245
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,329
She's...

246
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,094
She's staying with Errol's lawyer.

247
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,730
He has a real swanky pad
with a gate and everything and...

248
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,601
- it keeps the press away.
- The press.

249
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,939
You know what, Mrs. Aadland?
Forget about what the press are saying.

250
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,342
This book is the chance
to tell your side of the story.

251
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,078
It'll put it down
for the record permanently.

252
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,779
And I'm certain you have
a great story to tell me.

253
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,218
Okay, let's get started.

254
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,260
Just speak normally, relax. I'm gonna
start with a few questions here...

255
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,395
Well, there's one thing
I wanna make clear right off,

256
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:33,666
and that is that my baby was a virgin
the day she met Errol Flynn

257
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,569
and nothing makes me sicker
than those dried up old biddies

258
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,540
who don't have any of the facts,
but they make all these snide remarks

259
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,254
and make it seem like my daughter,
Beverly, was a bad girl

260
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:47,380
for what she did with Errol, which...
nothing could be further from the truth.

261
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,814
And I ought to know, because I'm her mother
and she told me everything.

262
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:54,419
Oh, God. Oh, God.

263
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,010
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

264
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,193
It's amazing.

265
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:13,503
Woodsey, you realize you're
bringing out my best work in years.

266
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,108
These past few weeks,

267
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:22,011
have been heaven.

268
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,620
For me, anyway.

269
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,153
I'm not complaining.

270
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,359
So, you do like me, just a little?

271
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,730
You're growing on me.

272
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,902
You are a cheeky little
wood nymph, aren't you?

273
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,946
What time is your mother
expecting you home?

274
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,066
Not until 5:00.

275
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,417
All right, that's good.

276
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,416
You told her dance class again?

277
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,953
I told her I had to stay
and practice the new routine.

278
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,558
Well, that's... that's true, isn't it?

279
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,097
I need more practice.

280
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,784
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,272
- Why not?
- Oh, Woodsey,

282
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:25,003
this is the monstrosity in love, lady,
that the desire is boundless,

283
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:28,948
and the act, a slave to limit.

284
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,483
Who said that? William Shakespeare?

285
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,351
Yes, how did you guess?

286
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,556
It sounded corny.

287
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,020
Yeah. You...

288
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:47,464
<i>Some say that happiness is hard to find</i>

289
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,041
<i>Some say they'd never...</i>

290
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,507
Hey, Beverly.
Did you go to Hollywood High?

291
00:22:56,607 --> 00:23:00,477
- Yeah. Why?
- Nothing.

292
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,850
Just drop you at the
end of the street again?

293
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,516
Sure.

294
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:15,595
<i>Some say that life is a mystery</i>

295
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:22,201
<i>Some say that love brings only misery</i>

296
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,405
<i>I felt the same thing</i>

297
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:28,808
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

298
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:34,010
<i>But that was before I met you</i>

299
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,551
Thanks, old boy.

300
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,486
Errol?

301
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:45,801
Well, it's just... It's about Beverly.

302
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:49,629
It's just... I thought she looked familiar
the first time I saw her,

303
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:55,264
but I didn't say anything and now I realize
that could have been a mistake.

304
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,965
What is it, Ronnie? Just spit it out.

305
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,858
She went to the same high school I did.

306
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:06,876
But she wasn't in my grade,
she was a couple grades below me.

307
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:15,888
I'm sorry. I feel stupid,
it took me so long to figure it out,

308
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:20,126
but really, she seemed a lot older. I mean,
she's really good at looking the part.

309
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,093
I don't know why
I didn't remember her sooner.

310
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,568
Don't beat yourself up, Ronnie.

311
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,972
It's not your job
to monitor my love life.

312
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,305
I know.

313
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,081
Well, I'll be inside
if you need anything.

314
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,915
Right.

315
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,824
<i>Out of the blue, Errol called
and he asked us up to the lodge.</i>

316
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,328
<i>That's not the kind of invitation
you get every day, I'll tell you.</i>

317
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,930
<i>My husband Herb, was away
on business, in Arizona.</i>

318
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,800
<i>So, we didn't have any transport.
But Errol, very gallantly, sent his car.</i>

319
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,671
- Mom.
- What?

320
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,138
- Come on.
- Okay.

321
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,172
- There you are, you made it.
- Yeah.

322
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,412
Beverly, how nice to see you again.

323
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,909
And who is this, your sister?

324
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,549
I've waited weeks
for this, Mrs. Aadland.

325
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,018
Oh, please, call me Flo.

326
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,487
Flo it is then.
Would you like a drink, Flo?

327
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:59,592
Yes, please.
I'll take a vodka on the rocks.

328
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:03,896
Perfect. Vodka is also
my poison of choice.

329
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,465
Beverly, why don't you...
Why don't you find a soda?

330
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,968
It's in the kitchen, which is
down the stairs and to the left.

331
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,367
Okay.

332
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,743
She's amazing, your daughter.
I want you to tell me all about Beverly.

333
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,612
She's been in show business
for a while, hasn't she?

334
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,175
Oh, she has been a pro since she was 12.

335
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:26,085
Here, and in Vegas.
She was the Pears Soap baby.

336
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:31,491
And then at three, she won a contest for
a knock-out impersonation of Bette Davis.

337
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,327
"Fasten your seat belts,
it's going to be a bumpy night?"

338
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,794
It was, "I'd like to kiss you,
but I just washed my hair."

339
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:44,892
And then, five, her first film.
The Story of Nylon, Technicolor.

340
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:48,261
She's just... She was born
to be a performer.

341
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:51,744
You don't have to convince me, Flo.
I saw it right away.

342
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,214
She's one of the brightest,
most unaffected,

343
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,581
natural talents, I have seen in years.

344
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,284
- Oh, please, sit down, won't you?
- Oh, thank you.

345
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,420
The thing is...

346
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,995
If there's a way,
I would really like to help her.

347
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:12,391
- You know, get her career going full-steam.
- Really?

348
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:15,401
There's so many people in this town,
friends of mine who have influence,

349
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,570
you know, that I could introduce her to.

350
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:23,042
And I could say, "This is my discovery.
My protégée, so to speak."

351
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,111
That is, with your approval.

352
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,679
- Of course.
- Splendid.

353
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,615
I never got you your drink.

354
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,923
There is one thing, Florence.

355
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,467
The other day,
my assistant told me that...

356
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,363
he thought he remembered Beverly from
high school and that she's not yet 18.

357
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,229
Is that true?

358
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,856
Yes.

359
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,004
- How old is she?
- She's 15, Errol.

360
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,349
You know, that could be
very dangerous for Beverly.

361
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:07,786
If the studios found out that
she's underage, she could be blackballed.

362
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,928
Blackballed?

363
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:14,827
Oh, yes. They're real sticklers for the
rules these days. Not like in my time.

364
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,038
- Well, they won't find out.
- No?

365
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,476
No, she has a birth certificate
that says she's 18.

366
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:22,034
- It's a good one, too.
- Is it?

367
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,504
Yes, she was dancing in Vegas
when she was 13

368
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,674
and no one ever suspected anything
and she could pass for 20 now.

369
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:32,375
Well, that's exactly
the age I took her for.

370
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:38,284
It occurs to me that if I were
to take Woodsey under my wing,

371
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,220
we'd naturally be seen
around town a lot.

372
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,356
And the press in this country,
the free press is...

373
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:49,061
Well, they have such filthy minds,
they could make it rather difficult for us.

374
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:53,165
- Even when nothing is going on?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

375
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,968
Well, that's frustrating.
I mean, that's not fair.

376
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,402
No, it's not. But I've had an idea, Flo.

377
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,742
What if you were to come along
with us, when we're out?

378
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,608
You know, be a part of the group.

379
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,916
- Well, that's a swell idea.
- You are her mother, after all.

380
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:14,382
We'd just be...
We'd just be three friends,

381
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:18,154
out on the town,
having a wonderful time.

382
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,549
Well, that sounds like fun.

383
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,829
Splendid.

384
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,399
Are you out of your fucking mind?

385
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,703
Yeah, you bet.
And loving every minute of it.

386
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,339
Does the mother even know
what's going on?

387
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:37,540
Well, you know, mothers see
what mothers want to see.

388
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,906
Here you are, sport.

389
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,551
Oh, you're flying too close
to the sun, my friend.

390
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,220
Your wings will get burned,
you're gonna fall down to earth,

391
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,123
and you're gonna land in this
nasty little place called jail,

392
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,659
which you barely escaped in '42.

393
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,629
That was a show trial,
I was a big star then, I'm not anymore,

394
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:00,433
so the DA doesn't care about me.
And I don't give a damn about him.

395
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,569
And besides, Beverly is not a gold digger,
like those girls were.

396
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:07,273
But she is underage
and the public never forgets.

397
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,939
You don't have to remind me, sport.

398
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:15,548
I live with it every day.
"In like Flynn." It'll be my epitaph.

399
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,783
That's exactly why they're gonna
throw the book at you.

400
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,884
And the studio
can't protect you anymore.

401
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:26,989
Belli, you're a lawyer and I pay you
quite handsomely to think like that.

402
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,993
But at the end of the day,
I don't give a damn.

403
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,732
Do you know what doctor once told me,

404
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:37,203
that if I didn't give up the drink
and the drugs and the wild ways,

405
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,805
I'll have six months to live.

406
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:45,476
That was 10 years ago,
and I've lived every day and night

407
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:48,486
as if it was my last.

408
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,613
That's what I love about you, Baron.

409
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,683
I really do.

410
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,686
But now you're gonna listen to me.

411
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,423
Statutory rape, that's hard time.

412
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,891
Look at that...

413
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:21,510
<i>I began to see that there was a real
chemistry between Errol and Beverly.</i>

414
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,385
<i>He was so eager to please her,
to do things for her</i>

415
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:30,686
<i>like she was a big star
and he was her youthful admirer.</i>

416
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,365
<i>I went everywhere with them and met
the best Hollywood had to offer.</i>

417
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,870
<i>The crème de la crème.</i>

418
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,683
- Hello?
- Hello, Woodsey.

419
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:01,620
Oh, hi, Errol, I love the music box,
it's so sweet.

420
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,623
I'm so glad. Something about it
made me think of you.

421
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,526
Listen, my love, is this is a good time?

422
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,262
- Sure.
- Put her on.

423
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:12,890
Mom, pick up.

424
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:15,917
Hello.

425
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,271
Florence, hi. Listen,
I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner.

426
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:23,141
Oh. No, no, not at all,
we just finished.

427
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,408
How are you? Bev, hang up the phone.

428
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,480
How are you doing?

429
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,185
Not well, Florence, not well at all.
I have to leave on Monday for New York.

430
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,988
- Oh, really?
- It's that damn play.

431
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:40,492
I've committed myself to it and I'm stuck.
I really don't want to go.

432
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,211
But, listen, I've had an idea,

433
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:45,114
why don't you take some clothes
and things and throw them in a suitcase,

434
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:49,435
take the baby by the hand and join me,
there in New York, soon as possible.

435
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,803
Errol, stop joking.

436
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,905
No, I'm not joking at all,
I'm deadly serious.

437
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,971
I want to launch Beverly's career
in New York.

438
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,509
You'll be there as a chaperone.
I'll take care of everything of course.

439
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,348
That's a very generous idea, but...

440
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,219
I have to give it some thought.

441
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,289
No, no, don't think about it really,
Florence. Just do it, come on.

442
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:15,127
Come as soon as you can. It'll be wonderful
for Beverly, I mean just think of it.

443
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:18,264
New York? What are you talking about?

444
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:20,833
There are some people
who took interest in Bev

445
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:25,269
and they could really
move her career along.

446
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:28,139
Yeah, like who?

447
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,548
Errol Flynn.

448
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,378
What?

449
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,246
Yeah, he's been helping
her out with her career.

450
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,285
She's 15 years old.
I mean, Lord knows what's gone on.

451
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,253
Oh, nothing's gone on.
It's perfectly innocent.

452
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,389
- I've been there, I've seen them together.
- Flo. Flo, Flo.

453
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,292
Errol Flynn is a walking penis.

454
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:49,261
- Oh, no that's not...
- He can't keep his hands off of young girls.

455
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,632
- Okay, so he's interested in her talent?
- Yes.

456
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,667
Oh, wake up, woman.

457
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,470
She's a chorus girl,
she's a so-so singer and she's...

458
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,947
- She can't act her way out of a paper bag.
- You know, you don't know anything.

459
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:06,378
I know. I'm not letting you
take Beverly to New York,

460
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:10,115
to be served on a platter
to a man like Errol Flynn.

461
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:16,018
Listen, Beverly's whole life has been
about one thing and one thing only,

462
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:18,122
and that's show business.

463
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,394
You don't understand the difference
that just a little helping hand

464
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:26,598
from a director or a producer
or a big star like Errol can make.

465
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:30,302
It makes the difference between
those who make it, who really make it

466
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:35,040
and those that are left behind on the
garbage heap, the has-beens, the wannabes.

467
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,109
This is her shot, you can't say no.

468
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,746
If you do, she's gonna resent you
for the rest of her life,

469
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,118
and I will, too.

470
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,650
You owe me this.

471
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,789
Oh, Flo.

472
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,238
You always had your way with that girl.
You kept me out...

473
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:58,598
I never kept you out of it,
you weren't in it because...

474
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:00,563
Let me finish!

475
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,941
Damn you!

476
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,603
Take her if you want.

477
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,395
But that's it.

478
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,144
I'll wash my hands of the both of you.
You're on your own.

479
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,944
Oh, look, Bev. I've always wanted
to come to New York.

480
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:50,580
You know, not many mothers
would do what I'm doing.

481
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,616
I know.

482
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,800
I love you, Mom.

483
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,923
Oh, I love you too, baby.

484
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,197
Mom.

485
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,601
Errol wanted me to talk to you
about the sleeping arrangements.

486
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,974
Okay.

487
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:20,676
He wanted me to tell you that I'd be
sleeping in his room most nights.

488
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,216
- What?
- It's the way he wants it.

489
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:27,567
That may be the way he wants it, but that
doesn't mean that's what he's going to get.

490
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,952
Mom, come on.

491
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,122
He's Errol Flynn.

492
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,530
- You better not say anything.
- Don't tell me what to do. I trusted you.

493
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,632
- Mom, don't embarrass me.
- Just stop whining.

494
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,066
- Yes.
- Yes, we are here to see Mr. Errol Flynn.

495
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,639
It was leaving for Hong Kong.
So, we got on it...

496
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:53,313
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

497
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,077
Woodsey.

498
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,250
- Everyone, may I have your attention.
- May I take your coat?

499
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,953
I wish to present the marvelous
Mrs. Florence Aadland

500
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,924
and her exquisite daughter, Beverly.
It's their first time in New York.

501
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:10,295
- So I hope you give them a warm welcome.
- Welcome.

502
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,194
- Hello, Beverly.
- Hello.

503
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,766
- Oh, God, I missed you.
- I missed you.

504
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,733
- Thank God you're here.
- I'll put these in the closet, ma'am.

505
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,740
- Hey, there, I'm John Ireland.
- The actor?

506
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,773
Yes, indeed.

507
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,211
Your daughter's very lovely.

508
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,911
Yes, thank you.

509
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,022
Hello, Florence. I know.
I know you're angry with me

510
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,423
and you have every reason to be.

511
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,062
- I am the devil incarnate.
- I could have you thrown in jail.

512
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:46,224
- Please, don't joke about this.
- I'm not joking. You lied to me.

513
00:37:46,324 --> 00:37:50,536
You blatantly lied to me, to my face
about what you were up to with my baby.

514
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:55,107
I thought it was perfectly obvious.
What did you want me to say?

515
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,809
That I was in over my head
with your daughter?

516
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,979
Your beautiful clever daughter.
Whom you've groomed so carefully

517
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,182
- to seem older than her years?
- Oh, now, I'm the one to blame?

518
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,787
No. No. No. No more than I am.
But, if I deceived you

519
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,888
you deceive me as well,
not to mention the rest of Hollywood.

520
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,272
Florence.

521
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,803
I love Beverly as much as
I've ever loved anyone.

522
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:30,109
And for some reason she loves me,
really loves me.

523
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:35,277
So, please, try to find it in your heart
to forgive me for both our sakes.

524
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,250
And I think if you'll admit it, you always
knew what was going on, didn't you?

525
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,589
All right, what are you
love birds doing in here?

526
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,796
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, we're just, catching up.

527
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,576
Right, Flo?

528
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:59,004
So here we are. Enough for everyone.

529
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:02,708
<i>Seeing them together again
I realized that it was a love match.</i>

530
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:06,078
<i>I saw that he genuinely
cared for her, very much,</i>

531
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:10,816
<i>but as I turned it over and over in my mind
I realized it could go either way.</i>

532
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,686
<i>The liaison with Errol could be
very good for Beverly's career,</i>

533
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,656
<i>but it could also be a disaster.</i>

534
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:21,660
<i>They weren't married after all, and if
the press realized what was going on,</i>

535
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,995
<i>it would be a page one scandal.</i>

536
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,826
<i>I knew we were playing
with dynamite here</i>

537
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:29,468
<i>and it all had to be handled
very carefully.</i>

538
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,503
<i>I didn't want our lives turning
from an A picture into a B movie.</i>

539
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,413
Look darling, Dag Hammarskjöld,
he's a great man.

540
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,521
- You know who he is?
- Yes.

541
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,889
Who is he?

542
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,892
He works at the United Nations,
he's like a secretary.

543
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,960
- Yes, secretary-general to be precise.
- Yeah.

544
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,832
I am going to get you a tutor
while you're here.

545
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:05,169
- No, tutors are boring.
- Well...

546
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,172
I like things just the way they are.

547
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:10,442
Well, I'm gonna get you some
decent books to read at any rate.

548
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,513
Something with a little more
literary merit than the funnies.

549
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:18,567
Oh, no, come on, don't spoil it.

550
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,719
It's the most fun I've ever had.

551
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,588
Really, you don't miss
Los Angeles, your friends?

552
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:29,027
No. I'm like a windup toy there.

553
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:32,698
Go to this audition, go to this dance class,
go to this voice coach...

554
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,731
- Do you even like show business?
- Yes.

555
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,537
- Really?
- Kind of. It's fun.

556
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,770
There sure are a lot of
swelled heads around though.

557
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,640
You might say that.

558
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,878
What I really want
is to just be with you,

559
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,448
and do fun things

560
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,418
and go out and stay in.

561
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,857
And just be free for once in my life.

562
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,760
You examine me, Miss Eyre.

563
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:08,197
- You think me handsome?
- No, sir.

564
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,662
By my word,

565
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:15,652
there is something singular about you.

566
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,192
When one asks you
a question you... you...

567
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,849
You rap out a round rejoinder,

568
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:28,584
which if not blunt, is at least brusque.

569
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,224
Sir, I beg your pardon,
I spoke too plain.

570
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:35,594
I ought to have replied that beauty
is of little consequence,

571
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,262
or something of the sort.

572
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,765
You ought to have replied no such thing.
Beauty of little consequence, indeed.

573
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,299
Indeed. Indeed.

574
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,475
And so, under the pretense of softening,

575
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,011
your previous outrage now,

576
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,381
you stick a penknife under my ear.

577
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,715
What fault do you find with me, pray?

578
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,903
I can't believe it.

579
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:11,062
- Who does this clown think he is?
- I told you not to read that.

580
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,932
They never ever a kind word, if they did,
they probably misspell it.

581
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,770
Goes after the actress, too.
You should have used Bev.

582
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:24,843
Well, I had a really
disastrous day myself.

583
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,946
I'm sorry, what happened?

584
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:32,082
I got a letter from Bev's father
asking me for a divorce.

585
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,251
- And he's not giving us a penny.
- Oh, that's terrible.

586
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:40,355
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

587
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,727
You know, I was mad for that man.

588
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:46,630
I met him when he was the bartender
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

589
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,566
I was a waitress working for tips and
going up for auditions whenever I could.

590
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:56,671
- You were an actress?
- No, I was a dancer.

591
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:00,676
And not half bad, actually.

592
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,814
I got a callback
for a Fred and Ginger movie.

593
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,981
- Really?
- Yes.

594
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,688
One night after work
we were going up Highway 1,

595
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,525
to this little beach
that we liked and, oh,

596
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:17,762
we'd been drinking,
and Herb took a turn too quickly

597
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,299
and the next thing I knew,
I was in the hospital

598
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:25,123
and the doctor was telling me
that he'd taken off my leg.

599
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,632
Poor thing.

600
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:29,807
That's awful.

601
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,149
But when Bev was born,

602
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:37,115
she was such a special child,

603
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:43,485
and I felt as if she had been
given to me to make up for my leg.

604
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:49,002
- Of course.
- It was as if it had been pre-ordained.

605
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:54,116
Everything that has gone on
has felt as if it was...

606
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,231
pre-ordained.

607
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:02,474
You've done a marvelous job
raising Woodsey.

608
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:07,075
No, no, you are a superb mother.

609
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,280
- Thank you. I tried.
- Yeah.

610
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,318
My own mother was a class A cunt.

611
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,323
- Errol. Oh.
- Oh, no, no.

612
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:22,624
She did despicable things
to me and to my father.

613
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,327
Destructive woman.

614
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,434
Yeah, I'm sure Mr. Freud would say that
she had a large hand in shaping my

615
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,537
distinctive attitude toward women.

616
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:35,507
But you're a gentleman among gentlemen.

617
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:41,877
Florence, I am and always will be,
quite literally, an absolute son of a bitch.

618
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,184
- Cheers.
- And you know it. Cheers.

619
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:49,217
- To hell of a day.
- To hell of a day.

620
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:54,059
- So, what happened next?
- Well, then after the play closed,

621
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,730
Errol's luck changed and he got a call
from the top director, John Huston,

622
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,067
who asked him to be in his new film,
The Roots of Heaven

623
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:06,571
and that starred Juliette Gréco
and Orson Welles.

624
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:10,106
The only bad thing was
that it was in Africa.

625
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,553
<i>Woodsey, it's incredible to me
that love would exist</i>

626
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:25,156
<i>between a man my age and one so young.</i>

627
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,628
<i>But I do so want to believe that you mean
what you've been writing to me.</i>

628
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,098
<i>It might seem unbelievable
that a man as masculine as Errol</i>

629
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:38,433
<i>would weep while writing a love letter,
but there's no doubt that he did.</i>

630
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,579
<i>Beverly loved those letters,</i>

631
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,177
<i>they were the only thing
that kept her going with him away.</i>

632
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:48,814
<i>But afterwards,
she just missed him more.</i>

633
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,384
<i>And then something happened
that took us both by surprise,</i>

634
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:55,120
<i>Errol landed a part for Bev in the film,</i>

635
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,907
<i>but it turned out,
that old fox had a trick up his sleeve.</i>

636
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,760
- I'm sorry, no.
- Mom, come on.

637
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,664
It will be a cold day in hell
before I let you go that far without me.

638
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:08,266
It's not my fault that he could only
get them to pay for one ticket.

639
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,001
Yeah, I'm sure he tried very hard.

640
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:14,405
- Please, please, please...
- Baby, just stop it. Just stop it.

641
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,643
This isn't a day trip to the Santa Monica
Pier that we're talking about here.

642
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,045
But I would be with Errol,
you know he'd look after everything...

643
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,617
There are bugs and animals and diseases
and God knows what else.

644
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:27,986
Well, fine. I'll just go,
you can't stop me.

645
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,388
You just try it, missy,
and you see how far you get.

646
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:34,356
Mom, it's a big movie with major stars.

647
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,731
I have to say I'm really amazed you'd
want me to pass up an opportunity like this,

648
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,564
it goes against everything
you've ever taught me.

649
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,934
Unless you don't think I'm up to it.

650
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,003
That's ridiculous.

651
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,596
<i>So she went to Africa, all that way,</i>

652
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:58,146
<i>and she would write me these wonderful
little postcards saying how hot it was.</i>

653
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,920
<i>All of the cast and crew came down
with dysentery except for Errol,</i>

654
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,653
<i>who was avoiding drinking water.</i>

655
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,633
<i>I stayed on in New York and picked up
a job in a nearby movie theater.</i>

656
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:18,002
<i>The pay wasn't bad
and the people were all right.</i>

657
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,804
<i>One week they were playing Errol's movie</i>

658
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:23,542
<i>and I really got a hoot
out of telling folks all about him.</i>

659
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:27,579
<i>In the end I decided to go home
to California and wait for Beverly.</i>

660
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,014
<i>And when she came back we clicked into our
routine just like she'd never been away.</i>

661
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,488
- That's Katonga.
- Katonga, okay.

662
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,223
- He was so nice.
- Sweet.

663
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,294
- Is that a rat?
- No, no. That's Riki.

664
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:46,161
- Oh, Riki?
- He was my pet mongoose.

665
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:50,569
- Oh, God, looks like so much fun.
- It was.

666
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,304
I ate so much,
the desserts were so good.

667
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,671
This was our hotel.

668
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,208
And here's us in Madrid.

669
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,058
We didn't stay there for very long.

670
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:08,186
- This is the Mediterranean Sea.
- Oh, so calm.

671
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,888
Yeah, I know.

672
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,790
This is on Errol's yacht,
the Zaca, in Majorca.

673
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,343
- Such a beautiful boat.
- So beautiful.

674
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:17,463
I almost forgot,

675
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:21,366
I have a little, welcome home...

676
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,567
Just a little something for you.

677
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,377
Thank you. That's so sweet.

678
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,711
It's a Paula Lynn.

679
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,843
Oh, that's nice thank you, Mom.

680
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,851
Of course, if you don't really
care for it, you can exchange it.

681
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,386
- No. No, I really like it.
- My feelings won't be hurt.

682
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:44,343
- It's really pretty. I like it.
- Fine.

683
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,454
Florence.

684
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,092
- Errol.
- Drink?

685
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,796
Why not, what are we drinking?

686
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:54,769
We're drinking your health, of course.

687
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,636
- So nice to see you.
- Thank you.

688
00:48:57,736 --> 00:49:01,739
I can hardly believe that we actually
made it back in one piece

689
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,507
from the bowels of darkest Africa.

690
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,876
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

691
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,920
You're younger.

692
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,517
- Doesn't Woodsey look well?
- Beautiful.

693
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,820
Light of my life. Fire of my loins.

694
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,823
- You remember where that's from?
- That book by Nabokov.

695
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,258
You see how I'm educating her.

696
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,125
Yes, well...

697
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:28,730
Ladies, if you will excuse me,
I'll go slip into something more dignified.

698
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:37,372
Oh, I'm so glad you're back,
both of you.

699
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,579
Does he seem maybe just a little...

700
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,048
- I don't know, off?
- He's fine, Mom.

701
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:49,253
But you wouldn't notice because
you see him every day, but he seems...

702
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,956
- I don't know, something's going on.
- He has back pain, that's all.

703
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:54,258
That's what it is.
Is he seeing a doctor?

704
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,494
- Yes.
- Okay.

705
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:58,927
Just drop it. I'm gonna
get another box of slides.

706
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,167
Woodsey, why are you
so dressed all the time?

707
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,433
Grab a hat, would you?

708
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,341
Flo, pardon.

709
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,369
One line, that's it?

710
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,673
- I had more, they cut it out.
- I don't believe it.

711
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,675
- I'm furious with the studio.
- Good job, Errol.

712
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,045
Yeah, thank you very much, thank you.

713
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,081
You know, they always do it,
they cut the best scenes.

714
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,947
- They cut a lot of my lines, as well.
- Can't you do something about it?

715
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:56,587
No, no, no. They're a hard-headed lot.

716
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,390
I gave you up for five months
and that's it?

717
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,093
- I had a great time.
- That's not the point, is it?

718
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:05,730
I don't know, Florence,
I think perhaps happiness is the point.

719
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,634
At the end of the day, more important
than stardom and Hollywood.

720
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:13,438
Fame is like a religion
in this godless country.

721
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:16,541
It only provides the public
with idols that they can worship

722
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:20,044
and then tear down
as the mood strikes them.

723
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,679
Don't change the subject.

724
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:25,013
She hasn't had a shot, you said you'd
give her a shot, she hasn't had one.

725
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,922
- How's your health?
- Never better.

726
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,730
People say you drink too much.

727
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,132
If you believed all the rumors about me,

728
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:45,400
I'd think you were... I'd think I was
something quite extraordinary.

729
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,437
I have to say the idea
definitely intrigues me.

730
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:54,245
- Errol Flynn as Humbert Humbert.
- Yes, it's the part of a lifetime.

731
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:57,968
I was born to play it really, you know,
I think this chap Nabokov is a genius.

732
00:51:58,068 --> 00:51:59,816
I love that book.

733
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,814
Yes, and I think for the role of Lolita

734
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:05,720
you'll agree that Beverly
has all the right prerequisites.

735
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,595
- How did her audition for you go?
- Not well.

736
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,897
Oh, you're not gonna find
a better Lolita.

737
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:16,133
- You can search all you want.
- No dice, Errol.

738
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,899
Besides, she's too old.

739
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,002
That's a shame.

740
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,742
I think you ought to
rethink this, Kubrick,

741
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:28,176
because you see,
we're sort of a package deal.

742
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,445
You're not serious?

743
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,849
Well, that makes things...

744
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,652
Awkward.

745
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:53,604
<i>Just when Hollywood closed its doors,
Errol had a terrific idea.</i>

746
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:57,742
<i>He'd always been fascinated
by the ideology behind rebel causes.</i>

747
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,545
<i>So, he flew to Cuba and began work
on an independent movie</i>

748
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,846
<i>in support of
the rebel chief Fidel Castro.</i>

749
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:11,419
<i>This time, it was no
bit part for Beverly.</i>

750
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,938
Are all you Americans so bloodthirsty?
This isn't even your war.

751
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:31,909
I don't even know who those guys Batista
and Castro are. That's your problem.

752
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:36,114
But the man I'm gonna marry is out there
in that stinking, lousy jungle hiding.

753
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:39,150
And if he has a reason for it, so can I.

754
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,919
I wish some of the Cubans
felt as strongly as you do.

755
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:43,717
Cut.

756
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,755
Wonderful, moving on.

757
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,430
- Nice take.
- Oh, thanks.

758
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,233
- I'm serious.
- Goofball.

759
00:53:55,333 --> 00:54:00,070
So we got... three hours
of sun and five scenes.

760
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:04,305
Here's what I think you should do.
You should do...

761
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,111
- It's nicer over here in Cuba.
- Yeah.

762
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:10,845
Beverly, I know flirting when I see it,
and that was flirting.

763
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,616
What am I supposed to do, he was
talking to me, I was only talking back.

764
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:21,626
While you're here, making this movie
with me, you will behave appropriately.

765
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,868
- Got it?
- What are you, my parent?

766
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,862
Don't dare try that with me.

767
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,169
Hello.

768
00:54:56,426 --> 00:55:00,428
- Here you go, Mr. Flynn.
- Thank you, old sport.

769
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,832
- Where's Miss Woodsey today?
- She's...

770
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:09,370
- Out and about.
- She's very young.

771
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,038
Yes.

772
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,948
I'm far too old for her, but sadly,

773
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,180
she's not too young for me.

774
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:27,225
Mr. Flynn, there's a place
that's not too far from here,

775
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:31,927
they have plenty girls,
and very young and very beautiful.

776
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,797
I'm sure they are.

777
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,934
Thanks old boy, not today.

778
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,804
Excuse me.

779
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,619
- Hello.
- Hello.

780
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,135
You're mad at me?

781
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:17,463
Is there a reason
I should be mad at you?

782
00:56:17,563 --> 00:56:18,464
No.

783
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,609
Then I'm not mad.

784
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,555
You surprise me.

785
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,083
I surprise even myself sometimes.

786
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,037
They are having a ball out there.

787
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:50,871
And Beverly's career
is taking off in leaps and bounds.

788
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,644
That Errol's a marvel.

789
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:57,212
Errol Flynn.
They don't make them like that anymore.

790
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:01,919
Yeah, he's... He's a rascal, that one.

791
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,622
He's always playing pranks.
I mean, it's just so much fun.

792
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:07,088
To be around him, you know.

793
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,554
I miss him.

794
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:23,571
You're burning up.

795
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,295
- It's malaria. It's come back.
- I think we should get a doctor.

796
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,462
No, no.

797
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,099
Look, maybe they could
give you something.

798
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,935
Just hold me. Just hold me.

799
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,634
I'm dying, Woodsey.

800
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,247
No, you're not.

801
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,601
I am.

802
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,688
I feel it.

803
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,590
- I feel it.
- You are not.

804
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,270
I am the...

805
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:30,327
most selfish man in the world.

806
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:32,435
Don't be silly.

807
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:36,380
All my life, I've done
what the hell I wanted.

808
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,247
And to hell with the consequences.

809
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,314
I'm dragging you down with me.

810
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:55,730
- What have I done to you?
- Errol, stop.

811
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,902
This is crazy. Just rest.

812
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,690
You'll be okay.

813
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,593
You'll be okay.

814
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,788
Good morning, Woodsey.

815
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,631
Morning.

816
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,956
Do me a favor, would you, darling?
Bring me that flask.

817
00:59:54,056 --> 00:59:56,266
I think you should drink water.

818
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,728
Water is just for swimming in,
I've told you that.

819
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,933
Are you gonna be okay?

820
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:12,273
Yes, I actually think the worst is over.

821
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,209
For this round.

822
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:19,149
- You need to rest for a few days.
- Yes, ma'am.

823
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,286
I want you to get me
a clean sheet of paper.

824
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,618
I want you to write
something down for me.

825
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:26,253
What?

826
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,091
- Just do it, would you?
- Not until you tell me.

827
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:39,536
Just in case anything happens,
I want to make things right with you.

828
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,439
To make an amendment
to my will, that's all.

829
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:45,573
What are you talking about?
You're gonna be fine.

830
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,781
Just do it.

831
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,186
- There's some notepaper.
- Good enough.

832
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:08,462
I, Errol Thomson Flynn,

833
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:15,135
being of sound mind and body...

834
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,308
am hereby dictating

835
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,213
my last will and testament.

836
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:42,496
<i>When they came back from Cuba,
it was time to throw a party.</i>

837
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:48,305
<i>Beverly's 17th birthday was coming up,
so Errol splashed out.</i>

838
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:52,418
<i>He hired a band and invited
some of his Hollywood crowd.</i>

839
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,112
<i>All of Beverly's high school
friends turned up.</i>

840
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:59,447
<i>And I think they were amazed to see
what a star she had become.</i>

841
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,554
Go, Daniel.

842
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,978
Darling, that was beautiful.

843
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:17,598
Oh, God.

844
01:02:28,847 --> 01:02:29,773
Everyone.

845
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:35,016
Ladies and gentlemen, friends...

846
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,321
new friends, old friends,

847
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:41,822
I have a formal announcement I'd like
to make concerning our birthday girl.

848
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:47,364
I want the world to take note
that Miss Beverly Aadland, a lovely girl,

849
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:51,766
somewhere between
the ages of five and 50...

850
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:57,138
will soon become
the fourth and final Mrs. Flynn.

851
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:06,201
<i>Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday</i>

852
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,848
<i>Happy birthday</i>

853
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:09,725
Happy, darling?

854
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:14,391
We did it, baby. We did it.

855
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:21,865
<i>And I hope
that all your dreams come true</i>

856
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:25,502
<i>Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday</i>

857
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:28,035
<i>Happy birthday</i>

858
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:32,007
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

859
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:42,483
- There you are. Enjoy.
- Oh, thank you.

860
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,920
Congratulations, Florence.

861
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,525
- Oh, Madge, thank you for coming.
- Such a swell night.

862
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,694
- I had so much fun.
- Oh, good.

863
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,096
Beverly looks so beautiful.

864
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:55,164
I know, she's gonna
make a beautiful bride.

865
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,702
You never told me. How did she
ever meet Errol in the first place?

866
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:01,238
Well, I think it was fate.

867
01:04:01,447 --> 01:04:03,674
You see, she was passing
for 18 at the studio,

868
01:04:03,774 --> 01:04:07,444
so I couldn't really tag along.
Mama couldn't just tag along, you know.

869
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:10,948
So, I wasn't there when they got together.
But she told me everything.

870
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,783
- Beverly?
- Oh, are you leaving?

871
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:13,884
Yes, yeah.

872
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:17,287
She was a virgin and he made
love to her on the first night.

873
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:20,124
And he was so crazy for her
that he tore her dress.

874
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:24,928
Yes, it was a $75 bolero Paula Lynn.

875
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,331
Can you imagine, but, you know,
what was she gonna do?

876
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,699
- It's Errol Flynn.
- My God.

877
01:04:29,878 --> 01:04:31,398
Baby!

878
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:36,006
- You remember Madge from the nail salon.
- What are you doing?

879
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,776
What do you... Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

880
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:42,579
Madge is good people
and she's been following your career.

881
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,916
- It's private.
- Don't you talk to me that way.

882
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,321
I'll see you ladies later.

883
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:50,554
Why do you keep telling everyone?
It's none of their business.

884
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:53,490
- I know who I can trust and who I can't.
- No, you don't.

885
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,326
Yes, I do and look,
just because you're engaged to Errol,

886
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,930
doesn't mean that you own him lock,
stock and barrel. He's my friend, too.

887
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,666
- He's my fiancé, not yours, Mom.
- Obviously.

888
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,267
So stay out of it.

889
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,437
Just how far do you think you would have
gotten with this thing if it weren't for me?

890
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,941
- What thing?
- The thing. You and Errol.

891
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:14,411
Do you know how much I sacrificed
so that you two could be together?

892
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:17,354
- How much I've...
- It has nothing to do with you. Nothing!

893
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:21,418
- I lost my home, my marriage. My husband...
- You did it all for yourself.

894
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:24,015
- I did it for you!
- Leave us alone.

895
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:27,688
You come back here!
Come back here. You...

896
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,921
What? What are you looking at?

897
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:34,764
You too.

898
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,600
Mind your own business.

899
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,870
You know, Florence, I was wondering.

900
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,937
I really wanna interview Beverly.

901
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,743
I don't think so.

902
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,912
Maybe she could shed
some new light on some of the...

903
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:54,215
Beverly doesn't know about the book.
And I don't want to involve her in this.

904
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,555
Well, I'd handle it very gently.

905
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,390
When the time is right, I will tell her.
Not before then.

906
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,880
Okay.

907
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,941
- That's how you feel?
- That's how I feel.

908
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,707
So,

909
01:06:11,537 --> 01:06:13,628
where were we?

910
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,374
The final chapter.

911
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:26,416
<i>Errol, he wasn't making the kind of money
that he did in his glory days.</i>

912
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,788
<i>And in order to settle his divorce,
he needed some ready cash.</i>

913
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:34,024
<i>So, even though the Zaca
meant the world to him,</i>

914
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:36,760
<i>he went up to Vancouver
to sell his yacht.</i>

915
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,627
<i>That shows how much
he loved Bev. Right there.</i>

916
01:06:41,363 --> 01:06:43,066
I'm already getting enquiries.

917
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,468
A treasure hunting expedition
in the Caribbean,

918
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,939
searching for Spanish gold.
Errol Flynn at the helm.

919
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,431
That's a nice idea, sport, but...

920
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:55,165
need a bit of time to think it over.

921
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:56,810
Okay.

922
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,891
Well...

923
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,719
- We best be going to the airport.
- Fine. I can drive you there myself.

924
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,354
- Are you sure, sport?
- Are you kidding me? It would be an honor.

925
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,889
What's the matter?

926
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,341
My back.

927
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,331
- Oh, it's killing me.
- I can call a doctor.

928
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:18,001
No, no, no. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right. Yeah, it's getting better.

929
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:20,304
Yeah. And I've got medicine in my bag.

930
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:23,637
I could use a nice stiff drink though,
if you'd be so kind.

931
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:29,246
- It's in my legs.
- I have an old friend who's a doctor.

932
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:33,110
- His house is on the way.
- No, no, no. I'll be fine, really.

933
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,683
We need to take him to the doctor's.

934
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:47,831
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, doc. It's George. Are you busy?</i>

935
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,400
<i>I have someone with me
who needs looking at.</i>

936
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,235
- Is it urgent?
- <i>I don't know. It might be.</i>

937
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:55,771
<i>And get this, it's Errol Flynn.</i>

938
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,474
Okay. Bring him straight away.

939
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,078
You're not gonna believe this.

940
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,593
- Great to meet you, Errol.
- Pleasure, doctor.

941
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:20,063
And this is Beverly Aadland,
my small companion.

942
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,766
I told Cynthia
not to call anyone, but...

943
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:25,344
Shall we go into the den
so I can take a look at you?

944
01:08:25,444 --> 01:08:27,901
Later, later, old sport.

945
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,306
Hello, everyone.

946
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,481
You all remember who John Barrymore was?

947
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:40,484
One of the greatest actors
of his generation, right?

948
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:42,052
- Of course.
- Yeah.

949
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:45,638
Well, he just died.

950
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:50,961
Been a tremendous friend of mine,
and of the director, Raoul Walsh's.

951
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:54,798
And well, while I was out
drowning my sorrow in vodka,

952
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:58,802
Raoul hightailed it over
to the mortuary.

953
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:00,670
And he's told the mortician that

954
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,675
Mr. Barrymore's crippled aunt
wanted to view the body.

955
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,077
He slipped the cat 200 smackers,

956
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:10,747
smuggled the corpus delicti
to my very own home,

957
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:15,215
where they deposited him
in my favorite armchair.

958
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:19,319
Well, I got back two hours later.

959
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,191
I was drunk.

960
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,528
Sad drunk.

961
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:28,098
I opened the door,
flicked on the lights.

962
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,060
And staring right at me,

963
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,171
was John Barrymore.

964
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,973
His eyes were cold.
His expression was...

965
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:41,609
He was bloodless, gray, bloated.

966
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,015
I let out a gasp. I ran out the door.

967
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:49,219
I was about to climb into my car and
tear down the hill, when I heard voices.

968
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:53,957
There on the porch
was Raoul and his cronies,

969
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,704
just as pleased as punch.

970
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,930
What happened to the body, Errol?

971
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,640
Oh, they took it back to the mortuary
and no one was the wiser.

972
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,473
But if I know Barrymore,
he was up on his cloud saying,

973
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:14,775
"Thanks for the outing, boys.
That last place was a bit cramped."

974
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:22,426
Is it true you have a two-way mirror
put up in your guestroom?

975
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:26,556
I'm sorry, young man. I would never
corrupt you with that sordid tale.

976
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,639
Oh, it's all right.
He can hear it, Errol.

977
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:32,896
To tell you the truth,
I need to lie down for just a bit.

978
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,749
- Do you need me to...
- No, no, no.

979
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,667
Stay there, old sport.
I never felt better in my life.

980
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,605
I shall return.

981
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:08,896
- So, how do you like Vancouver?
- Oh, it's beautiful. We really like it.

982
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,299
Can I ask how old you are, Beverly?

983
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,503
I'm 21.

984
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,405
Really? You look younger.

985
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:22,312
I was only 18, when I met Kenneth
and we were in high school.

986
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,846
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm going to check on Errol.

987
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:44,426
Errol? Errol?

988
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,604
Errol? Is it your back, Errol?

989
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:53,209
Errol? Help! Someone help me! Please!

990
01:11:53,926 --> 01:11:56,346
Errol? Help!

991
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:58,904
Help me, someone! Help me!

992
01:11:59,004 --> 01:12:02,316
Help! Please, help!

993
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,087
Errol? Errol!

994
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:07,701
Errol?

995
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,097
No.

996
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,032
No!

997
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,802
Errol, no!

998
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,378
But is it true Errol Flynn
died in your arms?

999
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,880
- What were his last words?
- How long had you known him?

1000
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,182
Are you going to the funeral?

1001
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:34,657
Miss Aadland, did Flynn
leave you anything in his will?

1002
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,289
- Beverly! Bev!
- Miss Aadland, how did you meet...

1003
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:40,821
How old are you?

1004
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:45,325
Beverly!

1005
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,311
<i>Now, it's time for our once-a-week round-up
of America's number one society stories.</i>

1006
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,013
<i>What's the news this week, Hedda?</i>

1007
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:06,975
<i>Well, I for one, am fed to the teeth
with all the drool</i>

1008
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:11,555
<i>about Errol Flynn and the Aadland ladies.
It makes me sick.</i>

1009
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:15,225
<i>We've known for years
what a roué Flynn was.</i>

1010
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:20,627
<i>And he met his match in Beverly,
a teen hellcat...</i>

1011
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,342
<i>As for the peg-legged scheming mother,
well, Mrs. Aadland,</i>

1012
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:35,178
<i>in this state there is
a little statute on the books</i>

1013
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:38,215
<i>about contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.</i>

1014
01:13:38,315 --> 01:13:44,017
<i>Keep it up and you'll end up
right where you belong, in the clink.</i>

1015
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,905
Bev! Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

1016
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:00,036
I missed you so much. Come on.

1017
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,039
You look tired. Have you been sleeping?

1018
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:07,476
I'm fine. I just... just wanted
to stay out of the spotlight.

1019
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,844
I know. It's... It's been very hard.

1020
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:18,120
I fixed up the bedroom
for you very nicely.

1021
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:20,724
And I'll just... I'll stay on the couch.

1022
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:24,103
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm fine with the couch.

1023
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,828
Mom?

1024
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:33,770
There's all this crazy stuff in the press
about me being pregnant, and the will.

1025
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,491
It makes me so damned mad.

1026
01:14:37,205 --> 01:14:40,709
- Have you been talking to them?
- No, not really.

1027
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,495
Well, don't.

1028
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:48,451
She's not great. She's only been sleeping
about two hours at a time.

1029
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,321
And she doesn't eat...
I didn't know what was wrong.

1030
01:14:51,421 --> 01:14:55,792
So I took her to the doctor and the
doctor said that she's just grief-stricken.

1031
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:59,796
- <i>Well, she's been through a lot.</i>
- I know, Ronnie. I know.

1032
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:01,530
That's why I thought
it would be a good idea

1033
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,168
for her to just... You know,
throw herself into something.

1034
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:08,772
Like her career.
Take advantage of all the attention.

1035
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:13,009
In fact, there's a guy out in Glendale
who wants her to appear in his nightclub.

1036
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,942
It's just the ticket for Bev, I think.

1037
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:38,368
<i>Some say that happiness</i>

1038
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:42,539
<i>Is hard to find</i>

1039
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:45,775
<i>Some say they'd never</i>

1040
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,978
<i>Have peace of mind</i>

1041
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:52,482
<i>I say the same thing</i>

1042
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:55,918
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

1043
01:15:56,018 --> 01:16:00,081
<i>But that was before</i>

1044
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:03,626
<i>I met you</i>

1045
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,863
<i>Some say that life</i>

1046
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:10,766
<i>Is a mystery</i>

1047
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,105
<i>Some say that love</i>

1048
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:17,604
- <i>Brings only misery</i>
- Asshole.

1049
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:21,163
<i>I say the same thing</i>

1050
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:24,707
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

1051
01:16:24,807 --> 01:16:30,784
<i>But that was before I met you</i>

1052
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,957
Hank Segal of the Times loved you.

1053
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:36,960
And the Hollywood Post
is gonna write a little article.

1054
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,864
And Pat is so happy because the take
at the bar was twice what it normally is.

1055
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,199
That's 'cause you were here.

1056
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:47,170
Very funny. So...
What do you say we celebrate

1057
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,773
and go, maybe, to Canter's
and get a burger and a shake?

1058
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:54,140
I can't. I'm going to a party
at Jack's tonight.

1059
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,779
I don't like you hanging out
with those punks.

1060
01:16:56,879 --> 01:17:00,149
They are... They just play up to you because
you're famous and because of Errol...

1061
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:03,717
- That's not true.
- You be home by midnight.

1062
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,443
Beverly?

1063
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:27,943
Bev?

1064
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:37,050
Wait here.

1065
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:46,194
- Yeah, who is it?
- <i>I wanna talk to Beverly.</i>

1066
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,631
- Who is this?
- I have to talk to Beverly.

1067
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,634
If you don't let me talk to her,
I'm gonna call the police.

1068
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:54,616
- <i>Sleep it off, lady.</i>
- Wait a minute.

1069
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,928
Beverly?

1070
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:23,647
Beverly?

1071
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:28,911
Beverly!

1072
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,006
Beverly!

1073
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:36,545
Beverly, it's your mother!

1074
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:39,949
- She's out of her mind.
- She's baying at the moon.

1075
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,785
- Beverly!
- Go home, lady!

1076
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,188
- What?
- Go home!

1077
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:47,335
But I want my daughter here!
Is she up there?

1078
01:18:47,435 --> 01:18:49,292
- Beverly? Send her down!
- I haven't seen her!

1079
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,861
Yes, you have! You liar!
Get me my daughter!

1080
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,330
Bev!

1081
01:18:56,031 --> 01:19:00,236
What? What the fuck
are you doing, you jackass?

1082
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,539
Come down... stop it!

1083
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:06,075
What are you doing? Beverly!

1084
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:09,710
I'm gonna get the law after you,
you stupid punks!

1085
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,712
Go home!

1086
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,271
I called as soon as I saw the papers.

1087
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,476
- When's the court date?
- 23rd of next month.

1088
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:42,945
- It's hard to believe, really.
- I know.

1089
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,958
Contributing to the delinquency
of a minor and then they take Bev

1090
01:19:46,058 --> 01:19:50,153
and they hold her in juvenile hall,
what is the point of that?

1091
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,827
They're just trying to
punish me for what Errol did.

1092
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:59,428
- It'll never stand up in court.
- Why?

1093
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:04,267
It's got a lot of major difficulties. I mean,
it's in Beverly's handwriting for a start.

1094
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,735
And that really wouldn't be
such a problem,

1095
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:09,572
except for when you look on the back,
there's no signature page.

1096
01:20:09,772 --> 01:20:13,640
- It's gotta be there, somewhere.
- No, not on this copy.

1097
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:18,615
He dictated it to Beverly,
so he must have signed it.

1098
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:21,250
I mean, he wanted Beverly
to have a third of his estate.

1099
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,720
Well, his estate is,
believe me, a nightmare.

1100
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,589
I don't really care.
You've gotta find the signature page.

1101
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,858
But Florence, it's more than that.

1102
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:34,494
He needed to initial every page in the
presence of a witness, two witnesses.

1103
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,864
This is a sloppy job.

1104
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:39,932
Typical.

1105
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:26,582
- Are you eating? You look thin.
- No, I'm fine.

1106
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:31,387
- They taking good care of you?
- Yeah, they're really nice.

1107
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:35,522
Don't worry, baby. We're gonna
be back together again real soon.

1108
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:42,598
Mom, people are saying that they're
never gonna give you custody.

1109
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:45,531
What? Who's saying that?

1110
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,236
Just people around here.
My social worker and stuff.

1111
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,310
Well, that's not true. I've spent my
last dime on a crackerjack attorney

1112
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,179
and I'm fighting
with everything that I've got.

1113
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,344
I know.

1114
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:03,719
But I just wanted to say
that if it doesn't go your way,

1115
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:07,456
they've talked to me about some
foster care at a ranch outside the city.

1116
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,258
No, that's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen.

1117
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:12,056
It's not the way it's meant to be.

1118
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,832
I don't think that anything
was ever meant to be, Mom.

1119
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:18,710
I disagree.

1120
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,825
All right, I don't wanna argue about it.

1121
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,880
Bev, I...

1122
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:39,322
I went to see the lawyer
about the will and...

1123
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:42,589
It's no good.
He doesn't think it's gonna hold up.

1124
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,363
But, Errol dictated it
to me himself in Cuba.

1125
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,667
I know, I know, I know.
But they can't find the signature page.

1126
01:22:50,767 --> 01:22:54,933
And they don't know if it was stolen
or it was misplaced. Then he didn't...

1127
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:59,444
He didn't file the damn
thing properly. It's just...

1128
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:02,475
Left us high and dry.

1129
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,113
Well, I don't care.

1130
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:12,118
I don't care about the money.

1131
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,622
I don't care about anything, really.

1132
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,415
There's nothing that can bring him back.

1133
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:23,296
I know, baby.

1134
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:28,935
It was a party
whenever he was around, wasn't it?

1135
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,773
Now, the party's over
and we have to clean up the mess.

1136
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,983
But, actually, Bev...

1137
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,429
Something has...

1138
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:48,129
come up that might be
a silver lining to all of this.

1139
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,687
There's an offer of a book.

1140
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:56,198
It would be about you and me and Errol,
and I've been talking to this writer.

1141
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:59,835
He seems like a good guy
and he says it's a slam dunk.

1142
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:02,604
- Mom, don't.
- What?

1143
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:07,355
Don't do that. Don't talk to him.

1144
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,280
- Bev, did you love Errol?
- Of course.

1145
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,918
Well, don't you think that you owe to him
to tell the real story of your love?

1146
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:18,854
I mean, all the gutter versions
are out there.

1147
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:21,891
Now is our chance
to set the record straight,

1148
01:24:21,991 --> 01:24:25,868
to tell the world what a good man
he was and how much he loved you.

1149
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,238
Bev, you're still so young.

1150
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:37,170
When you get to be my age, you realize
that life just goes by in a minute.

1151
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:40,643
This is our chance to make our mark.

1152
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,713
All those people that are clucking
their tongues at us,

1153
01:24:43,813 --> 01:24:46,782
they don't have what we have.
They don't have our real story.

1154
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:50,617
A love story that will stand
the test of time.

1155
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:55,625
People will know who we are,
a hundred years from now.

1156
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:59,692
But none of that matters
once you're gone.

1157
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,033
Look at Errol.

1158
01:25:02,133 --> 01:25:06,202
Look at Errol. He is still here,
because he's Robin Hood,

1159
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:09,305
the swashbuckler, and people remember.

1160
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:11,904
Have you signed anything with him?

1161
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,262
Not yet.

1162
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,243
Well, don't.

1163
01:25:17,945 --> 01:25:21,948
- Promise me that you won't.
- Oh, Beverly.

1164
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,154
Promise me,
or you'll never see me again.

1165
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:40,307
All right, I promise.

1166
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,376
Thank you.

1167
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,606
I love you, Mom.

1168
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:53,085
I love you, baby.
