00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:18,069
Would you want this man
to be your spiritual guide?

679
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:20,470
Ha-ha, no. Maybe my TV guide.

680
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:22,937
- Oh, wow. Terrible dad joke.
- Am I right?

681
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:24,437
I like her. Let's get to work.

682
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,638
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

683
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:28,271
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

684
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:31,372
I can help. I...

685
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:34,138
I can help with the hotel
in exchange for gallery space.

686
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:35,706
- No.
- Huh? No, I can help.

687
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,640
I can... I can paint. I can saw.

688
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,106
I can lift and lay tile, grout.

689
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,808
- Is that...? That's a thing.
- Yeah.

690
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,140
It's not gonna happen.

691
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:46,107
That sounds like free labor.

692
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,708
And, Nick, you love
free labor, don't you?

693
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:50,241
- LUCY: You do. Come on.
- Come on.

694
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,108
You don't have a plan
for the balcony.

695
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,341
I did say
I had a plan for the balcony.

696
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,075
I just said it was phase two.

697
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,610
Sorry, uh, balconies are
really important.

698
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,276
- LUCY: He gets it.
- They're essential.

699
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,510
- What is going on?
- MARCOS: Two people agreeing.

700
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:05,477
- Maybe eternal friendship.
- We're bonding. We're friends?

701
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,477
We should take it
step by step, but sure.

702
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:08,977
- Okay.
- It's a good start.

703
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:10,978
- I hate both of you.
- Is that a yes?

704
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,511
- No. No.
- Yes. We could use the help.

705
00:32:13,646 --> 00:32:15,345
You start tomorrow,
7 in the morning.

706
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:18,279
Get us the coffee, right?
You know, gotta pay the piper.

707
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:19,647
We do love oat milk.

708
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,648
Get almond milk
if you don't have it.

709
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:25,947
Soy milk, whatever. Have fun.
But nothing with actual dairy.

710
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,848
He gets really sensitive
in his tummy.

711
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,816
- Okay. All right. Let's...
- He has IBS, it's embarrassing.

712
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,415
- IBS is a real thing.
- Stop it.

713
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,315
- Tell me about his tummy.
- This is not happening.

714
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:35,716
There is no tummy.

715
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,149
Goodbye.

716
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,483
- Dude. What? No.
- We have 30 days. We need help.

This is Morris.

734
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:22,423
My husband and I
got him together.

735
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:24,758
My husband left.

736
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,090
Morris took it pretty hard.

737
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,458
Yeah, he died immediately.

738
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,192
Let me get this straight.
You are collecting

739
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:36,927
other people's junk
in addition to your own?

740
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,460
Oh, shut up, Jeff.

741
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,293
I should text Max about this.

742
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,127
He likes to be up to date
with galleries.

743
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,993
- No. Don't do that.
- You're right.

744
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,495
I'll slide in the DMs.
That's more chill.

745
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,728
You need to get a grip.
He is dating a doctor

746
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,295
- with the face of an angel.
- You're a monster.

747
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:55,463
Thank you. Okay, you need
some sexual Listerine.

748
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:59,764
Jeff agrees. What, um...?
What about that new guy, Nick?

749
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,963
Last time I slept
with someone I worked with,

750
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:03,864
it ended very badly.

751
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:06,430
AMANDA: That is so true, Jeff.
That does sound like progress.

752
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,665
- Thank you.
- Why don't you invite

753
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,766
your "friend" Nick
to my birthday?

754
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,866
I came up with a new theme,
murder karaoke.

755
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,998
- Oh.
- It combines my favorite things,

756
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,834
- murder and karaoke.
- A heavenly combo.

757
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:18,934
- A perfect combination.
- NADINE: You guys.

758
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,133
I am in love.

759
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,634
Her name is Irina.

760
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,901
She's got tiny baby bones
like a baby chick,

761
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:27,734
and I just wanna
build a nest for her

762
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,635
and chew her food for her
and feed her.

763
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:31,334
Jesus, I give it two weeks.

764
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,902
Do I detect cynicism
from the great believer of love?

765
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:37,803
She's right. You've banged more
models than a tech billionaire.

766
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,437
If you were a guy,
we would hate you.

767
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:41,369
- Yeah.
- I don't need to take this.

768
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:43,103
- You do. You do.
- I don't. I don't.

769
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:45,438
- Eat the pasta.
- Okay.

770
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,573
Hey, uh, Nick, I, um...

771
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:55,573
- I can't work anymore this week.
- Why?

772
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:58,507
Your homeboy's been commissioned
to build a new table

773
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,973
for that hotel in Fort Green
that's opening up.

774
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:03,508
Really? That place is so cheesy.

775
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:05,307
Oh, God.
How dare I take their money

776
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:06,808
when you don't like
their mason jars.

777
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:09,675
Look, man, I know...
I know things are tough,

778
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,876
but I have a meeting
at the bank on Friday,

779
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,876
and I will get you your money.

780
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,375
- You are first on my list.
- Oh, there's a list?

781
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,610
Can I see the list, or...?

782
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,109
- It's a theoretical list. Nick...
- It's gonna happen.

783
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,310
Come on.
I can't keep doing this, man.

784
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:25,310
I got a family. All right?

785
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:28,010
I have responsibilities.
I'm sorry.

786
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:30,479
Don't shut off on me. I...

787
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,278
Show me those blushy cheeks.

788
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,580
Oh, my God. I feel so warm
inside when I see them.

789
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:36,245
- Show me...
- I'm fine, man.

790
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:39,179
- Please, just go, okay?
- All right.

791
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:42,647
Good morning, building buds!
Who's ready to work?

792
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,147
Because I am. Check me out.

793
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,814
Look at this belt,
a practical belt for tools.

794
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,415
Ha! Here is your coffee,
Marky Mark.

795
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,583
All right, Lucy Liu. Ha!

796
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,850
And then, for you,
I got the special milks.

797
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:55,982
Thank you.

798
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:57,982
- Dude.
- Sorry. Her Majesty is

799
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,563
a little upset this morning,
so tread lightly.

800
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:00,566
Oh, no. We need to talk
about our feelings?

801
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:00,569
Because the CFO has arrived.

802
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:00,572
Chief Feelings Officer is here.
Let's hold hands.

803
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:00,575
Okay, bring it in, guys.
God. Dad jokes. Okay, I'm out.

804
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:00,578
See you, dude.
Bye.

805
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:00,581
Who is this person?
Yeah, you're in the right place.

806
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:00,584
Hi.
Hey. Uh, whew.

807
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:00,587
Are you here
for the Broken Heart Gallery?

808
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:00,590
Yeah. Is this
that heartbreak thing?

809
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:00,593
Yeah. You're in the right place.
Welcome. I'm Lucy, head curator.

810
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:00,596
Yeah. Willhelmina.

811
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:00,599
So how's this,
uh, whole thing work?

812
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:00,602
I don't know.
How does this whole thing work?

813
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:00,605
Uh, well, why don't you we start

814
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:00,608
by you telling me
what you brought and why?

815
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:00,611
Yeah. Uh, well, met my ex, Gina,
while I was actually...

816
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:00,614
Oh, wait. Pause. Uh, do you
mind if I record this?

817
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:00,617
Just, you know, for our socials.
Yeah. Sure.

818
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:00,620
Take a step back against this.

819
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:00,623
Right. Here?
Ooh, that is perfect.

820
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:00,626
And go.

821
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:00,629
I was in the hospital.

822
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:00,632
I was recovering from a
pretty nasty skydiving accident.

823
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:00,635
She was my nurse. I had
a body cast covered all my tats,

824
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:00,638
so Gina, she drew
these ones on for me.

825
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:00,641
When I could walk,
I asked her to marry me.

826
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:00,644
But she changed her mind
three weeks later.

827
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:00,647
No.
Damn, Gina.

828
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:00,650
Anyway, time passed,
but this just...

829
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:00,653
sat in the corner
of my bedroom, taunting me.

830
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:00,656
How long
have you held on to it for?

831
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:00,659
Six... Five years. Five years.

832
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:00,662
Feels good
to admit that, you know?

833
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:00,665
Then I heard about
this place.

834
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:00,668
And how exactly did you hear
about this place?

835
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:00,671
My masseuse's Instagram.

836
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:00,674
How did your masseuse
hear about it?

837
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:00,677
Don't listen to him.
Are you ready to hand it over?

838
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:00,680
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay.

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

840
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:00,686
Ooh, it has an odor.
Oh.

841
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:00,689
Okay. Mm.

842
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:00,692
You did it.
I did it.

843
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:00,695
How does it feel?
This is the first time

844
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:00,698
in, like, five years

01:40:45,352 --> 01:40:46,619
This is the bottle

2197
01:40:46,753 --> 01:40:48,719
from the first whiskey
we shared together.

2198
01:40:48,853 --> 01:40:53,453
And this is the pen Lucy used
to defile my hotel,

2199
01:40:54,921 --> 01:40:56,521
and this is the hotel room key

2200
01:40:56,655 --> 01:40:58,988
from when Lucy and I
first started connecting...

2201
01:40:59,121 --> 01:41:00,688
What are you doing?

2202
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:02,489
I'm doing the thing
about the stuff,

2203
01:41:02,622 --> 01:41:05,556
you know,
that the other people did.

2204
01:41:05,689 --> 01:41:07,490
I'm sorry. She has no manners.

2205
01:41:07,623 --> 01:41:09,823
Okay, that's cute,
but we don't...

2206
01:41:09,957 --> 01:41:12,757
You don't need this, okay,
because we're never breaking up.

2207
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:14,391
Not even in a zombie apocalypse.

2208
01:41:14,524 --> 01:41:16,591
I'm sorry, he's such a hoarder.

2209
01:41:16,724 --> 01:41:20,891
Um, we don't use that term.
It's derogatory.

2210
01:41:21,025 --> 01:41:24,058
No, taught you so well.
