00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,875
during the early 21 century
a virus destroy nearly all life on earth

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,911
it is called the VXII

4
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:28,661
a 50 foot walls built to protect
the non infected survivors

5
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:33,147
there is no life beyond the wall

6
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:37,985
internment camps are built to accomodate
the increasing number of orphans

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,622
only 5 children survived
the brutal conditions

8
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:44,981
Sentanza, kane, vitor
shawn and jude

9
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:47,699
they are known as the drifters

10
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,769
most of them have disappeared
and vanished from the public eye

11
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,773
except for one

12
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:58,297
jude black now leads a terrorist gang of
disillusioned youths called the vespers

13
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,565
they have taken control of 3 cities
within the wall

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,632
and are now trained on the
last standing city: hawthorne

15
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:08,065
It is about our brother
You know, brothers!

16
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,903
jude

17
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:43,829
since two brothers.
both evil , both friends.

18
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,998
Jude,,? You hear me?!

19
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,185
- how much they pay to you?
- Not you just hear?!

20
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:56,034
so one day the
older brother dies

21
00:01:56,217 --> 00:02:01,899
And the younger brother ..
price for a pastor.

22
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,678
and said : I have a condition

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,029
In the funeral of my brother,
should call him saint.

24
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,554
And the pastor ...

25
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,988
who make you doing this?

26
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,979
will you listen?!

27
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:26,140
It is about brothers.

28
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,815
It's all Sentanza.

29
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:39,225
Two brothers, one is dead
the yonger price for a pastor!

30
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:41,760
What are you afraid?

31
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,064
have always been close.

32
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:52,894
My brother would never
have come here today

33
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:12,565
Two brothers, one is dead
the yonger price for a pastor!

34
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:18,406
The pastor gives his word and accept the money.

35
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:22,599
to say say at the funeral.
This man was evil.

36
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:26,603
cheating on his wife
cheating on his children!

37
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:32,578
But compared with his brother,
Who is the saint?

38
00:04:49,604 --> 00:05:04,760
The White Wall.

39
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:12,816
hawthorn city

40
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,214
The first time I saw the white wall

41
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,265
was the first time I heard about the VX2.

42
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:27,471
i grow up in an orphanage
camp behind the wall.

43
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:30,285
that was built to protect
us from the infection.

44
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,349
The only memories i have from my child

45
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,455
are from this camp.

46
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:38,310
only the strong survived

47
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:41,108
Sentanza, Jude, Vitor, Cane and I

48
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:44,396
were those who remained.

49
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:47,231
Are the unique family I know.

50
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,396
they call us the drifters

51
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,597
Eventually, we grew up
on a separate ways.

52
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:59,829
some of us never
escape the violence.

53
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,336
As Jude.

54
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,540
The last I heard

55
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:07,705
is gain of vespers  and responsible
for half of corpses in the city.

56
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,840
I fear that when the time comes

57
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,592
only one who can stop him is one of us.

58
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,181
i have not heard for
many of us from years

59
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,670
maybe they found some peace
and quit, maybe not

60
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:35,735
i think everything happens for a reason,
But still I'm waiting

61
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,828
hawthorne , medic station
12 and 13 july 2039

62
00:06:57,143 --> 00:07:00,604
Never learn, eh? three weeks
and do not take the job seriously.

63
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,724
- need more
- you joking

64
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,928
You can hold a job for a few months.

65
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,664
ya i know, people talk.

66
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,517
everybody wants to give
their 2 sense about you

67
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,626
what is yours?

68
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:18,641
I have no one.

69
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,188
But see this.

70
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,218
if you ever find some wonder on what
you doing or where you going,

71
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,795
if some wonder why you are here

72
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,315
just stay quit and follow my lead

73
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,024
i will keep this in mind

74
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:33,398
If you're not taking this seriously,
Why you here?

75
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,561
why even bother coming

76
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:43,647
forget it is the Dr granddaughter
Why she will like a fool like you?

77
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,820
Work comes the captain
is coming over

78
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,389
what he gonna do
send me behind the wall?

79
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:52,042
wall ? what wall?

80
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:56,174

81
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,778

you Forgot to put up
the wet floor sign

86
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,955
you did not bother with the
bathrooms on the second floor

87
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,436
and you forgot to unload
the boxes of the medics

88
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:19,630
you think that is a acceptable
behavior for the head of the janitors?

89
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,742
Mr. Sorry I forgot.

90
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,186

109
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:37,928

Shawn, I work here

114
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,315
they say that you are expert on vx2

115
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,986
That you've been here since the beginning

116
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:18,932
what do you want

117
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:22,214
I've been looking into this virus lately

118
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,833
but its been hard killing my
hands on anything useful

119
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:29,102
they say you the
meant to talk to you

120
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:30,458
Is it true?

121
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,201
can we turn down the wall
if we found the cure

122
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,637
Sorry, its just far too speculative

123
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:42,248
but the risk is paramount
there is no cure..

124
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:46,197
- And if ...
- I said that is it any

125
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:49,030
To find the cure we need a carrier.

126
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:52,256
We have none, because nobody survives

127
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:59,456
I'm a reasonable man.
If you want to research tell me your plans.

128
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:01,697
Le í his book and I thought ....

129
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:05,409
Yes? Do you have any experience?

130
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:08,336
"Some.
-? EDUCATION?

131
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,497
Self-taught.

132
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,787
Self-taught.

133
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,211
I have seen many
boys like you.

134
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,988

advice I can give you?

135
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,542

136
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:24,963
Go home.
Wherever it is that might be

137
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:30,634
And if you have nothing value to say
I have more important things to do.

138
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,994

147
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:18,268

all I want in help for me
is . . . . in an empty fridge

00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,789
at least here I have
something good doing

156
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:07,280
- The equation is wrong.

Not at all.

bitches and throw them in the desert?

211
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:51,106

212
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:54,382
We will use condoms.

213
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,102

You've been doing the same
Shawn shit for six years.

When are you going to grow?

222
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,776

It is common things in
nature? you Know?

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,968
brothers stay helping each other

241
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:53,604
Sometimes till death.

242
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,978
I remember when I was young

243
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,923
i did not have a brother
i had a sister

244
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,341

245
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:04,124

00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,877
- or you want to talk to my brother?

250
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,650

252
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:29,911

00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:49,159
well the one
the vespers are coming

257
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:52,527
You can thank your brother for that.

258
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,723
you would not do that

259
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,483

260
00:31:57,518 --> 00:32:00,680

261
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:08,366
Come on, we're wasting time

262
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:16,400

- Of course.

263
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:27,676
- You work for the militia?

264
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,058
how you know where jude is?

265
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:34,322
I am a businessman. I follow the money.

266
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:38,217
Who pays the bounty then?

267
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,956
Nobody important.

268
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,161
The deal is that Jude stay alive

269
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,430

this mess before it is too late

270

285
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:44,277

286
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:48,755
I lost my blade

287
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,110

288
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,884
they do not care about you
Come on, give me a chance.

289
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:59,542
Why you still here?

290

307
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,368

309
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:30,530
I thought I was your back up

310
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:33,266
we do not need anybody else

311
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,003
anybody else wants Jude dead

312
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,450
I am gonna find the drifters

313
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:41,797
That is a bad idea

314
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:45,128
who the hell they?

315
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:47,484
They are my brothers.

316
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,590
the only brother you have
there is bounty on his head

317
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:55,487
you were as brothers because you
was in some children home together

318
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:58,355
some home by ya they were

319
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,818
with santenza dead and jude warned

320
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:03,637
there is only two of us left

321
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:06,885
You can put an end to this right now.

322
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:11,428
no forget it, never mind
deal is off

323
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,842
What can I do without m í?

324
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:16,063
What can you do without the car?

325
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,100
make it right

326
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,093
The last time. this motherfucker Sentanza
Came and ...

327
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,536
I thought you say you
do not know him

328
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,965
Well, I hardly know him

329
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,677
We were not friends
we just want to reward

330
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,563
it dos not matter
back to the issue

331
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:39,619
loyalty, character , integrity.
do I make sense?

332
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:42,958
You are right.
Sentanza was not intelligent.

333
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:47,116
but vitor was different
every one knew vitor like this

334
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,032
was one time vitor and I were

335
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,714
This story does not lead us anywhere

336
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:55,436
Vitor was strong, everyone knew
that but he have brains

337
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:05,247
- What?
- Nothing

338
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:11,243
let just test him
see how he will response

339
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:15,072
- what are you thinking?
- Sentanza betray me.

340
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:18,436
i am telling you
you can not trust anybody

341
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,444
you still mad of me
are not you?

342
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:31,316
I want you to take the keys
as a symbol of my confidence

343
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:35,939
- You sure?
- Yes, just park your car.

344
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:46,663
vitor bungalow

345
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:25,185
- kane
- shawn

346
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:31,465
so is vitor?

347
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:34,868
I did not know that you
were living together

348
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,302
A drink?

349
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:42,937
where is the brother

350
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:46,547
that way we catch from long time

351
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:51,618
I do not know how he will
react when he sees you

352
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:57,816
well I know its been a while
but I really need to talk to him

353
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,115
and tell him what?

354
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,939
you remember the internment camps

355
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:08,292
when the guards came around
and practically ran the place

356
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:14,509
it was shame only a
few was survived

357
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:18,717
we should stuck together

358
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:24,082
Do you remember that joke, two evil brothers?

359
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:27,276
Nobody say like Sentanza

360
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,340
he is dead

they can not believe
how much I changed

384
00:45:25,576 --> 00:45:29,594
they still think I am a
skinny little kid

385
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:32,373
Yes.

386
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,293

387
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:37,612
they told me they will back
me when I need them

388
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:43,083
Vitor told me to stay a while
but I told him I have to go

389
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:46,525
I dont want them to know
that you are around

390
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,704

391
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:10,832

its a blueprint
Is the power generator

543
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:36,887
its happening already

544
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:38,883
they will target the
main official first

545
01:12:38,918 --> 01:12:42,244
what left from them will rest or run

01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:45,016
We have to get as far awa
 from here as possible

547
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:49,728
- I have to tell Shawn about this
- I do not want you to see him Elsa

548
01:12:49,763 --> 01:12:52,724
I never liked that boy

549
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:54,990
he was hiding something

550
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:58,886
- you made the VX2?
- That was an accident

551
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:02,411
Create a biological weapon was not an accident.

552
01:13:02,608 --> 01:13:07,684
What you want me to say?

take money for this

556
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:56,600
I'm thinking of starting my business.
In some place up north.

557
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:59,770

01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,338

561
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:40,840
I can blow away all my
new savings quickly

562
01:14:41,874 --> 01:14:44,142

563
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:47,640
how you gonna spend the
last of your days

564
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:49,837
What do you mean?

565
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:54,666
Jude will not get far.

566
01:14:56,138 --> 01:15:01,875
he will gonna burn this place
down before he reach the outside

567
01:15:03,229 --> 01:15:06,413

trace to this virus?

568
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:21,439

571
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:44,815

572
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:54,443

573
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:05,935
everything will be fine.

574
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:23,394
we need to help shawn
find out how to turn the power on

575
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:30,779
Grandfather,

576
01:17:33,838 --> 01:17:36,650
I do not blame you grandfather

577
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:48,184
what you think you are doing
go and get my papers

578
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:07,099
These are all my notes of VX2,

579
01:18:08,122 --> 01:18:13,508
creation, intention, everything.

580
01:18:13,586 --> 01:18:18,648
what suppose to do with that
even you could not figure this out

581
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:26,200
You are right
I could not figure it out

582
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:48,109
- should turn off the third generator?
- not yet

583
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:51,617
I do not want to draw attention.

584
01:18:56,796 --> 01:19:02,949
Propaganda, lies, it all ends now.

585
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:07,524
we breach the wall
we force them to find the cure

586
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:10,346
Finally we are free

587
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,349
You should not have come.

588
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:06,224
I let you go.

589
01:20:21,672 --> 01:20:24,483
You do not know what you do.

590
01:20:25,176 --> 01:20:27,919
Do not know what I'm doing?

591
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:30,796
You will get yourself killed
whenever else with you

592
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,937
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

593
01:20:34,185 --> 01:20:36,432
let it go Jude!

594
01:20:36,437 --> 01:20:41,565
- Some of us want to live
- then get out of my way!

595
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:20,454

596
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:26,188
A friend.

597
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,800
Nothing has changed.

598
01:22:34,597 --> 01:22:38,350
we are getting slowly smaller

599
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:41,982
