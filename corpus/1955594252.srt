1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,760
Mr. Brown ought to be here any minute.

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,840
But why don't I walk you through
the aerial survey and site plan

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
until he arrives.

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,960
What do you think they're getting
per square foot over there?

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,800
Sorry?

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,400
What kind of money are they getting
for that space

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,800
in the business park?

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm sure I don't...
I don't really know, Mr. Mayor.

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
- Guesstimate.
- I don't have a clue.

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,840
I bet a bundle.
I bet a bundle, Nate.

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
It's Saturday, for heaven's sake.

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,200
Can we please look at this thing
and get going?

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
Trish talked with him ten minutes ago.

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,520
He ought to be here, you know,
in a minute or so, but I can get started.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's get the show on the road.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,680
This is the six block area.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,600
We vacate the alleyways and create
a superblock site. You follow?

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Superblock, yes, yes.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Let me orient you.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,000
Neighborhood-serving retail here,
upmarket women's shoes and apparel,

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,040
fine dining, fountains, textured
hardscape, just like stone,

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
even an indoor children's playland.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,400
It's a pedestrian-friendly,
relatable space.

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,720
And then... on that superblock site
I give you...

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,520
Cortona.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
Cortona.

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
Cor-tona.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,880
It really, I think, expresses
simplicity, beauty, and elegance.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
If I do say so myself.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,560
Actually, I think it creates
a sort of Aristotelean unity...

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,360
And the piece de resistance,
one hundred and seventy condominium units

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
for the discriminating consumer.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,320
- It totally redefines the urban fabric.
- I like.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
I think it's fantastic.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,200
Pardon me, but I don't see
the low income units.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,360
There are no low-income units at Cortona.
We'll build whatever the city requires...

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
... off-site.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,760
Off-site?

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,280
Sure. We pay the in-lieu fees
and build them...

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
In East Orange.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Not exactly. My partners and I
have found the perfect parcel

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,320
out on Maple Avenue.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
We can build our low-income units
out there.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,280
You know what they say. Out of sight...

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
... out of mind.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
That's all well and good, gentlemen,

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
but what about the current owners?

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,800
Hi, Jennifer.
Lizzie from the Paisley Set.

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Yeah. Gimmie the L'Oreal lightener.
The one-pound tub.

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,080
Make three of 'em
and ten boxes of foils.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,960
Oh. And a gallon of Barbicide.

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Right.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,120
Right. Cheers, darling.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
Thanks.
Here you go.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you.

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
- Hi.
- Hello, Samantha.

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
- Just coffee. In a to go cup.
- Large?

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,120
- Perfect.
- Got it.

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,320
- Is Leonard here?
- He's in the back.

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm just going to hit the loo.

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,640
- Well, now! Good morning!
- Had to see you before work.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Anybody see you come in?

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,160
- Len. I can't wait until Monday.
- Monday?

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Yes, yes, the city, remember?
Ozzello's on Mulberry Street.

65
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,120
- I don't know...
- What don't you know?

66
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,720
Well, you see, Monday night
is Deeanne's book club night.

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm in charge of the kids Monday.
I'd have to get a sitter.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,280
And Deeanne would be suspicious if
I got a sitter.

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,840
Well, why don't you think about it.
I've got to get to work.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,640
- I want to...
- I know, I know.

71
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
- One more.
- Thank you.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,160
You're welcome.

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Sam, dear, the loo.
You're out of paper towels.

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Okie dokie.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,520
Alright, you.
I'm turning on the lights.

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Bollocks.

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Up to your old tricks, dad?

78
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,080
God Mehar! You scared me to death.
What are you doing here?

79
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
I work here, Lizzie.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,240
You could have killed me, you know.
I was putting a penny in the box.

81
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,000
And you. Flicking the switches.
I could have gone up... poof.

82
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,800
I've got to call an electrician.

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
That's more like it.

84
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,880
I heard you up here.
Talking to the ghost again?

85
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,840
Why do you believe in ghosts?

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,360
Unless I am mistaken, Christians
aren't supposed to believe in spirits.

87
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
That's alright, dearie. I'm Scottish.

88
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,160
Yes. We believe in ghosts and brownies
and selkies and howlers and griffins.

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
Why are you in so early?

90
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
- The wedding party!
- Oh, crikey, I forgot.

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Oh my god. The florist isn't there yet.

92
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,240
Mom. Did you hear that?
The florist isn't there.

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,920
Jacks, a red velcro.

94
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Cheers.

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
- This is a disaster.
- She'll be there.

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,360
The point is she's not there, mother.

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,760
Hold your head straight, dear.

98
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,960
- Why don't you call Daddy.
- What can Daddy do?!?

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,240
He can't even hire
a responsible florist!

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680
- Hand me your phone.
- You didn't bring your phone?

101
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm getting married today
and you didn't bring your phone?

102
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,960
They won't let me have a cell phone.

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,000
- Cell phones are overrated, dude.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,480
But I need one.

105
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,000
They are the bane of humanity.

106
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,440
- What's a bane?
- I need it for school.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Hey, you do not need a cell phone
distracting you in the classroom.

108
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,840
Don't stunt her growth, Mother.

109
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,280
I might as well just forget the wedding.

110
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
- Now what?
- Daddy's pants don't fit.

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Oh, for heaven's sake,
they can let them out.

112
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,480
In one hour!?!? He's got to be
at the church hall in an hour

113
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
to pay the florist.
Who, by the way, is not there.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,760
You need to relax, dear.
Today is your day to shine.

115
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,640
I cannot shine when everyone's
screwing up.

116
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,120
Listen.

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,720
You've got a good man and
a diamond ring on your finger, you know?

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,560
The wedding is pure gravy.

119
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,440
We should all be so lucky.

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,920
Everyone's in an up-do? Am I right?

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,840
- Except mine's the biggest.
- Oh, for God's sake.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Of course, dearie.

123
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,280
You're queen for a day, and
your beautiful hair will be your crown.

124
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
Come on.

125
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
Good morning, ladies.

126
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,200
I have a certified letter
for miss Lizzie.

127
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
And I need a signature.

128
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,720
Lizzie! You have to sign for something!

129
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,040
Good morning, beautiful.
How are you today?

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Good morning, Craig.

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,560
A certified letter for you today.

132
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,560
You're still beautiful.

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
- You have a great day.
- You too, Craig.

134
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Thank you.

135
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,120
Bloody hell!

136
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
- Mehar, can you cover?
- Yeah, of course.

137
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,240
Back in a sec.

138
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
- Mister Mayor.
- Lizzie Munro. Right?

139
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,640
I try to keep everybody's name
right at the tip of my fingertips.

140
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,560
- What in the hell is this?
- Hey, take it easy. Have a seat.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Would you like some coffee?
Maybe... What have we got?

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,840
- What about this...
- An explanation. That's what I want.

143
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,960
Well this is a notice from the Planning
Department that tells everybody

144
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
what's gonna happen around here.

145
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,840
- Eviction? From my own property?
- Eminent domain.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,280
My domain.

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Look. It's all legal.
C'mon, Lizzie.

148
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,120
It's how you give an old town
a nip and a tuck. Gets rid of the blight.

149
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,520
- Blight?
- Improves the tax base.

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,000
You do wanna improve the tax base,
don't you?

151
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,040
What are you talking about?

152
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
My father left that building to me

153
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
and I've worked my fingers to the bone
to pay it off.

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,920
Hey, is that Lizzie?
Where is she going now?

155
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
Leonard.

156
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,000
- Lizzie. What a surprise...
- Have you seen this?

157
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,400
I got a letter. Sure.

158
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
I just had a very interesting chat
with Tiny Provenzano.

159
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,760
Eminent domain they're calling it.

160
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,600
They're going to force us to take
a piddling sum for our buildings

161
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
whether we like it or not.

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Then they'll scrape the whole business,
and put up some fantasyland

163
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,040
with Coldstone Creamery and Baby Gap.
Right here! In Old Town!

164
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,920
You're right.
That's what I understand.

165
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,760
- I just paid off that building, Leonard.
- Yeah. That's hard.

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,320
But, look on the bright side.
It could mean cash in our pockets.

167
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,400
I can swing a divorce
and can make alimony.

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,120
And you and I could...

169
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
Ok. Look.

170
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,040
We'll talk about it,
when we're able to. Ok?

171
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah. I know.

172
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

173
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,800
Anyway, I've got to get back
to my ladies.

174
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,400
I'll just... call you Monday.
Or something.

175
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Yes. We'll talk Monday. Can I
get you something in the meantime?

176
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
We have a new burger on the menu...

177
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
Are you hungry? C.J.'s at a rally,
and I'm a loose ends.

178
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,720
I dunno.

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,720
- I'm knackered.
- Come on. My treat.

180
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Don't make me eat alone.

181
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,080
It's awful good of you to sacrifice
your Saturday night for the old boss.

182
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,280
You know, you might just be in line
for a raise.

183
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
I'll make a note of that.

184
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,960
- Since when do you smoke?
- Since today, dear.

185
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,680
What's up, cuties?
Wanna keep us company tonight?

186
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- In their dreams.

187
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
The whole thing sucks.

188
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,160
I'd hate to see the old block
turn into a pile of bricks.

189
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,160
Me, too.

190
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,400
It's just greed.

191
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,600
Hear, hear. And it's not just my
business

192
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,200
or you girls trying to put
food on the table.

193
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160
- It's bigger than that.
- Yeah.

194
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,680
What about our ladies? Don't forget them
and their frosts and tips.

195
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Oh, God. How can I?

196
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,840
You know, my father left my mum
and my brother and me in Stirling

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,640
when I was eight.

198
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,520
Broken hearted.

199
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,600
So, I did my beauty school stint
in Glasgow,

200
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,640
and as soon as I knew one end
of my shears from the other,

201
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
I tracked the bastard down.

202
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
All the way to Manningtree, New Jersey.

203
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
- Of all places.
- Yes.

204
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,960
But by the time I got here,
he'd already been dead a year.

205
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,960
And all he left was the building
and a failing little haberdashery.

206
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,200
And a monstrous mortgage.

207
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
You know,
in a weird way I'm thankful.

208
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
For him and his folly.
I met some nice people here.

209
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,800
I've learned to drive
in three foot of snow.

210
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,040
And eat hotdogs with yellow mustard.

211
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,920
There you go.

212
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,960
- What about a nightcap?
- Right you are.

213
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,160
Nice break.

214
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,880
I love Manningtree.
I love my customers.

215
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,160
I love cutting and flatironing
and perming the lot of 'em.

216
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
I really do.

217
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
It'll be sad to leave it.
So sad, Jacks.

218
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,200
Come on, you're not leaving.
Your friends are here.

219
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,000
What about bowling nights?

220
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,240
- What about Len?
- What about him?

221
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
You'll be together some day.

222
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,840
Men. Bah.

223
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,160
If I had any sense
I'd become a lesbian.

224
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,680
But then I think about the fights!
Females are fierce.

225
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,320
- See me. You can?
- I can.

226
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,520
Put two of 'em together.
Crikey, what a mess!

227
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,200
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

228
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,280
A word, Mr. Berry.
My name is Lizzie Munro.

229
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,840
I own the building at 150 Main Street.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,080
And I need to talk with you
about a letter I received.

231
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,360
It's my lunch hour, Miss Munro.

232
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,920
It's my building and your town
is going to seize it.

233
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,280
We'll negotiate a fair price, Miss Munro.
You have nothing to worry about.

234
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,040
What if I refuse to negotiate?

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,840
With all due respect, Miss Munro,
you can't refuse.

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Supreme Court. 2005.
Kelo v. New London Connecticut.

237
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,160
We have the authority to condemn
and clear private property

238
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
if we can't come to a reasonable
accommodation with you.

239
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Are you saying, you can take my propriety
without my consent?

240
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
That can not be right.

241
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,600
In America, Miss Munro,
progress is always right.

242
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Cortona is progress. Ipso facto.
Cortona is right.

243
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,600
That's all we have on Cortona.

244
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,360
Let's see. At a dollar a copy,
that'll be a hundred and ten dollars.

245
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,080
- A hundred and ten dollars?
- We take checks.

246
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,880
Holy cow!

247
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
- A hundred and ten.
- Thank you.

248
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,880
I'll be back in a minute
with your receipt.

249
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,160
Jesus.

250
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,360
Did you hear the expression
of fly in the ointment?

251
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,480
Yeah.

252
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,040
Just had a visit from a certain
Lizzie Munro.

253
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,200
That's what she's gonna be.
I think you'd better call our friend.

254
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Ok. He'll deal with it.
Don't worry about it.

255
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,920
Warren. Tiny. How's it hanging?
Yeah. Well, we have a little problem.

256
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,960
A broad.

257
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,480
So.

258
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
What about us?

259
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,080
- What do you mean?
- Leonard.

260
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,040
What can I say to you that I
haven't already said, Lizzie?

261
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Deeanne doesn't understand me.

262
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,760
We haven't had a physical relationship
in, well, in a long time.

263
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,280
We're separated.
What do you want from me?

264
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,280
Does Deeanne know you're separated?

265
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,000
You still live with the woman. For all
I know, you still sleep in the same bed.

266
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,920
Now, Lizzie.

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,760
Here's the thing about affairs,
Leonard.

268
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,600
You cannae help me.
If I'm in trouble, you cannae help me.

269
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,360
Or comfort me. Or fight for me.
At least not in public.

270
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,920
And I'm in trouble.
Big, bollocky trouble.

271
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,920
I will fight for you, Lizzie.
I promise.

272
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,800
Everything is gonna be alright.

273
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,960
No, Leonard, not tonight.

274
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Good night.

275
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,000
And these lights come on
when they want to.

276
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,320
And every time we turn on more
than one dryer, zap.

277
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
Everything goes down.

278
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
It's no wonder.

279
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,280
With the electrical service
of this building

280
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,800
you'd be lucky to light up
a family of gnats.

281
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
Where did you say the fuse box was?

282
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,920
In the basement.
Down the hall to the right.

283
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
I'll show you.

284
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,280
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Oh. Well. I need a haircut.

285
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,760
- Shampoo and haircut?
- What do you think?

286
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,960
I think you look great,
but if you insist... follow me.

287
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,200
- Have a seat. Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

288
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,960
- Right here?
- Yes.

289
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,880
So... Lizzie can help you.
Can you?

290
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Of course.

291
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,880
I'll prep the patient for you.

292
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
Miss Munro, you need a subpanel.

293
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,920
Gotta get those circuits outta
the basement. Fire code.

294
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,960
Alright. Yes. You'll get me a bid asap?

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,800
- Tomorrow.
- Brilliant.

296
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Have a good one.

297
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,840
- Hi. I'm Lizzie.
- I'm Warren.

298
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,320
- So... what do we want today?
- Haircut?

299
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
- Shampoo?
- Great.

300
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Brilliant. Right this way.

301
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,000
Right here.

302
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,160
- Comfortable?
- This is great.

303
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,880
- Sorry, ma'am, we're closed!
- Bernie, let me in.

304
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,920
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. I want to show you
something. You're just in time!

305
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,040
Those bags I bought in Vicksburg
just arrived.

306
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,120
Beaded. Beautiful. Bendel's. Circa
1920. I'll let it go for ninety bucks.

307
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,640
- What would I do with a beaded bag?
- You never know.

308
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,760
Listen, Bernie. Do you know about this?

309
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,520
- What is it?
- A letter from the Township.

310
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,240
There's probably one just like it
in that pile of unopened mail.

311
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
I just got home last night,
for God's sake!

312
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,840
I've barely had enough time
to brush my teeth.

313
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,280
Open it.

314
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,440
I-95 was a freak show. Pileup.
Spotsylvania.

315
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
Ten cars and a tractor trailer.

316
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,080
I mean, what part of "slow down"
do people not understand?

317
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,720
- Oh my God.
- Read on.

318
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,280
- No way.
- Yes.

319
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,600
We're all going to be swept up
into a giant dustpan

320
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
and dumped God knows where.

321
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,960
- All of us?
- The whole neighborhood.

322
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,520
What can we do?

323
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,480
I haven't thought that far.
I wanted to talk to you first.

324
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,720
- There's not that many old timers left.
- Old timer. How kind.

325
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,680
- We could hire an attorney, I suppose.
- Attorney? Is it that serious?

326
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,800
If we don't sell, they'll take!

327
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
Liz, I just refinanced this place.

328
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
I can barely afford the mortgage,
much less pay a fortune to some lawyer.

329
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Like, hello? What's your hourly?
Three hundred. Perfect!

330
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Can you help us? Maybe yes, maybe no.
We lose. Broke again.

331
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,080
Bank takes the building. Precious
antiques out on the street.

332
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,480
Roll end credits. I mean, thank God
for Robert's Air Force pension.

333
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,800
What are you doing?
You can't sit there.

334
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,880
- Please, Bernie. Try to focus.
- I'm sorry.

335
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,440
It's just that it's mid-century.
Mint condition.

336
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,440
I have a buyer in mind.
Gorgeous man. About fifty.

337
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,640
- Tall. Graying. But... married.
- You're not exactly single.

338
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,200
True... but a man can dream,
can't he?

339
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
- Bernie. Tell me one thing.
- Anything.

340
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,400
- Will you sell out to these bastards?
- What do I look like? A wuss?

341
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
- Hello.
- Hey.

342
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,600
You're forty minutes late. I was
about to go give up and go to sleep.

343
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm sorry. Something came up.

344
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm sorry about the other night, Len.
I'm just...

345
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,920
I know.

346
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,560
- You know?
- Yes, darling. I know.

347
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Sometimes you get impatient with me
and my circumstances.

348
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,600
But at the same time,
we gotta keep our eye on the ball.

349
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,920
We're a perfect match, Lizzie.
Physically, intellectually...

350
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,360
...spiritually.
You know it and I know it.

351
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,400
It's all about timing.
We've got to be patient.

352
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,960
We gonna be together.
Soon.

353
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,040
Len. I'm worried about Old Town.

354
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,080
Well, you know, we'll deal with that
when the time is right.

355
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
We've got to figure out
how to derail this thing straight away.

356
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,520
We need to make sure
everybody in Old Town knows about it

357
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,640
and is ready to fight.

358
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,280
You're with me on this, right, Len?

359
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,520
- The dog's getting a chill.
- Leonard.

360
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Hey, come in for breakfast
and I'll make you a Denver omelette.

361
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,320
- Good night.
- Night.

362
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,520
I'm liking this color quite a bit.

363
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,960
It's good. Sempre giovane.
Makes me look young.

364
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,880
But you are young, Mrs. Provenzano.
You look a lot younger than your nephew.

365
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,240
The poor thing. It's the weight.

366
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,120
It wouldn't kill Tiny to miss a meal
every once in a while.

367
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
- I've got a bone to pick with that man.
- A bone.

368
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,280
Word on the street is
that the town council is hooked up

369
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,080
with some big-time developer.

370
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
Now they're telling us we all
have to sell up or be condemned.

371
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,480
- All of us. Macintosh's, Bernie's...
- Len's Coffee Shop...

372
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,720
Len's...

373
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Damiano's Drugs.

374
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,160
Dear old man Sivney
and his hardware store.

375
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Tiny's leading the charge.

376
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,640
From Bedford Falls to Downtown
Disney in one swell foop.

377
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,360
And they'll give you pennies
on the dollar. Right, Lizzie?

378
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,600
- I think that's how it works.
- Honey, that doesn't seem right.

379
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,600
Well, you might ask Tiny about it.

380
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,880
I tried to talk to him,
but he's dead keen on this project.

381
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,640
He gave me the brush off.

382
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,080
No, that can't be right.
Let me tell you.

383
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,240
I happen to know that Tiny's had his eye
on some of these old buildings

384
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,640
for a long time. He loves 'em.
He wants to fix'em up.

385
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,680
Between you and me,
Tiny's been biding his sweet time,

386
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,280
waiting for the older guys
to retire and sell up.

387
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
Is that so?

388
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,880
What do you got there about
"Sufficiency of Evidence"?

389
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,000
It says here... "a court confronted
with a plausible accusation

390
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,520
of impermissible favoritism
to private parties should conduct..."

391
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Got that?

392
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,360
..."a careful and extensive inquiry
into whether, in fact,

393
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,080
the development plan chronology is
of primary benefit to the developer...

394
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,840
...and private businesses which
may eventually locate in the plan area,

395
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,240
and in that regard, only of incidental
benefit to the city ..."

396
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,320
- Exhausting!
- Crikey.

397
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,040
Incidental benefit? What does it mean?

398
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,040
We're screwed?

399
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
Let me look at that.

400
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Hey, you know who built our library?

401
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,320
- No. Roosevelt?
- Andrew Carnegie.

402
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,760
- As in Judy?
- Judy Carnegie?

403
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,440
Judy at Carnegie. Hall, that is.

404
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,560
- Yeah, exactly.
- How fabulous.

405
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,600
He was the richest man in the world
back in the eighteen-hundreds.

406
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,480
Born in Scotland.

407
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
A stone's throw from my own hometown.
He came to America as a boy.

408
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,440
What in God's name was he doing
in Manningtree?

409
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,800
Oh, I don't think he ever set foot
in Manningtree.

410
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,440
Pittsburgh is where he ended up.
He made a fortune in steel and coal.

411
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Billions. And when he got old,
he gave it all back.

412
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,800
- To who?
- To us, dear. To the people.

413
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,880
So Mr. Carnegie built
the Manningtree Library.

414
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,080
Manningtree and a few thousand others
in the States and all over the world.

415
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,480
He was a true Scotsman, Bernie. He had
faith in the power of everyday people.

416
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,240
That sounds like my Aunt Minnie.
She was a communist.

417
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,760
Before she died, she wrote
"Marxism for Dummies".

418
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,440
Died in her penthouse
on the upper east side.

419
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,160
I wish I could have a cigarette.
Ash?

420
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,440
- You're on your own.
- Suit yourself.

421
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,560
Tim and me. We've given it up. Big
tobacco's not gonna run our lives.

422
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,760
- A principled decision, eh?
- Tim's a political science major.

423
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,040
Of course.

424
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,680
- He's got a job at Town Hall.
- Does he?

425
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,600
Maintenance man.

426
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,360
Well, good.

427
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,720
So, is it serious between you two?

428
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,120
You mean birth control serious
or wedding serious?

429
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,120
- Well, I suppose I mean marriage.
- No. We're good. We're tight.

430
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,800
- We're just not in the box yet.
- I see.

431
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,600
I mean, it's not like
it's a hook-up or anything.

432
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,560
- Hook-ups suck. Especially for chicks.
- How d'you mean?

433
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,720
You know, right? There's like
what you want, okay?

434
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,520
"Love me, love me,
you're hot, pay attention to me."

435
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,560
You'll do anything to get nothing.
That's a hook-up.

436
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,320
Then there's, "Hey, I'm important,
I'm gonna pay attention to me,

437
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,640
and by the way dude, who said
you could drink my last beer?"

438
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,480
That's when you're ready for true love.

439
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
Nice!

440
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,120
We aim to please.

441
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,920
Holy toledo. Gettin' that fuse box
out of the basement was a slog.

442
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Hey, C.J.'s here. Do you mind if I go?

443
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,360
I don't have any clients
until tomorrow at two.

444
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,200
No. Go ahead.

445
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,440
- A bientot!
- So long, Jacks.

446
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,480
- Hello, Leonard. How are things?
- Lizzie. Lizzie Munro. How's by you?

447
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,920
- Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- No, no. Just talking.

448
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,320
Restaurant business talk.
Trying to... boost the bottom line.

449
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,120
Recession proofed the...
thing.

450
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,680
That's what it's all about
in a low-margin business.

451
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,160
Indeed. Well, I wondered if you
were free to... Macintosh's happy hour.

452
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,560
Thought you might want to join me
and a few friends... a quick drink.

453
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,000
Chat about... local commerce.

454
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,480
Why, sure. Tell you what.
I'll meet you there in... five?

455
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,320
- Five's good. Take ten if you need it.
- Ten it is!

456
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,400
- Save me a cocktail banger!
- Will do.

457
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,720
- You Scots are a morose bunch.
- Not ordinarily.

458
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,840
- Then what? Sentimental?
- Ordinarily? Defiant.

459
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,240
- Tonight? Disappointed.
- In me?

460
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,480
In me.

461
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,680
Please, Lizzie. This thing is bigger
than the both of us.

462
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,240
We... we got caught in the undertow.

463
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,000
Please, Leonard. Stop before you say
something you truly mean.

464
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,400
Look at me, Leonard. Look at where I am.

465
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,160
The Paisley Set?

466
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,440
Yes, Leonard. I parked in front
of my building.

467
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,520
And I cannot seem to get you interested
in helping me save this building.

468
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
Or Old Town. Or your own backside.

469
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,640
Len, I need you.

470
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
We can talk about all this
at the culinary trade show.

471
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,200
No, Leonard.
There will be no trade show.

472
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,200
But... I made reservations.
Orlando. The Radisson.

473
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,960
Pina Coladas by the pool.
It'll be like it used to be.

474
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,920
What's happened to you?

475
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,360
As you can see in this slide,
our timeline is aggressive...

476
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,080
but achievable.

477
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,120
Eighteen months from city
entitlements to vesting.

478
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,560
Cortona. Physically possible,
financially feasible,

479
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,040
maximally productive...
legally allowable.

480
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,040
The highest and best use.

481
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,000
Warren, can you talk to us about
our exposure?

482
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,400
Minimal.

483
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,680
Once our concrete is in the ground,

484
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,120
in other words, once we're vested,
we can't be touched.

485
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,840
What about the opposition?

486
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,720
It's simple. We can hit them
with a SLAPP suit.

487
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,440
Strategic Lawsuit Against
Public Participation.

488
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,880
It's best way to deal
with any insurgency.

489
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,000
Philip. These are mom and pop
operations.

490
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,040
They can't afford to lawyer up
in any meaningful fashion.

491
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,960
Besides, what we don't already own,
our friends do.

492
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,120
Holy shit! This place is a maze!

493
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,600
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to introduce Mayor Anthony Provenzano.

494
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,680
You must be the money guys.
How are you?

495
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,600
This ends the study session to consider
the pending development agreement

496
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,080
with North Sea Assets, S.A.

497
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,880
The next regular meeting is set
for July 25th.

498
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,560
I will circulate the agenda, Mister Mayor.

499
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,720
Right. We done.
Are we done?

500
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,040
- Are we adjourned, Mister Mayor?
- Yeah, sure.

501
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
Then gavel us out of here, please.
I have things to do.

502
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,000
I second that motion.

503
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,920
My sitter bails in 15 minutes.
I've got to go.

504
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,880
Adjourned.

505
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,600
So... is this your new hobby?

506
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,640
Well, Tiny, I've lived here for 20 years
and have never once dropped in

507
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,080
to see what all the excitement was about.
Town Council is really inspiring.

508
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,400
- Inspiring?
- Yes, indeed.

509
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,880
The back and forth.
The parliamentary procedure.

510
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,160
Fascinating. I've really missed out.

511
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,240
You know, I think it's so important
to have an understanding

512
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,120
of how things work
in these United States.

513
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,120
Things? What things?

514
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,240
The People's business.
Democracy in action. I'm enthralled.

515
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,600
As a matter of fact, I might bring
my chums the next time.

516
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,360
- What's that woman up to?
- No good, Nate. No damn good.

517
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,360
Tiny, my man.

518
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,080
I'm on my way to a meeting.
How may I be of service?

519
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,240
Lizzie Munro? A minor obstacle.
I'm already taken care of it.

520
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,640
Well, my people have a saying, Tony:
all cats are gray in the dark.

521
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,640
Mister Hottie has returned.

522
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,040
Back for more?

523
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,400
- Warren, is it?
- Good memory.

524
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm good with faces.
What can we do for you?

525
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,800
- Just a trim. I like to keep it neat.
- I can fit you in.

526
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,000
Congratulations, Mr. French.

527
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,480
Back at ya! And your wonderful
company, too.

528
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,000
- What a winning bunch of folks.
- You're the real winner, Mr. French.

529
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,480
So...

530
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,920
You given any thought to what you
want to do with the old place?

531
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,680
Oh, I don't know. Hire a wrecking ball?

532
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,440
- Is it going to be cash or check?
- We're lucky. I have cash.

533
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,640
- We're lucky indeed. That'll be thirty.
- Perfect.

534
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,400
Tell me Warren... shall I make out
a file card for you?

535
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,080
How can I say no?

536
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm sorry for being so bold.

537
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,280
Would you consider having dinner
with me tomorrow night?

538
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
Yes. I would give that
serious consideration.

539
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,080
That's my cell.

540
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,280
Great.

541
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,400
- Dude, that never happens!
- Not to me, it doesn't.

542
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Thank you.

543
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,480
We'll have the Dutton Goldfield
Pinot, please.

544
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,960
So. You're looking for real estate
in Manningtree?

545
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Yeah. But I'm taking my time.

546
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,360
My consulting practice gives me
that luxury.

547
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,920
What do you consult on?

548
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,360
A little of this and a little
of that. Urban planning, mostly.

549
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,600
Town planning?

550
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,880
Nowadays they call it urban planning.
Sort of a semantic thing. Towns are...

551
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,800
- ... disappearing.
- Evolving.

552
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,400
I've never really understood
what consultants do.

553
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,280
- It's sort of a broad term.
- A catch-all, is it?

554
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Well, let's see. I help make things
happen for a variety of concerns

555
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,640
on a variety of fronts.

556
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,080
My consulting practice allows me
to set my own schedule,

557
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,200
vacation when and where I want.

558
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,400
I have a house on the Dalmatian Coast.

559
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,040
That is, when my Blackberry lets me
out of the cage.

560
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,880
But I'm more interested
in what you do.

561
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,600
What I do?

562
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,640
I cut, color, and style hair.
It's pretty simple.

563
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,280
- They say simplicity is happiness.
- Oh, well, happiness is another matter.

564
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,960
I go to work to forget
the complications in my life.

565
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,720
Please. Let the lady.

566
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
That's very nice.

567
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,280
So, tell me about these complications.

568
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,760
You know how... if you don't keep
your hair trimmed, you get split ends.

569
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,920
Wee things going this way and that.
It's a mess.

570
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,120
So, you get your shears,
you trim off the ends,

571
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,080
and your hair looks healthy again.

572
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,760
It takes on a new shape.
Well, that applies to life.

573
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,400
Life has little complications
going this way and that,

574
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,560
not leading anywhere.
You gotta get rid of 'em.

575
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,080
Then your life has a new shape.
That's my philosophy, anyway.

576
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,280
At this time in my life, Warren,
my shears are in my hand.

577
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,000
You and your scissors don't scare me.

578
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,400
You'll see in your packets that
we've arrived at purchase agreements

579
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,040
with a substantial number
of Old Town property owners.

580
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,680
Stan Singleton... Dennis Howe...
Andrew Macintosh, Leonard French.

581
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,360
- Len's Cafe is going away?
- Good riddance.

582
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,920
I assume he'll be relocating to Route 22.

583
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,400
- Where he belongs.
- What's wrong with Route 22?

584
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,840
Len French drove a hard bargain.

585
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,680
He's landed a 600 square foot space
in the new project.

586
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,400
An upscale little coffee place.
A real sweetheart lease.

587
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,600
Whattya know.
The guy's got some gonads.

588
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,760
North Sea is currently working with
Amuelson's Leather Goods,

589
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,160
and having a look
at the Paisley Set property...

590
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,200
- What 'bout Bernie Depper?
- And Bernie Depper.

591
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,000
Bernie's Antiques.

592
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,680
I don't need to tell you, these are
ongoing and sensitive negotiations.

593
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,520
All that remains is the certification
of the environmental impact report.

594
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,560
That's the bound document in your packet.

595
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,120
- So, we vote on this?
- Correct.

596
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,160
I think we have the votes now.

597
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,720
- I say go for it.
- Then let's get this show on the road.

598
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,120
Not so fast. It has to be approved
in a public meeting.

599
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,880
- With two weeks' notice.
- Come on, fellas.

600
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
- That's what the town charter says.
- He's right, Tiny. Two weeks' notice.

601
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,680
I'm having my gall bladder out
in two weeks.

602
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,520
No, you're not.
Bonnie! Post that notice!

603
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,640
Are we done yet? I've got lunch plans.

604
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,960
I move to adjourn.

605
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,360
Do I hear a second?
Hell. I'll second it myself.

606
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,880
All in favor?

607
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,880
Opposed?
Ayes have it. Adjourned.

608
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,000
Let's go eat.

609
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,920
- How did it go?
- I think you have a project.

610
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,800
Your usually scungigli salad,
mister Mayor.

611
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,920
Thank you.

612
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,560
No bread for me, please.
I'm on Atkins.

613
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,480
Atkins is dead. He fell down.

614
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
Smack. Right in the middle
of Manhattan. Some diet.

615
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,240
It's working for me. No more bat
wings under here.

616
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,000
I look better
than I did twenty years ago.

617
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,320
- I like the color.
- What?

618
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,240
The color of your hair.
It's a lot less...

619
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,880
Johnny Cash.

620
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,960
It's my hair stylist. Lizzie Munro.
In Manningtree. She does good.

621
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,920
- You know her?
- Yeah, I know her.

622
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,720
She said you gave her
the cold shoulder.

623
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,080
- Did you? Give her the cold shoulder?
- What is this, the third degree?

624
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,320
I promised your mother on the day
she died that I'd look after you.

625
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,840
Make sure you went to mass.
Make sure your hair was combed.

626
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,320
But you're a man now.

627
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,640
- I try to stay out of your business.
- Good idea.

628
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,360
So I was surprised when Lizzie
told me about this Disneyland thing.

629
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
And how you brushed her off.

630
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,320
Disneyland.
What are you talking about?

631
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
The big, crazy shopping mall.

632
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,960
Now wait a minute. If you're talking
about Cortona,

633
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,000
that's a beautiful plan.

634
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,360
- Beautiful condos, stores, restaurants.
- In Old Town?

635
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,200
Yeah. But I don't wanna discuss it.
I just wanna eat.

636
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,560
I don't get you, Anthony. Didn't
you tell me you were gonna pick up

637
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,680
some of those buildings
while the market was not so good?

638
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,360
Fix 'em up?

639
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,920
Isn't that you told me at Carla
Pezzimenti's daughter's confirmation?

640
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,160
- I do not recall.
- Gavone.

641
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,120
There's nothing quite like
the Manhattan skyline.

642
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,840
They say that architecture
is frozen music.

643
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,720
Some architecture.

644
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,680
It embodies every aspiration,
everything powerful about this country.

645
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,560
I don't know. Sometimes I think
it looks like a graveyard,

646
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,280
with the stones pointing up
out of the ground.

647
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,920
Am I bit dark?

648
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,920
Not at all. A bit poetic, maybe.

649
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,560
Do you know Sir Noel Paton?

650
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,480
He was a painter. Scottish.
I studied him at university.

651
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,000
He also wrote poetry. He had the most
fantastic sense of the visual.

652
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,440
The plaided ghosts of buried centuries

653
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,480
Were mustering in the glen
with bow and spear.

654
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,840
And shadowy hounds to hunt
the shadowy deer

655
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,160
Mix in phantasmal sword-play,

656
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,520
or, with eyes of wrath and pain
immortal, wander o'er

657
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,720
Loved scenes where human footstep
comes no more.

658
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,360
- You're the poetic one, Warren.
- You bring it out of me.

659
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,000
Hello, sir.

660
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,480
- Heading home?
- Oh, yeah. It's American Idol night.

661
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,440
Good night, Mr. Berry.

662
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,320
Tim. When you're done here,
you have to get to those floors.

663
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah. Okay.

664
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,160
- It's like a dry lake bed in there.
- Gotcha.

665
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,680
- I mean perceivable dirt.
- No problem, Mr. Berry.

666
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,960
Good. Good.

667
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,760
I would have loved to see this mill
when it was up and running.

668
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,600
It must've been grand.

669
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,080
The water turning the enormous wheel.

670
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,720
The yarns all coming together
on the loom. The warp and weft.

671
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,120
Dead marvelous.
Electricity reared its ugly head

672
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,720
and put this old beauty
out of business.

673
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,280
That's progress, Lizzie.

674
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,320
Did you know my grandparents
were Scottish?

675
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,560
- Liar.
- Dundee.

676
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,280
Now you're pulling my leg, Mr. Brown.

677
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,000
I learned about progress from them.
About Scotland.

678
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,480
How it was the birthplace
of modern physics and chemistry.

679
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,080
James Dewar. Charles Macintosh.
Thomas Graham.

680
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,280
Those were my heroes growing up.

681
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,680
Progress is a good thing, Lizzie.

682
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,960
You're nearly perfect, aren't ya?

683
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,080
- What've we got here?
- What does it look like?

684
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,400
- Uisge beatha.
- Right you are.

685
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,280
To better living through chemistry.

686
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,200
Scottish chemistry.

687
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,760
Slainte.

688
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,440
- Tell me, did someone die?
- The guy just sold up.

689
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,520
So what does this mean?

690
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,680
It means that the North Sea Assets
project will be a done deal.

691
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,000
I will not sell.

692
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,480
Then the bulldozers will come
roaring down the street.

693
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,280
Either way, you lose.

694
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,560
Why can't you face reality? Take
the money they offer you and go.

695
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,040
Surrender? Never!

696
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,640
Jesus. Whose side are you on, Mehar?

697
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,920
- I'm on the side of progress.
- Sometimes progress blows, dude.

698
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,440
Do you want to go work for ultra cuts?
Because I don't!

699
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,120
Do you think we need another strip mall
in town?

700
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,240
- I don't want to live in MacManningtree.
- So? Whose side are you on?

701
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,160
This one's nice, honey. Hon?

702
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,760
I don't know.
This one's pretty good, Lenny.

703
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,040
You can go really soft...

704
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,480
or pretty darn firm.

705
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,960
I don't know, Dee. Those are
expensive little units.

706
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,720
Oh, come on, now.
It'll last forever, honey.

707
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,800
It'll be the last mattress
we ever own.

708
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,000
Don't be penny-wise and pound foolish.

709
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Besides, we have got some
extra cash in the bank now.

710
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,480
We can get the pillow tops
for the kids

711
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,680
and treat ourselves
to something really special.

712
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,440
Think about your bad back. And you know,
everything comes ready to go.

713
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,920
Fitted and flat sheets, two pillow
cases apiece. Are you listening?

714
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,920
Isn't that Lizzie Munro?

715
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,200
- I'm looking for the Mayor.
- Well, he's not here right now.

716
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,640
Thank you, Connie.
These look delicious.

717
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,160
You like 'em?

718
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,600
I have a little old man
up in Hoboken who makes 'em special.

719
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,400
He does all my baking
for events and stuff.

720
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,480
Altar society, bridge club.

721
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,440
I shouldn't.
For my sins.

722
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,800
I asked you to come here
for a reason, Lizzie.

723
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:04,120
My beloved nephew, Tiny Provenzano,
is no friend of yours.

724
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,560
Well, he's on the wrong side
of the Old Town fight.

725
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,440
- No, no, no. He is your enemy.
- My enemy? Now that's a bit dramatic.

726
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,040
He is in bed with the developer.
North Star.

727
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,760
North Sea.

728
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,360
North Sea. Tiny has been making offers
on buildings up and down Main Street.

729
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,920
He is throwing money around
like an intoxicated sailor.

730
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,640
But, Connie, how could Tiny afford
that? He has one mattress store.

731
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Cheap money, Lizzie.

732
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,760
Cheap money and bribes from North Sea
in exchange for Tiny's influence.

733
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,600
Tiny is going to make millions
from ground leases and tax incentives

734
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,600
from his piece of the project.

735
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,880
You don't look well, honey.
Have a bite of your "canolli".

736
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,400
What do you say we double on this hole?
Make it 200?

737
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,080
That makes it 200, right?

738
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,720
- Nice shot.
- See what you've got, Tiny.

739
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,160
Warren, darling. It's Lizzie.
I need your consulting expertise.

740
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,720
Call me as soon as you get this.
Alright? Bye.

741
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,760
You think three?

742
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,200
We got all day.

743
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,160
Let's go.

744
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,480
Bollocks.

745
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,760
Hello, Mr. Brown.

746
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,800
- Dennis, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

747
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,240
I'm dreamin'.

748
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,280
- How's your new baby?
- Very good, thanks.

749
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,600
That's great.

750
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,480
Holy shit.

751
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,560
- Bastard.
- Men are beasts. We should know.

752
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,440
What an idiot I am!

753
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,760
That's the trouble with this world.
No loyalty. No honesty.

754
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,080
And honor's out the window.

755
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,280
- What a fool I've been.
- We're behind you, whatever you do.

756
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,240
Don't worry, Lizzie.

757
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm afraid we're beat before we've
even had a chance to get started, Dad.

758
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,120
I may have to give this place up.

759
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,200
But damn it, I know I should fight.

760
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,880
- Give 'em hell, girlie!
- Aye, I'll give 'em more than that!

761
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Tell them I have something to say.

762
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,560
Hey, everybody, listen up!
Lizzie's got something to say!

763
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,440
Hello Manningtree!

764
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,440
I want to thank you for coming out
on a Monday night.

765
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:46,160
I hope the bartender has treated you well
and you've all had something to eat.

766
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,360
The drinks are on me tonight.

767
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,480
Tomorrow, the fate of our dear
little town will be decided.

768
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,360
Will we be buried by developers
and politicians, bought and paid for?

769
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,480
No!

770
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,440
Or will we let them know
what we think of their silly Cortona?

771
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,680
Are ye ready to fight?

772
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,920
Then I'll see you at Town Hall.
Bring everyone you know.

773
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,480
Bring your wee bairn and your granny
if you have to. Just show up.

774
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,080
Here's tae ye!

775
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,560
- Just a wee trim, Jacks.
- Trim it is.

776
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,400
This man has no shame.

777
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,480
Go away, Warren. As far as ye can get.

778
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,160
Just open the door.

779
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,800
I've welcomed my last walk-in,
Mister Brown.

780
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,440
My services are available
by appointment only.

781
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,200
Now you slither on home to Fifth Avenue
and leave us alone.

782
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,320
Listen. I was just trying to help you
come to terms with the inevitable.

783
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,760
The inevitable? Is that what they
call a roll in the hay?

784
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,400
I was fallin' in love with you,
Warren.

785
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,800
You and your Scottish grandparents.

786
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,600
And your Gaelic and your poetry.

787
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,040
But it's all just a lot of bollocks,
isn't it?

788
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,880
You're wrong.

789
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,840
Up your kilt with a banger!

790
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,800
Can I see one of those, please?

791
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,440
Excuse me.

792
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,120
- Good work, lassies.
- My God!

793
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,280
- Dude. We should run for President.
- We should.

794
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,640
Ladies and gentlemen, after you.

795
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,600
All right, all right. Council will
convene in five minutes.

796
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,720
Oh, my God!

797
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,400
All raise for the pledge of allegiance.

798
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,360
I pledge Allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

799
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,840
and to the Republic for which it stands,

800
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,640
one nation under God, indivisible,

801
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,760
with Liberty and Justice for all.

802
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,080
Bonnie, first item please.

803
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,640
Item 1-A. Appreciation of Ruth McDuff

804
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,760

of the Senior Citizens Forum.

805
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:49,800
Item 1-B. Proclamation recognition
of international mail carrier's day.

806
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,600
Item 2-A.

807
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,000
Approval of sanitation department
budget increase.

808
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,640
Item 3-A. Budget increase
for town council trip to Yokohama.

809
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,720

810
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:25,120

811
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,400

01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,760
Order!

813
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,440
Order!

814
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,240
First speaker... Martha Ruth.

815
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,440
I want this town to be for my son
the way I grew up here.

816
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,640
Thumbs down on Cortona.

817
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,560
For the sake of our children
and our future just say "no" to Cortona.

818
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,120
Remember. We voted you in,
we can vote you out.

819
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,480
Mayor is a disgrace,
he ought to be ashamed...

820
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,680
My father owned a motorcycle shop
here for 10 years.

821
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,040
We want to keep it that way.

822
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,000
This is our town...
And we're not going to let you take it.

823
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,360
Worst thing that ever happend
to this town. We have to stop it.

824
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,000
All of us. We have to stop it.

825
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,120
A lot of projects are bad
for Manningtree, New Jersey and US.

826
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,040
And who is this town belong to anyway?
It belongs to us, all of us.

827
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,080
- We, the people, say "no" to Cortona.
-I don't want to live in MacManningtree.

828
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,440
Stop this...

829
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,200
I will fight so that Cortona
will never happen here.

830
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,640
This is for the people. All the people.

831
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,160
Besides, I need a place
to get my hair done.

832
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,400
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
You can't play with people's lives.

833
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,320
I think it should stay
just the way it is.

834
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,720
That's the kind of place
I want my kids to grow up.

835
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,360
The last speaker...
Lizzie Munro.

836
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,960
Mister Mayor.

837
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,120
Members of Town Council.

838
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,720
My name is Elizabeth Munro.

839
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,000
Most of you know that. I work
and live here in Manningtree.

840
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,160
You probably know that, too.

841
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,920
I guess you can tell I'm from Scotland,
if you don't know me already.

842
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,800
We Scots have a long and proud history
in America.

843
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,800
We signed
your Declaration of Independence,

844
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,640
we lived in your White House
more than a few times.

845
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,640
We invented your telephone.
We're Lucille Ball and Jimmy Stewart.

846
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,600
Ulysses S. Grant, Davy Crockett
and Neil Armstrong.

847
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,720
We're even Jackson Pollock,
for God's sake.

848
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,720
So it's important to me
to live to up to all that. Ya ken?

849
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,960
We're not here for a history lesson,
Ms. Munro.

850
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,120
Right.

851
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,240
In my home town in Scotland,
William Wallace, Braveheart,

852
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,200
stood his ground against the English
on Stirling Bridge.

853
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,200
Against the insurmountable odds

854
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,440
he and his people
routed English invaders that day.

855
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,440
That was September 11.
In the year 1297.

856
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,080
And like you,
we Scots have a long memory.

857
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,360
But I'm sad to say that some Scotsmen
have forgotten who they are

858
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,920
and where they come from.

859
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,520
And when you pledge allegiance
to the almighty dollar, or euro,

860
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,120
or whatever you have in your pocket,

861
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,120
you've lost your citizenship
in the human race.

862
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,560
- Get to the point, please.
- That is the point, Tiny.

863
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,080
For chrissake, Aunt Connie.
Can you let me do my thing here?

864
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,240
A town... this town... is a place
to live, and work,

865
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,520
and raise your family.

866
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,840
But a town is not an amusement park.
Not a chain store.

867
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,200
It's not a bloody ATM machine
for developers and city officials.

868
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,400
- Time's up.
- I'm not finished.

869
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,280
You are finished.

870
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,200
Could we get the police here
to clear the room?

871
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,600
Point of order, Mr. Mayor.
We don't have a police department.

872
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,240
Bonnie, call the roll.

873
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,640
Bonnie, are you deaf? Call the roll!

874
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,040
Item 8-F. Certification
of the environmental impact report.

875
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,480
You cannae vote until the people
have been heard!

876
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,600
For God's sake, Bonnie,
will you call the roll here?

877
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,760
Mayor Provenzano. Let me finish.

878
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,080
Ms. Munro. I am the chairman
of this Town Council.

879
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,200
And when I say your testimony is over,
your testimony is over.

880
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,080
Mister Mayor!
What about our bloody constitution?

881
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,320
- Excuse me?
- Well, what about it?

882
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,160
You have to let her speak. She has
waited for nearly six hours.

883
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,400
This is a public hearing.

884
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,160
Don't be a silly man.

885
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,640
Bonnie, cut to the chase here,
call the roll.

886
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,400
The question is before the Council.
All those in favor...

887
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,200
No.

888
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,520
All those in favor...

889
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,200
No!

890
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,680
The applicant withdraws!

891
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
Excuse me!
You can't do that!

892
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,720
- You can't do that!
- I just did.

893
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,160
God bless America.

894
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,040
- Hey.
- Hey, Jacks.

895
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,880
Dude. Your ten o'clock cancelled.

896
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,280
Really? She told me she was eloping
tonight.

897
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,920
- It's off.
- Bummer.

898
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,120
Lizzie,
may I have a word with you please?

899
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,560
A small token of my esteem.
Take it.

900
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,320
Hang tough, Miss Braveheart.

901
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,920
Alba gu bra!

902
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,720
Scotland forever.
