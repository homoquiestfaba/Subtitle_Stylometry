SISKIYOU COUNTY,
CALIFORNIA,

00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,436
913 have been reported
Bigfoot Sightings

00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:41,816
In 25 years, more than any
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

4
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,988
In August 2009,
A DOCUMENTALIST

5
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,490
He went to investigate
THE alleged sightings.

6
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:52,160
MAY 13, 2009

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,369
OPERATOR:

8
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,247
MAN:

9
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,457
Walking walking here.

10
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,001
A person, animal or? ...
Eleven
00: 00: 59.126 -> 00: 01: 01.919
I DO NOT KNOW. Just know that LIT
MY LIGHT SENSOR

12
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:03,296
And I could see

13
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,131
SOMETHING RUNNING
FOR THE GARDEN,

14
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,800
A MAN HIGH OR SOMETHING
LOOKS LIKE A MAN.
Fifteen
00: 01: 07.925 -> 00: 01: 11,095
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS,
JUST CROSSING THE GARDEN.

16
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:13,139
HEAVEN HOLY BETTER BURNING

17
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,933
HELLO?

18
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,602
Send someone!

19
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:18,685
WHAT'S UP?

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,147
The bastard
It is more than 2 meters.

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,440
You see now, sir?

22
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:23,691
Yes, I am seeing.
2. 3
00: 01: 23,816 -> 00: 01: 24,816
JUST A MOMENT.

24
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,901
It's here ...

25
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,446
- ARE YOU IN YOUR GARDEN?
- YES. HEAVENS IS HUGE!

26
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:29,947
What does the in your garden?

27
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,324
She's staring at me!

28
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,960
The following sequences
They were found in 2012.

29
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,055
Say hello to the camera.

30
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,060
TEA HOUSE
MALIBU MOON

31
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:08,319
This is my home,
whose comfort will leave

32
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:11,155
filming my documentary
about Bigfoot.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,033
- Have you washed it?
- Yes.
3. 4
00: 02: 14.158 -> 00: 02: 16.619
What a lovely couple.
How are you?

35
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,787
Good.

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,789
So happy that Santa Claus
We have jealousy.

37
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,127
Missing two weeks for the journey.
How are they?

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,586
- We're fine.
- Good.

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,796
In fact, very good.

40
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,757
My plan is to place the emergency call
of this man,

41
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,009
try to interview
to him and to the people,

42
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,137
and then we'll see what happens.

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,347
So-Good ...

44
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,475
to contact you called
Emergency
4. 5
00: 02: 38.559 -> 00: 02: 42.688
you'd have to get someone
I told you who he is.

46
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:48,067
And then, if he told you where to go,

47
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,652
then you acampar?as.

48
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,237
Would you like women?

49
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,989
But you are not going to use as bait.

50
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,824
Do not worry.

51
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,451
I promise you will ...

52
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:59,787
Whatever you need.
I want the film to be authentic

53
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,790
and real. So if you need
she stand there ...

54
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,877
shaking "bonbons" or something,

55
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,172
it is within 100 °.
We are committed to.

56
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,340
- We will go.
- And we'll see.

57
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,467
- Yes.
- We see it ...

58
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,677
and running.

59
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,472
Siskiyou County,
where we will go,

60
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,849
they have seen
than anywhere else in the world.

61
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,225
The most recent report,

62
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,562
that says a Bigfoot
He attacked a dog,

63
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:29,360
It is the first aggressive sighting
known of Bigfoot.

64
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,362
So it's aggressive.

65
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,156
It is the first time that has passed
in the history of Bigfoot.

66
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,326
Usually they are pretty ... Boring.

67
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,827
They try to avoid
contact with humans,

68
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,954
just stay away,

69
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:45,166
but that's why I was intrigued,

70
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:48,044
I was thrilled
to want to do this.

71
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,504
I was not planning,

72
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,090
I was lucky with the sighting

73
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,341
I was that guy.

74
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:57,804
The most important folk legend
US is the Bigfoot.

75
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,056
It existed for over 200 years

76
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,643
and thousands of people around the world

77
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:04,769
They say they have seen.

78
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,688
I do not think that so many people
lying about it.

79
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,149
But no other name?

80
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,694
- Something like ...
- Sasquatch.

81
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,656
It is called Sasquatch in Canada,

82
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,741
Bigfoot in United States

83
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,494
and Europe is the Yeti

84
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,454
or Abominable Snowman.

85
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:24,832
- Then it's white.
- Yes, it is white.

86
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,292
Bigfoot is black
and Sasquatch is coffee.

87
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,877
Here we go to the race.

88
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,920
- Is not that.
- Racist.

89
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,755
- Let's make history.
- Yes.

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,465
- Remember that.
- History.

91
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,969
If you can shoot something ...

92
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,179
- And live.
- And live.

93
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:42,515
Just do not say that.
We will live.

94
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,018
But if you can film something so'd show
in the history books

95
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,563
and that would be sensational.

96
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,732
It is exciting
Why pursue.

97
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,775
- Yes Fabulous..
- I'm ready.

98
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:56,821
Then the camera
only we will follow.

99
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,197
L.A. AIRPORT

100
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,907
It is in good shape.

101
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,617
That does not sound good.

102
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:19,636
Does it bother me because
it's right in my face?

103
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,686
Thanks, Stephon.

104
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,275
My grandmother used them

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,860
when I was a kid,

106
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,695
He said to bring good luck.

107
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,657
Your grandmother used leagues?

108
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,746
My favorite color is black.

109
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,206
Have you always used ...?

110
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,874
There are superstitious people.

111
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,967
Read Information card

112
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,136
located in the pocket
the seat in front of you.

113
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:05,974
Be sure to turn the functions
your phone ...

114
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:07,434
- And Bluetooth-
- Enough.

115
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,311
They can not be used in flight.

116
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,568
We are super excited.
We just landed.

117
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:20,071
Not bad flight
on a plane La Bamba.

118
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:22,031
She happy to sleep on your back.

119
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,159
Yes. It's going to wake up
when we see Bigfoot ...

120
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:26,994
At about wine, to carry me.

121
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,789
Or we know to call,

122
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:32,208
who die I wait to see.

123
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,751
Sure, go ahead.

124
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,421
I'm very excited.
Let's get to the carousel.

125
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:42,510
We did this trip
to shoot the man.

126
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:45,723
It is the main reason
why we came,

127
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,475
and perhaps to give
a walk in the woods.

128
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:52,271
But as I said before was coming

129
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,356
and it turns out that this gentleman
He saw Big Foot,

130
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,191
so that will ...

131
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,860
it is a best documentary.

132
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,779
If you are not do the best you can,

133
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,783
but if it is I think I can
do something special, so ...

134
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,327
Uh ... How strange.

135
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,370
You do not have your cell phone service?

136
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:10,455
No.

137
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,582
Insurance?
Try again, maybe ...

138
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,667
What try again?

139
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,711
No, no service.

140
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,171
No service.

141
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,672
You have a bar?

142
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,466
- What company are you?
- Nothing.

143
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,259
Is that the statue?

144
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:25,470
- Damn, films that, man.
- Look.

145
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:29,265
I f?lmalo. You have to shoot it.

146
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,142
- Fuck.
- We got off?

147
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:33,437
Yes, Let's get off to film that.

148
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,147
Siskiyou County! We Arrived!

149
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,024
- Here we are.
- We did it.

150
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,901
Finally we are here!

151
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,986
Yes. You have to shake hands.

152
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,030
Shake hands
the Bigfoot himself.

153
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:46,658
Hi, Mom!

154
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,537
We are living our dreams
big.

155
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:53,457
I will ask marriage
eggs under Bigfoot.

156
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:55,542
- What do you want?
- Water.

157
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,252
Good. And you?

158
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:01,172
Whatever ... Something to eat.
Some dried meat.

159
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:03,341
- Good.
- I do not give jerky.

160
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:06,469
No more jerky.
A deodorant.

161
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,056
Why?
You do not like that smell?

162
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,349
No!

163
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,850
That stuff sucks.

164
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,352
It was an accident.

165
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,312
I suck, I'm tired of smell.

166
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,106
What is this town sucks.

167
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,233
Yes, I can not even ...

168
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,986
How are you? They got lost?

169
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,323
- No.
- Not at all.

170
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,033
What do you do with that camera?

171
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,703
Filming ...

172
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:32,246
It's a nice place.

173
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:33,872
Why not turn off?

174
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,207
It does not work.

175
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,751
Up windows, please.

176
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,340
Heaven. What happens to those people?

177
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,554
Yes, that was balls.

178
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,557
Very good.

179
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,517
Did you see his appearance?

180
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,601
What about your teeth?

181
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:57,353
The truth did not see his appearance,

182
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,690
because I could not see past
his black teeth.

183
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,193
They stared us to leave.

184
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,614
And they smelled as if they had not bathed
in 6 months or more.

185
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,199
- I'm not exaggerating.
- OMG!

186
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,537
And he is CREATING his shirt, yuck.

187
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,123
- Neither the look.
- Let's go.

188
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:35,851
CAMP
ARROYO OF MOOSE

189
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,021
Look, not even note
we approach.

190
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,481
I'll be surprised.

191
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,654
Friend, here are two.

192
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,033
That's great.

193
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:57,163
Well, this is
our charming cottage.

194
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,874
Plane will go.

195
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,587
You should not see,
because I am the future brother.

196
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,471
Are you sleeping again?

197
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,309
Shy!

198
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,895
Really?

199
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,271
It is dormid?sima.

200
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:23,607
It has been a long journey,
but we have to ...

201
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:27,361
go to town to walk,
maybe talk to some people.

202
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:30,447
I want to ask who is
the man called emergencies.

203
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:32,574
- Do me a favor.
- Which?

204
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,951
I know you will not,

205
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,911
but when interviewing people

206
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,247
We not insist on something
I can make them angry.

207
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,874
- I know you will not, but ...
- How am I going to insist?

208
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,168
I know you and I know you will say
"Big Foot".

209
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,088
"Have you seen Bigfoot?"
Maybe these people do not want ...

210
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:50,216
These people are very direct,
That's for sure.

211
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,388
Do you think something like
could exist in this area?

212
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:58,142
Well ... There ...

213
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:02,020
There are noises in the forest
not explained.

214
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:06,233
I ... I've heard them and heard
others talk about them.

215
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:11,780
Some of these noises ...
They are very rare.

216
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,659
You can not explain that ...

217
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,870
At least we
we can not explain,

218
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,498
and it is something that we live
here in remote areas.

219
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:26,086
The sun sets at 8:00 and 8:30.

220
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:30,632
7:00 or 7:30,
if you're in the woods, you're screwed.

221
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:34,677
It's dark and you're not going to walk
from side to side.

222
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,345
If you grab the night there,

223
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,431
better sit
and stay where you are.

224
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,185
You do not want to walk around there.

225
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,896
Did you miss people
in those woods?

226
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,606
Not that I know of.

227
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,902
If they were lost,
perhaps grabbed the drug cartel.

228
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,153
What's with that?

229
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,031
Mexican planting pot.

230
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,908
You do not want to run into them,

231
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,201
You may not return.

232
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,827
Are there people who sows speck here?

233
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,206
What do you people do here?
2. 3. 4
00: 12: 03.665 -> 00: 12: 07.336
It is the main source of income
the Siskiyou County.

235
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,089
I heard marijuana plant here.

236
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:11,214
Yes.

237
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,427
How do you know where that is
in the forest?

238
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,513
You'll walk.

239
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:22,267
You should go for a walk,
and if you see a plantation ...

240
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:27,105
you long there, because otherwise
they could kill with one stone.

241
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,109
What do you think could eat
one Bigfoot?

242
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,115
Goats are tasty.

243
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,450
Also the chicken.

244
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,748
I came for a couple of months
I saw the news ...

245
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:48,544
and a guy said a Bigfoot
he had halved his dog.

246
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,504
- Really?
- It was in this county.

247
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,006
- In this county?
- Yes, so I came.

248
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,550
Have you heard anything about that?

249
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,926
No, I had never heard.

250
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,638
He halved his dog.

251
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,390
People tell me that has dogs

252
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:04,059
trained to hunt bears and stuff.

253
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,229
Out, and suddenly the dogs run
to get into the van

254
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:08,772
or under it and begin to whine.

255
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:12,735
They hear screams, someone
They throw stones and all that.

256
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:16,405
It seems that dogs do not feel
comfortable with those things

257
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,573
and there must be a reason for it.

258
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,034
I do not see it.

259
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,119
I see a cougar so.

260
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:24,455
Or a bear.

261
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,165
A Bigfoot?

262
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,042
I say ...

263
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,794
you know.

264
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:34,590
If something happens around here ...

265
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:40,596
anyone here know before
in fact happen, man.

266
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,181
So it is.

267
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:45,684
And it was probably a cougar
which halved the dog.

268
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:46,977
He said it was Bigfoot.

269
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,815
What are you smoking? I want.

270
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,610
Nape heard
a Bigfoot attack ...

271
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
to animals or humans ...

272
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,452
in my life.

273
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:07,748
How does this story make you feel?

274
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,962
- If true.
- I think that's a lie.

275
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,426
I do not believe that Bigfoot
He had halved that dog.

276
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,763
Do you know who it was,
or something about that story?

277
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,933
I ... I do not wanna talk about it.

278
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,938
- A jar.
- Look!

279
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,106
Land of Bigfoot.

280
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,609
I think I need coffee
after this trip.

281
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,736
Coffee, quickly.

282
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,614
Uuuuu, Bigfoot.

283
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,741
It's scary.

284
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:49,415
A glass of Earth Bigfoot.

285
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,875
- My tequila.
- You have to buy it.

286
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,341
- I could put my tequila in my coffee.
- Good idea.

287
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:01,553
I want to find a man
it is supposed to be called emergencies,

288
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:05,139
saying Bigfoot
He split his dog.

289
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,933
Have you heard anything about that?

290
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,310
I asked him
10 or 15 people

291
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,938
and nobody knew
what were we talking about.

292
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,231
I know who could do that.

293
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:16,734
- Not seriously?
- Yes.

294
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:19,445
I think it's here
passing this curve.

295
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,493
What do you think?

296
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:28,120
If we look, what will you say?

297
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:30,080
I do not know if he is that man.

298
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,459
First of all I will start talking
with the,

299
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,586
being friendly.

300
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,297
I felt a blow to the head.

301
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,508
- No we attract more-
- Was ...?

302
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:42,801
I did not do that.

303
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:46,096
No we attract more attention
than necessary.

304
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,101
- Is the?
- I think so.

305
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,936
I'll see if he is.

306
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,814
- Stay here.
- Agree.

307
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,777
It does not look very happy, friend.

308
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,282
I do not know if I should do that.

309
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,294
- Shit.
- Stephon!

310
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,010
I think you should go for it.

311
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,637
I am not under the car.

312
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,515
Heaven.

313
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,476
Heavens!

314
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,689
- Stephon, get in the car.
- Get in the car!

315
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,400
Wait, guys.

316
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:58,544
it's okay. He was a little ...

317
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,713
He thought I was in the press
and he was removed from the roll,

318
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,173
- But there's no problem.
- He had an ax.

319
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,718
He's fine,
I gave her space and all that.

320
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,636
No anger.
It will not do anything.

321
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,639
Hi, whats up friend?

322
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:11,764
Hello.

323
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:14,768
He's my ...

324
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:16,478
He is my brother Davee,

325
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:19,606
and his girlfriend, Shy.

326
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:20,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,234
- How are you?
- I'm Travis.

328
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,737
How are you, Travis?

329
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,865
Come on.

330
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:33,079
Just I wanted to make
that they are not in the press.

331
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:35,081
- Everything is fine.
- We are not of the press,

332
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:36,458
I promise.

333
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,586
Where I can put this?

334
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:43,005
Where you go to be more comfortable.

335
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,632
Hence there is a stone.

336
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,800
A concrete block.

337
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,135
You want to sit?

338
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:49,344
Yes. Is that OK?

339
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:50,428
- Yes.
- Well,

340
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,058
I ... I filmed.

341
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:56,101
. Stay you here.

342
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,313
Faith is powerful.

343
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:03,359
Religions sometimes not ...

344
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:04,735
you get them all.
3. 4. 5
00: 18: 04.818 -> 00: 18: 08.072
There are, you know, the perfect shoe.

346
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:13,786
But when you find it,
you accept and are part of it,

347
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,872
and it takes

348
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,541
and makes you a better person.

349
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:24,005
I've seen it.
I have witnessed his strength,

350
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,965
of its power.

351
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,968
His eyes
the bottom of my soul.

352
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,637
How were your eyes?

353
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:33,514
Large, red ...
I looked directly.

354
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:39,311
I was there.

355
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:41,772
He looked into my eyes
when I was praying,

356
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,400
trying to find a signal.

357
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,485
He turned and walked away.
Theo gave chase.

358
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,155
We follow, we follow
and we follow.

359
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,660
They must have been several miles.

360
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:57,621
And we got a runner,

361
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:58,747
Y ...

362
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,252
the ...

363
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,839
The dog continued.
I stopped, I could not follow ...

364
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,302
and I told Theo:
"Come, come, come back."

365
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:15,348
Theo finally ran back
as if frightened

366
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:19,894
And ... We were here ...

367
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,813
some days after,

368
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:25,733
and returned, he loaded the dog
and he broke it in two.

369
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,860
- Oh Lord.
- What he halved?

370
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:31,196
To the half.
In front of me, she broke in half.

371
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,032
They can not go. It is haunted.

372
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,158
They can not go.

373
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:35,909
There's something about that corridor.

374
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,287
When you get to that road ...

375
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,415
it is ... In the region
the Marble Mountains.

376
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,544
?Bigfoot is in those mountains?

377
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:47,212
Yes.

378
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:51,091
I'd love to go into the woods with you,
be there one day ...

379
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,428
to see what happens

380
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,473
and how is this area.

381
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,391
I had never been here,

382
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:00,060
so I do not know where to go.

383
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:01,394
You've been here five years,

384
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,356
and obviously knows the area
better than me.

385
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,066
Come tomorrow.

386
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:07,275
Really?

387
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,905
- Come tomorrow.
- Perfect.

388
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,740
- With pleasure.
- Go away.

389
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:14,991
I think they're crap.

390
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,476
But as you want,
I came to support you.

391
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:18,244
?"Nonsense"?
What do you mean, fuck?

392
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,788
Let her brother.

393
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,998
- That came ...
- I understand.

394
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,708
- To talk to this guy.
- I already know it.

395
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,127
Leave her in the car, fuck.

396
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,546
Leave her in the car!

397
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,881
it's okay.

398
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:34,218
It's just ... I do not want to push me
in religion.

399
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,970
How do we talk about ...?

400
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,807
- A dog and Bigfoot a-
- Would you shut the door?

401
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,350
Before I change my mind.

402
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,894
Suddenly we are
in a Bible school.

403
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,314
Do not exploit,
stay out of religion.

404
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,692
Well, since you are so friends

405
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,068
and I have understood
which it is a documentary-

406
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,611
You know why we came.

407
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,571
You told me apoyabas.

408
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,282
That's right, a thousand percent,
and we both agree.

409
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:58,368
Know that this type
it would be something different.

410
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,788
"Something different" is one thing.

411
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,456
Demented is another.

412
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,542
He left with an ax in his hand.

413
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,793
Did you see around you?

414
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:07,961
Did you see?

415
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,463
Some had axes
8 different sizes.

416
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:13,173
I saw machetes, hammers ...

417
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,802
Hey, he lives in a forest.
People live differently here.

418
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,303
- I think ...
- With all those animals?

419
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:20,764
I think there are rare sacrifices there.

420
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:24,935
I think you need to calm down
and we have to sleep.

421
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,479
It has been a long journey. The three ...

422
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:28,647
we are tired.

423
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,191
Tomorrow will be a new damn day,

424
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,486
we will see the type
and see what happens.

425
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:02,557
Shit.

426
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,025
Dammit.

427
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,364
Fuck.

428
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:56,568
What are you doing?

429
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:58,612
- Dammit!
- What are you doing?

430
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,072
What the hell are you doing?

431
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:02,449
- What are you doing?
- I thought I heard something.

432
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,326
Just kidding?
It's 5:00 in the morning,

433
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,994
4:00, 3:00 in the morning.

434
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,538
You scared me, dammit!

435
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,290
Go to sleep. go to sleep ...

436
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:15,255
please have a heavy day tomorrow.
For the love of God.

437
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,506
Ven.

438
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,265
We must rise.

439
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:26,433
Awake.

440
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:37,569
Already we made us one hours later.

441
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:40,447
She is old, I swear.

442
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,986
We are in the forest
and you want to fix the hair.

443
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,994
Already you list, my love?

444
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:48,121
I can not stand being late
and she knows it.

445
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:51,498
- It is unprofessional.
- You know what? ?Dont professional?

446
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:54,752
- It is.
- I told you to wake me up at 9:30.

447
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:58,213
- At least you could ...
- I had to repack.

448
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,381
Whatever.

449
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,924
- How are you?
- Good.

450
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,220
Sorry I'm late.

451
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,139
Well, it's not a good start.

452
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:07,932
It's my fault.

453
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,851
- Women.
- Yes.

454
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,147
Let's pray for a moment.

455
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,630
- Bow your heads.
- Good heavens.

456
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,775
Nods.

457
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:21,988
You want ... You want my brother
Also do?

458
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,740
Well, if a believer.

459
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,994
Perhaps you want to be at this time.

460
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:30,872
Could you just shoot?

461
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:33,333
You know what?
My eyes are closed.

462
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,543
"And Jabaz called the God of Israel, saying:

463
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:38,505
'You really bless me
and you agrandar?s my territory,

464
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:40,382
May your hand be with me

465
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,508
and protect me from evil

466
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,469
to not cause pain. '

467
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:47,971
And God granted him what he requested. "

468
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:50,391
The Father, the Son ...

469
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,524
Holy water.

470
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:06,241
Ceo I ...

471
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,409
you're good.

472
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:10,787
- Well, let's go.
- Amen.

473
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:14,332
What the fuck do, eh?

474
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,045
Fuck.

475
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:21,673
Sorry.

476
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,135
She will be a problem.

477
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,761
It will not be.

478
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,973
I have my sunglasses.

479
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:32,142
Too bad. Aguantate.

480
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,063
So we should have
packed last night.

481
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:39,148
Damn!

482
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:41,276
You found your glasses?

483
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,944
No. Are Davee.

484
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,947
They do not even get me.

485
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:47,115
Selfishness, brother.

486
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,201
He brought them over the head.

487
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:52,245
- Now his eyes ...
- His eyes are brown.

488
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:53,872
Look, you can not open my eyes.

489
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:55,790
His eyes are brown. Yes you can.

490
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:59,044
I poetry.
Do you like poetry?

491
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,503
- It does to me.
- Yes.

492
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:03,048
- Definitely.
- Travis, be good for my documentary.

493
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,299
Otherwise, we would be walking alone.

494
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:07,052
It would be good to read a couple of things
in the path

495
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,179
before reaching the place
which we spoke.

496
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:11,639
I got this for years.

497
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:14,642
- My poem.
- A poem?

498
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,686
Everyone should have a poem.

499
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,356
It is ... Is the Bible?

500
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,940
No. Only I keep it there.

501
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,568
It is called "Live my life".

502
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,236
"I live my life
in increasing orbits

503
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:26,988
Moving
on the things of the world.

504
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:30,200
We may never reach the ultimate

505
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:32,243
but that will be my attempt.

506
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:33,953
I have gone round
about God

507
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,915
And around
of the ancient towers.

508
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:39,000
I've been around for a thousand years

509
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:43,963
and still I do not know if I'm a storm,
a hawk or a beautiful song. "

510
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,216
It was written in 1899.

511
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:47,384
Who wrote it?

512
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:52,722
- What is this?
- This?

513
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:56,101
It's to mark our way
not to lose.

514
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,811
He read it in a book.

515
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:01,731
Do they read fairy tales?
Hansel and Gretel "?

516
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:05,193
They threw crumbs,
which was silly, because people

517
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:06,611
or animals ate them.

518
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,115
- This is tape.
- You do not trust me?

519
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,618
- It's not about that.
- No Yes ...

520
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:17,747
trust, but I want to make sure
we know exactly where we're going.

521
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:20,458
I know how to get back.
We return.

522
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,962
The suit case,

523
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:26,047
we did not know
if we would find.

524
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,050
Put the tape. Only one piece.

525
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:31,177
The pick,
not leave trash.

526
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:36,141
- It's okay?
- Yes.

527
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:43,690
Can I have the tape shove them?

528
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,028
What are you doing?

529
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:49,988
We explained that we will put

530
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,575
- To find the way back.
- A was not enough?

531
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,661
It makes every 100-300 meters.

532
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,163
They may arrive morning.

533
00:27:58,288 --> 00:27:59,648
- I can ask you something?
- What?

534
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:01,791
Why can question
our methods ...?

535
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,036
But when I question,

536
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:06,546
my brother and my girlfriend bother me
for having questioned?

537
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:07,714
I just want to learn ...

538
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,050
Do not judge ...

539
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,593
because the rod that midas

540
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:12,719
you will be measured.

541
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,475
It sounds good.

542
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,436
- What does it mean?
- Means that no judge.

543
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,855
Who's in charge here?

544
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,523
You.

545
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,067
Shut up.

546
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:30,779
You had to mess with
your damn righteousness.

547
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:37,118
The Lord is in His holy temple.

548
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:38,995
The Lord's throne is in heaven.

549
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,749
His eyes behold,
His gaze examines humankind.

550
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,087
Is this a documentary
about Bigfoot

551
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:49,255
or a goddamn prayer meeting?

552
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:54,844
Why not ...?

553
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,721
Why do not you let me
be the cameraman?

554
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:59,600
Let me shoot and you
continue their nonsense with ...

555
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:00,725
This way.

556
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:10,068
See? Come on ...

557
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:11,903
north, so good.

558
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:14,906
And she's leaving tape
on the road, that's good.

559
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,658
I know exactly where we're going.

560
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:20,995
At least maybe get
a pretty bride.

561
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,872
Shit. Wait, I'm bleeding.

562
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:23,956
Fuck.

563
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,000
- Really?
- Yeah. Damn.

564
00:29:28,628 --> 00:29:29,921
Well, let's go.

565
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,601
- Damn!
- What happened?

566
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:46,395
Thorns.

567
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:49,608
Come on.

568
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,777
Are we closer?

569
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:53,279
Crosses.

570
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,615
Fuck, I pushed.

571
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,825
I only helped a little.

572
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:04,164
It's a little more open.

573
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,247
Is this clear?

574
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,709
Very small pines.

575
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,711
- Hey I ...
- 21.

576
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:12,672
Before proceeding,
I found it there.

577
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,966
What about this?

578
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:19,012
- Where?
- There, beside the canvas.

579
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,764
There is no other well.

580
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:23,224
It is a. 410.

581
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,976
- Hunting quail.
- Is it a rifle?

582
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,312
- Yes a. 410.
- It is a rifle.

583
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:29,689
A little shotgun.

584
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:31,900
I had one. 410.

585
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,943
We entered 7 km
in the forest.

586
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:36,946
- Hunters, marihuanos.
- Marihuanos?

587
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,783
I do not want to go ahead,

588
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:42,078
I worry me get me
in the field of someone or something.

589
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:43,537
They do not ... No, no.

590
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:48,167
That's over there ...

591
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:49,418
to the south.

592
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,669
That's the bad part.
Let north.

593
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,254
Why is that a bad area?

594
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,673
There are farms speck.

595
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,842
- So come on-
- No, we're not going over there.

596
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:00,845
- But there's weed.
- Yes. We're going for here.

597
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,516
- Damn! Dammit!
- Are you okay?

598
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,643
- Can not be.
- OMG.

599
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:08,687
- Shit.
- Fuck. Motherfucker.

600
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,480
Shit, fuck.

601
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:13,650
Hey, you know where the hell
It is leading us?

602
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:18,947
- You have to fuck.
- What did you do?

603
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:22,200
What did you do?

604
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:24,035
Oh Lord.

605
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,540
My bloody knee, my ankle ...

606
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:29,959
Damn!

607
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,919
Heavens, it's very swollen.

608
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,587
Do not move.

609
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:36,882
Do not move!

610
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,308
Do you see anything?

611
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,227
Fuck.

612
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,357
What is?

613
00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,154
Did you hear that?

614
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,321
Yes.

615
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:04,951
There is water below.
Something is splashing.

616
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,957
We've been here almost five hours.

617
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,834
They do not hear that noise?

618
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:15,838
Obviously not.

619
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:20,468
Stephon.

620
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,639
Do you really hear something
when you were there?

621
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:27,391
- Yes.
- Really?

622
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,268
I swear.

623
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,979
I heard it. I heard something like a "uuu".

624
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,356
You guys. They not heard?

625
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,858
I heard nothing,
but we were far behind

626
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:39,569
and I had just fallen,
so I heard branches breaking.

627
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:41,363
So I ran like crazy

628
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:42,781
- To seek the guidance.
- I saw that.

629
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:45,367
The place to camp.

630
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,577
- What?
- It is here.

631
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,162
Are we There Yet?

632
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,373
It is the beginning of the corridor.

633
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:52,832
What?

634
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,209
It is the place to camp.

635
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,838
- Does the camp site?
- Yes.

636
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:06,596
What is that?

637
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,682
The corridor.

638
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:17,608
What can we so down?

639
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:20,443
You will see.

640
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,987
Are we going to take up there?

641
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,285
What?

642
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:30,912
Are we going to take up there?

643
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,004
You want to do?

644
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,923
What do you want to do?

645
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:44,008
No. I'm gonna talk to him.

646
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:45,343
But what do they do?

647
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,178
What does?

648
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:48,680
He is praying.

649
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:50,515
Really?

650
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,107
Go talk to him, Shy.

651
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,403
Ask how far
He plans to take.

652
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,252
it's useless.

653
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:24,215
What's up?

654
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
I can not go any further.

655
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:26,926
- What?
- I can not go any further.

656
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:28,678
Why?

657
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:30,096
I can not go any further.

658
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,307
- You go.
- Wait, wait.

659
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,641
- I can not go.
- What ...?

660
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:34,934
I can not go.

661
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:38,980
- Travis!
- Let me go.

662
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,857
- Listen, he said ...
- Let me go.

663
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,026
You can not leave us here.

664
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:51,619
Is he sick?

665
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,707
Is it something religious,

666
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,793
or it has to do with Bigfoot?

667
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,424
It's sick or something.

668
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,426
Need to drink water?

669
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:12,765
Wait, we're not going
stay here.

670
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:14,933
Wait! We're with you.

671
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:18,520
Travis!

672
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:22,774
What you are on that road?

673
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:25,568
I do not know. Search and find.

674
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,905
Search and find.

675
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:32,242
They want to see it? You'll see.

676
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,120
Are we in danger here?

677
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:36,539
Fear knocked on the door and opened faith.

678
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:38,040
there was no one.

679
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:42,503
I have to go.

680
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,132
Are you serious?

681
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:51,011
Are we going to let go?

682
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,847
it's over.

683
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:54,598
We do not know how to get back.

684
00:36:00,312 --> 00:36:01,355
Fuck.

685
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,942
Do you think there's something down there?

686
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:08,653
I could not breathe.

687
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:10,196
- Was he acting?
- I could not breathe!

688
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:12,824
- That was very strange.
- No, he was hyperventilating.

689
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,951
It seemed strange from the beginning.

690
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:16,675
I told the guy
I did not know where he was going.

691
00:36:16,703 --> 00:36:19,831
I felt I was looking for
someone constantly.

692
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,916
Now I feel that brought us here,
He made a scene

693
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:23,294
and we're fucked anyway.

694
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:24,670
We do not know return,

695
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:26,874
- We are in the middle of nowhere ...
- We can come back.

696
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,175
Shy stopped the tape and have been
going north.

697
00:36:29,258 --> 00:36:30,926
You have to go back and go south.

698
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:33,971
We may return, but do not want ...

699
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:35,514
We can not return at night.

700
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:38,601
Why do not we do this?

701
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:39,935
Camp

702
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:43,481
and in the morning
let's see what's there.

703
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:45,691
We further 800 meters.

704
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:48,069
If we see something, we see something.

705
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:51,113
If not, we're out of here.

706
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:52,365
But I'm sick.

707
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,533
I can not walk 7 hours.

708
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:56,494
We all damn day
in this forest.

709
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:08,380
- Wake up, I heard something.
- What?

710
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:11,049
I heard something.

711
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,344
Oh Lord.

712
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:15,596
I'll go see.
Come on, I want to go see.

713
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:25,606
I do not know.

714
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:28,567
Why do we go to him?

715
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:30,069
I want to see what it is.

716
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:36,992
They are stones.

717
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,841
This is crazy.

718
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:00,056
Do you think it's the damn Travis?

719
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,268
No, I do not think it
Travis accursed!

720
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,644
No, it's the kind of the Bible.

721
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,187
F?lmalo, dammit.

722
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,312
Click Travis.

723
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:09,567
We brought the boondocks.
These are run.

724
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:10,693
Come on ...

725
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,904
Shut up, dammit.

726
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,490
Oh Lord!

727
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:17,825
It's a fucking stone.

728
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,379
Shit! Fuck you, Travis!

729
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:32,381
Fuck.
Let's go back to the store.

730
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,800
Come to the store. Dammit!

731
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:36,552
Click stupid shit.

732
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:45,852
Fuck Where is the shop?

733
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,064
Give me your hand. Take my hand.

734
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:50,899
They see nothing.
I have the damned ...

735
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,024
We are lost.

736
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,986
We not found the shop, dammit.

737
00:38:54,111 --> 00:38:55,154
Come here.

738
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,368
What the hell's going on?

739
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:06,457
- What do you want?
- What's up?

740
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:12,171
Fuck. This damn ...
Damn, man. It scared us ...

741
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:13,547

742
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:18,928
Come here.

743
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,429
- What?
- Come here.

744
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:22,848
Who?

745
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,183
Come here.

746
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:25,518
Who?

747
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,019
Who the fuck you talking about?

748
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,312
Stay away, friend.

749
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:30,856
You come here.

750
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:32,274
- Me?
- Yes.

751
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,402
Shy, go fuck.

752
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:35,611
Why?

753
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:39,489
I want to talk.

754
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:43,619
Look, it's not ...
Leave her alone, dammit.

755
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,540
This is private property.
Come here.

756
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,376
Can not you tell from there?

757
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:54,463
What right have
to get to this property?

758
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,258
- We ...
- What right, see?

759
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,385
Come here. Come here now!

760
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,178
- Come here!
- Go.

761
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:02,304
Fuck.

762
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:04,015
We had no idea.

763
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,307
We do not know where ...

764
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:06,475
Fuck.

765
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:12,440
Stay here.

766
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:25,077
Which? Does the muscular?

767
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,289
Are you sleeping with both?

768
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:32,043
We're not doing anything.
My brother is filming a documentary.

769
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:35,212
We are lost, fuck.
We just want to go home.

770
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,589
We try to find
a monster or something.

771
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,841
we are not ...
We are lost.

772
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:40,217
That look for?

773
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:41,886
- Nothing.
- Oh yeah?

774
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,679
Someone brought us here.

775
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,226
I mean, is this necessary?

776
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,647
On knees.

777
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,149
Come on, please, fuck.

778
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:58,277
- Get on your knees ...
- Do it, Shy.

779
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:01,072
Shut up, Davee!
It has a fucking gun!

780
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:02,823
Heed, Shy!

781
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:04,492
I will not fuck here.

782
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:06,911
Do not fuck this skinny.

783
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,580
- I do not want.
- We Go ...

784
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,707
Get out of my property.

785
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,751
We did not know it was yours.

786
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,920
That we,
get out of your property.

787
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:18,339
Could you tell us how, please?

788
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:20,175
Averiguenlo.

789
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,802
- They ...
- Put the gun down!

790
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,929
okay okay.

791
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:26,263
- Fuck.
- Five minutes,

792
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:29,809
or maybe I fuck this skinny whore.

793
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:33,646
- We go.
- Yes.

794
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,941
- We're out of here.
- What direction?

795
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,984
We do not know where we are!

796
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,778
- D?ganos-
- Hey.

797
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:42,697
Look at me

798
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,365
and do not go where I go.

799
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:48,160
Five minutes.

800
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:53,749
Come on, get out of here.

801
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,876
Shy, we gotta go.

802
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,253
go Go.

803
00:41:57,336 --> 00:41:59,422
Let's go. Pack store!

804
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:01,340
Get the damn store here.

805
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,217
Take it and let's go.

806
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:05,970
We have five minutes
to get out of here.

807
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,139
Let's get out of here.
Take the store.

808
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:10,183
Everything outside the property such.

809
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,769
Take the damn store and let's go.

810
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:16,188
go Go. We have to go.

811
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:17,690
- Let's go.
- I'm coming!

812
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:21,277
Let's go from here!
We have to get out of here!

813
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,029
Damn!

814
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:27,742
Davee, what the hell do we do?

815
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,790
Davee, what the hell do we do?

816
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,376
You think you're safe here?
What's already out of your property?

817
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,004
I think so, we are half an hour from ...

818
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:43,007
We walk half an hour.
We should be fine.

819
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,925
Calm down ...

820
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:48,012
I say we stay here
and the moment when the sun rises,

821
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:49,722
we took.

822
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,098
Good. It's okay.

823
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,735
What is that?

824
00:43:03,236 --> 00:43:04,571
What the hell is that?

825
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:13,412
Wait wait.

826
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,086
Hey, what the hell was that?

827
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:24,924
- I do not know.
- I'll go see.

828
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:26,008
No, no.

829
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:29,095
I want to see what it is.
Let me see what it is.

830
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,098
Do you remember the last time
we saw it was?

831
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:39,146
- No.
- I have to go see.

832
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:40,523
- Stay, listen.
- Wait.

833
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:43,359
- Please.
- Do not go, Stephon.

834
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:45,945
It's safer here.
I feel safer here.

835
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,658
Can we stay here
until morning?

836
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,118
What the hell is that?

837
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:53,412
I do not know ... Let's stay here.

838
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,334
I'm going.

839
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,293
I'll see what it is. You ....

840
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,753
We'll go with you. We'll all go.

841
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,463
If he goes, we go.

842
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,648
Come on, Shy. Come on.

843
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,055
Have they stopped?

844
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,270
Fuck.

845
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:20,748
- Run!
- What the hell was that thing?

846
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:22,113
- To the store!
- Oh Lord!

847
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,085
- To the store!
- Heavens! Fast!

848
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:26,838
- Let's go! Oh Lord!
- To the store!

849
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:29,966
What shit
What the hell was that?

850
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,262
- Shy, come out!
- Run!

851
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,891
Run, my love! Faster!

852
00:45:37,974 --> 00:45:39,309
Run faster!

853
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:42,979
Damn!

854
00:45:46,273 --> 00:45:47,441
What was it? What was it?

855
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:49,944
Something is out there.

856
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:57,660
We all saw it, right?

857
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,329
What was it?

858
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:22,185
Oh Lord.

859
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:24,563
All our things. Everything.

860
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:26,857
- Look.
- We stayed ...

861
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:28,400
without anything.

862
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:30,318
Awesome, fuck.

863
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,030
It is destroyed.

864
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:35,115
Where the hell is ...?

865
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,118
- Everything.
- Where is the bag? And the food?

866
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:40,619
- Whose is this bag?
- It's mine.

867
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:43,372
It is Shy. Where is mine?

868
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:45,541
- I see my bag anywhere.
- Oh Lord!

869
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:49,086
And he was all there. Everything.

870
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:51,380
Fuck. Davee, where yours is?

871
00:46:51,505 --> 00:46:53,966
- All it is gone.
- Nothing remains!

872
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,595
Bag Shy is here.
I had food and you, the compass.

873
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,348
Everything disappeared.
All fucking.

874
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:02,433
We not even know where we are.

875
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:04,935
Fuck.

876
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:08,190
But we have your yellow tape, right?

877
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:09,274
Yes.

878
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,109
Did you put on trees?

879
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:12,235
- Shy.
- What?

880
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,612
- Did you put ...?
- Yes Yes.

881
00:47:13,737 --> 00:47:16,531
Good. That's fine.
As I said before,

882
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:19,201
We were going north
and we had difficulties,

883
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:21,453
but we have to go south.

884
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:24,456
Do you know where is the south without a compass?

885
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,001
Yes, by the sun.

886
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,669
We can not stay another night.

887
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:30,921
We do not have anything.

888
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:04,204
Hear! Look!

889
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,002
Look! No tape here.

890
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:13,714
Thank God dammit.

891
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:18,760
We'll be fine.

892
00:48:18,885 --> 00:48:21,138
We find it, there it is.

893
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:25,307
Follow the river

894
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,310
and to the tape, and we'll be fine.

895
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:31,022
Thanks God.

896
00:48:31,063 --> 00:48:33,607
Now you become religious?

897
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:36,193
I am returning very religious.

898
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:37,737
We're good guys.

899
00:48:37,862 --> 00:48:39,905
- Here it is.
- All right, fuck.

900
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,536
- I have more tape.
- You saw this?

901
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:46,872
- I'm reading the tape as a menu.
- Yes, dammit.

902
00:48:46,997 --> 00:48:50,792
- Meat, lobster, shrimp ...
- Hamburgers.

903
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:52,335
- Cold beer.
- Chips.

904
00:48:52,419 --> 00:48:54,755
I think even below says whiskey.

905
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,506
I think it says tequila!

906
00:48:58,383 --> 00:49:01,470
Glasses of tequila. Many cups.

907
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:03,305
OMG. Just kidding?

908
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,890
There is no tape, tape.

909
00:49:05,015 --> 00:49:07,851
Congratulations to the Queen of the tape.

910
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:09,144
You See? There's the tape.

911
00:49:09,227 --> 00:49:13,482
Just follow south
and we'll be fine.

912
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:16,360
Can I have some water?
Thank You.

913
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:18,694
I'm in love with my tape.

914
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:21,906
I think we'll be back
before nightfall.

915
00:49:26,118 --> 00:49:28,245
You sure you put tape
every 90 meters?

916
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:30,998
Yes, I did.

917
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:34,086
I feel that we have walked 30 minutes
and I have not seen tape.

918
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:41,677
Maybe we
in the wrong direction.

919
00:49:41,802 --> 00:49:44,638
No, we are still going south.

920
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:46,932
- Are you sure?
- Yes, totally.

921
00:49:47,057 --> 00:49:48,725
Shit.

922
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:50,435
Look, there is no tape!

923
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,397
- There it is.
- Thanks God.

924
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,190
You See? We said fine.

925
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,692
Really? Thank you thank you.

926
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:58,944
Oh Lord! Boys!

927
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:01,655
- What's up?
- What?

928
00:50:01,738 --> 00:50:03,615
Oh Lord!

929
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:07,661
No no no no.

930
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:11,414
We are totally screwed!

931
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:15,626
Who did this?

932
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:19,672
Why are we stopping?

933
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:22,133
We have to keep walking.

934
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:24,261
Are you kidding?

935
00:50:27,305 --> 00:50:29,474
- What does that mean?
- We're going south.

936
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,644
We are following
Stephon shadow.

937
00:50:34,021 --> 00:50:36,815
If your shadow is in front of you
means you are going south?

938
00:50:36,898 --> 00:50:39,151
It is south. I know where I'm going.

939
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:51,538
Do you think known something?

940
00:50:51,663 --> 00:50:53,832
- Anything.
- Everything looks the same.

941
00:51:05,426 --> 00:51:07,345
What the hell is that?

942
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:08,721
What?

943
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:11,015
I see some goats.

944
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:12,642
Yes.

945
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:13,852
Hi!

946
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:17,439
I do not know if you should cry.

947
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:20,984
What the fuck is that?

948
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:26,907
Hey, Stephon,
What is it that is hanging there?

949
00:51:28,658 --> 00:51:31,328
- Fuck.
- What fuck is that?

950
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:32,829
It's a damn chicken.

951
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:46,259
Hey, this is not usual.

952
00:51:46,343 --> 00:51:49,304
And there are stones there.

953
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:51,515
Also around goats.

954
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,768
And now, those sticks form an X.

955
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,978
What does that mean?

956
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:00,522
Fuck.

957
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:04,111
It's like ...

958
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:07,072
As if they had been left here ...
Why they are tied?

959
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:10,909
What do you mean?
They form a circle.

960
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,915
This is not right.

961
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:18,375
Is there blood in that suit?

962
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,626
- Yes.
- Is that blood?

963
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,378
And there's a candle.

964
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:25,424
See? See?

965
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,135
It's that son of a bitch, Travis.
is the. You remember?

966
00:52:28,218 --> 00:52:29,761
What I said when we got?

967
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:31,346
He had many animals,
Remember?

968
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:32,472
- You remember?
- Yes.

969
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:35,851
What was the first thing I said?
Sheep for slaughter, right?

970
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:39,354
That's. This is the work of that type.

971
00:52:39,438 --> 00:52:42,899
- It is work that bastard.
- Do you think this is yours?

972
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:45,652
I do not know. Let me see ...
chickens, goats.

973
00:52:45,736 --> 00:52:47,778
Weird shit ...

974
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,447
Find a Bible.

975
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:53,160
Oh Lord.
Are you serious, dammit?

976
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:57,372
- It's getting dark.
- It's fresh blood.

977
00:52:57,456 --> 00:53:00,167
- It's cool.
- Stephon! Let's go!

978
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,668
Turn the camera off!

979
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:06,548
You See? This make.

980
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:08,884
- Standing stones and candles.
- Turn it off!

981
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:10,761
Turn the camera off!

982
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:13,472
Stephon! Do not you see that?

983
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:14,973
- Let's go!
- Turn it off!

984
00:53:15,098 --> 00:53:16,558
- You are happy?
- Really!

985
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:17,642
- You are happy?
- It's okay.

986
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:18,769
- Please.
- Turn it off!

987
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:20,228
Let's go.

988
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:24,566
From now on, I guide.
Let's go. Come.

989
00:53:24,649 --> 00:53:27,361
Hurry, Shy.
Now I am in charge, thanks.

990
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:28,612
I'm in charge.

991
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:33,367
Stephon, fuck.
Fuck.

992
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,410
Follow me. you can follow me

993
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:37,245
or do what you want with your camera.

994
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:39,206
Let's go. To hell with this.

995
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,042
I ignored all damn day.

996
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,418
it's over.

997
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:20,997
Damn!

998
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:22,082
Shit.

999
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:24,459
What the fuck is that?

1000
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:26,670
Davee, is the same sound last night.

1001
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:29,506
- We have ... Fuck.
- What are we going to do?

1002
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,884
I do not know, I do not know. Damn!

1003
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,010
Where did?

1004
00:54:43,103 --> 00:54:45,147
This is not good.

1005
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,523
It is everywhere.

1006
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,041
Everywhere around us.
Everywhere, dammit.

1007
00:55:04,124 --> 00:55:06,460
I do not know where they are.

1008
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:08,211
- We have to go.
- They can hear everything.

1009
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:09,755
- Come On.
- We must continue.

1010
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,966
We have to walk faster.
We walk faster.

1011
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:14,843
Careful where you step.
Be careful.

1012
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:25,104
Shy!

1013
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:27,314
Run Run Run!

1014
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:28,857
Davee!

1015
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,275
Run faster!

1016
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,946
Shy, where are you?

1017
00:55:37,783 --> 00:55:39,618
Run! Run!

1018
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,587
Run, woman! Run!

1019
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,631
Damn!
Run Run Run!

1020
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:54,466
I'll turn off the light.

1021
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:55,801
Oh Lord.

1022
00:55:55,926 --> 00:55:57,844
Did you see how many there were?

1023
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:59,096
- Yes.
- Fuck.

1024
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:01,890
Completely surround us.

1025
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:03,975
Oh my God, Stephon.
Oh Lord.

1026
00:56:05,435 --> 00:56:06,937
Oh Lord.

1027
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:20,367
I am very afraid.

1028
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:29,000
The lost, dammit.

1029
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:33,797
I hope he's not dead.

1030
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:38,385
Fuck.

1031
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:41,930
Fuck.

1032
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:44,683
We have to move on.

1033
00:56:48,562 --> 00:56:49,938
Are we going to find?

1034
00:56:51,982 --> 00:56:54,401
Yes. We have to.

1035
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:02,160
This is ... This is what we have left.

1036
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:04,078
What do we have?

1037
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:06,372
We have water.

1038
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,915
Deodorant ...

1039
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,625
a little water ...

1040
00:57:12,878 --> 00:57:14,588
toilet paper.

1041
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,635
Hell, let's look for my girlfriend.

1042
00:57:26,266 --> 00:57:27,517
What is that?

1043
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:30,687
What is that?

1044
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:35,859
What the fuck?

1045
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,154
It is tape.

1046
00:57:40,697 --> 00:57:42,574
Just kidding?

1047
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:47,454
Is joke, fuck?
Good heavens, it's a damn ...

1048
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,123
What the fuck is that?

1049
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,670
Someone was definitely here.

1050
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,467
Damn!

1051
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,303
Bastards bastards!

1052
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:03,845
Damn!

1053
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:07,974
What do you think is?

1054
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:13,855
I think Travis joined
all friends cursed.

1055
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,358
Do you remember I asked

1056
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:18,568
if he had friends?
And what did he say?

1057
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:19,695
Not.

1058
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,488
Who does not have friends?

1059
00:58:21,613 --> 00:58:24,032
That guy. I do not know.

1060
00:58:24,116 --> 00:58:25,659
In the camp ...

1061
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:28,537
He had chickens, goats.

1062
00:58:30,872 --> 00:58:34,501
Travis had chickens and goats.

1063
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:37,630
Travis was religious.

1064
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,054
I'm sick of this shit,
of this game.

1065
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:48,057
I've had enough of your nonsense.

1066
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,184
I want to get my girlfriend,
I want to go home,

1067
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,894
I want out of here.

1068
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:10,954
Fuck.

1069
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:12,372
I see a path.

1070
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Toma.

1071
00:59:19,296 --> 00:59:21,423
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck.

1072
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,557
Damn, just climb.

1073
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,061
This does not make head nor tail.

1074
00:59:33,144 --> 00:59:36,147
Is it a way for firefighters?

1075
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:52,788
How long is this path?

1076
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:05,842
Maybe a ranger comes.

1077
01:00:08,053 --> 01:00:11,306
In a perfect world,
topar?amos we think someone.

1078
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,434
Hopefully it
somebody suitable.

1079
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:16,019
I think that is a way for firefighters,

1080
01:00:16,104 --> 01:00:19,941
so I think something
You must pass through here.

1081
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:21,651
Someone has to.

1082
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:23,277
We find out who,

1083
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,698
and I hope it's someone good.

1084
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,701
- You know what?
- What?

1085
01:00:29,784 --> 01:00:31,619
Let's see if there echo.

1086
01:00:43,046 --> 01:00:45,340
Hi!

1087
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:54,808
But the truth, she's ...

1088
01:00:54,891 --> 01:01:00,522
I respect more than any woman
besides Mom.

1089
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:05,611
It is the only one that has liked you
of all

1090
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:07,405
which you have presented me.

1091
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,285
That means a lot to me.

1092
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,246
Really.

1093
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,085
Obviously, regardless
what I do in life ...

1094
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,588
I mean, even if you are younger ...

1095
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,550
Yes.

1096
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:29,093
Always ...

1097
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:36,099
I've always admired
somehow.

1098
01:01:36,183 --> 01:01:38,185
Why my crazy adventures?

1099
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:42,064
Your crazy adventures.

1100
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:45,275
You always had dreams.

1101
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,820
You know what sucks?
The truth,

1102
01:01:48,945 --> 01:01:51,907
all I thought I was going to do ...

1103
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,743
It is what you said you will do.

1104
01:01:54,826 --> 01:01:58,456
Go home and take care
the family business.

1105
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:03,419
And in a way
you will never understand,

1106
01:02:03,503 --> 01:02:09,467
I envy fully
for having the guts to go

1107
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,885
and pursue your dreams.

1108
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,179
I feel like I've never done that.

1109
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,768
I hate that feeling of fullness.

1110
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,979
You always want more.
You want to find ...

1111
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:25,149
You want to do, and do it.

1112
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,694
And somehow it gives me jealous

1113
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:31,822
and that makes me love you even more
as a brother. You understand me?

1114
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:56,514
Let's do it.
Let's get out of here.

1115
01:02:56,597 --> 01:02:58,016
I promise.

1116
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:09,277
What do we have here?

1117
01:03:10,445 --> 01:03:13,156
- Finally, dammit.
- Dinner.

1118
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:18,703
Finally, dammit.
Thank God.

1119
01:03:20,662 --> 01:03:22,247
These are ...

1120
01:03:22,372 --> 01:03:23,540
they are rich.

1121
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:26,752
OMG.

1122
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:32,132
- I like red or not?
- No.

1123
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:37,096
They are better than the store.

1124
01:03:38,973 --> 01:03:40,933
Scrumptious.

1125
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,226
What barbarian.

1126
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,567
What the hell was that?

1127
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,821
What fucking?

1128
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:58,451
What the hell is that?
A shot.

1129
01:03:58,576 --> 01:03:59,576
Yes.

1130
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:03,373
Fuck.

1131
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:09,212
My God, can not be.

1132
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:11,547
Will it never end?

1133
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:18,136
Davee, crouch.
Get down, damn.

1134
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,145
Run Run.

1135
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,699
I am very ...
Damn, I'm so ...

1136
01:04:40,827 --> 01:04:41,869
Fuck.

1137
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,420
Why do not they come for us?

1138
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:53,840
Here we are, Shy!

1139
01:04:55,383 --> 01:04:57,385
No, no. Davee, duck!

1140
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:00,680
Get down! Get down, dammit!
Come On!

1141
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:02,682
What the hell are you doing? Damn!

1142
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:03,891
Basta.

1143
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:09,229
Ala Fuck these motherfuckers.

1144
01:05:11,231 --> 01:05:12,231
Fuck.

1145
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,293
I see nothing out there.

1146
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:34,088
Surely they see us.

1147
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,432
You think she's alive, right?

1148
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:46,267
Yes.

1149
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:49,645
I have to believe it.

1150
01:05:57,195 --> 01:05:59,237
Makes you wonder ...

1151
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:02,367
Do you think we did something wrong?

1152
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:10,541
It is rare. Suddenly you think of all

1153
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:13,711
what you've done in your life
that is not right ...

1154
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,423
at a time of crisis.

1155
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:20,760
As they return to see all ...

1156
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,807
since you were a child until now.

1157
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:29,727
You try to see if something
maybe you had been ...

1158
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:32,438
do differently ...

1159
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:35,191
for perhaps not having reached
this situation.

1160
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,575
She wanted to do this

1161
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:47,453
because I knew it would make me happy.

1162
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,789
And look how everything went.

1163
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:06,347
I think tomorrow will be a good day.

1164
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:09,892
I think we're going to find good.

1165
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,521
I also believe it.

1166
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,151
I know you believe.

1167
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:27,368
Shy!

1168
01:07:30,997 --> 01:07:33,458
it's her. I know it's her.

1169
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:35,668
it's her.

1170
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:38,796
Shy!

1171
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:45,428
I see nothing.

1172
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:47,388
Nothing here, brother.

1173
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:48,598
Nothing.

1174
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:51,476
- Why are they doing this?
- I do not know, dammit.

1175
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:55,021
I do not know. I see nothing. Fuck.

1176
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,905
It was her. You heard her, Stephon.

1177
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,867
Back to the tent.

1178
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,786
We return. We have to-

1179
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,459
We have to do something.

1180
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:18,294
We can not stand idly.

1181
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:20,338
What do you want me to do?

1182
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:21,631
Tell me what to do.

1183
01:08:21,756 --> 01:08:23,466
We light a campfire.

1184
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:24,842
You know where we are.

1185
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,260
- Yes, the mieda!
- We do not hide.

1186
01:08:26,344 --> 01:08:27,428
- Fuck!
- We can not.

1187
01:08:27,553 --> 01:08:30,933
What does it matter?
At this point, who cares?

1188
01:08:31,016 --> 01:08:34,561
I did not take.
Stay here, okay?

1189
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,939
I'll start a fire.
Who gives a shit?

1190
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:39,857
Do not go here.

1191
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:41,943
- Where am I going to go?
- Look, just ...

1192
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:50,952
Where do I shit go?

1193
01:09:04,424 --> 01:09:05,842
OMG ...

1194
01:09:08,302 --> 01:09:09,971
please ...

1195
01:09:11,472 --> 01:09:13,016
please ...

1196
01:09:14,308 --> 01:09:16,060
Shy let's okay.

1197
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:20,441
Please do not let him hurt.

1198
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:24,445
Please let it end
this nightmare.

1199
01:09:25,904 --> 01:09:30,366
Please let Stephon, I,
all we come home safely.

1200
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,336
Davee!

1201
01:09:42,337 --> 01:09:43,671
Damn!

1202
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:45,173
Davee, where are you?

1203
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,605
Oh Lord.

1204
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:02,273
this ...

1205
01:10:22,877 --> 01:10:24,504
Davee! I am going!

1206
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,703
Fuck. Davee!

1207
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:41,247
Stephon!

1208
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,045
OMG ...

1209
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,490
My God, my God.

1210
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,676
Fuck.

1211
01:12:54,947 --> 01:12:56,073
Oh, fuck.

1212
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,751
Shit.

1213
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:43,245
Come On!

1214
01:13:44,455 --> 01:13:46,081
Now what are we gonna do?

1215
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:49,626
- Dumbass.
- Yes, muscular.

1216
01:13:49,752 --> 01:13:51,712
- Ah, burly.
- Deposit is the bastard.

1217
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,713
You dont have anything. Nothing!

1218
01:13:55,173 --> 01:13:56,591
He has gel in his hair.

1219
01:13:56,674 --> 01:14:00,053
What do you think, eh?

1220
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:01,763
- Motherfucker.
- Why come here?

1221
01:14:01,888 --> 01:14:03,639
We have been here all ...

1222
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:14,609
Well, you're in trouble, right?

1223
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:19,448
Yes?

1224
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:24,620
I told them to get the hell out of my property.

1225
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:27,331
This is your fault!

1226
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:32,294
We do not have many women here.

1227
01:14:33,462 --> 01:14:35,464
We do not ...

1228
01:14:36,715 --> 01:14:39,176
a boy like you ...

1229
01:14:39,259 --> 01:14:40,511
muscular.

1230
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:45,014
You live with that skinny bitch.

1231
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:49,310
It's not fair!

1232
01:14:50,395 --> 01:14:51,896
You know what I do?

1233
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,189
Do it, Donnie.

1234
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:55,233
- I'll take my knife ...
- Show him.

1235
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:59,028
And I'll cut your face.

1236
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:02,240
You I'm going to cut ...

1237
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:04,408
I'm going to ...

1238
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,708
you I'll show ...

1239
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:15,212
- Yes! Come On!
- Before you make love and fuck!

1240
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:26,682
- Easy, boy.
- I liked that.

1241
01:15:26,765 --> 01:15:29,101
- Puta.
- I liked that.

1242
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:32,521
Now he will have his turn.

1243
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,735
I think this
you'll learn a few things.

1244
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:42,363
So give her case.

1245
01:15:42,447 --> 01:15:47,160
You can find the perfect spot.

1246
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,039
F?llatelo!

1247
01:15:51,122 --> 01:15:53,791
Do you remember me?
I met in the city.

1248
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:56,503
Yes, bitch!

1249
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:01,592
Freeze!

1250
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,385
Stop him!

1251
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:06,889
It is twisting!

1252
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:09,850
This they did
A long time ago,

1253
01:16:09,975 --> 01:16:12,102
motherfuckers.

1254
01:16:12,227 --> 01:16:13,228
Come On!

1255
01:16:14,438 --> 01:16:15,814
Yes! You like it?

1256
01:16:19,318 --> 01:16:21,570
You fuck, motherfucker!

1257
01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:22,988
It is not as strong.

1258
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:24,948
Now it's not so hard!

1259
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,619
- Muscular.
- Get used to this.

1260
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:31,871
Come on, do you like?

1261
01:16:31,996 --> 01:16:33,414
- You finished?
- Did you finish, Kyle?

1262
01:16:33,498 --> 01:16:35,083
- I think it's over.
