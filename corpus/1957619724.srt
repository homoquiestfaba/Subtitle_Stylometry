00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,048
OF COURSE HE DOES.

216
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:47,019
HE ONLY LEFT BECAUSE
HE WAS FEELING SO BAD
ABOUT BEING OUT OF WORK.

217

HE DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG
US DOWN WITH HIM,

BACK ON HIS FEET...

IF HE'S LIVING DOWN HERE,

220
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,363
HE'S NOT BACK ON
HIS FEET AGAIN.

221
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,234
HE MIGHT NOT
BE DOWN HERE.

THEY CAN REACH YOU?

533
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:19,224
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE'RE
IN BETWEEN PLACES RIGHT NOW.

534
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,661
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST
PUT MY NUMBER DOWN,

535
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:27,132
AND YOU CAN CHECK BACK HERE
AND SEE IF ANYONE HAS CALLED.

536
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,334
I'M MUCH OBLIGED.

537
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,849
BEN, IT'S GETTING LATE.

538
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,585
ALL THE SHELTERS ARE
GOING TO BE FULL.

539
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,522
WE CAN GO TO THAT CAMP
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

540
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,058
NOT ON THE STREET!

541
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,897
IT'S NOT THE STREET.

542
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:03,802
THEY'VE GOT TENTS
AND BLANKETS AND
EVEN PORTABLE BATHROOMS.

543
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,303
LOOK, WE CAN GO
BY THERE,

544
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,471
AND IF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT,

545
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:10,408
THEN WE CAN TRY TO
FIND A MISSION.

546
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,876
ALL RIGHT.

547
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,645
COME ON.

548
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,021
WELL, WELL, WELL...

549
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:27,359
NEVER KNOW WHO'S GONNA
TURN UP FOR DINNER.

550
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,195
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

551
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,663
I'LL FIND YOU A SPOT.

552
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,933
THE CITY AIN'T
CHARGING RENT YET.

553
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:40,739
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE BLANKETS
OR A BEDROLL.

554
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:46,945
HEY, MOTHER THERESA,
CAN YOU SCARE UP A
FEW BLANKETS?

555
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,814
NICK, DIDN'T I ALREADY
GIVE YOU A BLANKET?

556
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,282
IT AIN'T FOR ME.

557
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,652
IT'S FOR MY FRIENDS HERE.

558
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,689
LOOK, I'M SORRY WE DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE BLANKETS
FOR TONIGHT.

559
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,790
COME ON, HONEY.

560
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,824
I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH
WORK FOR ONE DAY.

561
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,825
LET'S GO HOME.

562
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,129
WE COULD GO GET
MORE, DAD.

563
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:08,066
SWEETHEART, WE CAN'T
HELP EVERYBODY.

564
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,236
IT'S JUST ONE
FAMILY.

565
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,605
COME ON, LET'S LOAD
UP THE VAN.

566
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,577
HEY, GEORGE!

567
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,513
YEAH, YEAH.

568
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,883
AH, FORGET THAT GUY.

569
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,919
LET ME SEE WHAT
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

570
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,959
WHAT ABOUT THESE TABLECLOTHS?

571
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,162
MOM WON'T MIND.

572
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:43,168
HEY, COME OVER HERE!

573
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,469
JENNIFER!

574
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,337
JENNIFER, WOULD
YOU PLEASE GET
BACK IN THE VAN!

575
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,773
HERE.

576
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,377
TAKE IT.

577
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,479
GOD BLESS YOU.

578
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,425
COME ON.

579
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,633
WHY DOES GOD LET SO
MANY PEOPLE BE HOMELESS?

580
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,836
DON'T BLAME THIS ON GOD.

581
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:21,072
THIS ISN'T PART OF
HIS PLAN, HONEY.

582
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,443
ALL THIS IS A GRIEF
TO HIS HEART.

583
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,745
WHETHER RICH
OR POOR,

584
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,446
THERE'S ALWAYS PAIN
AND SUFFERING WHEN

585
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,815
PEOPLE TURN AGAINST GOD.

586
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,485
JUBE AND I HAVEN'T
TURNED AGAINST GOD.

587
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,455
I KNOW THAT.

588
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,726
LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST
CAME FROM A FUNERAL.

589
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,763
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GOD.

590
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:49,501
OH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

591
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,338
LOOK HERE, TALKIN' AIN'T
NEVER CHANGED NOTHIN'.

592

HARD TIMES CALL FOR
STRONG MEDICINE.

593
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,848
NOW THAT'S BETTER
THAN TALKIN'.

594
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,617
YOU'RE DRUNK!

595
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:10,822
I PREFER TO CALL

THESE PEOPLE IN HERE,

651
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,751
AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN
THIS INTO A SHELTER,

00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,187
NOT A CHURCH.

653
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,490

JUST ONE FAMILY.

656
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,063

658
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,268

659
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,707

EXCUSE ME.

CAN DO FOR YOU?

663
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,135
WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE

00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,372
NO ROOM AT THE INN, I GUESS.

665
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,149

FAMILY SHELTER.

WELL, WE TRIED THEM.

667
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,653
THEY WERE FULL UP.

668
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,756
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS GOD
HEARD YOUR PRAYERS TODAY.

669
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:54,859
AN HOUR AGO,
A FAMILY MOVED OUT.

670
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,873
HI!

I'M THE DIRECTOR HERE.

WELL, YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.

673
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:23,254
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME

THIS IS YOURS.

675
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,267
IS THIS ROOM
JUST FOR US?

676
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:43,975
THE LOCAL CHURCH HELPED THE
FAMILY THAT LIVED HERE FIND
AN APARTMENT.

677
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,810
IT'S A NEW PROGRAM THAT
WE'RE A PART OF THAT

678
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,580
MATCHES HOMELESS FAMILIES
WITH CONGREGATIONS THAT
WANT TO HELP.

679
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,852
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE HAVE MORE FAMILIES
THAN CHURCHES.

680
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,687
DON'T CRY, MOMMA.

681
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,624
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE.

682
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,528
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
RIGHT, CONSTANCE.

683
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,529
THE PEOPLE HERE,

684
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,265
WE ALL KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

685
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,067
WE'VE BEEN IN THE
SAME PLACE OURSELVES.

686
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,170
NO MOUSE.

687
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,008
WHY DON'T YOU WASH UP
AND SETTLE IN?

688
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:20,211
WE'LL TALK MORE
AT DINNER, OKAY?

689
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,486
ARE YOU GOING TO HELP
US FIND OUR FATHER?

690
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,756
IS THAT WHY YOU CAME
TO LOS ANGELES?

691
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:34,392
I SAW HIM ON THE
STREET TWO DAYS AGO.

692
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,194
DID HE SEE YOU?

693
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,900
HE WAS TOO
FAR AWAY.

694
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,671
I KNOW YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, BEN,

695
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:49,373
AND WHETHER YOU FIND YOUR
FATHER OR NOT,

696
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,743
YOU'LL STILL HAVE
DIFFICULT CHOICES AHEAD.

697
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,579
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

698
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,881
GOD'S HELP.

699
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,916
I DON'T WANT HIS KIND OF HELP.

700
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,453
GOD DOESN'T FORCE
HIMSELF ON ANYONE, BEN.

701
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,723
HE'S THERE FOR YOU
IF YOU ASK,

702
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,459
BUT YOU HAVE TO
OPEN THE DOOR

703
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,195
AND INVITE HIM IN.

704
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,499
IF YOU DO THAT...

705
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,901
YOU'LL FIND A FATHER.

706
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,303
I TOLD YOU,
I ALREADY HAVE A FATHER!
