1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:03,218
(woman laughing)

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:05,065
- [Woman] Charlie, Charlie.

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:06,474
- [Man] Life is hard, motherfucker.

4
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,758
- [Doctor] A danger to
yourself or to others.

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,667
- Charlie, Charlie.
- Innocent, innocent.

6
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,614
- Not guilty.
- Charlie.

7
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,173
- [Man] By reason of insanity.

8
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,569
- Charlie!
- Charlie.

9
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,913
Kill for me, Charlie.

10
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,330
Charlie, Charlie.

11
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,479
(dramatic music)

12
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:25,861
- It's madness.

13
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:30,327
The truth is I'm running from
it, from her, from everything.

14
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,324
I can feel her watching me.

15
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:37,367
Around every corner, in
every window, she waits.

16
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,391
(woman laughing)

17
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:44,703
Stop!
(horn honking)

18
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:47,203
(eerie music)

19
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
- Thank you.

20
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,703
Thanks for saving me.

21
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,874
- [Doctor] You seem a
little agitated today.

22
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:36,944
Did you leave the halfway house too soon?

23
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:37,777
- I'm fine.

24
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:41,457
- Do we need to do a blood test?

25
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,344
- What for?

26
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:47,054
- Come clean with me, Charlie.

27
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:49,334
I'm here to help you,
always remember that.

28
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:52,294
If you have a problem,
it's okay to get help.

29
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:53,214
If you're slipping--

30
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,447
- I'm not.

31
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:58,097
- Remember, a danger to
yourself or to others.

32
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:05,617
- You know me, Dr.
Resner, I like everyone.

33
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,737
- Good.

34
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,824
You must always fight your urges.

35
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:17,387
- I met a little girl that
looked like my sister before.

36
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,624
- [Doctor] Before she died.

37
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:21,304
- As opposed to what?

38
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:22,137
- [Doctor] You're not still having

39
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,564
the dreams about her, are you?

40
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,927
- Not for a few months, a year.

41
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,304
- That's what I like to hear.

42
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:32,484
How's the new place?

43
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:38,584
- I met the girl that used to
live there, she talks to me.

44
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,717
- That's good, it's nice to have friends.

45
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,754
Is she pretty?

46
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:43,907
- She was beautiful.

47
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,614
- I'll see you next week, Mr. Cavenaugh.

48
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:53,224
(tools buzzing)
- Hey, Charlie!

49
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,307
Hey, Charlie!

50
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:01,555
Fuckin' freak.

51
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:16,120
You heard me the whole time, didn't you?

52
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,364
You're a weird kid, Cavenaugh.

53
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:22,051
- Thank you, Mr. Lincock.

54
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,727
- You trying to be a funny guy?

55
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,734
I want you to show the new guy
around, train him a little.

56
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,294
Make sure he knows he can't
get away with shit around here.

57
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:34,127
- I don't train.

58
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,937
- You train or I report you.

59
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,154
- You shouldn't do that.

60
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,444
- You finish the papers, Buckler?

61
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:55,894
- Even know how to spell too.

62
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,137
- Another wise ass.

63
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,554
It's all they ever send me.

64
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,904
Okay, this here's Charlie Cavenaugh,

65
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:07,454
the best machinist I got.

66
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:08,794
He'll be showing you around.

67
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:10,044
- Dave Buckler.

68
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,727
Most people call me Buck, like a dollar.

69
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:15,177
- Charlie.

70
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:18,737
- Get to work.

71
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,344
- Hey, don't worry about it,
you don't have to teach me.

72
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,044
I just spent 18 months practicing.

73
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,262
There you go, take it.

74
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:02,124
You know, you remind me of
this guy I used to know.

75
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:02,957
Good friend.

76
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,044
Hey, Char, what do you do
for kicks around this joint?

77
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:15,897
- Not much.

78
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,614
- Yeah, I gotta quit smokin' this shit.

79
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,944
In the joint, you can't help it, right?

80
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,844
So what put you here in this hellhole?

81
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:24,787
Hey, no problem, Chief.

82
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,234
Just trying to make a little conversation.

83
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,957
You know, pass the monotony
away, you know how it is.

84
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,894
What do you say you and I go
see a movie or play some pool

85
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:33,357
or somethin' like that?

86
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:35,844
Got to kinda feel my
way around this joint.

87
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,364
- I can't today.

88
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,604
See you tomororw.

89
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,134
- Yeah, maybe tomorrow, huh?

90
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,047
Walk easy.

91
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,130
Fuckin' place is gonna drive me nuts.

92
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,797
(ominous music)

93
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:00,874
- You the neighbor, right?

94
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,774
You need to score?

95
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:12,767
Hey, Quote, is that
motherfucker staring at us?

96
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,521
- Hey, you need somethin'?

97
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,234
Oh what, you don't hear me?

98
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:21,954
Go get him, Jerry.

99
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,773
(somber music)

100
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,884
- [Charlie] It was the darkness in me.

101
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,374
And everything else was
gone until I met her,

102
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:33,344
the girl that used to live here before me,

103
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,944
the one who left in a bathtub
full of her own blood.

104
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,694
She owns my dreams like
she owns this place.

105
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,474
Chillingly, breathtakingly, beautiful.

106
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,607
She knows who I am.

107
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:49,011
- [Woman] Come to me, Charlie.

108
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,104
- Dear Pasqua killed herself

109
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,754
because she didn't have the time.

110
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,491
- Do I look dead to you?

111
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,691
- You look like a vampire
sent to punish me.

112
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,404
- I'll give you everlasting life.

113
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:07,331
- Life, life is for the living.

114
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,709
- Like your family, Charlie?

115
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,324
Killer, I'll get you.

116
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:24,884
- Where you going so fast, boy?

117
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:25,804
- Late.
- Late, man.

118
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:28,064
If you late, why you gonna bother, huh?

119
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:29,097
What do you say you look at something?

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,613
- Take it easy, man.

121
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,244
- No harm, just a look.

122
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,387
Okay, you'll see.

123
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:36,397
Hey, Janetta, get on out here.

124
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:40,154
You're gonna love this pussy, boy.

125
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:43,367
This girl's fresh, hot off
the press, ain't broken in.

126
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,064
- I have to go.

127
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,874
- Man, it ain't like I seen
any ladies going to your room.

128
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:54,757
- She's a baby.

129
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,954
- That's the best kind.

130
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:03,014
Chance of a lifetime.

131
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,314
You can break her in, boy.

132
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,121
He's probably a fag anyway.

133
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,408
Why don't you go in and
make us some pancakes?

134
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:19,075
(tools buzzing)

135
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:22,814
- Hey, where you been, brother man?

136
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,321
That Lincock guy is pissed.

137
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,372
- I had a bad dream.

138
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,205
- Huh?

139
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,177
- I had a bad dream.
- What?

140
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,544
- I had a bad dream!

141
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,744
- Yeah, I dabble in
dreams sometimes myself.

142
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,440
- You're a funny guy, Buck.

143
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,604
- Well, it gets me by,
you know what I mean?

144
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,304
Sometimes you just step in
it and keep right on going.

145
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,584
Speaking of shit.

146
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,244
- Nice of you to show up, Cavenaugh.

147
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,864
- His mom was sick.

148
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:48,544
- Nice try, Buckler.

149
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:49,744
His mom is dead.

150
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,414
Is there something you
weren't shown yesterday?

151
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,364
- Yeah, but charlie showed me just now.

152
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,474
- Great, I got a shop full of losers,

153
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,936
and now you're showing up late too.

154
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:02,136
- It won't happen again.

155
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,094
- We need to start our
own business, my man.

156
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,747
You know more about machining
than that guy ever will.

157
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,234
You know, you remind me of
this good friend of mine.

158
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,794
One of them quiet, smart type of guys

159
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,144
you can't quite figure out.

160
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,044
This guy Lou Labonte.

161
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:29,894
He was kind of like my
mentor in the pen, you know?

162
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,694
He had dreams.

163
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:34,787
Kinda took me under his wing,
you know, got me straight.

164
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,444
Taught me to see some things.

165
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,897
He died of cancer not too long ago.

166
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,447
Say, Char, use a carton of sticks, man?

167
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,371
- No, thank you.

168
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,657
- You got a girl, Char?

169
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,542
Well, maybe I can fix you up sometime.

170
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,094
Why don't you go get a
bite of something with me?

171
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,894
If I don't eat now, I'm gonna smoke.

172
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,384
- Megan says she can get me this job

173
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:05,824
working over at Calhoun's.

174
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:07,804
It's a lot less fucked
up than things here.

175
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:09,764
Anyway, the pay is pretty good.

176
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,344
- I'm ready to order
now if you don't mind.

177
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,177
- How you doing today?

178
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:15,334
- I'll take a ham and cheese
on rye, provolone cheese,

179
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:18,514
with lettuce that isn't
wilted like last time.

180
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,734
And hold the mustard.

181
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,134
Are you gonna take my order?

182
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,754
Give me your manager.

183
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,771
- Dude, I asked you how you're
doing, and all you can say

184
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,189
is I'll have a ham and
cheese with provolone?

185
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,278
I was just trying to be nice.

186
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,060
- I don't give a damn what you think.

187
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,393
(punch cracking)

188
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:38,226
(dramatic music)

189
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:54,557
- I'm sorry, that was bad.

190
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,371
- He started it, right?

191
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,414
- I'll have a turkey sub.

192
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:20,707
- So where you want to eat, brother man?

193
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:23,120
- I gotta go.

194
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,299
- Man, he's saying 15.

195
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,005
- I need 20 on that.

196
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:31,838
- 20.

197
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:36,767
- Well well, what kind of
carrot juice you drinking?

198
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,086
- I'm no rabbit.

199
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:42,484
- (laughs) Fuckin' crackhead.

200
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:44,594
- I need something to help me sleep.

201
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,574
- [Jerry] We got it all
if you got the money.

202
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:47,624
- [Charlie] How much?

203
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,767
- You know, I knew you were
gonna come visit me real soon.

204
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,374
- I need to sleep.

205
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,337
- 20 bucks.

206
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:13,817
- Sweet dreams, killer. (laughs)

207
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,178
- I didn't mean to scare yoo.

208
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,987
I can save you from all that, Charlie.

209
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:03,834
- This time I came to save you.

210
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,784
- Why would I want to go back there?

211
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,734
- Why wouldn't you?

212
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:15,730
- I can't.

213
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:17,774
- You're not real.

214
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:23,387
- Last time your father beat
you, you laughed, didn't you?

215
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,577
You laughed because you knew
what was going to happen,

216
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,244
didn't you, Charlie?

217
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,601
Kiss me.

218
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,728
(Pasqua laughing)

219
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,124
- [Doctor] An accident?

220
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,734
- Work.

221
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:01,727
- Any dreams?

222
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:05,434
- Everyone has dreams.

223
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,197
- Do you ever dream about your mom?

224
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:11,424
Why do you think that is?

225
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,664
- Because she could've saved us.

226
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,444
She didn't have to stay with that monster.

227
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:17,734
- [Doctor] Are you still angry at her?

228
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:21,497
- No, she was just trying
to keep it together.

229
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,334
- [Doctor] It's okay to
talk about this, Charlie.

230
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,084
It's okay to feel guilty,
too, but it wasn't your fault.

231
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:30,084
Your father killing
your mother and sister,

232
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:31,394
that wasn't your fault.

233
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:33,107
You had to kill your father or else he--

234
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,077
- Look, Doc, I should get to work.

235
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:37,539
You think you can give me

236
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,554
a little somethin' to help me sleep?

237
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,234
- I don't think that
would be such a good idea

238
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,124
given your past addictions, do you?

239
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,324
- You're probably right.

240
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,524
- I want you to come
back tomorrow, Charlie.

241
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,874
I want to talk to you
when you're not so tired.

242
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,664
I think it's time to
open some closed doors.

243
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,457
Look back so maybe we can
start to look forward.

244
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:03,472
- If you think so.

245
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,057
Tomorrow then.

246
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,641
- I'll see you tomorrow, Charlie.

247
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,511
(tools buzzing)

248
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,081
- [Charlie] They think they know me.

249
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,567
They think they understand me.

250
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:18,707
The thing is, I'm sane.

251
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:21,914
Pasqua sees that.

252
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:28,264
After years of solitude,
someone's finally come for me.

253
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,257
- So you ain't mad at me, are you, Char?

254
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,277
- No reason to be.

255
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,564
- Just the way you did about
five guys' worth of work

256
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:49,994
in there, you know?

257
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,547
Figured something was on your mind.

258
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,324
- I had a long night.

259
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:57,824
- Bowed her up good, did ya?

260
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:05,654
- Listen, Buck, do you know
anyone that could score for me?

261
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,147
- It's bad karma.

262
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:19,937
- Okay.

263
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:28,014
- Hey, Char, if I had a little
get together, would you come?

264
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:29,664
Got this girl I want you to meet.

265
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:35,604
- Thank you, I probably shouldn't.

266
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:38,184
- Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, man.

267
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,911
It'll be fun, huh, huh?

268
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,194
- Fun's good.

269
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,344
- Good, I'm gonna set it up, all right?

270
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,187
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

271
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,530
- Take care, Chief.

272
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,224
(eerie dreamlike music)

273
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,263
(kids chattering)

274
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:01,314
- [Jerry] Hey man, you need to get up.

275
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,941
- We got the ride ticket for you, boy.

276
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,017
- Not now.

277
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,154
- Man, you should fuck
him up for that shit, man.

278
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:10,467
Crazy fuckin' freak.

279
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,654
- That's a valued customer right there.

280
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,380
(phone ringing)

281
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,887
(eerie music)

282
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,326
- Charlie, innocent Charlie.

283
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,462
Who killed those men?

284
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:24,807
- [Charlie] One, two, five,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

285
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:28,057
- (laughs) Hi, Chucky.

286
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,367
- You're caught, punish him.

287
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,442
- Say good night.

288
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,257
- Save me, Charlie.

289
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:40,271
- Say goodbye, Charlie.

290
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:42,771
(eerie music)

291
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,874
(knocking)

292
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:21,314
- Good day, sir.

293
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:22,254
My name is Hank,

294
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,234
and I'm your neighborhood
carrier for the Tribune.

295
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:25,994
I know you've heard of the Tribune

296
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:28,594
because it's the top carrier
of local news in this area.

297
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:29,824
Yes, sir.

298
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:30,657
- [Charlie] No, thank you.

299
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:32,881
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
please, please hear me out

300
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:34,534
because I got some special
offers for you today.

301
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,794
That's right, eight-week
and 12-week offers.

302
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:37,744
And I know once you hear 'em,

303
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,324
you'll know you must,
must take the Tribune.

304
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:41,784
- No, thank you.
- Well, that's all right

305
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,194
if you don't need any right now.

306
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:44,634
I mean, we bill at the end of the month,

307
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,464
and it's only pennies a day.

308
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:50,744
And I got a special offer
for you, too, I know.

309
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:54,034
Right here, if you sign right
here, you get a special gift.

310
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,104
A real gift.

311
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,454
- Look, I don't have any money.

312
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,274
- Well, that's all right,
you don't need it right now.

313
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:59,344
We'll bill you at the end of the month.

314
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:02,064
Only a few pennies a day,
sir, and you get a free gift.

315
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:04,904
All you've got to do is sign
right here on the dotted line.

316
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:05,804
- Back out.

317
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,534
- Please, please, look, I
know you need the Tribune.

318
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,834
You got to have the Tribune.

319
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,994
Look, look, look I don't
want to go back, so--

320
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:12,957
- Get out!

321
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,274
- Well, maybe next time.

322
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:18,654
Maybe in a couple days or maybe next week

323
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:21,770
or some other time when
it's better for you.

324
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,270
(eerie music)

325
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:42,879
- Hey there, Charlie.

326
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:44,468
(Buck knocking)

327
00:25:44,468 --> 00:25:46,074
I'll take good care of you, my sweet.

328
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,487
- [Buck] You in there, Char?

329
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,757
- Don't let him take you
away from me, Charlie.

330
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:54,610
He's not your friend.

331
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,277
(Buck knocking)

332
00:26:03,592 --> 00:26:06,259
(Buck knocking)

333
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,455
- I knew you were here.

334
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:16,518
- Hey, Buck.

335
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:20,194
- Mr. Lincock was pretty
pissed off at you today.

336
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,587
I told him you were sick, all right?

337
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,057
You got a great place here, Char.

338
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:27,437
- I had the flu.

339
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:31,754
- So just came by to tell
you that party is gonna be

340
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,357
on Saturday night if you're
feeling better by then.

341
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,254
Got some real winners living
downstairs, don't you?

342
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:40,797
- I might be busy, sorry.

343
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:42,874
- What's going on, Char?

344
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:44,424
Got this whole thing arranged, man.

345
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,274
You're supposed to meet these chicks.

346
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:49,994
- The flu.

347
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,254
- The flu?

348
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:53,254
Planning on having the flu this weekend?

349
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:56,037
- Okay, I'll be there.

350
00:26:57,444 --> 00:26:59,627
I just need to get a
little sleep right now.

351
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,897
- Don't have to ask this dog twice.

352
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:09,009
Just wanted to make sure you were alive.

353
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:09,967
Sweet dreams.

354
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,634
(ominous music)

355
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:19,414
- [Pasqua] I'm glad you came back.

356
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:21,584
I thought your friends had you cornered.

357
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:24,014
- [Charlie] How do you know
what happens when I'm awake?

358
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,514
- Because I'm always with you.

359
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:30,224
- How come we never fly in these dreams?

360
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:34,387
With my sister, sometimes we'd fly.

361
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,534
- Because I'm real.

362
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:38,544
She's dead.

363
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:41,399
Don't be mad at me.

364
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,127
Lay with me.

365
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,478
Make love to me.

366
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,354
Cross over with me, Charlie.

367
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,151
Be with me.

368
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:39,828
(laughs) You're a very bad boy, Charlie.

369
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:44,679
Very bad boy.
(slaps cracking)

370
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:45,512
- No!

371
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:00,744
(pills rattling)

372
00:30:43,114 --> 00:30:43,947
- Friend or foe?

373
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,244
- Just lookin' for you.

374
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,208
- You were so unfriendly last time.

375
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:57,404
Now you wanna talk?

376
00:30:58,495 --> 00:30:59,412
- Purchase.

377
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:01,792
- Purchase.

378
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:09,317
I guess we're friends
again now, aren't we?

379
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,164
You lookin' to float?

380
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:15,418
- Nah, I need to get up.

381
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:18,741
- That's easy enough.

382
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:27,708
It's just a question of how high.

383
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,208
(eerie music)

384
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,306
(Pasqua laughing)

385
00:31:58,306 --> 00:31:59,889
- [Pasqua] Charlie.

386
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,931
Come to me, Charlie.

387
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:04,348
Innocent, guilty.

388
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,941
Charlie.

389
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:09,308
- By reason of insanity.
- Charlie!

390
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:12,028
- [Pasqua] Kill for me, Charlie.

391
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:12,861
Charlie.

392
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,337
- Where the hell have you been?

393
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,397
What the fuck are you doing, huh?

394
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:33,487
Your fuckin' quack has been
calling, looking for you.

395
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,724
What'd you do, finally
go on a killing spree?

396
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,454
- What time is it?

397
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:41,531
- You're late, Cavenaugh,
that's what time it is.

398
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:44,257
- I couldn't help being sick.

399
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:46,817
- I ain't stupid, and you ain't sick.

400
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,114
You better think long and
hard whether you still want

401
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:53,004
this job because I'm gonna
give you one more chance.

402
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,804
That's it, no more.

403
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:56,816
Goddamn it!

404
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:09,774
- Doing all right, Charlie boy?

405
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,837
- Yeah, I just want to
apologize for yesterday.

406
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,327
I wasn't feeling in the right mind.

407
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:20,454
- Hey, no problem.

408
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,334
We boys, right?

409
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,317
- Right, things will be better now.

410
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:27,807
- You need to get laid, my man.

411
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,297
- I did yesterday.

412
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:33,274
- I swear you get more than me.

413
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:35,194
Here I am trying to fix you up.

414
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,794
You got any friends for me?

415
00:33:36,794 --> 00:33:38,544
- Any friend she has would be dead.

416
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,551
- Look, I ain't too picky, I'll meet her.

417
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,754
You wait and see this girl
I fix you up with, man.

418
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:46,927
She's cool, she won't fuck with your mind.

419
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:48,707
- Good.

420
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:52,187
I got to go now.

421
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:56,004
I got an appointment.

422
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,597
- Hey, I peed in my PO's cup yesterday.

423
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,387
Later, Char.

424
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,404
- I'll transfer your
call to his office now.

425
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:10,351
- Let me demonstrate, I grabbed
the loon like this, right?

426
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,451
Got him a nice little.

427
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:15,587
You mind your own business, okay loser?

428
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:20,164
Okay, this guy didn't say okay, all right?

429
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:22,684
Instead he went fuckin'
ballistic on me, so I grabbed

430
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,937
the mace and maced his ass
right in the fuckin' eyes.

431
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,254
- Uh huh.
- So he's lying

432
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:28,957
on the floor, hootin' and
hollerin' my eyes, my eyes.

433
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:30,944
I nonchalantly walk over there,

434
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,234
and wham right in the fuckin' balls.

435
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:34,417
Got to watch them, man.

436
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,044
I think these people ought
to all be put to sleep.

437
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:38,604
Because these people today are dangerous.

438
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:40,166
Got to watch your back, man.

439
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,324
You got to kick 'em in the
balls, kick 'em in the balls.

440
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:42,674
They'll bite your nose off.

441
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,165
(eerie music)

442
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,774
- Good work, my Charlie.

443
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,363
I think it's so funny.

444
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,404
Oh, it feels so good.

445
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:04,307
- Charlie?

446
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:08,187
Charlie?

447
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:12,754
Charlie, this isn't your home.

448
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:14,254
The doctor is waiting for you.

449
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:17,324
- Just one moment.

450
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:22,757
Bad flu, huh?

451
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:26,227
I guess it'll pass.

452
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:29,254
How are you doing otherwise?

453
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:31,977
- Fine as ever.

454
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,734
- I'm afraid for your own good,

455
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:37,334
I'll have to order a
urine test immediately.

456
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:38,504
- What have I done?

457
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,824
- No one said you did anything, Charlie.

458
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,724
I'm only here for your own good, okay.

459
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,434
I just want to make
sure you're not slipping

460
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,054
on all the gains that you've made.

461
00:35:47,054 --> 00:35:48,984
- I'm not going back in a facility.

462
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:51,017
- No one said anything about a facility.

463
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:54,504
- So you already have one in mind.

464
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:56,404
- I didn't mean to upset you, Charlie.

465
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:58,954
I'm just concerned about you.

466
00:35:58,954 --> 00:36:01,534
You look like you may
not be doing so well.

467
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,024
- I told you I had the flu.

468
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,701
What more do you want, Doc, hm?

469
00:36:06,504 --> 00:36:08,524
I have a great job and a girlfriend now.

470
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:11,274
How much more normal you want to get?

471
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:13,324
- You never told me you had a girlfriend.

472
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:19,154
- I've done nothing
but tell you about her.

473
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:19,987
- [Doctor] When?

474
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:22,144
(Charlie laughs)

475
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,714
Is this girl, has this girl you're seeing

476
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:26,654
ever been in care too?

477
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:29,263
- Why, is that the only kind of woman

478
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:30,938
you could ever see me with?

479
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,124
- I'm warning you,
Charlie, just calm down.

480
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,917
I'm only trying to help you, okay?

481
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:41,781
- Sorry, Dr. Resner, this
flu has just worn me out.

482
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:45,206
- I believe you.

483
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:47,487
- You're kinda the rock
that's kept me in place.

484
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:52,147
- Well, of course I do the
best I can, as I'm sure you do.

485
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:57,774
- If you don't mind, I better
get home and get some sleep.

486
00:36:57,774 --> 00:36:59,967
How soon can we schedule
that next appointment?

487
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,494
- [Doctor] Angela, how soon
can we schedule an appointment

488
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:08,391
for Charlie Cavenaugh?

489
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:17,514
- Good day, gentlemen.

490
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,994
You ever get the feeling
life is meaningless

491
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:20,454
when you don't have friends?

492
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,504
- Who else you buying shit from, cracker?

493
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:24,964
- I ain't buyin' it, that's just it.

494
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:27,384
It's all bullshit, know what I mean?

495
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,374
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

496
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:32,227
So what do you need, a
little blow, blowjob?

497
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:34,404
- Pretty funny, blow.

498
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:38,004
Nah, actually I just want
to finally introduce myself.

499
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:38,837
Yeah--
- Don't.

500
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:43,544
- You're always too
cohesively busy to talk.

501
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:45,861
My name's Charlie Cavenaugh, and you?

502
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:50,757
- I'm Quote.

503
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:52,624
My associate Jerry here.

504
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:55,915
- You know, this motherfucker's
really asking for it, man.

505
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:57,465
- I'm just being social to you.

506
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:01,054
My doctor says it's a good idea.

507
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:07,434
- The good customers, they
catch a break for a short time.

508
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:10,550
This doctor friend of yours,

509
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,097
he got anything to sell wholesale?

510
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:15,334
- I don't know, I'll ask him.

511
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,134
For now, I better get my sleep.

512
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:20,097
- Yeah, do that, you fuckin' loon.

513
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:24,224
- Trust me, you shouldn't talk like that.

514
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,795
What if Pasqua heard?

515
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:29,244
- What you say?

516
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:32,017
Wait, wait, what you say?

517
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,184
What'd he say?

518
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:35,984
Damn.

519
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:38,484
(eerie music)

520
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:44,274
- Why do you kill?

521
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:49,377
Why do you kill?

522
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:53,567
- The same reason as you, Charlie.

523
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:57,687
- I don't want anyone hurt.

524
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,004
- I only love you.

525
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,486
You did it, not me.

526
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,954
- I didn't kill anybody.

527
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:05,144
- You killed your father, didn't you?

528
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:06,664
- With reason!

529
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:08,217
At least I didn't kill myself.

530
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,924
(smack cracking)

531
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:13,304
- When are you gonna tell
the whole truth, Charlie?

532
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,304
When are you gonna see I'm the only way?

533
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:17,427
The truth and a light.

534
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,257
I'll never leave you.

535
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,702
(glass shattering)
- Hey, what's up, man?

536
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:27,037
(dog barking)
What?

537
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,127
Man, fuck you!

538
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:35,424
Hey, your bitch still got that big ass?

539
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:39,004
- Hey, could you keep it
down out there, please?

540
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,194
- [Jerry] What?

541
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,884
Yeah, okay, I'll keep
it down for you, man.

542
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:43,643
Yeah, I'll keep it down for you.

543
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:44,476
(glass shattering)

544
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,407
Why don't you come out here and make me?

545
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,587
You fucking crackhead,
why don't you come out

546
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,814
and let me kick the shit out of you, huh?

547
00:40:51,814 --> 00:40:52,897
Come on.

548
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:56,397
Stupid ass bitch.

549
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,182
I'll fuck you up.

550
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,225
What's up?

551
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:05,812
Hey. (whistles)

552
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:07,112
Hey, baby doll, come here.

553
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,973
Come here.

554
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:14,851
(eerie music)

555
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:30,335
(kids chattering)

556
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,627
- Are you my sister or Pasqua in disguise?

557
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,054
- You know who I am.

558
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:44,107
- I'm so sorry.

559
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:48,044
You've never left my mind.

560
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:50,067
- But I have left your dreams.

561
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:53,068
You have to save yourself, Charlie.

562
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:54,954
Get help.

563
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:03,037
(Charlie crying)

564
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:04,620
- I'm your brother.

565
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,417
Oh shit.

566
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:45,254
Not too smart.

567
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:51,074
Yeah, I know he's out of town already.

568
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:53,774
I was just wondering if I could come in

569
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:55,274
and see someone else possibly.

570
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:57,974
(ominous music)

571
00:42:57,974 --> 00:42:58,997
I have cash.

572
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,847
You don't seem to understand, I need help.

573
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:10,717
But I know my appointment
isn't until next week.

574
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:13,647
Hello, hello?

575
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:15,527
I have cash!

576
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:32,769
- Son of a bitch!

577
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:34,570
Now get back to work.

578
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,403
Goddamn.

579
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,394
Uh uh, stop right there.

580
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:42,704
This job starts at 7:00 a.m.

581
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,984
Apparently you don't believe
me when I say don't come back

582
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,327
if you can't be on time.

583
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:48,234
- [Charlie] I had to
pick up a prescription.

584
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:49,744
It won't happen again.

585
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:51,464
- You're damn right it won't happen.

586
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:53,394
Just walk right out of here, Charlie.

587
00:43:53,394 --> 00:43:54,294
- [Buck] Ease up, boss.

588
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,494
- If you want to keep
working here, Buckler,

589
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:58,354
get back to your press.

590
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:00,204
Me and the mental patient are talkin'.

591
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,414
- Hey, don't say that.

592
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:05,264
- Well, what'd you think, Buckler,

593
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:06,907
that he was a parolee like you?

594
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,643
Now get back to your press.

595
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:24,714
I can't fire you fuckin'
lunatics or I would.

596
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:26,107
- Maybe I didn't hear you.

597
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:28,774
- [Lincock] I said I
can't fire you lunatics.

598
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,870
The goddamn state won't let me.

599
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,583
(Lincock choking)

600
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:37,583
Please get off me.

601
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:38,874
Get off!

602
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:42,391
- Charlie!

603
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:46,885
Damn it, Charlie, listen!

604
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,135
Don't kill him!

605
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:01,295
Charlie!

606
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:02,411
- Don't try to make that good.

607
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:04,317
- Mr. Lincock's all right, Charlie.

608
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,774
- Thanks for being my friend.

609
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:09,184
- Wait.

610
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,684
Look, Mr. Lincock ain't gonna
want some government guys

611
00:45:11,684 --> 00:45:14,354
coming around here trying to
figure this out, all right?

612
00:45:14,354 --> 00:45:15,694
I can work it out, man.

613
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:17,354
- I would've killed him.
- I can fuckin' work it out.

614
00:45:17,354 --> 00:45:18,554
- I would've killed him.

615
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:28,114
- So I put the shit right
in his fuckin' mouth

616
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:30,714
and I asked him if it really
meant that much to him.

617
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,437
Fuckin' bitch.

618
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:37,314
You wanna talk shit now, freak?

619
00:45:38,244 --> 00:45:41,107
I'm gonna fuck your shit
up, you goddamn mental case.

620
00:45:44,514 --> 00:45:45,547
- So how you gonna get home?

621
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:49,877
The stairs?

622
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:54,744
What you got to barter with?

623
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:55,994
- [Charlie] Trade.

624
00:45:55,994 --> 00:45:57,744
- We ain't no fuckin' Indians, man.

625
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:01,858
- Hey.

626
00:46:06,786 --> 00:46:08,034
What you got there, Charlie?

627
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:08,884
- That's my name.

628
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:12,914
- Just say it, Quote,
and it's done, kicked.

629
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:13,747
- Trade.

630
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:25,767
- Oh, this is minor league, baby.

631
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:28,277
Kiddie candy.

632
00:46:29,974 --> 00:46:32,224
This doctor must not
like you very much, huh?

633
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:34,184
Ain't got no trade.

634
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:39,624
- Can you spot me till tomorrow?

635
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,994
- Just like everyone else,
he wants it for free now.

636
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:46,414
Like we owe him something and shit.

637
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:49,450
- I can pay tomorrow, I just
need a little somethin'.

638
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,033
- You get the fuck out of here.

639
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,804
You come back when you get your check.

640
00:46:56,804 --> 00:46:57,824
- My pills.

641
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,804
- Yours or ours?

642
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:00,637
- Mine.

643
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:02,314
- You be careful what you ask for.

644
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:06,259
I just might give it to you.

645
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:08,873
- [Jerry] Fuck!

646
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,143
(Quote laughs)

647
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:13,976
Damn!

648
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:17,654
- Boy, you gotta give
that crazy guy credit.

649
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:18,894
- Give him credit?

650
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:20,694
I'm gonna fuckin' kill his ass, man.

651
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:22,947
Fuck!

652
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:43,416
(Charlie shouting)

653
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:07,657
- There can be do doubt that
what is usual is unusual.

654
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:12,417
What's normal is insane.

655
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:17,537
What's a dream is reality.

656
00:48:22,414 --> 00:48:24,011
- I'll never leave you.

657
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
I'll never laugh at you.

658
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,956
You'll never be lonely again.

659
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:37,034
My sweet killer.

660
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:46,191
(Jerry knocking)

661
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:49,424
- You got lucky today, you freak.

662
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:53,187
You can hide all you want,
but you're still a junkie.

663
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:56,454
You listening in there, boy?

664
00:48:57,911 --> 00:48:59,998
You know I'm gonna fuck you up, huh?

665
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:00,831
- [Woman] Shut the fuck up!

666
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:03,967
- I'm gonna get you soon,
you know that right?

667
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:06,104
- [Man] Knock that shit off!

668
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:08,464
We're trying to sleep over here!

669
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:10,564
- Why don't you come out here and make me?

670
00:49:12,404 --> 00:49:13,987
That's what I thought, punk.

671
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:18,914
Nice lipstick, fag.

672
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,654
(punch cracking)

673
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:24,844
- You want my consideration?

674
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:28,467
Consideration, do you
want my consideration?

675
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:29,300
- Yeah.

676
00:49:35,074 --> 00:49:37,824
(Jerry coughing)

677
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:52,874
- The doctor is gone for
the rest of the week.

678
00:49:52,874 --> 00:49:55,474
- That's funny, he called me.

679
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:58,274
He said to come down and pick
up my Valium prescription.

680
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,304
- That is funny since Dr. Resner

681
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:04,533
doesn't give Valium
prescriptions, Charlie.

682
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:08,784
- (laughs) Gee, I didn't
think you knew my name.

683
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:10,934
- I know who you are, now leave.

684
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:14,534
- Now I would very much appreciate it

685
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:17,064
if you would give me some
pills to help me sleep

686
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:19,254
until Dr. Resner gets home from Hawaii.

687
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:21,232
- The Cayman Islands.

688
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:23,065
- Cayman Islands then!

689
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,694
Please give me my pills.

690
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:30,444
Samples will be fine.

691
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,677
- Leave now if you don't want any trouble.

692
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:40,471
- Open the window, Angela!

693
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,897
I need to make a phone call.

694
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:03,907
Can I speak with Dave Buckler please?

695
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:09,307
No, I can't leave a message.

696
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,597
You see, it's a family tragedy.

697
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:17,167
Yes, a murder.

698
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,327
Please, can I talk to him?

699
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:34,014
Hey, Buck, meet me after work, okay?

700
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:40,774
I need to talk to you.

701
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:46,204
Yeah.

702
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:52,204
I don't suppose I can help you.

703
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:55,544
- Yeah, go peacefully and
you won't have to get maced.

704
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:58,714
- No problem, I was just trying
to pick up my prescription.

705
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:01,624
- You seem to have scared
some people, Charlie.

706
00:52:01,624 --> 00:52:04,084
And it's not good to scare people.

707
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:05,134
- Her name is Angela!

708
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:09,184
Question to answer.

709
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:10,847
You don't believe in God, do you?

710
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:15,427
You lie in bed at night
wondering what's the void?

711
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:18,081
And they say I'm crazy.

712
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,831
(blows thudding)

713
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:26,294
- You gonna fuckin' kick him or what?

714
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:30,195
Good.

715
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,154
And you're damn lucky I
don't have you arrested.

716
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,944
Because I could rightfully
have you locked up

717
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:42,534
till Dr. Resner gets back, but I won't.

718
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,664
Now Mr. Cavenaugh, I want
you to exit the building

719
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:46,504
and don't come back until
your next appointment.

720
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:47,527
You understand me?

721
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:50,364
You're very lucky.

722
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:57,484
These fuckin' loons, man.

723
00:52:57,484 --> 00:52:58,694
What'd I tell you?

724
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:00,094
- You're right, that is fun.

725
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,869
- You look like shit.

726
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:16,097
Hey, good news, you can come back to work.

727
00:53:18,714 --> 00:53:19,984
Why not?

728
00:53:19,984 --> 00:53:22,534
Did a lot of manipulating to get it back.

729
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,654
- I have other things to worry about now.

730
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:26,304
- One thing I learned quick.

731
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:29,204
Principal can you get in a
hell of a lot of trouble, Char.

732
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,774
- True, I need a favor.

733
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:33,607
- [Buck] Shoot.

734
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:36,397
- I need something to help me sleep.

735
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:39,077
I need to sleep.

736
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,357
I'm having bad dreams.

737
00:53:42,864 --> 00:53:45,944
- If something can beat
you down, you stay away.

738
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:48,104
You walk way, you run away.

739
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:49,674
Stay awake.

740
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:50,534
- You.

741
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:53,497
- Me, you promised me you'd
come to my party tonight.

742
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:57,694
Yeah, that's what friends
do, they keep promises.

743
00:53:57,694 --> 00:53:58,527
- I have a girl.

744
00:54:00,414 --> 00:54:02,864
- Then you need some
comparison shopping, my boy.

745
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:07,544
(mellow rock music)

746
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,634
- How many people are coming, Buck?

747
00:54:09,634 --> 00:54:10,477
- Including us?

748
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:17,357
Let me think.

749
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:21,364
There's one and two and four.

750
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:22,914
Four people are coming.

751
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:24,834
- What about your roommate?

752
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:26,214
- I wouldn't really call her a roommate.

753
00:54:26,214 --> 00:54:27,604
She's just this little old lady

754
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:29,204
that I rent a room from, you know?

755
00:54:29,204 --> 00:54:31,454
She's visiting her
grandkids for the weekend.

756
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:33,187
- Oh.

757
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,464
- Two girls, Char, two.

758
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,114
- I do kinda have a girlfriend though.

759
00:54:42,114 --> 00:54:42,984
- Don't worry about it, man.

760
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:44,884
These are good people, you know?

761
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:46,957
And like I said, comparison, hm?

762
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:48,857
- Shopping.

763
00:54:48,857 --> 00:54:52,527
- Right, except this
shit's already bought.

764
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,214
I already pitched you, man.

765
00:54:54,214 --> 00:54:57,137
It's in the bank, know what I mean?

766
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,637
- What time do they get here?

767
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:02,621
- What if I told you
they were already here?

768
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:05,171
- (laughs) I'd say I already
have a girl like that.

769
00:55:09,313 --> 00:55:13,075
- Man, Char, you gotta quit
trying to fight the whole world.

770
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:14,464
I still think you need to get laid.

771
00:55:14,464 --> 00:55:15,664
- [Charlene] Is that so?

772
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,677
- I know two girls perfect for the part.

773
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:26,274
- You got any beer for us, Buck baby?

774
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:28,574
- I don't know, Charlie, we
got any beer for these girls?

775
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:29,614
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

776
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:34,614
Char, this is my girl
Charlene and her friend Nora.

777
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,181
- Hi.

778
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,737
- Hi.

779
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:38,904
- Here you go.

780
00:55:50,252 --> 00:55:54,419
- [Nora] I like you,
Charlie, don't be so nervous.

781
00:55:57,297 --> 00:55:59,547
Buck was worried about you.

782
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,139
- Buck's a great guy.

783
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:27,332
(Charlie shouts)

784
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:28,499
It's not safe.

785
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:31,826
- [Nora] I'll take my chances.

786
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:32,659
- I can't.

787
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,711
(Charlie shouts)

788
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:41,628
- Hey, where you going?

789
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,204
- [Charlie] Stay away.

790
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:50,384
- Damn, Charlie!

791
00:57:04,105 --> 00:57:05,605
- Get out of here.

792
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,714
Jerry thought you weren't coming back.

793
00:57:27,274 --> 00:57:32,274
I knew you'd be back because
you need so bad, now don't you?

794
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:36,124
- You know what I need.

795
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:39,297
Help me sleep.

796
00:57:41,644 --> 00:57:42,477
- Forever.

797
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,507
- For as long as I can.

798
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:49,864
I have things to work out.

799
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:55,504
- It's gonna cost you extra this time

800
00:57:58,114 --> 00:57:59,597
considering damages and all.

801
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,354
Because I'm a businessman, Charlie.

802
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:08,331
And well Jerry is gonna
be gunning for you.

803
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:13,874
I'm the only one who's gonna keep you

804
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:15,074
breathing now, aren't I?

805
00:58:28,274 --> 00:58:30,107
- It's all I got left.

806
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:39,344
- Well aren't you gonna owe me?

807
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:44,284
Yeah, I got something
special for you, boy.

808
00:58:47,784 --> 00:58:52,784
This pill, it's gonna end all
your worries, all your cares.

809
00:58:56,694 --> 00:59:01,197
It's the super duper knock
you off your ass space ride.

810
00:59:03,614 --> 00:59:04,664
- That's what I need.

811
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:09,826
- Sleep away, sleep away.

812
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:39,598
(Quote laughing)

813
00:59:41,826 --> 00:59:44,326
(eerie music)

814
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,500
- 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. 36,

815
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:29,049
37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

816
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:34,342
46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.

817
01:00:36,197 --> 01:00:37,447
398, 399, fuck!

818
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:40,265
Tricked!

819
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:42,144
Pasqua!

820
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:47,969
Pasqua!

821
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,528
Better, better, better.

822
01:00:59,526 --> 01:01:01,443
Better, better, better.

823
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,556
Better, better, better.

824
01:01:08,446 --> 01:01:09,696
Better, better.

825
01:01:55,499 --> 01:01:58,897
(dial tone droning)

826
01:01:58,897 --> 01:02:00,230
Pasqua, help me!

827
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:03,983
(Charlie shouting)

828
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:09,307
Please don't leave me.

829
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:12,789
Please.

830
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:17,287
Please don't leave me.

831
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:22,802
I'll be with you forever,
I promise, I promise.

832
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,254
- After that shit's done with him,

833
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:50,069
he's gonna be lucky to sleep for days.

834
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,890
- Hey, neighbor, get a good night sleep?

835
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:07,385
- Like a baby, why?

836
01:03:07,385 --> 01:03:08,635
- You can't sleep, freak.

837
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:12,467
- Lunatics can always sleep.

838
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:20,724
- You're gonna get put to sleep real soon.

839
01:03:20,724 --> 01:03:23,657
- Let's just put a cap in his
ass and solve this shit, man.

840
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,730
- Till death do us part.

841
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:39,487
(eerie music)

842
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:03,688
- Come on up for a look, young man.

843
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:04,855
We won't bite.

844
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:19,501
- That's a good one.

845
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:20,827
All our stuff is good.

846
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:22,587
- Can I have it?

847
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:24,457
- Yeah, sure.

848
01:04:25,564 --> 01:04:29,107
I paid good money for that,
but I can make you a good deal.

849
01:04:30,254 --> 01:04:33,047
- I'm getting married,
but we have no money.

850
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,407
I need this one.

851
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,907
- No, nothing's for free, kid.

852
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:41,897
Make me an offer.

853
01:04:42,774 --> 01:04:43,697
- Cheap, honey.

854
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:48,027
- Thank you, I'll be back.

855
01:04:54,274 --> 01:04:55,107
- We've been bringing that thing

856
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:57,297
out to our garage sale for years.

857
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:05,620
- Young man.

858
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,453
Young man.

859
01:05:45,752 --> 01:05:48,419
(phone ringing)

860
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:09,544
- [Charlie] Fun factory,
how may I help you?

861
01:06:09,544 --> 01:06:13,047
Hey, Doc, back so soon?

862
01:06:15,694 --> 01:06:18,094
Gee, I don't know if I
can come in this weekend.

863
01:06:19,004 --> 01:06:20,765
I'm kinda busy contemplating marriage.

864
01:06:20,765 --> 01:06:23,265
(eerie music)

865
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:55,084
- [Doctor] I'm very proud of you, Charlie,

866
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,354
for coming down here today.

867
01:06:57,204 --> 01:06:59,154
I wasn't sure whether you would or not.

868
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,694
- You could say we're almost friends.

869
01:07:01,694 --> 01:07:04,244
- Well, of course we're almost friends.

870
01:07:04,244 --> 01:07:08,644
But I'm also your doctor,
and I think you need

871
01:07:08,644 --> 01:07:10,794
to go into the hospital
for a little while.

872
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,297
- I'm not going back there.

873
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:16,144
I'm preparing for my wedding.

874
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:20,222
Just need a little
something to help me sleep.

875
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,714
I don't think that's asking a lot.

876
01:07:22,714 --> 01:07:25,164
- I do think you need to
go into a brief program.

877
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:28,864
I'm not doing this to punish you.

878
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:30,007
- You're not doing it.

879
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:34,417
Just give me the pills and
everything will be fine.

880
01:07:38,494 --> 01:07:40,314
- Sit down, Charlie,
you're only making this--

881
01:07:40,314 --> 01:07:42,457
- Don't go too far.

882
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,139
You were fooled, Doc,
all of you were fooled.

883
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:48,806
- What are you talking about?

884
01:07:48,806 --> 01:07:50,094
- I killed 'em all.

885
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:51,294
My father killed no one.

886
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:56,954
When my rage hit, the darkness
came, crept all around,

887
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,821
and I killed who I meant to protect.

888
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:03,821
And then I kept it a secret,
and you all believed it.

889
01:08:04,924 --> 01:08:06,567
And they say I'm stupid.

890
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:09,846
- You were only a child.

891
01:08:09,846 --> 01:08:10,840
Let me help you, Charlie.

892
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,590
(punch thudding)

893
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:19,918
(ominous music)

894
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,450
(dramatic music)

895
01:09:08,885 --> 01:09:09,718
- Oh shit.

896
01:10:17,428 --> 01:10:19,845
(gun clicks)

897
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:09,021
(pan clanging)

898
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:12,394
- Funny, fun, fun, funny.

899
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:13,394
Kill the freak, huh?

900
01:11:14,824 --> 01:11:16,764
Not bad work, do you think?

901
01:11:16,764 --> 01:11:18,264
- That was beautiful, darling.

902
01:11:33,404 --> 01:11:36,407
- Fun fun funny farm, how may I help you?

903
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:39,627
Don't come here, Buck.

904
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:15,091
- Perfect temperature, Charlie.

905
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:42,523
- You always gonna keep me
waiting like this, doll face?

906
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:43,694
(Horton knocking)

907
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:46,044
- [Horton] Charlie
Cavenaugh, open up the door.

908
01:12:48,124 --> 01:12:49,577
- The guests, they're here.

909
01:12:50,798 --> 01:12:51,634
(Horton knocking)

910
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,751
- [Horton] We don't want
to hurt you, Charlie.

911
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:56,418
Let us in, we just want to talk.

912
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,718
- I would've been your friend.

913
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:25,864
Welcome to the dream.

914
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:28,697
(gunshot banging)

915
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,417
Will you marry me?

916
01:13:33,112 --> 01:13:33,945
- Yes.

917
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:05,454
- Charlie!

918
01:14:13,468 --> 01:14:14,885
Charlie, Charlie.

919
01:14:24,948 --> 01:14:27,488
- You'll be my best man.

920
01:14:27,488 --> 01:14:30,821
(laughs) Late as usual.

921
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,124
- Charlie!

922
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:39,746
Come on, Charlie!

923
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:42,246
(eerie music)

924
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:58,269
- [Charlie] Someone
should've seen it coming.

925
01:14:58,269 --> 01:14:59,907
One of the happily ever after people.

926
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,777
God smiles at me and forgives.

927
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:09,184
I wanted so much and got so little.

928
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,092
Meant so good and did so bad.
