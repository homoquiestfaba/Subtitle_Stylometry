1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,460
I want to tell you about my twin brother
little Ralph. Maybe you've heard of him

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,650
(instrumental music) he's listed in the Guinness Book of
World Records as the youngest suicide in

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,960
recorded history.
It was a steamy July afternoon little

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,920
Ralph grabbed a Luger pistol put the
barrel to his head smiled at me

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,520
and blew his brains all over the incubator

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
(explosion)

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
and
all the while I was growing up my

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,090
parents kept asking me the same question.
Why can't you be more like your brother

9
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,750
Ralph?

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,880
- That's Morris Brock. Morris would do
anything to become more famous than his

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,600
twin brother Ralph. I found that out the
hard way.

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,909
My name is Jeff Burgess. I own a

13
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,290
rock and roll Club called The Heartbreak
Hotel

14
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:39,040
I met Morris on the night he launched
his career as a rock star

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,040
(rock music)

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,080
- "His brother got the headlines his
brother got the girls he lived in Jesus

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,040
shadow all his life"

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
- Last night I found
out about Morris's latest project

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,600
(instrumental music)

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,520
- Well I finally found a way to escape from
little Ralph's shadow. I became a terrorist.

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
(instrumental music)

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
(gunshot sound)

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,160
I joined an international
consortium that was planning to raise

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,780
the consciousness of 500 or so mindless
bourgeois rock-and-rollers

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
by blowing them up

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,760
There were four of us.
Gilda, our political officer, had grown up

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:54,720
next door to Hitler she recruited me
with promises of stranger European sex

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:05,420
Harpo, our driver, was a weapons expert.
Malcolm, our leader, was an asshole

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,080
(singing)

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
- Shut up!

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
- I'm playing tonight I gotta practice

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,480
- I haven't got the luxury of practice. One

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
mistake now and a whole block goes up

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
- This is the story of what happened last
night at the Heartbreak Hotel and I

35
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,380
guess it's also a story of how your
family can mess up your life. Morris had

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,880
to contend with his brother Ralph and I
had my father to deal with

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,989
- Hi, this is Clem Jefferson your public access Private Eye reporting from the Heartbreak Hotel that

38
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,030
notorious nightclub owned by Jeff
Burgess, son of presidential candidate

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,320
Robert Burgess

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,240
(rock music)

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,400
- I had led a pretty wild life before I
settled down at the Heartbreak Hotel

42
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,800
Unfortunately I was still the son of the
Honorable Robert Burgess, the United

43
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,310
States Senator, former CIA director,
presidential frontrunner and the last of

44
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,920
the cold warriors.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,660
- Do you think there
might be something unnatural about

46
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,280
having my own son killed?

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,720
- Oh come on
Robert we've been through this

48
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
- Maybe he's not my son he doesn't look like me
and his mother was...

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
did I ever tell you about her?

50
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,360
- Is she the wife that killed
herself?

51
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
- According to the note she left

52
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
she was trying to swim across the
Atlantic Ocean

53
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
(rock music)

54
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,360
Just pull on it hard

55
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
- It's incredible these people
don't even lock their doors

56
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
Where you going?

57
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm gonna go do my sound check

58
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,840
(music continues)

59
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,520
(instrumental music)

60
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,760
I've got no support there zilch. Why
should I suck up to them?

61
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,879
- Sir, you must

62
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,079
address the Black Caucus. If you don't
they'll call you a racist

63
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,760
- They already call me a racist

64
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,300
- No sir
they call you a fascist not a racist

65
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,480
it's okay to be a fascist people like
that.

66
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
- Hello Richard

67
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
- Holden and Miriam and I

68
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
have something to discuss

69
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,480
- 9:00 a.m. It's
on your schedule

70
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
- Your little package was

71
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
delivered about 30 minutes ago

72
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,220
- Any
problems?

73
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
- None.

74
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,240
Fuck the black caucus. Tomorrow I'll be a
national hero

75
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
- The bomb in my basement

76
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
wasn't the only problem.
Our mayor wanted to tear down the

77
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Heartbreak Hotel to make room for a
shopping mall.

78
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,250
- Now don't get me wrong we

79
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,870
are not against rock and roll I mean I
like the Beatles and Dylan and the

80
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,220
stones as well as the next guy so does
the mayor, the mayor even plays guitar

81
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,300
but that is not what we're talking about
here. What's the expression sex and drugs

82
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,980
and rock and roll we are talking about
sex and drugs we are talking about the

83
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,540
blatant sex and promiscuous use of
illegal drugs that permeates that

84
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,580
establishment and which threatens the
moral fiber of our young people

85
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,340
(rock music)

86
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,640
- Tell me who that is and I'll do the job
for nothing

87
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,380
I gotta get killed by the Indians custer
custom my ass that's Thomas Jonathan

88
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,220
Jackson the greatest combat general in
American history and you're educated you

89
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,520
don't know shit

90
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,140
- I know there's a
thousand dollars in here there's a

91
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,180
thousand more when the job's done

92
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,220
- What do you need me for? Why don't you go ahead and raid the place?

93
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,220
- A police raid wouldn't be
enough to shut it down permanently so we

94
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:50,160
need a riot then we can move the cops in
and really nail 'em. Do we have a deal?

95
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,640
-There's Jackson, standing there like a stonewall

96
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,120
(singing)

97
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,000
- this is Reverend Tillman Gandhi jr. who
preaches from this corner just a block

98
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,620
from the Heartbreak Hotel. Reverend Gandhi do you think there's any

99
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,022
spiritual quality at all to the
Heartbreak Hotel?

100
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:22,480
- Clem there is an evil

101
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,500
spiritual quality yes the same kind of
spiritual quality that the Philistines had

102
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,080
- Philistines?

103
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,580
- Yes

104
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,860
I have never been
inside but when I walk past and look in

105
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,720
there I see nothing but Philistines in
there

106
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,100
- My companions were not exactly

107
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,348
state-of-the-art terrorists

108
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:52,180
If they
screwed up

109
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,280
I was poised to take control

110
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,840
- There's 100 pounds of plastique sittin
under the dance floor

111
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,840
- Where is he?

112
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,120
- At the club that's doing a sound test

113
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,295
- We should eliminate him now

114
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,120
- We need the

115
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,660
little asshole tonight

116
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,040
- I do not like
this ransom business we should proceed

117
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,040
as soon as the club fills up

118
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,620
- What you
like or dislike is none of my concern

119
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,280
did you make the tape?

120
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,940
(on tape) Last night a blow
was struck for the oppressed peoples of

121
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,110
the world. We have brought the struggle
to the home ground of the oppressor

122
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,220
America can no longer escape from the
outrage of the masses. The destruction of

123
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,709
the Great Satan has begun. We chose first
strike at the rotting underbelly of this

124
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,660
disease society at a dirty decadent
little bourgeois music club owned by a

125
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,400
son of the fascist Pig robots they're
just who knows where we will strike next

126
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,640
Sweet dreams, America

127
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,960
(Singing and playing guitar)

128
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,620
and the dead guy's arms are falling off

129
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:41,620
and the dead guy's face is blue and the
dead guys smells like someone's dirty feet

130
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,680
- God is going to smite the people
in Heartbreak Hotel's into fudge

131
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,580
caramel and will run all down all over
the place and then he'll put

132
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,160
hemorrhoids in their anus

133
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,340
- Hemorrhoids where?

134
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,500
- In their anus, rectum

135
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,320
(Instrumental music)

136
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,720
(Motorcycle sounds)

137
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,600
(Rock music)

138
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,280
- You're probably gonna get a lot of calls
tonight about disturbances at the

139
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,600
Heartbreak Hotel. No, more than usual.
I want you to ignore them until you get

140
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,070
a call from me. Yes, don't worry about
it, it's what the mayor wants

141
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
(crowd cheering)

142
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:15,380
- The young adults were the main act that
night. I was opening for them. That was

143
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,140
like having Mozart open for Wayne Newton

144
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,300
- You know the Americans had some pretty
tight security when they were making the

145
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,850
atomic bomb but the Germans and Russians
couldn't figured out where they were

146
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,330
making it. All they had to do is look at the
circulation records in galaxy magazine

147
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,520
because a circulation change from
Chicago to Tennessee to New Mexico for

148
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,730
the Russians and Germans have to do to
figure out where the Americans are

149
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,100
making the bomb was check the
circulation in galaxy magazine

150
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,860
(singing)

151
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:09,410
- Hey is this your motorcycle? Can I take it for a ride? Where are the keys how do you start it?

152
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,840
(laughter)

153
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,260
How fast will this go? I wanna pass some cops

154
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,700
(laughter)

155
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,860
- Do you know what a Philistine carries
in his pouch?

156
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,040
- Excuse me?

157
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,020
- You know what a Philistine carries in his pouch?

158
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,400
- No, I, I don't

159
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,560
- Camel's dung

160
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,060
How does a Philistine count to 25?

161
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,080
On both hands. Did
you know that Goliath is 9 feet tall and

162
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,740
9 is an insignificant number of the
devil. Let me tell you how

163
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,540
- Reverend Andy

164
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,520
- Yes

165
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,620
- Thank you

166
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,620
- I headed back to headquarters for the
last supper with my Terror colleagues

167
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,920
(Instrumental music)

168
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,140
- You must have heard of them.
You know, Guy Fawkes Day November 5th 1605

169
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,700
He was a terrorist like us. Tried to blow up the Parliament

170
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,780
building with gunpowder. He got caught

171
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,600
they tortured him then they hung him

172
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:14,000
- Alright let's go over this. Anything unusual
behind the bar at the front door

173
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,960
particularly new faces, you report it to
Gilda. Never lose contact with her

174
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,420
- Where are you gonna be?

175
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,040
- That is none of your
concern

176
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,760
- How come she gets to know and I don't?

177
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:36,720
- We all know precisely what we need to know.
Anything unusual you report it to Gilda

178
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,260
- Reynolds may be a flaming liberal but
he's no dope. He won't be easy to fool

179
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,220
- Don't worry I can handle myself

180
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,600
- I hope so

181
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:12,940
All right you come back in here after
the call. You're preoccupied, shaken, you

182
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,930
tell Reynolds that something has come up
and you can't complete the interview but

183
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,790
then and this is the tricky part you
change your mind because you need to

184
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,880
talk to someone.
So you confide in Reynolds

185
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,630
off-the-record, you lay the whole thing
out for him. You tell him that terrorists

186
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,800
have planted a bomb in your son's
nightclub. They want a million dollar

187
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,700
ransom but instead you propose a
commando raid. Well of course the

188
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,160
bleeding hearts won't follow your advice
and we'll try and negotiate and when the

189
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:56,200
bomb explodes on schedule at 1:00 a.m.
you come out the tragic hero willing to

190
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,570
stand up to terrorism even at the
expense of your son's life

191
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,420
- And I'll have a pinko reporter in place to verify it
all

192
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:20,160
- You know Gilda I sing much better if I
have a sexual release right before I go onstage

193
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,540
- All right on the count of three
I shoot off your scrub

194
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,360
One, two...

195
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,100
I like rough sex but if things went sour at the
club that night I didn't want to get

196
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,100
caught with a hole in my underwear

197
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,780
(up beat music)

198
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,720
- I don't have the luxury of practice

199
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,450
- All sorts of people came to the
Heartbreak Hotel they showed up for the

200
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,139
music, for the atmosphere, sometimes I got
the feeling that they were looking for

201
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,340
something more but I could never figure
out if they found it

202
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,299
- Hey where's my beer

203
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,100
- Hey that's my beer!

204
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,300
- I go to the can for a minute my beer is gone

205
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,720
Hey you, you took my beer. I had a full one right here I want

206
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
another one right here right now

207
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,640
- I didn't take your beer

208
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,600
- Right here and right now

209
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,620
- Fuck you

210
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,440
- Fuck me? I'm a paying customer
you say that to me I want to see the manager

211
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,360
- Excuse me?

212
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,352
- What's that drink called?

213
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,800
- Oh it's a Harvey Wallbanger

214
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,200
- Vodka, orange juice, with the
Galliano on top

215
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,720
- Why is it called a Harvey Wallbanger?

216
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,200
- Gee I don't know maybe it was named after the guy who invented it

217
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,400
- Here's the opening act folks, Morris
Bravo

218
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,580
(Fart noise)

219
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,500
- Does anybody here know where syphilis
came from?

220
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,300
- Your mother!

221
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,460
- What's the capital of New Mexico?

222
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,500
- Your mother!

223
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,460
(laughter)

224
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,200
- You know what's wrong with you people you're

225
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,800
ignorant you don't know anything.
I can't stand ignorance, it makes me angry

226
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:39,580
There's hope for all of you yet you're all gonna die...
someday. Death makes you smart

227
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,300
You can take a complete idiot and kill him or
her and then he knows more than the

228
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:53,370
smartest person alive.
He knows what death is. So don't worry

229
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,150
help is on the way

230
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:07,280
(Singing) I hear that we're caught in a major food
crisis famine is knocking at the world's

231
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:16,360
front door still we're wasting protein
on women and nobody knows what we're doing it for

232
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:25,100
why do we feed the broads
please tell me why do we feed the broads

233
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:32,700
we could feed the whole damn world if we didn't have to feed the broads

234
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,640
- You were wild, busting up the town

235
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,400
Remember that? It was great

236
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,720
You got old. You
join the mop.

237
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,400
You know, he had respect

238
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
If he had kept riding,

239
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,200
he just would have been some fat old guy in a t-shirt on a bike

240
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,580
- What?

241
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,074
-Make it simple for him

242
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:03,580
- Look what he's

243
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,240
trying to say is there's nothing more
pathetic than an old guy in a bike

244
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,500
- I'm not pathetic

245
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
- Not you, him

246
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:22,580
- In war you kill people in order to
change their minds. Remember that it's

247
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,400
fucking a pardon

248
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,240
- And the Lord God looked
down upon the face of the earth and

249
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,429
behold anguish and trouble and the Lord
God said there's nothing down here but

250
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:42,800
burglars rapists murderers drug pushers
pimps gamblers. Noah build me an ark

251
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,780
Yes lord

252
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,030
how do you want it done Lord?
Build it in the fashion that I tell you

253
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,600
make it as long as a football field.

254
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,100
Got it

255
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,660
Make it three stories tall-got it,
anything else Lord?

256
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,840
Yeah yeah I want you

257
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,770
to gather all the animals of the earth
and two by two and bring them and put

258
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,960
them into this Ark

259
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,300
Will do, Lord

260
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,940
(phone ringing)

261
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,180
- Look we paid 10 bucks to get in here can we have a couple beers

262
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,220
- Look, I'll serve you, not him

263
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,280
- Why not

264
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,720
- Look at him he's shitfaced

265
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,580
- He's fine

266
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,420
- I'm fine!

267
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,220
- He's just a little dizzy

268
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,620
- Yeah, dizzy

269
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,000
- It's his birthday

270
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,260
- Heartbreak Hotel

271
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,220
- I wish to speak with Mr. Burgess please

272
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,300
- Speaking

273
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,920
- Listen carefully Burgess

274
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,220
There's a very powerful bomb containing plastique

275
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,400
explosive hidden in your cellar now it's
set to go off at 1:00 a.m. but can be

276
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,470
detonated at any time by remote device
in my possession if there's a mass

277
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,320
exodus from the club or we detect any
indication of police action we shall

278
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,090
detonate the bomb at once

279
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,560
- Tell you what

280
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,700
I'll let you have a beer if you drink it out of this

281
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,540
- I'll take it

282
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,400
- I what to dedicate this next song to a
certain special someone in the audience tonight.

283
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,320
You know who you are

284
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:34,940
The song is about my favorite European
dictator before you

285
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,080
(Singing)

286
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,980
(Audience booing)

287
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,100
(Phone ringing)

288
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,540
- Heartbreak Hotel

289
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,220
- I assure you this is not a prank

290
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,780
Burgess I am deadly serious

291
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,520
-You know I really
can't be taking threats over the phone

292
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,720
come on down here threaten me in person

293
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,800
- All the animals came into the ark by
pairs except for the worms they came in apples

294
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,240
(laughs) now here comes the rain and
here comes the Senators knocking on the door

295
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,460
Hey Noah let us in

296
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,840

bastards

300
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,000
(laughs)

301
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
and the water rose and

302
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,100
lifted the ship up and you know what
happened to people in here they drowned

303
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,650
like trap rats and what was Noah doing
in his ark eating fried chicken potato

304
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,500
salad and pickles and Pepsi Cola

305
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,300
- Hey buddy! Over here!

306
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,860
- Hey Mr. microphone!

307
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,320
- Are you guys TV?

308
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,880
- Ladies and gentlemen we're
making the film about the Heartbreak

309
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,357
Hotel we'd like to ask you a few
questions

310
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:37,120
- We're making a film about this booth

311
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,600
oh yes

312
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,120
- You better make it fast

313
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,160
- I'm a sensual intuitive entertainer

314
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,260
in each performance I try to gradually
escalate the mood of mutual antipathy

315
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:12,460
until it reaches a state of negative
nirvana a state that I like to call

316
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,640
New Jersey

317
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,040
What an empty baron wasteland

318
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,140
a crass commercial Hell hole

319
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,640
what an ugly thought occurred down

320
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,180
New Jersey

321
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,340
what a desolate dominion

322
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:40,080
what a clammy
creepy cataclysmic bleak unhappy tomb

323
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,420
New Jersey

324
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,140
- I need to speak to the manager

325
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,720
- You wanna sleep with the manager?

326
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
- I want to speak to the manager

327
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,040
- Where's Jeff?

328
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,600
- Uh, girls' room

329
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,520
- This is the ladies' room

330
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,660
- The men's room is over there

331
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,260
- I didn't see the sign

332
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,780
I left my beer in there

333
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,220
- Burgess?

334
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Yeah?

335
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,100
- I need to speak with you

336
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,060
- Yeah?

337
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,279
- We talked on the phone

338
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,020
- Oh yeah the bomb guy

339
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,000
okay I see you made it okay no
problems huh?

340
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,480
- You take a good look at the kick

341
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:42,100
the keg in the old refrigerator now you
take a good look at it you'll notice

342
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:48,180
some modifications you meet me back here

343
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,700
Burgess?

344
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,940
there's 100 pounds plastic in that keg

345
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,460
now do you have any idea what that can do to this place?

346
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,460
I want you to contact
the mayor I want you to contact your

347
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:33,349
father and I want 1 million dollars cash
small bills out of sequence by 1:00 a.m.

348
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:36,940
- Well you've got your job to do I've got
mine

349
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,060
- What?

350
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,160
- I got to go get some toilet paper for the girls' room, excuse me

351
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,420
- You're not going anywhere

352
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,780
- You know, I used to offer guys

353
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,290
hundred bucks to shoot me
you know like at parties one guy finally

354
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,440
took me up on it
shot off the top of my skull

355
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,480
(banging)

356
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,140
Get off the stage!

357
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,960
(Booing)

358
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,640
(Audience cheers)

359
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Hey, are those clads bugging you?

360
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:12,420
they could scream all night
I wasn't going to do an encore I am a

361
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:23,400
sick man a spiteful man an unattractive
man

362
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,839
- Hey Morris

363
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,360
what's fine ones mean?

364
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,040
- It means pig dog

365
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
-I'm out here in the parking lot with

366
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,870
Boris Lee president of the scum of the
earth motorcycle group

367
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,320
- Gimme the mic, I wanna talk

368
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,260
I'd like to ask

369
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,440
you a few questions

370
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,800
- Fuck the questions gimme the mic

371
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,880
- Of course we can't fuck the questions it's not the way it's done

372
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,980
I want to talk give me the mic

373
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,580
What I want to talk about is the Battle of
Gettysburg. Today is the 125th anniversary

374
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,600
of the end of the Battle of Gettysburg
the South lost the fucking Civil War and

375
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm still pretty upset about it because
if the south would have won the war

376
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
this would have been an entire nation of bikers

377
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,860
And I'd have been running for fucking president instead of this old father

378
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,220
Why do I want to be President? Well let
me put it this way

379
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:23,700
we live in perilous times what with the communist conspiracy powder keg situation in the Middle East

380
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,340
breakdown of traditional values at home

381
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,599
we need a man of strength, experience, and character that can meet these problems

382
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,440
head-on

383
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,480
- There is a bomb planted at the
Heartbreak Hotel now that bomb will go

384
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,220
off unless I am paid 1 million dollars
by 1 AM

385
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,340
- Are you the guy with the cherry bombs?

386
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:58,540
- Cherry bombs? There is 100 pounds of plastique sitting under the dance floor

387
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,460
- Look, who do you work for?

388
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,860
- Do you think I'm joking?

389
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,970
Do you? Will you come on down here
and I'll rub your nose in it it's 100

390
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,660
pounds of plastique asshole

391
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,980
- good luck

392
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,680
yeah guys

393
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,480
these guys with me they're playing
here tomorrow night

394
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,500
Once the word got out that Morris had left the building
the crowd really started pouring in

395
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,260
- Alright you guys having fun?

396
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,700
Come on follow me, this way

397
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,100
- My parents have a beach house and um the next beach over is a nude beach and so I go

398
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,500
there you know go there with my friends

399
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,780
Really not crowded

400
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,300
our beach is so crowded

401
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:15,640
- Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the
young adult

402
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
(crowd cheering)

403
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,220
- There's no fucking way I'm gonna drink this

404
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,300
it's flat

405
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,920
How you expect to drink that, a buck and a half for that crap?

406
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,020
It looks like brown water

407
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
(bubbling)

408
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,300
I guess folks this is the age of safe
sexuality huh

409
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
but a lot of people

410
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,200
probably heard about heterosexuality
homosexuality bisexuality the song is

411
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,720
about hortisexuality relationship
between man and bush

412
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,520
(guitar playing)

413
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,620
- Look I figure a year at the outside we're gonna be playing civic centers

414
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,380
- I don't know

415
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,520
- You guys are hot for a clone band

416
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,580
- Civic center that's a big jump

417
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,560
- I don't like
that word clone pretty soon we're gonna

418
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,300
start writing our own songs
you know songs inspired by the Beatles

419
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,000
- We're a clone band

420
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,320
- Well well well

421
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
what's going on down here

422
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,920
- Didn't take you long to get down here

423
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
- Hey Ruby

424
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,720
- Oh are you guys in a band?

425
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,540
- These are the beat legends they're playing
here tomorrow

426
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,660
- Oh yeah the Beatles fan

427
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,345
- Look we're not
just a Beatles band

428
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,500
- Which one are you?

429
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,020
- Paul

430
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,080
- Paul's my favorite. You?

431
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,300
- That's John

432
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
(fingers tapping)

433
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,840
- Where's George?

434
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:57,220
- You say you want to go to hell because
that's where your friends are well look

435
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,810
where it got them. Your friend is bound
and gagged sitting in the chair you take

436
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:08,220
a bar shove it down his mouth and bring
it out his rear. Send him over two Forks

437
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,830
and slowly fricassee him over a burning
fire and run butter across him while at

438
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,396
tanagen yes the demons are doing that

439
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,170
- Do you know anything about an Englishman

440
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,400
with a bomb at the Heartbreak Hotel

441
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,150
no no Pearson was talking about a couple

442
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,000
of cherry bombs in the sewer line this
guy's talking about a hundred pounds of

443
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,220
plastic well what should I do

444
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,640
- I'll make some calls

445
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,440
It's probably just a 4th of July prank

446
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,700
(xylophone music)

447
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
You know, it's the atmosphere

448
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:26,080
it's a climate you know what I'm saying
I mean they could have done anything

449
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,640
they could have put out a record of
Ringo scratching his ass and everybody

450
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,260
would have loved it it is the atmosphere
that's what's key the Beatles had this

451
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,160
atmosphere where anything they did would
have been accepted anything so they

452
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,980
could try anything and that's creativity
the ability to try any-

453
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,060
(phone ringing)

454
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,300
I should write that down

455
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,100
Heartbreak Hotel

456
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,480
the ability to try anything

457
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,840
- That's heavy

458
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,220
- That's good

459
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,320
- Who is this?

460
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,160
What, an act?

461
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,080
- Who is it?

462
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,880
- Hey listen Elvis, if you want a gig call
back during the day

463
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,880
What?

464
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,140
I'm talking to the spirit of Elvis Presley

465
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,320
- Oh really

466
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,000
- He's got Hendrix and Joplin with him

467
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,560
- Let me talk to him

468
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,060
- Some party

469
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,620
- Hi, who are you guys?

470
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,260
Are you in a band?

471
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,380
Elvis is my favorite

472
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,758
I can't give you my name I'm the guy that planted the
bomb

473
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,820
- Now we get a lot of prank calls

474
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,160
this time of year and I need to have
this verified

475
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,740
- Is this the FBI or a fucking pizza parlor?

476
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,500
- Sir there is no reason to

477
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,920
use that sort of language now I'm not
used to dealing directly with criminals

478
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,460
we usually deal with the victims first
but if you would just give me a phone

479
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:59,580
number I can have somebody get back to
you

480
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,760
(singing)

481
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,680
There's no such thing as a balance of
power in any confrontation there's

482
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,900
always a fella who's stronger and a
fella who's weaker

483
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,680
I'm gonna make damn

484
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,160
sure this country is the stronger fella

485
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,750
- Does that mean you would withdraw
American negotiators from the Geneva talks?

486
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,000
- You know one of our strongest
presidents Teddy Roosevelt once said

487
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,130
speak softly and carry a big stick.
Well I think the people of this country

488
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,860
deserve a big stick and I intend to give
it to them

489
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,820
(fireworks)

490
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,500
(cheering)

491
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,140
(phone ringing)

492
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,440
The problem is that we put the fucking
bill

493
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,160
- I married a tree

494
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,200
what do you call that?

495
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,780
(phone ringing)

496
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,240
(music playing)

497
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,540
Excuse me

498
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,520
what seems to be the problem here

499
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,320
- Suck my dick asshole

500
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,060
- Suck my dick asshole

501
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
funky pot roast

502
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,440
(phone ringing)

503
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,500
I am going to put him on his knees!

504
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,780
(instrumental music)

505
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,740
The terrorist team was
in disarray. How a great leader was

506
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,716
losing control. No one cared about his
bomb.

507
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,380
- All the terrorists are gone down to hell with their weapons of war

508
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,520
- Harpal was stuck in the van absorbing the wit

509
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,980
and wisdom of the reverend Tilman Gandhi
Jr.

510
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,470
As for the prussian hussy

511
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,880
once she lost track of me she didn't
know what to do

512
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,780
That's the thing about Nazis they're
good at following orders but they don't

513
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,079
know how to improvise. I was the only
terrorist who hadn't lost control

514
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,260
I had my ear to the ground monitoring
the situation in the club.

515
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,960
- We're all gonna die soon

516
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,800
and they're calling to help us with our transition

517
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,840
- Jack let me talk

518
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,880

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,500
- Jack give me the phone

520
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,660
- Who are you kidding I wouldn't work here

521
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,820
- Where's Lenin? Doesn't he hang out with
you guys

522
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,380
- It's weird it sounds just like them

523
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,200
-I don't believe this shit what is this

524
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,500
-Oh Lenin's reached a higher plane than

525
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,180
these guys they're still stuck down low
because they did so many drugs

526
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,520
- Man, who is this, Elvis?

527
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,020
Hey Elvis

528
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,360
ask Janice if she ever learned to sing

529
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,920
- I want to hear a Mercedes Benz

530
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,640
- No, no, purple haze

531
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,620
- Oh Lord, won't you buy me

532
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,120
a Mercedes Benz

533
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,580
- Okay time now for those intimate parts
of the show that I like an opportunity

534
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,820
that I can get down here and meet some
of the folks in the audience whoa hey

535
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,640
excuse me what's your name

536
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,720
- Ellen

537
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,800
- name is Ellen and where you from Ellen?

538
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,960
- Uh, Boston

539
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,720
- Boston Massachusetts all
right well Ellen now I think we've got

540
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,740
to know ourselves a little bit better
prepare to receive my sperm armada

541
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,120
I learned how to read palms from this gypsy named
Gladys

542
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,480
- Did she teach you that this is my palm

543
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,580
- She did yeah she did but but she says you have to start with the fingers and then you go to the palm

544
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,800
- Oh, I see

545
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,440
(Music playing)

546
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,500
Karma the balance of experiences in a
person's life

547
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,540
- Look at his eyes Randy

548
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,880
I think they're starting to glaze over

549
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,190
- How many lives do we have?

550
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,220
- That's your lifeline right there

551
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,280
- Hundreds of lives

552
00:52:51,420 --> 00:53:01,120
incarnate that's when you have a body
discarded that's nobody let's get back

553
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:07,010
to this karma business. If you do lots of
drugs in one life does that mean you're

554
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,300
really screwed for the next life?

555
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,170
Worse?

556
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,540
Horace what are you doing out here?

557
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:33,283
- I'm awaiting the apocalypse

558
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:35,660
- Listen uh do

559
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,900
you know anything about this place being
blown up tonight

560
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,080
- The planet?

561
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,880
- No just the club

562
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,060
- Oh, the club

563
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,960
Sure, 1 o-clock

564
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,060
Boom!

565
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,500
(music resumes)

566
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,940
I can't say that I approve of my son's
lifestyle but you know that's one of the

567
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,780
things that makes this country great
we're all free to live as we choose to live

568
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,980
- For the time being

569
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,960
- I didn't catch that

570
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,880
- Um, do you think that publicity about

571
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,680
your son might adversely affect your
campaign for instance the photo in the

572
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,900
Daily News last week the one of your son
holding a chicken

573
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,620
- I don't think I want comment further on that subject

574
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,940
- Do the two of you keep in touch

575
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,380
- You're pushing it Reynolds

576
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,180
I don't know what this says about my

577
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:56,400
life but my father was trying to kill me
and my favorite folk singer was helping him.

578
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,920
(band playing)

579
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,920
Keep your hands off!

580
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,360
- Listen to me

581
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,840
- Who are you?

582
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,380
- It doesn't matter who I am

583
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,660
I need to talk to you

584
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,380
- Oh and I'd really love to talk to you

585
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,200
but you see all these guys at the bar?

586
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,700
I don't think they'd like it very much

587
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,560
- There is a bomb in the cellar

588
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,680
- What?

589
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,220
- There is a bomb in the cellar

590
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,280
- There's a bomb in the cellar

591
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,060
Hey Alex, there's a bomb in the basement

592
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,860
- Better warn the rats!

593
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,820
That man, what did he want?

594
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,600
- Oh he just said that there was a bomb in the cellar

595
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,140
Their bodies are like ideas they exist

596
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,740
but not in the physical world. Yeah Elvis
well let me ask you a question, El

597
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,500
is your body a big idea or a little idea? Is
it the thin version for the fat version?

598
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,440
- Ask him if he still can get a hard-on

599
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:10,710
both no no keep thinking nowhere they
execute the guy and everybody disappears

600
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:16,270
Elvis I've got another question for you

in this place chief what happened to
your accent

I don't need an accent talking you know

01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:16,599
life-threatening situations I'm talking
about little problems like warts warts

629
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:23,059
warts they're harmless but if we had
socialized medicine any slob could walk

630
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:26,420
into a doctor's office get a wart remove
and the taxpayers would have to foot the

631

body what does happen God is blurring
what do you guys do for fun comedy

637
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,920
should a fella get something for nothing
I say no and I think the majority of the

638
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:27,170
American people would agree with mr.
Burgess I believe that you inherited a

639
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:32,480
substantial fortune in that case of
getting something for nothing you're

640
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:46,719
starting to sound like a commie you have
a call sir

641
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:53,500
we've got a problem
what apparently your son is ignoring the

642
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:59,019
ransom demands I should know they can't
count on him to act like a normal human

643
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:04,599

seems to be paying much attention blow

646
01:03:44,089 --> 01:03:49,749
mr. Burch would you comment on the rumor
of a bomb right here at the club

on gonna take the place of 20 minutes

649
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:18,420
perhaps I didn't make myself clear you

650
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,310

01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:59,520

so now it's Jesus so Jesus gets out

655
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:05,130
there starts to walk across the water
immediately sinks to the bottom so he

656
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:11,720
walks over to Moses and he says I don't
understand it used to be so easy and

657
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:16,440
Moses says yeah but that was before you
