1
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,431
Man: Davenport to serve.

2
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,600
( Tennis racquets
striking balls )

3
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,036
( Man grunts ) Out!

4
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,638
Man #2: What? Oh, my God.
That was in.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,540
Be honest. Dude, you saw that.

6
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,543
That was right on the line.
Seriously? Call stands.

7
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,812
Brad, that ball
was on the line.

8
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,647
Please don't do this to me.

9
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,516
Jimmy, he made the call,
and I confirmed.

10
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,451
You're really gonna
take his side? Look at him.

11
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,486
Does he look like
a man who can see?

12
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,359
After we went to
elegant girls that time,

13
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,228
you're gonna fuck me over on this?
It was out.

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,297
I never told your wife.

15
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,099
( Whispering ) And as I've
said numerous times before,

16
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,101
I went back to
the hotel room alone

17
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,170
after getting one dance
in the champagne room.

18
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,539
I don't believe
you fucked a stripper, man.

19
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,542
That is a terrible, terrible idea.
Do not do that again.

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,679
Is it too hard to get a hawkeye
camera up in this shit?

21
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,316
Serve the ball, long-shorts.

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,824
( Belching )

23
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,659
Whoo!

24
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,694
( Laughs )

25
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,699
Dude, would you
cheer up, please?

26
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,701
We made the quarters.
That's four grand each.

27
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,571
We lost, Jimmy.

28
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,673
I thought I could learn from
playing with a journeyman.

29
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,755
Five minutes after the match,
you're drinking a beer.

30
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,780
Well, this is actually gin

31
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,748
that I just poured
into an empty beer can

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,584
because I couldn't find a cup.

33
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,519
( Chuckles )

34
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,222
Well, you can drink
all you want now, Jimmy,

35
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,257
'cause we are done.

36
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,232
( Belches )

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,703
( Shouting, cheering )

38
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,644
Hey, Mr. price. Oh, hey, Barry.

39
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,681
So Mrs. whist will be back
from sabbatical next year.

40
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,517
You should try to sub
for seventh grade,

41
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,519
so you can be my teacher again.

42
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,420
Let's not get crazy, Barry.

43
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,890
Seventh grade's a little
out of my league.

44
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,759
So, uh, If you're
a substitute teacher,

45
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,529
then you're technically
unemployed right now.

46
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,797
Uh...

47
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,367
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,770
So you want to
hang out this summer?

49
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,507
Oh... yeah, I'm gonna be busy.

50
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,676
Oh. With what?

51
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,411
With a lot of stuff, you know.

52
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,580
With all those... Things.

53
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,549
Here, let me get
the door for you.

54
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,851
Oh. Thanks, Barry. Yeah.

55
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,287
All right. I'm gonna
go this way now, so...

56
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,856
Okay. You have a good summer.

57
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,358
Yeah, you too.
See you, Mr. price.

58
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,432
What up, Linda?

59
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,701
( Ringing )

60
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,644
Here we go.

61
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,714
Jimmy: Hey, dad, guess what?
I give up. What?

62
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,984
I made the quarterfinals at the corona
classic with that kid, Davenport.

63
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,719
Yeah, good for you.

64
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,522
Thank you, good for me.
And then the kid dropped me.

65
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,557
( Chuckles ) You know? Oh, well.

66
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,794
Talking about, It's time
for me to hang it up. Now?

67
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,631
But you've only been playing
tennis for eight years too long.

68
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,900
Fire her, dad.

69
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,270
So, If hanging it up
is what you want to do...

70
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,339
No, dad, no. I'm not
hanging it up.

71
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,274
I'm gonna make a run
at the open, actually.

72
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,842
Great, If that's
what you want to do.

73
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,777
It is what I want
to do. It's just...

74
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,013
It's hard to find
a good partner.

75
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,520
What do you think
about me asking Darren?

76
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,626
Uh...

77
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:23,362
Wow. Yeah, that'd be...

78
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,697
When's the last time
you even saw Darren?

79
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,433
What do you mean?
Like, I saw him...

80
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,403
When did I see him?

81
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,672
He's recently single,

82
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,707
so he might be looking
for something to do.

83
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,809
Just don't pull another
dash Stevens, okay?

84
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,479
Dad, that was 15 years ago.

85
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,649
Come on. What's a dash Stevens?

86
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,351
It's a "who," not a "what." Dash
Stevens was this hotshot pro

87
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,654
that Jimmy left Darren for
when he hit the pro circuit.

88
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,422
They played doubles together.

89
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,891
Jimmy looking out for himself
over his own brother?

90
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,427
Nah. I don't believe it.

91
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,763
Quit defending your
not-so-secret admirer.

92
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,331
Jimmy... What?

93
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,366
Quit flicking Brock's penis.

94
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,002
Fine.

95
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,905
What are you, 12?

96
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,344
( Motor whirring )

97
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:22,521
Hey, Mr. price! I thought
you were busy this summer.

98
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,556
Go home, Barry.

99
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,862
No, that's what
I'm saying, dude.

100
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,431
It gives you a mental edge.

101
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,533
Okay. How do you do it?
You just shove it

102
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,934
down your pants
in the middle of...

103
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,736
Ugh. No. That would scare kids.

104
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,005
What you do is, prior to
the match even starting,

105
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,907
you cut a little hole
in your pocket.

106
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,042
Right? Cut a little
hole in your pocket.

107
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,411
That way, every time
you go to serve the ball,

108
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,481
you know that that ball
has grazed your scrotum.

109
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,817
And your opponent, when
they're hitting the ball,

110
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,752
they're hitting
your scrotum ball, okay?

111
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,988
And now you own that man.
Now you're one up on him.

112
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,891
Yeah. 'Cause he's your bitch 'cause
he's hitting your scrotum ball.

113
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,461
Right?

114
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,763
Dude, the stuff you're doing with
your scrotum is light-years ahead

115
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,698
of what everyone else
is doing right now.

116
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,601
Thank you so much. That means a lot.
No, I mean it, man.

117
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,104
'Cause a lot of people
don't appreciate it.

118
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,539
Consider yourself appreciated.

119
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,875
Thank you. That's cool
of you to say, man.

120
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,011
Would you please give me a
couple of the prestige pro?

121
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,147
String them tight
this time. 59-57.

122
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,716
Jimmy, I...

123
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,852
What? I can't.

124
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,887
Nicky, give me some head.

125
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,523
Give you... 'Cause of the...

126
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,860
That's cool. I like that...
I love that joke.

127
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,864
My manager told me that I can't
give you any more free stuff.

128
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,800
Are you telling me head's
dropping me right now?

129
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,635
Uh-uh. I'm not
telling you that,

130
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,971
'cause they don't...
They don't sponsor you.

131
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm just starting to
train for the open, Nick.

132
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,076
And head's dropping me now?
That's ridiculous!

133
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,546
Yeah, they are. I hate to
be the bearer of bad news.

134
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,048
I could loan you my racquet.

135
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,151
Honestly, dude, just
take my racquet.

136
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,119
It'd be an honor.

137
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,655
Just take it.

138
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,124
Yeah! All right, whoo!

139
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,727
Believe in yourself, Jimmy.
You're gonna win it, man!

140
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,896
Hit me up If you
ever want to kick it,

141
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,831
like, on the weekends
or whatever.

142
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,174
Hey. Hey, Mr. price.

143
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,775
What are you doing now?

144
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,710
Listen, Barry, school's out.

145
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,146
Which means I'm just
a 33-year-old man,

146
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,682
and you're an 11-year-old boy,

147
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,751
so we're not hanging out.

148
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,990
What kind of car is this?

149
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,960
This car is a kia sorrento.

150
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,563
Cool. How much does it cost
to buy a kia sorrento?

151
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,532
I didn't buy it. I'm leasing it.
What's that mean?

152
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:51,036
It means that I am
kind of renting it

153
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,171
for a really, really long time.

154
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,708
Why would you lease
a kia sorrento?

155
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,479
I don't know, Barry.

156
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,882
Sometimes things are
sadder in retrospect.

157
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,017
What's this?

158
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,953
Dreamcatcher.

159
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,655
Cool. Catch a lot of dreams?

160
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,024
Just the sorrento, so far.

161
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,926
Hmm.

162
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,700
Uh, where'd you get it?

163
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,503
Uh, It's my girlfriend's.

164
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,671
My ex-girlfriend.

165
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,708
"Ex-girlfriend"? What happened?

166
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,109
I don't want to
talk about that.

167
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,844
Was she cramping your style?

168
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,080
Nope. Did she have
too much baggage?

169
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,583
Did your mom hate her?
No, she never met my mom.

170
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,120
Why not? My mom passed away.

171
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,689
Oh, man. How'd she die?

172
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,959
Okay. Yeah, Barry, you know,

173
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,761
you got to have more tact.

174
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,230
Oh. Sorry. Um...

175
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,635
How'd she die?

176
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,303
That was much better.

177
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,177
Okay. Here we are.

178
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,682
Okay, Barry.

179
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,253
Have a good summer.

180
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,025
Bye, friend.

181
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,268
Thanks for the ride. Mm-hmm.

182
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,803
Hi, grandma.

183
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,139
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you, Mr. price.

184
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,178
So hey, man, listen. The Alerian
open's, like, three months away,

185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,048
and I'm just trying to figure
out who I'm gonna partner with,

186
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,251
and going through the list,
your name popped up

187
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,987
on the list, so I was just...

188
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,323
Man:<i> Well, yeah, um...</i> Yeah?

189
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,825
<i>No, I was saying, "well, yeah,"</i>

190
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,861
<i>like, "well, yeah,"</i>
<i>but not "yeah," yeah.</i>

191
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,197
<i>Yeah, no, It's not</i>
<i>a good idea. So no.</i>

192
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh, yeah, no. No, I didn't...
Oh, yeah.

193
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,135
I'm talking about Alerian open.

194
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,638
I'm talking about going
the full distance, buddy.

195
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,007
What do you think about that?
<i>Yeah, I think...</i>

196
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,110
<i>You remember, you turned
me in to the officials</i>

197
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,847
<i>before a match for smoking
weed in '03? Right?</i>

198
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,250
Right.

199
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,119
<i>Weed that you sold me?</i>

200
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,321
<i>Shitty weed that you sold me?</i>

201
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,124
( Beeps )

202
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,661
Jimmy: <i>You're a fucking pro
at a country club, dude?</i>

203
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,129
Man: <i>Yeah, six figures, bro.</i>

204
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,131
And you're just not playing
on the tour anymore?

205
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,368
You're not in the game?
<i>Yeah, I'm married with kids.</i>

206
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,136
<i>Leo's four now. It's crazy.</i>

207
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,171
Jimmy: <i>Oh, my God.
You're like that dude</i>

208
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,642
<i>in the white shirt</i>
<i>at the... country club.</i>

209
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,411
<i>Hey, long-shorts.</i>
<i>What's up? It's Jimmy p.</i>

210
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,213
<i>Jimmy p. Your butt still
hurting from corona?</i>

211
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,382
<i>Super funny as always, Jimmy.</i>

212
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,885
Jimmy:<i> So listen, man, I've been
trying to narrow down a partner,</i>

213
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:57,055
<i>and I think we should talk
about getting back together.</i>

214
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,357
Long-shorts: <i>Why don't you
swing on out to the house?</i>

215
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,027
<i>All I'm focused on now</i>
<i>is getting to palm Springs</i>

216
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,995
to win the quallies
and getting into the open.

217
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,064
Yeah, man, me too. Me too.

218
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,901
If we stick together, we can
totally make that shit happen.

219
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,271
You got a lot of nerve,
I'll give you that.

220
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,775
What do you...
What do you mean?

221
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,277
You're 35. You're
begging a 21-year-old.

222
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,980
I'm just saying, that takes
a lot of balls. Ah...

223
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:26,151
Desperation or... Is it
very low self-esteem?

224
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,022
Guess I'm gonna have
to say "no way in hell."

225
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,094
You could've told me
that on the phone

226
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,464
instead of making me drive
all the way out to this

227
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,433
weird plantation.

228
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,835
Happy retirement, buddy.

229
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,738
See you in palm Springs, bitch.

230
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,747
( Motor whirring )

231
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,083
A "lidda hepp"?

232
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,122
"A lidda hepp"? A lidda hepp?

233
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,857
( Sighs )

234
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,293
Barry, the phrase is
"a little help."

235
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,763
Oh.

236
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,198
I thought it was
a Norwegian saying.

237
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,135
Okay. All right.

238
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,371
Do you see that box
diagonally across from us?

239
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,406
Uh-huh. Okay, I want
you to take a ball,

240
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,275
I want you to hit it underhand

241
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,345
into that box, like this.

242
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,047
Okay? That's a serve.

243
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,283
You do that with every ball
here, and when you're done,

244
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,852
go pick up all the balls and then
bring them back to this line

245
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,320
and do it again.

246
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,290
Got it? Okay. Got it.

247
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,295
I got one in! No talking.

248
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,467
I hit five good serves
in the box in a row.

249
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,003
I'm like kobe Bryant.

250
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,971
Kobe plays basketball.

251
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,040
Yeah, I know.

252
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,043
I meant that I'm like, uh,
the kobe Bryant of tennis.

253
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,112
Mm-hmm.

254
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,182
I even have Kobe's shoes.
See? Yeah, see,

255
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,584
that just makes me think that
you thought kobe played tennis.

256
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,187
My grandma bought them for me.

257
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,422
Sounds good.

258
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,392
And you live with her?
Yeah? Yeah.

259
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,028
So, tell me more
about your mom dying.

260
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,534
Barry, you cannot say
stuff like that, you know?

261
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,403
You... I'm sorry.

262
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:02,273
It's just that
my mom died, too.

263
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,875
Her and my dad.

264
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,045
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,013
It's okay.

266
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,257
Yeah, you know, my mom,

267
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,994
she taught me how to play
tennis before I could walk.

268
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,096
I was actually pretty good.
I won a couple of

269
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,465
junior national tournaments
with my brother.

270
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,335
Why didn't you win
any pro tournaments?

271
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,470
I didn't go pro.

272
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,373
My brother did.
He won a few tournaments.

273
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,244
Well, If you never called it quits, you
could've been as good as Tiger Woods.

274
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,279
Tiger plays golf. I know.

275
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,215
I meant the Tiger Woods of tennis.
( Car horn honks )

276
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,252
Oh, hey, my ride's here.

277
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,187
You, uh, want to come over

278
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,256
and watch<i> Harry Potter</i> later?

279
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,423
No, thank you.

280
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,532
See you later, Mr. price. Bye.

281
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,244
Hey, Barry...

282
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,681
I'm gonna be here Thursday, same time,
If you want to practice your serves.

283
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,384
Yeah, cool. I'm...

284
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:23,521
I'm like the Harry Potter
of tennis.

285
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,224
Yes. Yeah.

286
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,195

Uh, It's Jimmy.

300
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,281
Hey. Hey, man.

301
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,450
Is everything okay?

302
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,452
Yeah. Yeah, I was just

303
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,421
stopping by to check on my bro.

304
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:07,425
Right. Uh...

305
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,529
Can I come in?

306
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,134
Yeah.

307
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,307
Oh, so, hey, uh,
congratulations are in order.

308
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,743
Dad told me
you broke up with greta.

309
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,413
Uh, It's "grace." Grace.

310
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,515
That was her n...
Wait, that was her name?

311
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,417
Yeah, we went out
for three years, so...

312
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,819
( Laughing ) That's awesome.

313
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,359
Yeah, I just got out of a
really bad relationship, too.

314
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,494
Really?

315
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,830
Hayes Davenport. No forehand.
Real cocksucker.

316
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,533
So now I don't have a bid for
the qualifying tournament.

317
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,269
Qualifying for what?

318
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,271
I'm making a run at the open.

319
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,306
( Chuckles ) Right.

320
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,775
Right.

321
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,111
Yeah, so now I have to
earn my way in

322
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,081
through this upcoming
pre-qualifying tourney.

323
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,583
If I win that, I'm in the
quallies at palm Springs.

324
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,785
If I win at palm Springs,
I'm in the open.

325
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,821
Right. Cool.

326
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,556
Yep.

327
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,624
I just need a partner.

328
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,567
Are you serious?

329
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,669
( Belches ) Yep.

330
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,405
Jimmy... Hey, look.

331
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,607
I think we can be
kick-ass again.

332
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,176
I think this is our chance to...
I don't think so, man.

333
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,446
To really fuck
some shit up, you know?

334
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,650
We could go out there, and we
could really fuck some shit up.

335
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,254
Jim, no. Sorry. Sorry, Jim.

336
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,559
I forgot.

337
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,796
I forgot what a fucking
scaredy-cat you are.

338
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,599
I did. It completely
slipped my mind.

339
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,735
You should be honest with
yourself and me and just say,

340
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,239
"I'm a scared little girl
inside of a tall man's body."

341
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,875
It's a waste
of fucking time, man.

342
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,481
This is your dream you
fucked up, not mine, so...

343
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,486
Is, is that it?

344
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,622
Are we... Are we done?

345
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,896
( Door opens, shuts )

346
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,836
Overhand, huh?

347
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,572
No biggie smalls.

348
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,777
Can I hit balls from that
tennis Cannon too? Nope.

349
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,680
When was the last time you
played against real people?

350
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,949
It's been a while,

351
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,718
but I actually just got an
offer to play doubles again.

352
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,920
With who?

353
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,389
My brother. Awesome.

354
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,790
You won tournaments with him.

355
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,826
Junior tournaments,
and he's an idiot.

356
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:59,430
Yeah, but still, it'd be cool to
see how good you guys are now.

357
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,399
I mean, you have
nothing to lose.

358
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,403
I mean, your girlfriend
left you.

359
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:09,874
You're just a single,
unemployed teacher.

360
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,343
No, I get it. You're actually
a substitute teacher.

361
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,645
I mean, people always
say that they have

362
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,748
nothing to lose, but they
actually have something to lose.

363
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,751
You literally have
nothing to lose.

364
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,854
You don't have anything. Yeah, I get it.
Like, the first, you know...

365
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,358
Well, your, uh,
your kia sorrento lease.

366
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,727
Oh, that's a great point, Barry.
Thank you.

367
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,295
You're welcome.

368
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,371
( Grunts )

369
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,044
( Grunts )

370
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:23,848
If you didn't crush 'em so
hard, a lot more would go in.

371
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,918
Well, If I hit 'em underhand,
I could get 'em all in.

372
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,454
Just saying you could serve
at 120 instead of 130,

373
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,357
and 20% more of your serves
would go in.

374
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,761
Yeah, and I'm just saying If I served 'em
underhand, I could get every serve in.

375
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,497
Are you still leading all the
tournaments in double faults?

376
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,832
Yeah, and aces.
And unforced errors?

377
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,001
( CHUCKLING )
This coming from the guy

378
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,503
who once had
a five-minute rally

379
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,305
waiting for the other guy
to screw up.

380
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,573
I could've literally laid down
on the court and taken a nap.

381
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,842
We won that point. And we
didn't win by my aces?

382
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,445
Not your unforced errors.
Dude, Oh, my God.

383
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,415
Your game is so fucking conservative.
And yours is reckless.

384
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,718
We would've won twice as many
tournaments If you had any balls.

385
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,054
I'm the only reason we won
any tournaments, asshole.

386
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,989
Right.

387
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,860
So you're in?

388
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,532
Yeah. I'm in.

389
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,104
Hey, dad, what's this?

390
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:24,108
It's for canine epilepsy.
It's valium, basically.

391
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,718
( Sighs ) Took him three times around
the block, but he finally went.

392
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,755
Well, If it isn't my little buddy.
What's he still doing here?

393
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,857
He's waiting for
someone to adopt him.

394
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,826
Well, you could put him
to work in the meantime.

395
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,561
There's a huge market
out there for animal porn.

396
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,563
I was not aware.
Jack, I'll see you tomorrow.

397
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,698
Thanks, Heather. Guess what?

398
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,133
Tell me. Darren's in.

399
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,802
Yeah, we actually
drove over here

400
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,838
to tell you together,
but when he realized

401
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,940
he'd have to see Heather,
he bitched out.

402
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:59,043
He lied and said he wanted to
listen to "piano man" in the car.

403
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,445
That's a good song.

404
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,147

( Horn beeping )

410
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,565
What are you doing out here?

411
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,468
I just... I was just...
I was just listening to...

412
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,505
Sorry. Hold on a second.
Just listening to a song.

413
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,141
It's a good song. And, uh...

414
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,645
Are you here with Jimmy?

415
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,814
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
we're partnering up.

416
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,516
That's fantastic.

417
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,551
He was just saying he wants
to make a run at the open.

418
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,653
Yeah, I don't...

419
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,156
I'm just excited to get
some exercise, you know?

420
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,158
Excuse me.

421
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,860
Do you two happen to know where
the mid-valley vet clinic is?

422
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,696
Hi, Gary. Hey, baby.
( CHUCKLING )

423
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,800
Hey. Gary weeder.

424
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,601
Darren.

425
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,036
P-price. Darren price.

426
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,772
Darren's Jack's son. Oh. Nice.

427
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,207
So are you a vet, too?

428
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,775
No, uh, a teacher.

429
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,077
Oh. Nice.

430
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,747
Wait, are you...
Are you the hair guy?

431
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,082
Like, the "comb the gray out"?

432
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,820
Gary doesn't like
that term, "hair guy."

433
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,888
I'm the "right for men"
co-spokesman.

434
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,658
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't, you know...

435
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,859
Hey. You didn't know.

436
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,230
All right, well,
we should get going.

437
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,933
Good to see you, Darren.
Yeah, good to see you. Okay.

438
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,101
All right, hey, later. Bye-bye.

439

( Car starts )

440
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,915
See, when I go to net, you've
got to go cross court.

441
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,750
There's something about vhs.

442
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,052
It's like listening to vinyl

443
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,087
or jerking off
to dad's<i> playboys.</i>

444
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,149
Can you just pay attention
for two more minutes?

445
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:52,990
Are you kidding me?

446
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,025
I can hardly take
my eyes off myself.

447
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,994
I was hot.
Why didn't you tell me

448
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,256
how good my ass looked
while hitting a forehand?

I haven't seen your
hair band thingies.

455
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,879
I did look under
the bed, grace. Yes.

456
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,146
Yeah, I don't...

457
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,282
I accept.

the dream-catcher in my car.

Did he contact you
for masturbatory reasons?

464

Lunch? <i>I'm sorry. Who's asking?</i>

465
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:36,567
Really? This is
amazing to know.

466
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,602
So what happens? Do you...

467

I've got so many questions.
<i>No freebies.</i>

Aw. "Vanessa78." Yeah, okay.

471
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,282
Who were you talking to?

472
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,984
Hmm? Oh, I was talking
to my high-school self.

473
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,555
I wanted to warn me about Jamie Albright.
She gave me crabs.

474
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,291
Oddly, not as bad of a
thing as one would think.

475
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,760
Mm.

476
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,062
Don't touch me.

477
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,342
Putnam public is so much
better than this shithole.

478
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:22,313
This place is good. No
one will bother us here.

479
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:25,849
Yeah? Then who's that?
Hi, Mr. price.

480
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,618
Oh, that's Barry.

481
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,787
He's like a ball boy.

482
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,890
Hey, Barry. Barry, this is Jimmy.
Jimmy, this is Barry.

483
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:36,160
Hey, Jimmy. Barry.

484
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:39,163
Where'd you get your outfit?
The Kenneth Cole outlet.

485
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,198
Darren: So, I want
to keep the racquets

486
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
in the bag and do some
footwork conditioning.

487
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,201
What? Fuck that, man.

488
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,903
Hey, watch your
language around Barry.

489
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,738
What? Barry knows
I'm fucking around.

490
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,774
Listen, you're fat, and
we don't have a coach.

491
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,078
Hey, hey. Can we just hit around
for a little while, please?

492
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,880
Fine.

493
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,150

fucked Pinocchio.

00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,127
Ball, Barry, ball.
It went off the frame.

517
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,970
We should still get a run in.

518
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,708
Are you s... We just played
for three hours, man.

519
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,710
Jimmy, If you lost 10 pounds,

520
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,145
you'd still be the fattest
guy on the circuit.

521
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,748
Dude, that's rude.

522
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,984
I'm gonna go
take a run... tubs.

523
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,356
So,

524
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,293
who's your favorite tennis
man from the 1980s?

525
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,097
Okay.

526
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,850
Okay. Here you go.

527
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,222
All right,
let's just hit it around,

528
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,224
get back in the old
swing of things.

529
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,526
No pressure, Jimmy, you know?

530
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,461
Buddy, would you relax, please?

531
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,797
This is just a sparring session.
Don't count for shit.

532
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,999
Hey, hi!

533
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,301
Dad and Heather are here?

534
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,205
Look at you. What?

535
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,307
You've had a boner for her
since the fifth grade,

536
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,076
and you still
haven't made a move.

537
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,378
You want me to hook you up
with that sweet ass?

538
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,515
Yes, Jimmy. Right before
our first match in 15 years,

539
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:47,918
I'd like you to hook me up
with that sweet ass.

540
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,555
You guys ready? Yeah.

541
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,490
Yeah, we're ready. Up.

542
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,829
Yes! Bitches.

543
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,031
All right, I'm gonna go
down the "t" on both.

544
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,100
I'll pooch on the second serve.

545
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,536
It's not gonna get that far.
I'm gonna ace these fuckers.

546
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:08,038
Just relax, okay? You relax.

547
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,209
Good luck, guys. Yeah.

548
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,284
Just making sure you're awake.

549
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,287
You want some of this?

550
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,861
Really? Second-serve ace?

551
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,966
Second-serve ace.

552
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:39,069
That good or bad? Both.

553
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,514
Seriously? Can I play or what?

554
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,616
This is not fun for me at all.

555
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,154
Out.

556
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,023
Wh-what? It was just
about two inches wide.

557
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,025
That was in.
I'm calling it out.

558
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,527
It's an honor system.
Let it go.

559
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,463
Okay. No, you're right.
Good call, guys.

560
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,233
Good eyes. Good eyes.

561
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,038
Out. What?

562
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,907
Sorry. That was
a couple inches out.

563
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,976
Man: Are you kidding me?

564
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,477
Hey, If Abercrombie and douche

565
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,980
want to play like that,
I'll play like that all day.

566
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,315
Yeah, keep staring
me down, Facebook.

567
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,317
I got way more friends
than you, trust me.

568
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,386
Serve the ball.

569
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,624
Those guys were
fucking tools, bro.

570
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,926
What the hell happened
out there, huh?

571
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,628
What happened was we lost

572
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,930
to an unranked local team

573
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:43,133
in a no-name tournament
in the first round.

574
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,969
So you want to qualify
for the open?

575
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,676
Look, man, you're not taking
this seriously at all.

576
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,278
What do you mean?

577
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,246
If you want to
qualify for the open,

578
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,181
you can't drink like this, man.
What?

579
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,951
Do you think olympic
athletes do this?

580
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:03,353
Well, the Russians do.
Yeah, for sure,

581
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,355
and I'm not putting
anything past the Chinese.

582
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,291
I'm not gonna get
in your way or anything,

583
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,127
but If you want to drink and
party, then I'm out, man. Right.

584
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,296
I'm out.

585
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,102
( Belches ) Sorry, what?

586
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,071
Good luck finding
another partner.

587
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,974
Darren, look. If I
knew you were serious,

588
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,109
I wouldn't be drinking. Come on.

589
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,145
You're pouring another
glass right now.

590
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,280
Yeah, well, now it looks
like you really are leaving,

591
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,716
so I'm kind of hedging my bets here.
You're an idiot.

592
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,518
What?

593
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,154
Fine. See you at
Christmas, I guess.

594
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,072
You're up early.

595
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,507
You still bring her
flowers, huh?

596
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,276
Yeah, every Sunday.

597
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,445
Yeah, I like that, uh,

598
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,114
plastic holder thing
you put in.

599
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,283
Darren did that.

600
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,685
It's kind of cheap looking,

601
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,088
but It's nice of him.

602
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,729
Tip my 40 in the memory
of my mother.

603
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,198
Jesus, Jimmy, what are you...
What?

604
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,333
Don't pour beer on your mother.

605
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,735
It was... Okay. Sorry.

606
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,170
It's an urban thing.

607
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,306
Sorry.

608
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,444
Oh, so Darren quit.
( Chuckles )

609
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,784
Want to tell me what happened?

610
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:44,388
He, he... you know.

611
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,490
We were just having fun.

612
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,525
Jimmy, what happened?

613
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,762
He was being a baby about
me having a few drinks.

614
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,330
Ah.

615
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,134
And you want to know
what I think?

616
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,604
Maybe.

617
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,776
I think If you quit drinking

618
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,445
and really, really
trained seriously,

619
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,415
you'd still have a hard
time making the open.

620
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,251
Son, If you don't
straighten up,

621
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,253
you have a snowball's
chance in hell.

622
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,821
And after the whole
dash Stevens ordeal...

623
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,257
No. That was, like,
15 years ago.

624
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:23,060
Jimmy, he's your brother.
Did you ever stop and think

625
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,195
what it must've been
like for him?

626
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,532
To watch you turn pro,

627
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,634
do all the things
he wanted to do?

628
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,573
You want my advice?

629
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,642
Be a better brother.

630
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,652
All right, I'm gonna
get out of here.

631
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:52,489
This place fucking bores me.

632
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,424
Love you, dad.

633
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,293
Love you.

634
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,851
Hey.

635
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,887
How long have you
been waiting out here?

636
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,456
Uh... well,

637
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,226
I didn't want
to wake you, so...

638
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,362
What do you want?

639
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,465
You were right.

640
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,337
Okay, I know this is, uh...

641
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,906
I know this is my last
shot to prove anything,

642
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,742
and I want to do it right.

643
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,684
Look, I think It's great that you're
wearing a shit without any stains on it,

644
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,720
but just 'cause
you brush your hair...

645
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,421
I also cleaned my apartment.

646
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,891
What does that have
to do with anything?

647
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,927
It's like a... symbol or...
I don't know, asshole.

648
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,664
Just listen. If you come back,
give this another shot,

649
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,235
then you run the show.

650
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,472
All right? You...
You make the rules.

651
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,574
You're the coach.

652
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,309
Okay?

653
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,511
Hey, If I don't
take this seriously,

654
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,914
If you think at any point I'm fucking
around too much or whatever,

655
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,183
you can just... you can bail

656
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,218
and tell me to fuck off,
and that's that.

657
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,287
Just give me one more shot.

658
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,856
Come on.

659
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,726
No drinking?

660
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,897
Right. No drinking.

661
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,667
No partying, no smoking,

662
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:47,237
no drugs of any kind, no junk
food, none of that shit.

663
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,638
I promise.

664
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,947
I won't even smile.

665
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,253
Yeah?

666
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:04,854
All right.

667
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,791
Yeah? Let's do it.

668
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,293
All right. You
remember the routine?

669
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,795
Yep.

670
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,790
You know what, actually?

671
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,792
I feel... I feel healthier.

672
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,628
Yeah. Yeah.

673
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,463
You probably lost
six pounds alone

674
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,565
not eating the food that
drops on your shirt anymore.

675
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,767
( Laughing ) You shut
up, and you shut up.

676
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,639
Darren: Okay.

677
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,607
Barry: Ooh, um, can you actually

678
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,009
drop me off back at the school?

679
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,677
I want to work on my forehand.

680
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,846
What? No, no, no. We're, uh...

681
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,015
We'll practice tomorrow. Dude,
It's not gonna do any good.

682
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,850
You have an awful,
awful forehand.

683
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,019
Right? Darren: No. You
got a good forehand.

684
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,021
Uh... Bye-bye. Bye, now, Barry.

685
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,722
See you later. See you later.

686
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,759
Woman: Maybe because
you're being a bitch.

687
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,028
Out of my way! Seriously?

688
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,212
You told me Barry wasn't here.
What the fuck?

689
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:21,398
Are you lying to me now?

690
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,633
( Women arguing )

691
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,484
Who are these guys that
are dropping him off?

692
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,770
What the hell are you thinking?

693
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,972
Get back inside,
for crying out loud.

694
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,541
Woman: How come you
didn't hug me?

695
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,577
What, no hug? What'd you do?
What'd you tell him?

696
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,847
Get inside. Oh, you get inside.

697
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,029
Hey.

698
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,066
Hey. Wh...

699
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:57,901
Oh.

700
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,070
You didn't realize
I was coming.

701
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,672
Uh, no, but, um... Oh.

702
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,408
( Laughs ) Jimmy said
you asked me to come.

703
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,011
Oh, no. But, I mean,
you know, I...

704
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,080
It's great. Yeah?

705
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,716
Yeah, totally.
No, this is great.

706
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,589
How's, um, hair guy?

707
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,091
Gary? Gary. Gary.

708
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:22,959
It's going really well,
I think.

709
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,594
Cool. How'd you guys meet?

710
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,029
Um...

711
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,932
Uh, this dating web site.

712
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,900
I do the on-line thing
too, so...

713
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,902
Really? Oh, gosh.

714
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,538
Well, It's too bad you
didn't find me before Gary,

715
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,874
'cause that would've been interesting.
That would've been.

716
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,843
( Laughs ) Jack: Hey, slugger.

717
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,911
Hey, dad. Jimmy: R-really?

718
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,481
What? Dad, really? You
call Darren "slugger" too?

719
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,082
I thought that was our thing.

720
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,718
I don't remember ever actually
calling you "slugger."

721
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,653
You don't? If anyone's
the slugger, It's me.

722
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,155
Jimmy, you lied to get me here.

723
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,023
Everyone knows you're
boning the wrong guy.

724
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,693
Jimmy... what? Do you think
she's boning the right guy?

725
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,595
You've met him. Be honest.
Jim...

726
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,597
Jim... I'm just...

727
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,632
( Whispering ) Sorry to make
this uncomfortable for you.

728
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,935
Jack: Shut up! Fine.

729
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,037
What's going on at the clinic?

730
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,173
It's good. Busy.

731
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,175
Yeah, we were packed.
What did we have?

732
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,778
Eight dogs, seven cats
and a ferret today.

733
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,514
Actually, we had
seven dogs and eight cats.

734
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,983
Pretty sure it was
eight dogs and seven cats,

735
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,986
and I definitely remember the ferret,
although as soon as I started saying that,

736
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,687
I was thinking, "was
the ferret yesterday?"

737
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,589
Yeah, I think it was.
I can't do...

738
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,859
Guys, I'm gonna cut you off, because
otherwise I'll kill myself.

739
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,095
( Pager beeping )

740
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,597
Dad still thinks
he's in<i> new Jack city.</i>

741
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,534
Oh, It's an emergency.

742
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,669
Kind of. It's Mrs. Dolcort.

743
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,973
Oh, her pomeranian,
she's in really bad shape.

744
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,543
Yeah, but, you know,
we're all here.

745
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,512
Why don't I take this? No, look.
It's Mrs. Dolcort.

746
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,781
She'll throw a fit If
It's not me in person.

747
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,951
But If you go, how are we gonna solve
the "seven dog, eight dog" mystery?

748
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,820
Okay.

749
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,755
It's gonna keep me up.

750
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:01,491
Let's do this again soon, okay?

751
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,496
It's great to see
you two together.

752
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:07,764
Bye, dad. Bye, Jack.

753
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,566
See ya, pop.

754
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,969
I call him "pop." It's a thing.

755
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,238
So, are you guys

756
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,140
gonna hit it tonight?

757
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,210
Really? We're ready to order.

758
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,613
He's a pretty big guy, so I'm assuming
he's got some junk in the trunk.

759
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:26,683
As in "elephant trunk."
Do you know what I'm saying?

760
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,589
My penis is feeding
your mouth right now?

761
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:36,860
Mm-hmm. Elephant trunk. ( Imitates
elephant sound ) You know what I'm saying?

762
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:39,729
Elephant trunk.

763
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,934
You're good at this.
Yeah, thank you.

764
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,003

I have to ask you something.

Okay. What?

Why? What's going on?

Seven years? Wow.

00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:14,857

You're, like, a democrat?

Okay? We're not close.

Yeah. Okay. And we...

807
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,951
We need to be in tune
with each other,

00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,120

thinking on the court,

a chance in hell.

They're in tune.
They're in sync.

814
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:59,135
We need to be in sync. The pre-quallies
are right around the corner,

815
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,171
and If we want to win there, we have
to learn shit about each other.

00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,154
Jimmy: Good session today, man.

861
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:01,958
This "opening up" shit
is like emotional steroids.

862
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,493
Yeah.

863
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,199
Hey, you remember when I played
with that guy, dash Stevens?

864
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,301
Yeah. What about him?

865
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,303
Nothing. Just...

866
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,140
He was the worst.

867
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:20,009
That's good to know.

868
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,145
I mean,

869
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:25,114
you're way better than him.

870
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,218
Thanks.

871
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,120
Thanks, man.

872
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,929
Barry, what's going on?
You've been quiet lately.

873
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,230
Yeah.

874
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,332
Is there anything on your mind?

875
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,234
Maybe.

876
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:49,105
I was... just this one day...

877
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:52,341
I was being really
annoying at home, and...

878
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,510
You know how sometimes
you do one thing,

879
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,214
and that leads to another thing
and that leads to another thing?

880
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,383
Like a chain reaction?

881
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:02,485
If I hadn't been
so annoying that day,

882
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,921
other bad things
wouldn't have happened.

883
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,292
That woman at your house
when we dropped you off,

884
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,494
that was your mom, huh?

885
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,566
Yeah. I know
I told you she died.

886
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:18,901
Oh, that's okay.

887
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:21,404
You've got to understand,
Barry, whatever happened,

888
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:25,908
whether your mom left or what,
you know, It's not your fault.

889
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,045
Okay?

890
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:31,280
Is she still at the house?

891
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,583
Yeah,

892
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,384
sort of.

893
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,024
Are you around this weekend? 'Cause
the pre-quallies start tomorrow,

894
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,594
and we could really use
your support in our corner.

895
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:47,330
Do you think
you could help us out?

896
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,868
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

897
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,270
Okay, good. That's good.

898
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,875
It's good that Barry's gonna
help us out, right, Jimmy?

899
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,177
Is this a trick question?
Yeah, I don't give a fuck.

900
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,512
Just tell him not to
color-coordinate so much.

901
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:06,148
Yeah, I don't think that's
something he can control.

902
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,188
( Racquet striking ball )

903
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,459
( People applauding )

904
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:18,628
<i>( Man over p.A., indistinct )</i>

905
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:25,368
I've never seen you so nervous.
I'm not nervous.

906
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,003
Are you nervous?

907
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,272
Not that nervous.

908
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,307
I'm nervous.

909
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,312
Okay.

910
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,325
Barry: So cool!

911
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,109
You know anything
about these guys?

912
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,079
Uh, yes. The one
with the moustache

913
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,181
kind of looks like
Freddie Mercury.

914
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,418
I'm not sure If that helps
us out, tennis-wise.

915
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,423
I'm not worried.
Suddenly I'm not worried.

916
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,738
Fuck.

917
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,742
Seriously? Come on.

918
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,278
( Exhales ) Come on.

919
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,614
( Exclaims )

920
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,655
Sorry, partner. Those
tube socks threw me off.

921
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,226
Can't believe
I gave them that set.

922
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,095
Two double faults
in the last game.

923
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:02,198
Yeah, the volley into my own
foot didn't help either.

924
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,500
( Exhales sharply )

925
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,405
So how is Southern Italian food

926
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:12,008
different than regular
Italian food?

927
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,444
Uh...

928
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:18,581
Less butter, more olive oil,

929
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,449
and not as many meats.

930
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,252
Just more refined, you know?

931
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,754
Right.

932
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,655
It's pretty tasty.

933
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,791
Yeah, it sounds...
Sounds tasty.

Yeah! Whoo!

You could've slammed
that shit home!

Fuck, I know.
It's all good, baby.

( Crowd applauding )

952
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,597
If we win this point,

953
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,833
we go to palm Springs
for the quallies.

954
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,479
( Shouts ) Yes!

955
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,549
Yes! What's up, palm Springs?

956
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,886
How about that, man? Whoo!

957
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:39,688
Great game. Well played.
Weird shirts.

958
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,400
Darren. Hey.

959
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:54,370
Um, It's not really... Shut up.

960
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,372
I mean, don't shut up.

961
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:58,607
Just, uh, don't say anything.

962
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:01,510
So, I just came off
a really big win,

963
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,580
and I'm feeling more confidence
now than I pretty much

964
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:07,583
ever have in my life, so, um...

965
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:10,886
This is actually
harder than I thought.

966
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:14,523
Um, we just won the
pre-qualifying tournament,

967
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,559
and we're going
to palm Springs.

968
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,628
And If we win at palm Springs,
we are actually in the open.

969
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,866
So... so you should
come with us... with me...

970
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,435
and-and then after...
( Door opens )

971
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,771
Amateur tennis? Nice.

972
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,773
Wow, that is so funny.

973
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,841
We were just talking about what
we were gonna do this weekend.

974
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,643
Palm Springs? Awesome. Mm-hmm.

975
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:38,247
I... have you been
working out? I...

976
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:41,450
I think It's great
that you guys have a...

977
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,452
It's lining up like that.

978
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:46,855
Can you get us tickets?
Uh, probably not,

979
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:48,691
but the tickets are...

980
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,793
The tickets,
they're eight or nine.

981
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,329
Well, then... yeah.
That's... yeah.

982
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:56,999
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You guys will...

983
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,435
Nice.

984
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,237
All right. Um... Perfect.

985
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,838
Well, have a good night,
and, uh...

986
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,974
Good to see you, Darren.
Yeah. Okay.

987
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:09,011
Real fucking nice,
you fucking idiot.

988
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,348
What up, what up? Dude!

989
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,483
Guys, quick question.

990
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:17,386
What are the odds
of me being a ball boy?

991
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:20,522
I mean, I heard that the
officials and the ball boys

992
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:23,425
in the quallies
were volunteers.

993
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,904
Barry: I think we need to have
a talk about mutual respect.

994
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,389
You play world of warcraft?

995
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,357
Yeah. You?

996
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,925
Uh, yeah.

997
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,428
My main 'toon is
a level 90 on dead mage

998
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,697
with a complete regalia
of the burns scroll set.

999
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,899
214, buddy. Two pieces away

1000
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,368
from completing my p.V.P. Set.

1001
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,337
You?

1002
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:11,674
I'm level 82, human paladin,

1003
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,742
but all the level 90...

1004
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,611
yeah, yeah, okay.
You know what?

1005
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:17,579
Don't talk to me
about wow again

1006
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,516
until you're at least a level 90
with respectable raiding gear.

1007
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:22,718
And by respectable,
I mean epic.

1008
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,691
Okay.

1009
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,630
You know what? One other thing.

1010
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,034
We're a fucking team now, okay?

1011
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,573
And we're men. And men...

1012
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,775
Men don't blame themselves

1013
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:49,111
for pussy-ass shit
that's not their fault.

1014
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,914
Your mom doesn't have her shit
together, that's her issue.

1015
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:02,124
No more blaming yourself for that, or I'm
gonna throw you out of this fucking car.

1016
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,926
You got it?

1017
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:05,394
Got it.

1018
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,729
Good.

1019
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,535
So, um,

1020
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,537
about me being a ball boy...

1021
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,774
Shh. Go to sleep.

1022
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,615
No, no, no. Over there.

1023
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,991
Jimmy: What's up, palm Springs?

1024
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,993
Yo, what's up, dude?

1025
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,396
How you feeling?
You strong? You strong?

1026
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:43,031
That guy's such a pussy, dude?
Such a puss.

1027
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,001
With the open a week
away, unseeded players

1028
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:49,705
are here in palm Springs competing
in the qualifying tournament

1029
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,940
for the open's final spots.

1030
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:55,043
Jimmy price found a partner. Unbelievable.
Good luck, buddy. Bam. Bam. Bam.

1031
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,546
Young rookies and old vets
will battle it out

1032
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:59,982
for the prize of being
slaughtered in the first round

1033
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,650
by a top-seeded opponent.

1034
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,920
What do you know
about these guys?

1035
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,189
Okay, here we go.
Alan freedland...

1036
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:09,725
He's got a great forehand.
Stay away from that.

1037
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,927
Alan Cohen, he's the guy
closer to us...

1038
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,463
he is a scrapper. He'll
poach all day long.

1039
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,465
Keep him honest.
Hit a few down the line.

1040
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,435
People call them the Alans.
I call them the Alan-gators.

1041
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,804
Rumor has it they tried
to fuck the same girl once

1042
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,839
in a pool in Florida.

1043
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:25,474
That's good to know.

1044
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:28,043
I wonder If
their dicks touched.

1045
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,681
Why don't we ask them?
Let's do this.

1046
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:35,851
This is Barry. Hi, Barry.
This is Gary.

1047
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:38,120
Hey, man.

1048
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,055
Our names rhyme.

1049
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,090
That's mildly amusing.

1050
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,961
All right, all right.

1051
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,697
What's up, ladies? Call it.

1052
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,566
Tails.

1053
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,969
Suck it. We're gonna serve.

1054
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,206
Boom! Oh, guys, guys, sorry.

1055
00:57:57,208 --> 00:58:01,777
Um, is it true you actually
touched dicks in fl...

1056
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,012
I wasn't finished.

1057
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,793
Come on.

1058
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,628
Come on. Let's go.

1059
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,139
Yeah!

1060
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,778
Match point, man. We get
this, and we're moving on.

1061
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,686
( Cheering )

1062
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,993
That's my brother right there!

1063
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:54,997
Whoo! ( Laughs )

1064
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,633
No, no, no, no, Barry, Barry.

1065
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,869
This is a buffet, which means you
only eat the expensive shit.

1066
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:04,239
Take whatever you want, Barry.
That's the whole point of a buffet.

1067
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:06,308
You want some leafy Greens,
you get your leafy Greens.

1068
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,243
Really? Okay, fine.

1069
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,612
You don't get your money's
worth, It's not my fault.

1070
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,848
This is exactly why
you two are broke.

1071
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,983
Move on.

1072
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:16,585
Hey, nice match
out there, guys.

1073
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,320
Oh, nice fake compliment
to cut the line.

1074
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,289
Thanks. Hey, sorry
about your draw.

1075
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,724
"Sorry"? Oh, you didn't hear?
You guys drew

1076
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,760
Osborne and chandy
for your second match.

1077
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:28,063
Aren't they top-ten? What are
they doing in the quallies?

1078
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,198
Osborne injured his ankle
and missed most of the year,

1079
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,267
so the quallies are their
warm-up for the open.

1080
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,770
They endured the test of time and...
Hey, hey, hey.

1081
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:38,006
You're not on camera, asshole. We can
totally take those tools, trust me.

1082
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,309
I'm just gonna head to the meats. I'm
not gonna fill up on bread and tomatoes

1083
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,811
like a fucking chump. Jesus.

1084
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,617
So you're like the
tennis announcer guy.

1085
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:51,053
Uh, yeah. Did you
ever play tennis?

1086
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:54,690
I played in high school.
Oh, so not really.

1087
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:58,827
Watch your tone, nerd.

1088
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,863
Osborne's had time to rehab his
ankle, but It's still untested.

1089
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,099
Although you may want to
worry less about strategy

1090
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,734
and more about that.

1091
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:08,303
Who is that? Alexander.

1092
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,706
His partner went down
a few days ago.

1093
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,809
He's already in the open, so he's
looking for a last-minute replacement.

1094
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:17,045
But... I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.

1095
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,314
( Crowd applauding )

1096
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,428
Out!

1097
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,998
Come on, guys. Announcer:<i> Game
and first set, Osborne-chandy.</i>

1098
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,801
Come on, bro. We can
bounce back from this.

1099
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,872
Let's go.

1100
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,815
Man!

1101
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:28,884
Sorry. My bad.

1102
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,220
Really?

1103
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,056
Announcer:
<i>Game, Osborne-chandy.</i>

1104
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,330
<i>Ace!</i> ( Crowd applauding )

1105
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,401
Tough serves, huh?

1106
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,704
They're too good. No.

1107
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,921
The boys just need to
keep their heads in it.

1108
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:51,765
They'll be okay.

1109
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,877
Hey! Me!

1110
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,216
Get out of the way.

1111
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,427
<i>Game, price-price.</i>

1112
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,146
( Groaning )

1113
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,386
What If he can't continue?

1114
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,789
Well, they'd have to
forfeit, and we advance.

1115
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,457
Barry: Awesome!

1116
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,092
Hey, Barry,

1117
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,763
you don't want to ever
root for an injury, okay?

1118
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:49,498
At least, not openly.

1119
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,971
Can you go on?
No, I don't think so.

1120
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:58,774
<i>Osborne-chandy forfeit</i>
<i>due to Osborne injury.</i>

1121
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,776
<i>Price-price advance.</i>

1122
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,312
Yes!

1123
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,481
Sorry.

1124
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,984
Sorry, guys.

1125
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,553
It's bad luck, guys.
It's bad luck.

1126
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,190
Dude. Darren.

1127
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,259
Darren, hey.
What the fuck, man?

1128
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:20,195
Fuck you, man. Why are you
being such a dick? What?

1129
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:23,365
I did you a pretty big fucking
favor by making a run with you,

1130
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,501
and then... It's a
pretty fucking dick move

1131
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,538
to try to throw the match.

1132
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,406
Seriously? You think I...

1133
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,542
Dude, those guys are
a top-ten team, man.

1134
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:36,578
Yeah, I messed up a few times, but...
"A few times"?

1135
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,548
Dude, that was the worst
match you have ever played.

1136
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,551
At least If you're going to throw a
match, try to do it with a little art.

1137
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:45,120
You want to play the blame game
and re-count points?

1138
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,989
'Cause I can easily go into all
the forehands you fucked up.

1139
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,358
Here you go. Here you go.
Let's forfeit the next match,

1140
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,994
and you can just go play with
Alexander like you always wanted to.

1141
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,831
Dude, stop being an asshole, please.
We're about to go to the open.

1142
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,833
We're one match away.
Fuck you, man!

1143
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,235
You're being a fucking dick.
Don't fucking touch me, man.

1144
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:03,104
What the fuck? You're being an ass...
Let me tell you something.

1145
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,473
Mom died, and you left me.

1146
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,576
You don't fucking do that!

1147
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,578
You're a shitty brother, Jimmy.

1148
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,582
You've always been
a shitty fucking brother!

1149
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:15,183
You fuck!

1150
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,152
What the fuck?

1151
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,305
Ow. Fuck.

1152
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,126
So...

1153
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:33,161
Trouble with Jimmy?

1154
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,965
Not really.

1155
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,404
Kind of.

1156
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,285
You know, when I was

1157
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,522
just like a week or two
out of vet school,

1158
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:03,625
I got a call to go to this farm

1159
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,027
and work on a donkey.

1160
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,298
I'd never worked
on a donkey before.

1161
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,168
What kind of donkey?

1162
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,172
I don't remember, Barry.

1163
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:19,274
If I said the name of the
breed, would you remember?

1164
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,710
Barry, It's not...

1165
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:24,079
Was it mammoth Jack,
abyssinian...

1166
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:25,580
I'm trying to tell
a story here.

1167
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,382
Sorry.

1168
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,987
Listen, dad,

1169
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,656
I really appreciate the effort,

1170
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:37,492
but I think I just
want to be alone

1171
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,128
right now.

1172
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,599
Just so you know, the donkey
was Jimmy in that story.

1173
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,768
Barry, come on. Let's go, man.

1174
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,410
Oh, uh, Alexander?

1175
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:57,445
He found a new partner
this morning.

1176
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,381
Jimmy told him no

1177
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:03,084
before your match
against Osborne and chandy.

1178
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:06,488
Win or lose, your brother's
in this thing with you.

1179
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,368
Jimmy: I'm not saying it
wasn't a shitty thing to do.

1180
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,772
I mean, I got this offer
to play with this top pro,

1181
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:26,141
and I took it.

1182
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:28,676
Vanessa78: <i>That was a
pretty shitty move.</i>

1183
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:32,547
<i>But you were in a shitty place.</i>

1184
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,516
Yeah, but...

1185
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:37,285
<i>It's okay, babe.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

1186
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,454
<i>You were a shitty-ass
brother, and now you've got</i>

1187
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:42,157
<i>a ton of years to be</i>
<i>a not-shitty-ass brother.</i>

1188
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,125
You got it all
figured out, huh?

1189
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:47,128
<i>Medium.</i>

1190
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:50,698
<i>Mm, I've got a client</i>
<i>that wants to chat.</i>

1191
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,068
<i>Let's get rid of him.</i>
No, It's okay.

1192
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,770
You work. I'm going to, uh...

1193
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:58,306
I'm gonna head down
to the hot tub,

1194
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:00,508
loosen up a bit before bed.

1195
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,277
<i>Okay.</i> Okay?

1196
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,312
<i>Good night.</i>

1197
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:07,282
<i>Good luck tomorrow.</i> Yeah.
( Chuckles )

1198
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,543
Come in If you want, but I've
pissed in here twice already.

1199
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:38,279
What happened to your face?

1200
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,715
I got into a fight.
No, not the bruises.

1201
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:45,120
Just... Just your face.

1202
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,855

1203
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,495

Don't interrupt me, Barry.

1204
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:55,530
I'm staring at you in disgust.

1205
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,472
Okay, now, what do you want?

1206
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,142
I wanted to know
If you asked the officials.

1207
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,544
If I could be a ball boy
for tomorrow's match or not.

1208
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:12,747
No, no, I did not ask the officials
If you could be a ball boy, okay?

1209
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,518
Now, get the fuck out of here.
Okay.

1210
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,922
Barry, what the fuck?
Where are you going?

1211
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:24,192
You just told me
to get out of here.

1212
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:27,428
Okay, look.

1213
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,231
Part of being a man means

1214
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:32,400
not doing everything I say

1215
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:34,469
and standing up for yourself.

1216
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,671
Got it? Got it.

1217
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,240
Good.

1218
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,843
Now, get the fuck out of here.
Seriously.

1219
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,214
You know, I think I'm just
gonna stay and hang out.

1220
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,850
No, no. Look.
I know what I just said,

1221
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:52,320
but I've got a big match
tomorrow, and I need to focus.

1222
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,856
So I need you to leave.

1223
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,258
I'm serious, you little prick.

1224
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,260
Would you listen to me?
Get the fuck out of here.

1225
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:01,262
Fuck you, Jimmy. I'm staying.

1226
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,671
All right. Atta boy.

1227
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,839
Yeah.

1228
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,209
So I think when I get back,

1229
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:15,810
I might want to join
a tennis league.

1230
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,680
I might need some help.
( Laughs )

1231

to be your coach,

1232
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,650
just forget it, man.

1233
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,452
No fucking way, seriously.

1234
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:27,255
I was actually
thinking about Darren.

1235
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:29,791
Dar... Darren?
What the fuck, Barry?

1236
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,594
I'm way better than
Darren. Come on, man.

1237
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,462
But Darren's been actually...

1238
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:37,398
fine. I will fucking coach you.
Just shut up about it already.

1239
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,802
Okay.

1240
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:43,338

Jimmy: You don't have
to be a dick, dude.

1244
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,367
Sorry. My hands are tied.

1245

Well, so are mine,

1246
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,371

to have to do this, Ron.

Do what?

1248
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,509
Well, do you remember
the controversial call

1249
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,945
you made in
the Sevingnon match?

1250
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,014
Well, guess who has proof

1251
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:27,882

1252

So Davenport is tough.

to get into rallies with these kids.

than usual, so be tight on the switch.

01:22:39,722 --> 01:22:42,289
You're gonna be tempted
to think It's here

1375
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:45,392
or here...

1376
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:47,528
Or even here.

1377
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,268
But it doesn't.
It comes from here.

1378
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,303
All right?

1379
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:05,145
Ronnie, good work
out there, buddy.

1380
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,747
Thank you.

1381
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:14,388
Aw, It's okay.
I'm so proud of you guys.

1382
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,256
Yeah, yeah!

1383
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,359
So will you still go
to dinner with me?

1384
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:20,361
Yes, I will. Thank you.

1385
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,230
That was beautiful. Thank you.

1386
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:25,532
I'm proud of you.

1387
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,668
How do you feel, Barry?
How do you feel?

1388
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,037
I feel good about it. You do?

1389
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,473
And what about that ball you flubbed
in the fourth game of the second set?

1390
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:34,141
You feel good about that?
You saw that?

1391
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:36,176
Everybody saw that, Barry.

1392
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,612
I stick my neck out for you,
and you hang me out to dry.

1393
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:41,382
That thing probably already
has a million hits on YouTube.

1394
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:47,588
Good. Good.

1395
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,590
Take your time.

1396
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,159
Hustle. Hustle! Take your time!

1397
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:55,295
Yes. Good, good.
Hustle, hustle,

1398
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,697
hustle, hustle.

1399
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,600
Stay in the game.
Stay in the game.

1400
01:23:59,602 --> 01:24:02,369
Good, good, good!

1401
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,805
Hey, sweetheart. Darren, you know Vanessa.
Introduce her.

1402
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:07,408
Hi, Darren! Oh, hey, Vanessa.
This is Heather.

1403
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,277
Hi! My dad, Jack.

1404
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,479
It's okay, Barry.
Shake it off, buddy.

1405
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:14,381
Darren, please do not
coach my player.

1406
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,251
Don't shake it off, Barry. Do
not shake it off. Let it dwell.

1407
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,420
Darren: You're an idiot.
Hey, my technique.

1408
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:22,322
Do not fuck with it. Guys, guys, guys,
come on, Barry's got game point here.

1409
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:23,791
Right. Here we go, buddy.

1410
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:41,341
( Cheering ) Yeah!

1411
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:43,544
That was in! Yeah!

1412
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:47,648
Darren: All right Barry!
Yeah! Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

1413
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,651

1414
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:53,687
