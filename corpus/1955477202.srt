179
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,500
Um, nothing,
I'm doing interviews.

180
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,257
You're certainly
doing something.

181
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,596
Yeah, it'll just
be a few questions.

182
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,000
If, um... I'll pay you, okay?

183
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,440
How long will this take?

184
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,539
No more than 15 minutes.

185
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,281
If you could just answer a few
questions, and be honest, please.

186
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:15,179
Just be, like, brutally honest.

187
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,350
Brutally honest?

188
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:22,191
Uh, there's no smoking in here.

189
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,399
Okay, could you just say
your name, and your age,

190
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,100
and some basic stuff
to the camera, please,

191
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,171
- kind of thing?
- No.

192
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,072
Okay, well, I need
basic info from you.

193
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,043
No, you don't.

194
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,144
Okay, how did you get
into your field?

195
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,346
- My field?
- Prostitution.

196
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,279
Thank you.

197
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,219
A man paid me
to have sex with him.

198
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,256
What were the circumstances?

199
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,487
Circumstances were
he wanted to fuck me,

200
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,592
but I didn't want to fuck him,

201
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,993
so he gave me some money.

202
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,656
How long ago was this?

203
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,695
A while.

204
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,171
How old were you?

205
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,973
Younger.

206
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,241
Okay. Let's try
something else.

207
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,176
Is this...

208
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,583
Is this a life that you've
chosen to stick with

209
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,985
or do you want out?

210
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,357
[Kat] Why do you want to know?

211
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:35,027
Because the deal was
that I pay you

212
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,458
to tell me the truth.

213
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,403
No, the deal was
you wanted me to be honest.

214
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,767
- Remember?
- Yes.

215
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,368
Well, the truth is, you're
asking all the wrong questions.

216
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,637
Really?

217
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,338
When did I get started

218
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,270
and how long have
I been doing this?

219
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,005
Do I want out?
Who cares?

220
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,012
Do you like what you do?

221
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,782
I like being good at what I do.

222
00:16:56,783 --> 00:17:00,022
When I'm with a client,
I'm exactly what they want.

223
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:01,750
Not what they say they want.

224
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,755
Not what they think they want.

225
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:07,787
I'm what they don't know
they want.

226
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,058
What do I want?

227
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:16,795
You want someone to come in here
and shit all over your world,

228
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:21,140
make you do things you really
want to do, but can't.

229
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,741
You said you wanted
brutal honesty

230
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,710
because you are looking
for someone

231
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,141
to come in here
and tell you things

232
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,576
you don't want to hear.

233
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,451
What don't I want to hear?

234
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,657
I believe you owe me money.

235
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,496
[Chloe]
How much you charge?

236
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,802
As much as I can get.

237
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,504
Up to $3,000 a night.

238
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,077
I do whatever I need to.

239
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,808
Trade or steal, you know,
if I need a fix.

240
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,815
I'll charge a dick in the ass
if he's got it going on.

241
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,817
[Man moaning]

242
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,564
[Moaning continues]

243
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:20,096
[Man coughing, wheezing]

244
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,369
Hey, babe.

245
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,870
Get me a bottle of water
from the mini-bar.

246
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:29,142
- [Man coughing]
- Yeah, sure.

247
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,851
[Coughing]

248
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,452
Oh, man.

249
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,289
Can I keep these?

250
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,329
If you want to play some more,
we have to renegotiate.

251
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,399
Babe, times are tight.

252
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,270
I can't even afford
our dates anymore.

253
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:02,571
I know you understand.
[Coughing]

254
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,746
Sounds like you couldn't go
another round anyway, love.

255
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,177
You need to take
care of yourself

256
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,323
or you'll die
before your wife does.

257
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:15,248
[Groans]
Oh, man.

258
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,685
I can't believe a 45-year-old
prostitute is handing out advice.

259
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,526
[Continues coughing]

260
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,927
I'm 44.

261
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,769
[Girl]
My dad dropped me here.

262
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,606
[Chloe]
Your dad dropped you off here?

263
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,607
[Girl] Yeah.
He's waiting outside.

264
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,311
[Chloe]
Where's your mother?

265
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,514
[Girl]
Dead.

266
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,818
[Woman echoing] I'm not
leaving you on purpose.

267
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,286
[Girl]
What the fuck, lady?

268
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,756
[Chloe] Calm down.
I didn't call...

269
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,864
- Not cool, lady.
- It's fine.

270
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,396
[Kat]
What's with the kid?

271
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,971
- [Girl] Not cool, lady!
- [Chloe] It's fine.

272
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,239
Where do you want me?

273
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,809
The key to this job is control.

274
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,810
Show up early
before the client's ready

275
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,312
and it keeps you
in charge of the situation.

276
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,315
Plus it helps weed out the cops.

277
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,948
[Chloe] How'd you
know I wasn't a cop?

278
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:25,624
[Chuckling]
You're not a cop.

279
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,525
[Chloe] How do you
know all this stuff?

280
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,228
Experience.

281
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,506
[Whistles]

282
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,909
Unbelievable. Where the
fuck have you been?

283
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,513
- Sorry. I slept in.
- Check your messages?

284
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,876
I called you three times.

285
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,922
I know, but I was working
late last night.

286
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:55,550
One job?
That's it, right?

287
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,955
Yep.

288
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,487
You don't have the luxury
to work one job a night.

289
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,863
All your regulars
have been calling

290
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,891
and asking for
new and improved girls.

291
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,866
Maybe it's time for you
to find some other game.

292
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,597
I don't know,
look for some office work.

293
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,037
What's come in?

294
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,307
I get calls,
just not for road kill.

295
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,776
Maybe it's time for a makeover,

296
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,037
squeeze another year
out of this.

297
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:23,776
- I mean stuff.
- I know what you mean.

298
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,285
Is that all?

299
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,388
You want more?
Make more money.

300
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,358
If you checked your messages
once in awhile,

301
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,559
you'd know the client from the
other day has been calling.

302
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,061
She called me,
like, three times.

303
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,764
She? Who's she?

304
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,296
The 119? Uptown?

305
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,769
Next to the pawn shop?

306
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,038
I sent you there two days ago.

307
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,408
- The woman.
- Yeah, right.

308
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,409
Hey, one of Mr. Roma's guys

309
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,581
came back here
looking for you earlier.

310
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,682
Sent them to your old address.

311
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,046
They said you don't
live there anymore.

312
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,655
No. No, I don't.

313
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,732
Where do you live?

314
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,966
It's none of your business.

315
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,337
[Chuckling]
Crazy bitch.

316
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,739
[Chloe] How do you
know all this stuff?

317
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,576
[Kat] Experience.
There's rules.

318
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,777
[Chloe]
What are the rules?

319
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,049
[Kat] You know,
no in-calls, no groups,

320
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,680
no freebies, no blacks,

321
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,946
no getting attached,

322
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,790
and don't do drugs with clients.

323
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,521
[Knock on door]

324
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,028
- Hey.
- Come on in.

325
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,812
So, what are we doing tonight?

326
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:56,867
Uh, I wanted to shoot nudes.

327
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,881
Oh, that's going to cost
you more than this.

328
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,810
Well, there's 3,500 in there.

329
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,515
Yeah, but that
gets me to the door.

330
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,117
I'm gonna need another 500.

331
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,086
Okay.

332
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,447
And I would love a drink.

333
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,791
You don't have to
do that, actually.

334
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:19,498
Um, here, you know what?
Here. Come here.

335
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,569
Come to the corner over there.

336
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,140
Maybe...

337
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,909
Maybe go down on the floor.

338
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,740
And if you, like...

339
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,015
So, I just, what?
Put my head here?

340
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,519
Should I put it back?

341
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,591
Like, push my tits out
or something?

342
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,088
- Just be normal.
- Normal?

343
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,057
I'm curious.

344
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,066
Why do you do this?

345
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,499
When I moved here from London,

346
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,704
I was in a bit of trouble.

347
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,035
So, someone offered me
a way out,

348
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,110
and, well, you know.

349
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,978
[Chloe]
Out of what?

350
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,179
- I had sex to pay for debt.
- [Camera shutter clicks]

351
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:14,523
After that, it seemed,
I don't know, easy money.

352
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,817
[Chloe]

00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,804
Who wants bubbly?

711
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:16,836
Yeah, I think I'll be finished
by the time you get back.

712
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,671
Girl, I know exactly
how you feel.

713
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:22,206
I swear, my soul is made
of champagne and bacon.

714
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,813
She's funny.
She's cool.

715
00:51:24,816 --> 00:51:27,176
Yeah, our parents grew up
together. She's rad.

716
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,345
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:32,289
I'm so glad you could make it.

718
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,659
You look stunning, sweetheart.

719
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,588
- Really, really lovely.
- Thank you. Thank you.

720
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,562
Hi. I'm Chloe's father,

721
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,363
and you're...

722
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,534
This is my girlfriend,
Kat, I'm sorry.

723
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:44,533
It's an absolute pleasure
to meet you, sir.

724
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,195
What a gorgeous house you have.

725
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:48,144
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

726
00:51:48,145 --> 00:51:50,207
What do you do, Kat?

727
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,338
Oh, I model for your daughter.

728
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,842
- Nudes, mostly.
- Really?

729
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:58,205
- Mr. d! What is shaking?
- Zoe, how are you?

730
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,216
Oh, my god, I love the tie.

731
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,218
- It's very norm-core.
- Thank you.

732
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,220
Um, I'm doing good.
I'm doing good, you know?

733
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:07,791
- Good.
- Taking it day by day.

734
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,392
How are you and the folks?

735
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,563
Oh, you know,
the folks are good.

736
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:14,302
Yeah, same old, you know?

737
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,576
[Kat]
What's in there?

738
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:28,638
Nothing.

739
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,780
[Canister tapping]

740
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,882
[Women gasping]

741
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:38,846
[Sniffing]

742
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,816
[Women gasping]

743
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:45,225
[Muted chatter and laughter]

744
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,767
Whew!
It is hot in here.

745
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,598
[Chloe sniffs, grunts]

746
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,844
[Sniffs]
Oh, my god.

747
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,810
All of this used to be my room.

748
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,839
All my artwork was up
everywhere in here.

749
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:06,445
You name it... doodles,
drawings, paintings.

750
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,618
Um, my mom hung it.

751
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,287
She put it all up.

752
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:13,356
I mean, my dad turned this
into his fuck den.

753
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,787
[Laughs]

754
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,930
- Go on. -Yeah, I
bet you he had sex

755
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,828
right there where
you're sitting.

756
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,459
On this bed? Come on.

757
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,302
- On this bed right here?
- Right here.

758
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,930
No way.
What do you think he did?

759
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:25,935
- With what kind of women?
- Oh, god, I don't know.

760
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:27,937
Were they huskies?
Were they whores?

761
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:29,469
[Groaning]
Oh, my god,

762
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:32,473
they must have been
absolute whores.

763
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:35,306
Come to me!
Mwah! Mwah!

764
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,981
- Oh, my god.
- Hey.

765
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:39,422
Yes?

766
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,650
What?

767
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,385
Promise you won't leave me.

768
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,525
I won't.

769
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,899
- Back to the party.
- Okay!

770
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,828
She's absolutely fantastic.

771
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,495
What medium do you work in?

772
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,241
She works in all mediums,
of course.

773
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:02,869
She's absolutely
bloody brilliant.

774
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,973
We're collaborating on
a project together right now.

775
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,506
Really?

776
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,980
Yeah, it's mainly photography,

777
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:10,447
but... and video,
of course.

778
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:12,348
And I'm... I'm trying
to project film

779
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,919
onto three -dimensional
canvases

780
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,848
and capture, obviously,
the piece in itself,

781
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:21,524
but also what's the second
before and after everything.

782
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,785
But I'm just still... still
figuring it out.

783
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:27,364
I'm one of the models.
Strictly nudes.

784
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:30,625
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

785
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:35,695
Welcome to the 14th annual

786
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,436
"we care, we cure" gala.

787
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:42,879
[Applause]

788
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

789
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,715
I'm sorry I haven't called.

790
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:48,517
I've just been really busy
at the gallery,

791
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,019
but I wanna hear
how everything's coming.

792
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,491
[Father continues indistinctly]

793
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:52,689
Yeah. It's fine.

794
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,720
Everything's really good.

795
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,962
Don't worry about it.

796
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:56,589
Everything's coming along.

797
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,364
I can't wait to show you.
It's gonna be great.

798
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,400
- It should be done soon.
- Okay, good.

799
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:01,998
Just let me know
when you're ready.

800
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,566
Yeah, okay.
Let's listen.

801
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,367
[Father] It wasn't long
after we were married

802
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:09,739
the tell-tale signs
began to appear...

803
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,876
The depression,

804
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:16,046
the dementia,

805
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,407
and probably
the worst for Gabriela,

806
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,346
loss of coordination.

807
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:22,752
As many of you know,

808
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,488
she was a very,
very strong woman,

809
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,489
and she fought.

810
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,820
Where have you been hiding?

811
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,425
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

812
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:30,927
I was in the bathroom.

813
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,758
Well, I'm really glad
that you're here.

814
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,601
I didn't even know if you
you got out of rehab.

815
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,598
Your dad's been super weird
about the whole thing.

816
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I've just been working a lot.

817
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:40,066
Yeah, and getting
some action clearly.

818
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,901
Yes.

819
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:45,706
And with that in mind,

820
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,780
I would like to introduce to you

821
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:50,747
another very special person,

822
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,778
who has inspired not only me,

823
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,823
but all those who have
ever heard her story...

824
00:55:55,824 --> 00:55:59,690
- Jackie Sorka.
- [Applause]

825
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,791
[Jackie]
Thank you all very much.

826
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,096
I'm so honored to be here.

827
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:09,466
[Sighs]

828
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,467
Eight months ago,

829
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,899
I decided to embark
on an inevitable journey

830
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,774
that threatened to change
the course of my life.

831
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:17,673
My brother and I watched
Huntington's disease

832
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:21,805
take our father's life

833
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:26,816
with a 50% chance
of having the h.T. Gene,

834
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,647
I chose not to get
tested as a child.

835
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:34,491
But as my heart grew
harder and harder to invest,

836
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:35,592
I made the hard choice.

837
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,827
I picked up the phone.

838
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:39,558
I called my doctor.

839
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,834
I called my family

840
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,165
and my loved ones.

841
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,006
We were prepared for
anything and everything

842
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:53,707
except being thrown off-course
by a positive result.

843
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:56,151
I mean, s.A.T.'S
and weddings and children...

844
00:56:56,152 --> 00:57:00,447
I had planned for so much life.

845
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:07,157
I mean, every day
brings new challenges,

846
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:11,528
but I am determined to pack in
fifty years of life

847
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:15,059
if all I have is ten left.

848
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,905
[Sniffling]

849
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,775
[Sniffling]

850
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,530
[Chattering]

851
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:55,838
Hey. I thought you said you
weren't gonna leave me.

852
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,570
What are you talking about?
I was right there.

853
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:00,506
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

854
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:01,781
Give me a call sometime.

855
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:04,909
Where's your wife?
You ditch her?

856
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,215
- Excuse me?
- Your wife.

857
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:09,078
- I'm not...
- what's going on?

858
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,786
I don't know, uh...

859
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,718
What are you two doing out here?

860
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,923
I... I... sorry.

861
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:16,155
I think you should come

862
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,260
and get some fresh air maybe?

863
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,961
You're a little worked up.

864
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,003
Me? I'm not the one trying
to fuck random guys.

865
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,968
Maybe I should, um...

866
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:27,669
- It was nice meeting you.
- That it was.

867
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,239
What are you talking about?

868
00:58:32,243 --> 00:58:35,243
I thought you said
you weren't gonna leave me.

869
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:39,616
I didn't.
I was right there.

870
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,177
Chloe!

871
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,959
Chloe!

872
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,260
I didn't leave you.

873
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:53,031
You were the one
who disappeared.

874
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,630
Oh, come on, just admit it.
You were working.

875
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:57,633
I was talking to people!

876
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,035
Just admit it.
You were working.

877
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,637
No, I swear!
That is not what happened!

878
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:02,799
I wasn't trying to fuck the guy.

879
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,136
He just wanted a cigarette.

880
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:07,277
Come on.

881
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:08,978
Get your fucking hands off me.

882
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,649
Chloe, Chloe, let me talk to you

883
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,278
for just a minute, please!

884
00:59:12,283 --> 00:59:14,723
It's fine, I'll get her.

885
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,898
[Sniffs]

886
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,839
Oh, my god. You don't... you
don't care about anyone.

887
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,176
You don't fucking care
about yourself.

888
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:47,222
[Kat] Is that what that little
fit was about in there?

889
00:59:47,223 --> 00:59:49,617
I mean, what the fuck was that?

890
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,027
You know,
I've never been in love.

891
00:59:58,028 --> 00:59:59,696
[Kat]
Don't say it.

892
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:01,257
Why?

893
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,865
Because this isn't it.

894
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,938
Well, I wanted to say it
before you go.

895
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,265
I'm going?

896
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,878
Where am I going?

897
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:17,779
You just gotta go.

898
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,888
- Take off your dress.
- What?

899
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:31,060
- Take off your dress.
- Why?

900
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,661
Because I want to do one last
interview with you before you leave.

901
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,264
- Oh, I'm leaving tonight?
- Yes.

902
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:39,736
- Then I'm leaving now.
- No, you're not.

903
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:43,307
Take this. Here. It's
everything and a little extra.

904
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,144
Take off your clothes.

905
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,249
Don't sit.
You always sit.

906
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,980
Here, stand.

907
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,822
There we go.

908
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,761
Wait, stop.

909
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:09,665
I want the truth from you.

910
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,238
You have a kid, am I right?

911
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,407
Had. I had a kid.

912
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:19,838
Yeah?
What happened?

913
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,279
I gave it away.

914
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,380
[Chloe]
You gave it away.

915
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,881
Was it a he or a she or...

916
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,418
It.

917
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:30,119
It grew inside of me, I had it,

918
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,287
I gave it away.

919
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:32,848
Did you ever try to find...

920
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:37,086
No, and that's
the end of that story.

921
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:41,164
- How could you just...
- easily.

922
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:44,925
I didn't know or care if I was
pregnant until it was too late.

923
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:48,965
- How could you just...
- what? What?

924
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,306
You don't understand

925
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,367
how a mother could just
give away her child

926
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,836
and never think about it again?

927
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,145
I'm nobody's mother.

928
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,147
I'm just a woman who gave up

929
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:02,118
on her little girl.

930
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:05,419
So, it was a girl?

931
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,157
Sure.
Do you know what?

932
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,927
Are you done working out
your mommy issues?

933
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,158
This has nothing to do with me.

934
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,097
- Oh, it isn't?
- Unh-unh.

935
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:15,828
You take me to your mother's
charity event.

936
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,002
You go batshit crazy
when I start to flirt.

937
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:21,341
You come home here and you
just grill me about my scar.

938
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:24,338
Do you want a whore
or a therapist?

939
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,113
Oh, maybe you want
another mother.

940
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,015
Stop it.

941
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,348
You could never be my mother

942
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,091
because my mother was loving.

943
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:39,918
- Blah, blah, blah.
- Get the fuck out.

944
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,361
Get out, get out, get out.

945
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,518
I don't give a shit.
Now!

946
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,856
[Kat]
I'm leaving anyway.

947
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:47,762
How long can you keep
a whore around, huh?

948
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:50,092
What you think for dinner?
Maybe barbeque?

949
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,463
Oh, where the fuck
have you been?

950
01:03:51,464 --> 01:03:54,430
- Working.
- Really? That's good.

951
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:57,266
I hope this is it, because Mr.
Roma is all over my ass now.

952
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,067
Yeah, it's not enough, but I'm gonna
give to you in two, three days.

953
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,900
How's that supposed to happen?

954
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,266
I don't fucking know.

955
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,276
This is your job.
I need clients.

956
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:08,577
You should probably keep this

957
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,209
because there's
nothing out there.

958
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,583
Nothing out there,
or nothing out there for me?

959
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,953
Take your pick.

960
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:20,094
I got girls turning 20
that are in for a surprise.

961
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,131
Twenty. It's dry.

962
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,465
I'll do anything.

963
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,597
I'll do parties.

964
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,203
I'll even do groups.

965
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,204
Anything.

966
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,365
Anything?

967
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,445
Well, there's something,
but it is not good.

968
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:49,986
- You hear me?
- Anything.

969
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:51,317
- Not good.
- I'll do anything.

970
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,891
It pays well, but it's not good.

971
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,316
That's okay.

972
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,156
Anything.
I can do it.

973
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:00,101
All right.
I'll call you.

974
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:11,240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

975
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:16,111
Chloe, I think it's
important for you to know

976
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,953
that I never did anything to mom

977
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:21,418
that she didn't ask me to do.

978
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:29,264
Your mom didn't
want to suffer, so she...

979
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,166
Chloe, you need help.

980
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,267
That's why we're here,

981
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:43,269
Mr. Kenner and I would like
to discuss your options.

982
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,677
You know?

983
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:50,678
Chloe, mom had Huntington's
for many years.

984
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,559
I love you.

985
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,630
[Knock on door]

986
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,467
You Pete?

987
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,969
You can put your shit over
there.

988
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:38,990
Hey, um, could you help me
with something?

989
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,596
- Sure, anything.
- I need to find someone.

990
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,228
Okay.

991
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,479
[Pete] So, are you gonna
share any of that with me?

992
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,816
You're good.
So this is it?

993
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:35,547
- Yeah.
- Just in front of this?

994
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,187
- Yeah. That's it.
- Let's do it.

995
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:40,118
Okay, so rent here
is not free, okay?

996
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,657
[Kat]
Got it.

997
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,658
[Pete] There's a lot of
work if you need it.

998
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,730
- Let's just do it. -Yeah,
let's see what you got.

999
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,659
Whoa, what are you...

1000
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:50,625
Stop, stop, stop.
Whoa, stop.

1001
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:54,370
Is this your first time?
Slowly, babe, okay?

1002
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:57,271
Slowly. I gotta sell
this shit to people.

1003
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:59,274
Try again.

1004
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:02,336
All right, make it look
like you're into it.

1005
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,805
Look like you like it.

1006
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,683
Okay, you gotta... you gotta be
hap...

1007
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:12,516
You look like
you're about to fucking cry.

1008
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,292
Try and be happy.

1009
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,533
[Chloe] I'm gonna ask you
a few questions, okay?

1010
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:25,774
[Girl]
Okay.

1011
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,770
- What's your name?
- Amy.

1012
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,544
Hmm. Your mommy
said we could talk.

1013
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:39,445
She's not my real mommy.

1014
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,690
[Chloe]
You wanna stop doing this?

1015
01:08:45,691 --> 01:08:47,389
[Woman] You need
another damn question.

1016
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,390
[Chloe]
Do you wanna stop doing this?

1017
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:50,792
[Sighs]

1018
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,729
No.

1019
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:56,731
[Chloe] You ever
think that you will?

1020
01:08:56,733 --> 01:09:00,736
Sure, you know,
in a year or two.

1021
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,397
- Sure.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1022
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:06,566
No, I'm planning on doing
this maybe one more year,

1023
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:07,906
two at the most.

1024
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:12,181
Uh, yeah, one,
maybe two years tops.

1025
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,455
[Knocking on door]

1026
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,488
Are you in there?

1027
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,157
Chloe?

1028
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,636
Oh.

1029
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,437
Hello, is Chloe around?

1030
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:39,208
No, sorry.
She's in an appointment.

1031
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,639
Okay.

1032
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,679
Well, do you know when
she's gonna be home?

1033
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,310
I don't. Sorry.

1034
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,921
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1035
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:54,292
Look, can I just come in
and get my stuff?

1036
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:57,291
I don't think
that's really a good idea.

1037
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,528
Fuck.

1038
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,359
- Are you okay, though?
- Yeah.

1039
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,369
I'll swing by later.

1040
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,870
You know she's sick.

1041
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,505
Chloe's gonna lose
her independence

1042
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:19,812
and she needs people
who can take care of her.

1043
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,216
Do you honestly think
you can do that?

1044
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,399
[Chloe]
Do you like what you do?

1045
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,335
[Kat] I like being
good at what I do.

1046
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:48,342
When I'm with a client,
I'm exactly what they want.

1047
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:49,975
Not what they say they want,

1048
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,980
not what they think they want,

1049
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:55,352
I'm what they don't know
they want.

1050
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,916
[Chloe]
What do I want?

1051
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,524
[Kat] You want someone
to come in here

1052
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,985
and shit all over your world,

1053
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:08,795
make you do things you really
want to do, but can't.

1054
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:11,967
You said you wanted
brutal honesty because you

1055
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,938
are looking for someone
to come in here

1056
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:15,837
and tell you things
you don't want to hear.

1057
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,743
Shit.

1058
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,844
What're you doing here?

1059
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,476
I was really worried about you.

1060
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,716
Sorry, I just used
my key to get in.

1061
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,889
You didn't get back to me.
I didn't hear from you.

1062
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,756
It's cool.

1063
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,917
Um, did you, uh, touch anything?

1064
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:37,455
No.

1065
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,990
'Cause I had everything
set up on this table

1066
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,425
- that was really for...
- no.

1067
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,560
There were these Polaroids...

1068
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:45,565
Look, Chloe, everyone's really
worried about you, okay?

1069
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:48,568
And, um,
your girlfriend stopped by.

1070
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,739
My... Kat stopped by?

1071
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,470
Yeah.

1072
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,975
When did Kat come by?

1073
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,846
I don't know.
20, 30 minutes ago.

1074
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,377
- Look, are you okay?
- Fuck.

1075
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,955
Look, you gotta
talk to me, okay?

1076
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:09,787
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1077
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,593
- What's going on?
- [Sighs] I'm just hot.

1078
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:12,894
Yeah, you're hot?

1079
01:12:12,896 --> 01:12:14,526
Okay, I'm gonna get you
a glass of water,

1080
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:17,001
and, um, I'm gonna call
your dad, all right?

1081
01:12:17,002 --> 01:12:18,530
Don't call my dad.
Don't call my dad.

1082
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,765
- Don't call my dad.
- Chloe?

1083
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,441
What do you want?
You gotta talk to me.

1084
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:26,942
Can you help me?

1085
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:29,383
Can you help me with something?
Come here.

1086
01:12:29,384 --> 01:12:31,709
- Ooh. Okay.
- It's okay.

1087
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:32,805
- It's okay.
- My hands.

1088
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,676
Yeah, I know.
I know. I know.

1089
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,884
Do you want me to help you? You
want to tell me what to do?

1090
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,446
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1091
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:39,885
I'd like if you can
just pull up this file

1092
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,119
with the one where she's sitting

1093
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:44,093
in the bathroom, um...

1094
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,527
The one that's
a little bit closer

1095
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:46,528
and on her face.

1096
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,497
Okay. This is the one

1097
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:49,558
I'm going to setup, okay?

1098
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,741
[Pete] Hey, are you ready yet?
He's here.

1099
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,475
Come on, hurry up.

1100
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,150
[Door opens, closes]

1101
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,887
Isn't he the guy
from the chat room?

1102
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,956
How the hell should I know?

1103
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,617
Come on.
[Snaps fingers]

1104
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,659
[Chloe] What's the worst
thing about your work?

1105
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:22,798
Beatings,

1106
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,999
not getting paid,

1107
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,871
gettin' harassed by pigs
and arrested.

1108
01:13:26,872 --> 01:13:29,070
I... what do you think?

1109
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:32,441
Being treated
like a human toilet.

1110
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:35,082
- That I can't go back.
- [Chloe] Back where?

1111
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,915
Back home.

1112
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,687
[Keyboard clicking]

1113
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,458
[Voice mumbles]

1114
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,996
Come here.

1115
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:56,927
No in call.

1116
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:59,933
Always meet at a hotel
or the client's place.

1117
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,736
Never let them know
where you live.

1118
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:03,198
[Grunting]

1119
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,543
Don't do drugs with clients.
Gotta stay in control.

1120
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,716
[Telephone ringing]

1121
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,747
[Moaning]

1122
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:19,091
You gotta stay in control.

1123
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:21,218
Never let them know
where you live.

1124
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,629
You've got to stay in control.

1125
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,230
They're never my rules. They're
the rules to keep you safe.

1126
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,495
[Chloe]
What kind of rules?

1127
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,172
Um, no in calls

1128
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,973
always meet at a hotel
or at the client's place.

1129
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,136
Never let them know
where you live.

1130
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:45,605
Don't do drugs with clients,
gotta stay in control.

1131
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,745
[Pete] You wanna get the fuck
outta here tomorrow night?

1132
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,080
Get a drink or something?

1133
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:52,015
[Sighs]
Okay.

1134
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,243
[Chloe] Hi, I'd like to
make an appointment.

1135
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,684
Uh, is she available tonight?

1136
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,146
Ugh, uh, r-right now?

1137
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,017
Okay. Um, I'll text you
my address.

1138
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,187
[Kat] So, where are
we going tonight?

1139
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,229
[Stammering]
Sorry. I... I, um,

1140
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,760
I just got a call.

1141
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,625
You're working tonight.

1142
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:40,574
He's coming over now.
So get ready.

1143
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,873
[Knocking on door]

1144
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,675
Well, come on, join us.
Don't be scared.

1145
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,813
Come in.

1146
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,746
What are we doing here?

1147
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:33,152
Filming house extra.

1148
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,586
I know. Sit.

1149
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,868
Where's the blow?

1150
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:48,599
You complaining right now?

1151
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,835
So, uh,

1152
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:54,810
how'd you get started?

1153
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,981
I was stripping
at bachelor parties,

1154
01:16:56,982 --> 01:17:00,680
and, uh, switched over.

1155
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:03,183
Remember your first time?

1156
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:04,886
[Scoffs]

1157
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:07,017
No, not really.

1158
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,157
[Whispering]

1159
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,633
Everything all right?

1160
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,070
What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

1161
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:25,141
Nothing bad
has ever happened to me.

1162
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,235
Not yet.

1163
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:31,845
You ever fall in love
with a client?

1164
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,287
No, that's not me.

1165
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,091
[Clears throat]
I'm gonna go get a six pack.

1166
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,792
What?
You serious?

1167
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:48,825
Look. He's a friend
of Conrad's, okay?

1168
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,261
Relax.

1169
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:52,766
[Door opens, closes]

1170
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,855
You want a hit?

1171
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,170
You just gonna sit there
and say nothing?

1172
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,238
Fuck it.
I'll do another one.

1173
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,873
What is that shit, man?

1174
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,111
I'm not into that fucking shit.

1175
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:15,340
[Sniffs]

1176
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,850
I'm not doing it.

1177
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,554
I'm not fucking into that shit.

1178
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,458
Fuck it.

1179
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:07,329
I'm not into that shit.

1180
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,030
Ah! Ow!

1181
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,969
What?
What the fuck?

1182
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:21,376
What's wrong?

1183
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,077
What... what?

1184
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,610
- What's...
- Get out.

1185
01:21:26,616 --> 01:21:28,546
Get out.
Get the fuck out!

1186
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:32,021
- What're you talking about?
- Get the fuck out!

1187
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,092
Oh, my god.

1188
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,967
[Muffled voice]
No, no, no!

1189
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:48,898
[Gasping, coughing]

1190
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,941
[Man]
Room SSI.

1191
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,314
[Kat choking, silence]

1192
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:31,407
[Gasping]

1193
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,600
[Woman] I'm not leaving
you on purpose.

1194
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,498
I'm not leaving you on purpose.

1195
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
I'm not leaving you on...

1196
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:54,972
[Silence]

1197
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,238
- [Gasps]
- [Monitor beeping]

1198
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,655
[Groans]

1199
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,061
[Chloe]
How do you get through it?

1200
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,563
The drugs.

1201
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:57,334
Hope.

1202
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,099
I just do.

1203
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,766
I believe you know my client

1204
01:24:06,776 --> 01:24:09,636
miss Chloe Davis?

1205
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:12,175
Yes, I do.

1206
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:15,481
How did you find me?

1207
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:18,554
I'm the executor
of miss Davis' estate.

1208
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:30,261
Miss Davis has set up
a trust fund in your name.

1209
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,338
Trust fund?

1210
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:40,669
I take it miss Davis
didn't discuss this with you.

1211
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,212
She came to me about a month ago

1212
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:46,753
to adjust her will
amongst other things.

1213
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,386
A week ago I hired
a private detective

1214
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:52,847
to track you down.

1215
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,656
Shortly thereafter,

1216
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:58,728
he informed us of your incident.

1217
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,395
We spoke to the police and, uh,

1218
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:07,229
they have not found the man
who did this to you.

1219
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:09,096
They've also not
been able to locate

1220
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:13,705
- a Mr. uh, Conrad Setch.
- What'd you mean you left?

1221
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:15,439
The man who dropped you off
at the hospital.

1222
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,580
Get the fucking car, idiot!

1223
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:20,511
Doesn't surprise me.

1224
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,550
Now, miss Fuller.

1225
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:29,264
I don't know what your
relationship was with miss Davis,

1226
01:25:29,265 --> 01:25:32,758
nor does it matter.

1227
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,561
This trust fund was set up

1228
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:36,698
with several strict conditions

1229
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:40,699
of which I will be
monitoring closely.

1230
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:44,239
If you neglect
that in way shape or form

1231
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,140
to abide by these conditions,
