1
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,419
Mister? Sorry.

2
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:55,016
You're next.

3
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:57,150
Pardon me, miss.

4
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,715
My mind was
somewhere else.

5
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,452
No problem.
It happens to me too.

6
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:06,059
I'd like to wire this

7
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:08,524
to St. Joseph's
Boarding School in Boston.

8
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:11,491
It's urgent.

9
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,515
Someone's put an "E"

10
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:17,185
on every one of these bills.

11
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,953
- I didn't notice.
- People try to put fake money by me

12
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,514
on account
of these cheaters,

13
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:25,684
- but I've got instinct.
- That money is good.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,192
Yes, it is.

15
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:33,687
Been waiting long, Destinado?
How are you this morning?

16
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:39,684
As you can see,
his hoof isn't 100% yet.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,954
But if you don't gallop him
for a few days,

18
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,185
he'll take you
to the end of the world.

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,850
Thanks.

20
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,949
Not too often you get to work
on a horse like this.

21
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,083
If you want to sell,
I'd be interested in buying.

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,421
Next time he gives me lip about
getting up in the morning,

23
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:57,153
I'll think about it.
Got that, pal?

24
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:10,221
Yah!

25
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,253
Stop them!
Stop them!

26
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,781
Stop them!

27
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:23,116
We're robbed!
They took everything.

28
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,390
- Where's the sheriff?
- He's in the saloon.

29
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,857
Where do you think he is?

30
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,085
My money...
where's my money?

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,421
Gone.

32
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:36,789
Hey, no galloping.
Hey, remember, no galloping.

33
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,686
No!

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,453
Bad!
Where are you going?!

35
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,789
No.

36
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:30,157
- Are you all right, kid?
- I've been better, that's for sure.

37
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:33,885
Dang snake. You should've
got him in the head.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,926
Then how could he tell his friends
to leave kids like you alone?

39
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:38,720
Are you saying you didn't
kill him on purpose?

40
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,383
Better to change
the mind of many

41
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,618
than getting rid of just one.

42
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:46,792
- Ow, my shoulder!
- Hold on.

43
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,621
It hurts here?

44
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:51,352
Can you move
that arm like this?

45
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,148
Oh, it hurts!
It's broken.

46
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,454
We'll see.
Now tell me

47
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,458
what food
do you like best?

48
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:01,685
- My what?
- What is your favorite?

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,317
- Mrs. Melody's apple pie.
- Oh!

50
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,552
I like apple pie too.

51
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:10,388
Mrs. Melody's are the best, but what
does that have to do with my shoulder?

52
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,119
Now I want you

53
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:15,216
to close your eyes

54
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,451
- and picture that pie.
- Why?

55
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,992
Trust me.
Close your eyes.

56
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,716
Tell me why is that pie
so special?

57
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:26,452
It smells of hot butter.

58
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:28,856
When you take a bite,
it'll just melt in your mouth.

59
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,915
Oh, what, are you crazy?!

60
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:32,822
Your shoulder was out, kid.

61
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:35,189
Now it's not.
Try to move your arm.

62
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:41,719
Heh, it doesn't hurt
too much.

63
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:45,854
Are you a doctor?

64
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,955
No, I'm not.
Come on, kid.

65
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:57,892
I'm gonna get beat if I show up
at the ranch without my horse.

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,949
Your Pa will let it go
once he finds out what happened.

67
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,787
I don't have a dad or a mom.

68
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,553
They were killed by outlaws
when I was a month old.

69
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,319
- Sorry, kid.
- What brings you here?

70
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,859
Bandits... I've been
tracking them.

71
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:15,858
I saw two men this morning galloping
like the devil was chasing 'em.

72
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,858
Which way did they go?

73
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,915
Toward Holysand, I think.
I'm not sure... they were far off.

74
00:05:20,993 --> 00:05:23,686
There it is... Holysand.

75
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,692
I wonder
what that fire's about.

76
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,351
Nothing good, I'm sure.

77
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,722
God will punish you
for this, Mitchell!

78
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:35,021
Leave God out of this, Victor,
and get it into your thick head:

79
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,752
That land will belong
to me and my cattle.

80
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:40,019
That's Nathan Mitchell,
the man I work for.

81
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,285
What's going on here?

82
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,382
Sheriff, the seed salesman
sold Nathan

83
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,448
the seeds at three times
the market cost!

84
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,719
- Business is business.
- Free country.

85
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:52,850
Man can buy whatever he wants.
And he can burn whatever he buys!

86
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,391
Not if it's just to burn it
under our noses,

87
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,448
keep us from getting
what we need.

88
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,583
Gentlemen,

89
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,181
is this really the example
we want to set for our children?

90
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,089
Move this out of the road
right now.

91
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,785
Do it now.

92
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,257
Garvey,

93
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,622
do as the sheriff says.
See you at the ranch.

94
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,784
Consider it done.

95
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,853
Silver, did you hear that?

96
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:23,085
Douse the fire
and clear the street...

97
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:26,024
- on the double!
- Don't say anything, you'll make it worse.

98
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,525
I fell from my horse, Garvey.
My shoulder hurts so bad.

99
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:32,388
Unless you want your face
to hurt too, do as I say.

100
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,355
Hello, handsome man,
what can I get you?

101
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,949
- Iced tea, miss.
- Say that again.

102
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,491
You heard right, Gloria.

103
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,081
Your handsome man
wants tea.

104
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,682
You find that funny?

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,283
Out here, mister,
tea's not a real man's drink.

106
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,791
Know what I mean?

107
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,350
Yeah, I know what you mean.

108
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,892
But I can't help it.

109
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,187
- I like tea.
- He likes tea.

110
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,286
Is it true that a man who drinks tea
can't hold a deck of cards?

111
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,189
Probably.
But if you want,

112
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,191
I can play a couple of hands
while I sip my tea.

113
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,225
Let's give this man a seat.

114
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,015
Thanks.

115
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,081
Gloria!

116
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,955
Pitcher of tea

117
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,321
for the table.

118
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,424
I really thought
I won that one.

119
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,755
Doesn't two aces
beat three jacks?

120
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,053
Sure you didn't have whiskey
in that glass, friend?

121
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:39,649
- Sure you want to keep playing?
- Yeah,

122
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,589
but I lost a lot.

123
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,284
How can I make it up?

124
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,348
- You have to raise the stakes.
- Are you in?

125
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:48,586
Fine by me.
Gotta be able to pay though.

126
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,591
Even someone who drinks tea

127
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,988
knows that in poker

128
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,184
you always... you always
pay your debts.

129
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,054
Always.
Sorry.

130
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,349
We have to feed our family!

131
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:05,756
All right.

132
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,889
Tough break, friend.

133
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,386
Hold on, friend.

134
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,755
Isn't this what you call

135
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:32,655
a royal flush?

136
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,116
Isn't this a winning hand?

137
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:40,124
You dirty snake.

138
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,715
How come you're so lucky?

139
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:44,554
Luck has nothing to do with it.

140
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,091
Then how is it you just started
winning every hand like that?

141
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,250
I wasn't the one who thought

142
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:52,781
he had a sucker on his hands.

143
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,219
One last hand...

144
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,349
all or nothing.

145
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,392
But if I win,

146
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,391
you're gonna walk outside,

147
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,391
apologize to the kid

148
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,016
and finish sweeping
the street yourself.

149
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,184
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,020
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, not at all.

151
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:52,024
Think you can put one
over on me, huh?

152
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,115
You good-for-nothing cheater.

153
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,124
I didn't have to cheat.

154
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,987
You're so damn bad.

155
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,182
There's only one way
to settle this now.

156
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,692
Show me that your shooting
is as good as your cheating.

157
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,726
- You're tempting me.
- So what are you waiting for?

158
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:29,223
Now hold it right there.
You've had your fun.

159
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,781
You had your fun.

160
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,018
He cheated, Sheriff.
Everyone saw.

161
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,354
It's true, Sheriff.

162
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,221
- Right, Sam?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,520
Don't listen to 'em, Sheriff.
I didn't pick up

164
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:43,320
on any card sharpin'
and you know I know the difference.

165
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,091
Whatcha got to say for yourself?

166
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,717
- I played clean.
- These three here says you didn't.

167
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,782
- He cheated.
- That's four.

168
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,848
Give me your gun,
I'm gonna lock you up.

169
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:00,855
Whoa!

170
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,721
- My hat.
- Slow.

171
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:12,417
Good.
And this belongs to me.

172
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:14,686
For now, till I get
things cleared up.

173
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,884
- How much in there, Garvey?
- I don't know, Sheriff.

174
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,925
$77

175
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,583
and 5¢.

176
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,022
Substantial.

177
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:36,621
- What's going on?
- It's all right, kid.

178
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,158
Hey hey, slow down.

179
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,919
Slow down.

180
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,516
You ain't finished yet, kid.

181
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,756
Hey, Sheriff, I told you
I didn't cheat.

182
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,916
I don't know how long you
were in the saloon, but...

183
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,322
You want some tea?
I like tea myself.

184
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:57,359
Only I don't ever
drink it in public.

185
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:01,687
I brew it
from a secret recipe.

186
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,157
Make it with
peppermint leaves.

187
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:07,021
I was learned it
by an old mountain man.

188
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:09,422
Since we both like tea,
what am I doing here?

189
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,981
For starters, I only got
but three cells.

190
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,582
I don't have enough room
for Garvey and his men.

191
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,851
Besides, I know all
there is to know about them.

192
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,187
You, on the other hand,
are kind of interesting.

193
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,452
Looked to me like
you're hunting trouble,

194
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,583
like you're trying
to get yourself killed.

195
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:26,022
- What do you want to know?
- Let's start with your name.

196
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,217
- They call me West.
- What're you doing in Holysand, Mr. West?

197
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,224
Two gunslingers... they robbed
a post office in Santa Fe.

198
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,814
Some of that money was mine.
I've been tracking them.

199
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:37,415
So you caught their sign
and that brought you here.

200
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:40,425
- I'm sure they're long gone, Sheriff.
- That makes sense,

201
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:43,015
seeing as you're
the only stranger here.

202
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:45,684
What line of work
are you in, Mr. West?

203
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,656
I am a professional
card player.

204
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,484
If you check my saddlebag,

205
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,218
- you'll see that...
- I'm gonna find a couple decks of cards

206
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,155
- and a book.
- You read my book?

207
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,953
Not particularly.

208
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,184
I'm gonna leave this
with you.

209
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,225
You're gonna have
a lot of time to kill.

210
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:11,584
- Thank you, darling.
- You sure you weren't dreaming?

211
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:13,886
I'm telling the truth!

212
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,050
He hit the snake's tail from...

213
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,649
at least 300 feet.

214
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,191
And then he fixed my shoulder
with one snap,

215
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,020
like a doctor.

216
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:23,648
You sure you're not
exaggerating?

217
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,884
That seems like
a lot for one man.

218
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,517
I think you hit your head
when you fell off the horse.

219
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:31,559
No damn cheater hits
a snake's tail from 300 feet.

220
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,524
One thing's for sure...

221
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:35,582
whoever this Mr. West is,

222
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:37,749
he's definitely out of order.

223
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,950
You know, everybody's
talkin' about the way

224
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,287
you fixed that little
Silver's shoulder.

225
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,756
Matter fact there's a rumor going
around that you are really a doctor.

226
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:47,916
They all say I'm a gunslinger

227
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:50,390
just because I shot the tail
off a rattlesnake.

228
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,323
You know, it's a damn shame
that you're not a doctor.

229
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,382
My back is killing me.

230
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,550
The pain is so bad

231
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,716
- I can't sleep at night.
- Isn't there a doctor in Holysand?

232
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,452
Well, the onliest one knows
anything about medicine

233
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,321
is Mrs. Stark.
She's the teacher.

234
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:08,916
But I can't let a woman
lay hands on me for something like...

235
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,584
you know, not...
not for that reason anyway.

236
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,386
Well, you know what I mean.

237
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,947
I gotta make my last round.

238
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,423
Why don't you get yourself
some sleep?

239
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:19,890
Yeah.

240
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,255
Yep yep.

241
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,985
- Sheriff?
- Yeah?

242
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,184
- The pain in the back.
- Yeah?

243
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,849
- It's the boots.
- My boots?

244
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,551
What are you
telling me, boy?

245
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,183
These boots cost me
a ton of money.

246
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:43,521
Special dee-livery
Kansas City.

247
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,683
They ruined my wallet,
but not my back.

248
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,385
The heels are all worn
on the outside.

249
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,754
Get yourself a new pair.
A fella I knew

250
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,519
- fixed his back that way.
- A fella you knew?

251
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,525
- It's a long story.
- Oh. You ain't got time

252
00:15:57,592 --> 00:16:00,150
for long stories.
I'm throwing you out tomorrow morning.

253
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,885
You get some sleep.

254
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,857
- Good night.
- Night, Sheriff.

255
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,257
Am I dreaming?
Or am I seeing what I'm seeing?

256
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:32,224
Whoa!
Hold up there.

257
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,621
Only one way to find out.

258
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,817
Hold on a second, Burt.

259
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:45,321
I've only got two for you.

260
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:49,614
Morning, ma'am.
Don't mean to intrude,

261
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,658
- but anything we can...
- Need a hand?

262
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,748
We're at your
complete disposal.

263
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,950
That's very kind of you, but l...

264
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,419
Jack!

265
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,015
Burt?

266
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:04,149
You don't remember me?

267
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,384
It's me, Millie.

268
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,220
- Millie Mitchell.
- Here you go.

269
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,383
You two have changed
quite a bit too.

270
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,651
But then again not.

271
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,085
M-M-Millie?

272
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,647
- Is that really you?
- Uh-huh.

273
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:24,191
Shucks, Millie,
last time we saw you,

274
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:27,089
you was just a little girl.

275
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,455
I got it.
There you go.

276
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,355
And now you're...

277
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,392
like a woman.

278
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,981
Hold it there, Jack.

279
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,149
Hyah!

280
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,885
Hyah hyah!

281
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,050
Hyah hyah!

282
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,387
- Notice anything?
- What?

283
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,549
Watch this.

284
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,085
- Did you swallow a broom?
- No, I didn't swallow no broom.

285
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,750
I got me some new boots!

286
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,552
No more backache.
I feel like a new sheriff.

287
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,251
Looky here.

288
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,780
Denise.

289
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,087
- Good morning.
- Good morning your own self.

290
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,318
I'd like to talk to the doctor
who fixed your back.

291
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:31,585
Well, he... he never said
he was no doctor.

292
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:34,284
Well, a doctor is a doctor
even if he doesn't say it.

293
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,722
If he cured even one of God's creatures,
then he can help me.

294
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,587
Mister, I don't know if
you're a lowlife poker player

295
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,250
or a real doctor,
but I have a problem.

296
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,224
There's a woman in town,
she's been vomiting for three days.

297
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,849
She doesn't have a fever,
but her heartbeat is low

298
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,118
and she can't move.
What should I do?

299
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,024
Don't look at him, look at me.

300
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:01,286
Can you or can you
not help me?

301
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,188
Did you try some agave juice?

302
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,622
One spoonful every two hours.

303
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,386
One spoonful is not enough.

304
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,254
Get half a gallon and mix it

305
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:15,224
with half a gallon
of boiled water and honey.

306
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,621
Give her a glass every hour,

307
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,124
and every three hours
give her a cup of tea

308
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,124
made with wild nettle leaves.

309
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,555
That should stabilize
her heartbeat.

310
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,386
Some hombre he knew
got better thattaway.

311
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:33,021
- It's a long story.
- Well, I'll do as you say,

312
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:36,320
but I warn you... if you're not
telling me the truth,

313
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,120
you'll be sorry.

314
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,784
She's got some character.

315
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,053
- That's not all she's got, boy.
- Oh.

316
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,481
It's incredible...
nothing's changed.

317
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,649
Still so peaceful, so quiet.

318
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:03,353
Well, actually things could be
a lot better here in Holysand.

319
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,618
- What do you mean?
- Millie!

320
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,715
Father!

321
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,319
Ohhh.

322
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:23,313
Grandma Melody!
I missed you so much.

323
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:26,415
We missed you too, my dear.

324
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:30,288
Silver, you grew into
a fine young man.

325
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:31,881
Thank you, Miss Millie.

326
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,090
- What are you two doing here?
- Just trying to help.

327
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,681
Get your filthy hands off
my daughter's luggage.

328
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,714
Get the hell out of here.
Take your fat brother with you.

329
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,121
Easy, Jack, easy.
No point in arguing.

330
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:49,124
Go!

331
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,623
Let's go back to work.

332
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,089
- Why did you treat them like that?
- We'll talk later.

333
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,420
Right now I've got some
business to take care of.

334
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,751
Get in the buggy.
Sheriff!

335
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,882
What about this West fellow?

336
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:10,084
Far as I can gather he's a cardsharp,
but he's not a cheater.

337
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,454
- That ain't what my men say.
- Ha ha.

338
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:16,286
Your men'd say that my horse
drinks out of his behind.

339
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,517
You need to show my men
a little more respect.

340
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:21,683
You know, Garvey
is like my son. He's loyal.

341
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,452
He's trustworthy.
And that's all that counts to me.

342
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:27,185
All that counts to me
is keeping the peace in this town.

343
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:30,089
Even at the cost of sidin' up
with some damn cardsharp?

344
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,057
Yeah, till he gets
his money back he won

345
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,921
honest on the table
every day and twice on Sunday.

346
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,150
West will get
his money back.

347
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,214
He'll get every dime of it.

348
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,314
But if I have any more
trouble out of him,

349
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:47,222
I'm holding you responsible.

350
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,780
I'm holding
you accountable.

351
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,817
Here, Sheriff Basehart.

352
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:57,221
- Yeah yeah, Silver.
- Can you give this to Mr. West?

353
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,780
Just tell him Mrs. Melody made it.
He'll understand.

354
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,358
- Is it really that good?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,220
Yeah.

356
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,382
It was still hot
when he give it to me.

357
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,118
It's still warm.
It's still delicious.

358
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,016
What's in that... apples?

359
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:31,751
I love apple pie!
I purely do!

360
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:33,381
I like apple pie too.

361
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,549
Why do you
keep staring at me?

362
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,023
- Do you want some?
- Me? No, not me.

363
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:44,683
No, not me.
What, are you kidding?

364
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,018
- You ate it all.
- You said you didn't want any.

365
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:52,614
Well, I know what I said,
but that doesn't...

366
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:01,090
That's... that's right
neighborly of you.

367
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,749
- What's the stakes?
- Stakes is the truth.

368
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,450
If I win, you got to tell me
who you really are.

369
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:25,457
If you win, you leave town
with all my secrets.

370
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:29,252
You see, I have to know
what kind of a desperado

371
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,791
I'm pushing out on
an unsuspecting public.

372
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,117
All right, it's a deal.

373
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,521
And I'd like to know
what kind of man

374
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,524
put me in here
in the first place.

375
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:42,524
Two cards.

376
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,922
We both know how it is...

377
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:48,049
you travel 100 miles
and everything changes:

378
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,389
Gunslingers become mayors;

379
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,690
saloon dancers become
respected ladies;

380
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,088
and sheriffs...

381
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,021
one jack,

382
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,717
two jacks,

383
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,690
three jacks,

384
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,691
four jacks.

385
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,247
Who were you
100 miles from here?

386
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,883
Well, I was a cardsharp.

387
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,516
And I was a cheat.

388
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:19,024
And then somehow or t'other

389
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,319
I became sheriff of Holysand.

390
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,019
Whoa.

391
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:52,751
I'll get the luggage.

392
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,450
Millie dear!
It's a pleasure to see you.

393
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,650
Dana, what are
you doing here?

394
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:02,153
Uh, Millie, there's something
I want to tell you.

395
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,921
Dana is my wife now.

396
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:08,048
We got married a month ago.

397
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,819
Uh, that's not possible.

398
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,090
Why didn't you say anything?

399
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:16,090
Everything happened so quickly.

400
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,090
We barely even
realized it ourselves.

401
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:21,090
You were taking
your finals in school

402
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,215
and I didn't want to bother you.

403
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,780
I thought it'd be better
to tell you in person.

404
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,916
You thought wrong, Dad.

405
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:30,924
I have the right to know when you bring
another woman into Mom's house.

406
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,588
Three 10s,

407
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:40,487
and two queens.

408
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,150
Nice!

409
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:50,082
- Too bad four aces beats 'em.
- It sure does.

410
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:52,784
If you are as good at your job
as you are at poker,

411
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,722
you're gonna need
a bigger jail.

412
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,257
All right, quit stallin', West.
Tell me something I want to know.

413
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,120
I have to give you
an IOU on that.

414
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,953
Hold on now, pardner.
A deal's a deal.

415
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:03,547
Now!

416
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:06,989
All right.

417
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,151
I was born overseas,

418
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:13,282
became a doctor,

419
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,916
then came to this country

420
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,253
to practice in Boston.

421
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:23,223
I was a good doctor...

422
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:27,021
but one day

423
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,887
I killed a woman.

424
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,285
I mean,

425
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:37,654
I could have saved her,
but I didn't.

426
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,356
I just had to extract a bullet.

427
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,021
Easy enough for a doctor
like me but...

428
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:55,717
But you had drunk that day.

429
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,046
Yeah.

430
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,952
She was a widow... Mexican.

431
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,454
A beautiful woman.

432
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,519
She had a daughter...

433
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,621
three years old.

434
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:26,419
I've been taking care of her
for nine years now.

435
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:31,254
She's in one of the best
boarding schools in Boston.

436
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,281
Her name...

437
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,120
is Estrella.

438
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,555
And you play cards
to take care of this young'un?

439
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,090
Uh-huh.

440
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:46,522
I'm pretty good with my hands,

441
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:49,955
but I never had the guts
to pick up a scalpel again.

442
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:56,616
Cards is the only thing
I know now.

443
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:59,419
- And guns.
- It goes with the territory.

444
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,822
I gotta watch my back.

445
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,414
What the hell is going on?

446
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,488
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

447
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:21,848
All right, boys,
what's going on here?

448
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:23,686
Um, Sheriff, it looks like
someone took

449
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,725
the seed man's clothes
and set them on fire.

450
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,951
Now he's running around naked as
a jaybird... that's a public obscenity.

451
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:32,149
I reckon that neither one of you clowns
knows anything about this.

452
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:37,380
Sheriff, arrest these two.
They did this to me.

453
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,049
All right, you two,
my office now.

454
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,353
But wait a minute, Sheriff.
It's his word against ours.

455
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:45,118
I was trying to put
the fire out, Sheriff.

456
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,157
You're trying my patience
but mightily. Haul your freight.

457
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,890
Watch your back.

458
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:57,151
What are you doing?
You...

459
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,848
Where are you going?
Can I get some water out here maybe?

460
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:05,947
Can I get a little help here?!

461
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:09,354
Damn.
It's a $300 suit.

462
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,516
Oh man. Come on,
come on, come on.

463
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:13,524
Hurry hurry,
get it, get it, get it.

464
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:15,784
Come on!

465
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:18,120
Why, you son of a bitch!

466
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:24,317
Sure is nice
to meet you, Mr. West.

467
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:28,290
I hope next time you can teach
Garvey the lesson he deserves.

468
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,187
Ain't gonna be a next time.

469
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:32,588
Mr. West is
leaving us forthwith.

470
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:35,317
Right, as soon as
I get my money back,

471
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:38,324
I gonna put many miles
between me and this place.

472
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,458
It's always the best
who are first to go.

473
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:44,922
Yeah, that's why you're going to be
not leaving here for a long time, boy!

474
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,514
How long are we
staying here?

475
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:49,887
Watch out for the bedbugs.
But the beans are great.

476
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,288
- What time do we eat?
- Tomorrow.

477
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,256
- Tomorrow?
- Sheriff!

478
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,790
- I'm hungry now!
- Sheriff!

479
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,017
Sheriff!

480
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,387
I'm hungry too!

481
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,253
So where are
you headed, Doc?

482
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:05,018
First I'm gonna get
my money back from Garvey.

483
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:08,455
Then Santa Fe to wire
the money to Estrella.

484
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:11,582
And after that, any town
with a poker table.

485
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,522
Well, good luck to you, pard.

486
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,422
Thanks, Sheriff.

487
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,285
- Sheriff?
- Yeah?

488
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,789
You cheated... I caught that.

489
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,587
I expected you would.

490
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:09,217
It's a wonder, isn't it?

491
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,416
I'm sorry you
took it so badly.

492
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,458
What did you expect?

493
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:16,423
That I'd hug her and tell her
I'm happy she's my new mom?

494
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:19,424
No one can replace
your mother.

495
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,151
Dana's my wife

496
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:23,713
and you must respect her.

497
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:30,752
You still haven't told me
what happened with the Bakers.

498
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,756
They want to farm that land
east of the Colin River.

499
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,790
I need that land
to enlarge my herd.

500
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:39,291
- But that land has always been free.
- It can't keep being that way.

501
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:43,285
Anyway, it's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

502
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:46,119
Dana is behind this. Isn't she?

503
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:47,884
You leave her
out of it, Millie.

504
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,482
The Bakers are our enemies.

505
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:56,390
You remember that.

506
00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:01,086
Try to save as much as we can!

507
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:03,283
Hurry hurry!

508
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:08,423
- Try to push it back!
- Come on now.

509
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:11,049
- Victor, what happened?
- It just went up in flames.

510
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,590
- Get back!
- We're doing everything we can.

511
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:16,680
If only my good-for-nothing
boys had been here.

512
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:18,621
They're in jail.
I came to tell you.

513
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,123
- What?
- They stripped Sam the salesman's

514
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,588
clothing and burnt it.
The whole town's laughing.

515
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:26,714
- So that's why this happened?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

516
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,383
- This might have been an accident.
- Nathan will pay for this!

517
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,946
Let's just get the money together
to bail Burt and Jack out.

518
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,557
I knew your horse would
come back on his own.

519
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,749
Saved me
a chewing out for sure.

520
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:45,279
- You can always count on a horse.
- Yep.

521
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:47,085
More than you can
count on us humans.

522
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:49,623
Out of jail already, West?

523
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:53,981
Guess Basehart doesn't
like cheaters either.

524
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:56,956
Quit it, Garvey!

525
00:32:57,024 --> 00:33:01,615
Come inside, we're gonna put
an end to this problem once and for all!

526
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,487
You too, West!

527
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:07,818
Come on, Garvey.
Give it to him.

528
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,882
You're making
a mistake, Nathan.

529
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,856
We've already discussed this.

530
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,981
Give him his money.

531
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,747
It's all there.
Count it if you like.

532
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:30,450
Mr. Mitchell's word is
good enough for me.

533
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,220
Millie, are you going to town?

534
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,052
Yes, I have some
shopping to do.

535
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,590
My daughter Millie.

536
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:46,714
- Nice to meet you.
- We already met.

537
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,121
- We did?
- You were in front of me at the post office

538
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:53,055
in Santa Fe right
before it was robbed.

539
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,750
But maybe you don't remember because
your mind was somewhere else.

540
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:59,256
Miss Millie.

541
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,522
You're spoiling him, Silver.

542
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,251
Soon he'll like you
more than me.

543
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:18,586
I can't help it.
I grew up around horses.

544
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,021
I've never seen one
like this before.

545
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:23,579
How'd it go with Mr. Mitchell
and Garvey?

546
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,055
I got my money.

547
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,886
- You'll go then?
- Yes.

548
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,947
It was nice
to know you, Mr. West.

549
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:34,122
I'm sure we'll
meet again soon.

550
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:36,588
Sooner or later we will.

551
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:44,088
In the meantime,
don't change.

552
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:47,124
When we do,

553
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,350
I want to make sure

554
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:52,255
that I run into a great man.

555
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:22,317
Everything
all right, Miss Millie?

556
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:24,721
I was waiting for you.

557
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,689
It doesn't seem proper
for a girl like me

558
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,519
to ride out here all alone.

559
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:31,682
Would you be so kind as to keep me
company until Holysand?

560
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:35,815
Actually I was going that way,

561
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:37,823
and town is thattaway.

562
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, please, Mr. West?

563
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:45,616
I've always thought of Holysand
as some sort of paradise,

564
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,657
but it's changed so much.

565
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:50,054
Yeah, you could cut
the tension with a knife.

566
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,522
I want to stop this madness.

567
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:54,557
I'm going to speak
with Mrs. Stark.

568
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:57,284
She's the person
I respect most... my teacher.

569
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:59,221
Did you meet her?

570
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,052
Once, briefly.

571
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,023
Oh, she's a great woman, but once
she gets something in her head,

572
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:06,420
it's impossible
to change her mind.

573
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:09,514
I noticed.

574
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:12,580
She can be tough at times,
but I assure you,

575
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:15,123
she is sensible and sweet.

576
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:17,918
One thing I know for sure,

577
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,287
only women can right
the wrongs of men.

578
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:28,188
You have no proof at all
that it was Nathan.

579
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:29,883
I don't need any proof.
It was him.

580
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,924
Get this in your head, Sheriff:

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:36,219
This town is a powder keg.
And all of us, including you,

582
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,552
are gonna have to choose
what side we're on.

583
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:40,181
I'm on the side of the law.

584
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:42,190
And it is best that you
and everybody else

585
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:45,224
in this town understood that!
Good day, gentlemen.

586
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,320
Thank you, Sheriff.

587
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,553
Sorry, Pa.
I guess if we hadn't

588
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:57,784
been teaching the seed salesman a lesson
none of this would've happened.

589
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,687
Maybe Nathan might not
have burned down...

590
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:02,349
You don't respond to a prank
by burning down someone's barn!

591
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,515
What Nathan did is an act of war

592
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,955
- and he'll pay for that.
- You stooping to his level, Pa?

593
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,286
This is war, Burt.

594
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:11,380
And anything goes in war.

595
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:15,981
From now on we're gonna
go around packing guns too.

596
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,919
You think that's
a good idea, Pa?

597
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,980
Thanks for your company, Mr. West.

598
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:25,047
- Good luck with your peace venture.
- I'll need it.

599
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:36,355
I'm sorry to see
you go, Mr. West!

600
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,018
Only women can right
the wrongs of men.

601
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,648
Good one.

602
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,553
George Washington?

603
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:50,113
Mr. West.

604
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:53,714
We met at the ranch and he rode
back to town with me.

605
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:58,019
Be careful around him, Millie.
He's a poker player.

606
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:00,216
Though...

607
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,086
quite intriguing, it seems.

608
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,521
But a fine woman like you
should stay away.

609
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,386
From your tone of voice,

610
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:08,889
maybe you're the one
who needs to be careful.

611
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,583
Millie, is that what they
taught you in St. Louis?

612
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,816
- Impertinence?
- I'm sorry.

613
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,050
- I didn't mean to offend.
- I'm not offended.

614
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,386
I know how to protect myself
from the likes of him.

615
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:22,117
Doesn't matter anymore.
He left town.

616
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:25,180
Anyway, Mr. West was right
about one thing:

617
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:27,780
That we women need
to do all we can

618
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:30,120
to talk some sense back
to the men in this town.

619
00:39:14,424 --> 00:39:16,118
Hello again, pardner.

620
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,055
This time we
have insurance.

621
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,886
Even in cases of robbery
your money is guaranteed.

622
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:26,749
This is marked with "E"
just like last time.

623
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:29,619
But it's good money.

624
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:31,589
I know.

625
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,849
I think Victor's easier
to get to than your father,

626
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:48,947
even though Victor's barn
burned down.

627
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:53,081
I do too. My father isn't himself
anymore since he married Dana.

628
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,113
Actually, I always thought your father
was the gruffest man in town.

629
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,748
Downright pigheaded.

630
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,989
Okay, so since Victor
is our target,

631
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:07,182
how are we going to get him to make
an agreement with your father?

632
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:09,348
Maybe I should ask
his sons to help.

633
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:11,720
Burt, Jack and I were
friends when we were kids.

634
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:16,246
- That was a long time ago.
- I think I still have a card to play.

635
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,790
Oh, who's that?

636
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:21,221
Big, my husband's dog.
Ever since Eugene died,

637
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,086
he likes to go and sit
on that old blanket of his.

638
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:26,056
Oh, he's a sweetie.
Can I pet him?

639
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,988
He doesn't let
anyone touch him,

640
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,285
not even me sometimes.

641
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:33,187
It's okay.
Dogs absolutely love me.

642
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:35,053
I never met one who didn't.

643
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:40,214
I hope you have better luck
with the Bakers.

644
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:56,714
West!

645
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:01,055
What are you doing here?
I thought you left.

646
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:04,090
I left, but now I'm back.

647
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:11,084
What?

648
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:13,419
This is the money
that Garvey gave me.

649
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:16,252
Have a look at one.

650
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:19,854
See anything?

651
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:22,355
Yeah, girl on a bird.

652
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:25,652
Look closer.
On the righthand side.

653
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,548
Yeah, there's an "E" here.
So what?

654
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:32,112
After every poker game,

655
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,748
I separate the good bills
from the phony ones

656
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:38,585
so I don't make mistakes
when I send the money

657
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:40,714
to the boarding school
in Boston,

658
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,279
as I did that day in Santa Fe.

659
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,186
So this here "E" is for Estrella?

660
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,416
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

661
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:50,480
What you're telling me is
the money that Garvey gave you...

662
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:54,319
was stole from the Santa Fe
post office

663
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:56,357
with some of your money
along with it.

664
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:58,856
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

665
00:41:58,924 --> 00:42:01,446
And what you're asking
me to believe

666
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:04,115
is that Garvey was
one of the men

667
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,622
who stole that money
in the post office?

668
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,214
Right.
I want you to arrest Garvey.

669
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,222
Well, I will grant you

670
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,552
that these bills is marked

671
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,715
but you can't rule
out coincidence.

672
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,916
And you also can't rule out

673
00:42:18,991 --> 00:42:22,150
that there ain't a judge
in anywhere in holy hell,

674
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,690
or Holysand, who would ever

675
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:28,554
convict a man on such
flimsy evidence.

676
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:29,885
Right.

677
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,480
So are you still leaving?

678
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:37,055
I'm not gonna leave
until we put Garvey in jail.

679
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:41,881
I mean until you
put Garvey in jail.

680
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,549
Why, mighty kind
of you, Sheriff.

681
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:46,749
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

682
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,148
- West.
- Gloria.

683
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:02,690
Oh my God,
I thought you left.

684
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:05,280
I left, but now I'm back.

685
00:43:05,357 --> 00:43:08,653
- Got a room for me?
- For you,

686
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:11,588
always.
Come, follow me.

687
00:43:42,424 --> 00:43:45,219
Come out of there
right now, Jack Baker!

688
00:43:49,957 --> 00:43:52,423
- Howdy, Miss Millie.
- You too, Burt.

689
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,116
I know you're there.

690
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:24,056
Hey, my beans!

691
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:27,688
Come back here!

692
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:30,155
Gee, Millie, we didn't
come riding down here

693
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:32,315
to spy on you or nothing.

694
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:34,516
We always come
for a swim at sunset.

695
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,523
I mean, you did too,
don't you remember?

696
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,682
No, absolutely not.

697
00:44:39,758 --> 00:44:43,246
I remember that I could never bathe here
without you two spying on me!

698
00:44:43,324 --> 00:44:47,188
Come on, Millie. We come down here
to pick the wild berries and such.

699
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:49,984
I'm kidding, Jack.

700
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:53,353
Actually, I came here
hoping to find you.

701
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,583
Why?

702
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:59,020
To talk to you about what's
going on between our families.

703
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:05,983
I'm sorry, Millie, but there's nothing
we can do about that now.

704
00:45:06,057 --> 00:45:08,819
- Not after the barn burned down.
- I know.

705
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,379
And if your suspicions are right,

706
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:14,685
well, my father made
a very stupid mistake.

707
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:18,246
That's exactly
why we have to talk...

708
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,313
to avoid making more.

709
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,888
You know, Millie, that's going
to have to be Nathan Mitchell's job,

710
00:45:29,957 --> 00:45:32,048
not ours.

711
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:33,953
Come on, Burt, let's go.

712
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,088
Burt! Jack!

713
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,918
I just want peace again.
If you do too

714
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,423
and still trust me, meet me tomorrow
at the Heart's Creek.

715
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:54,880
Come on, Burt.

716
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,252
All right, you scoundrel.

717
00:46:11,324 --> 00:46:14,347
What are we gonna do
about this?

718
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:19,455
You're not trying
to butter me up, are you?

719
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:24,553
All right, you can have it all.

720
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,513
- Mrs. Stark.
- Mr. West!

721
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,920
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

722
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,479
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?

723
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,218
I was following
my pan of beans.

724
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,256
What are you talking about?

725
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,880
Here.

726
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:48,016
Big! Are you
stealing food again?

727
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,352
- As if I don't feed you enough.
- You can't blame him.

728
00:46:51,424 --> 00:46:53,219
Those were real good beans.

729
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:56,889
You like them spicy, huh?

730
00:46:56,957 --> 00:46:58,253
I don't know what to say.

731
00:46:58,324 --> 00:46:59,949
I'm completely mortified.

732
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:10,918
Mrs. Stark?

733
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,149
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

734
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,484
That's the first time
since Eugene passed that

735
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,045
Big's shown any affection
for anybody.

736
00:47:26,124 --> 00:47:29,420
Maybe it's because we
share a passion for beans.

737
00:47:31,124 --> 00:47:33,317
I don't think it's just that.

738
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:38,651
I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stark.

739
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,919
Thank you.

740
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,320
It's been 10 years
this December.

741
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,788
Some things take
a long time to heal.

742
00:47:52,624 --> 00:47:55,283
- Big!
- It's okay. He doesn't bother me.

743
00:47:55,357 --> 00:47:59,119
Maybe, unlike his mistress,

744
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,281
- he likes poker players.
- Poker players

745
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,289
or doctors?

746
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:07,380
Big, get down!

747
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:10,218
Your agave remedy worked,
by the way.

748
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,518
- She's doing much better.
- Really?

749
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,886
- I thought you'd left town.
- I did.

750
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,283
But now I'm back.

751
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:21,983
It'll be a long time

752
00:48:22,057 --> 00:48:23,886
until I see a stew like that,
Mrs. Stark.

753
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:27,048
- Better than the beans Big stole?
- Sure was.

754
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:30,681
Thank you.
I have to go now.

755
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:33,155
It's getting late.

756
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:45,114
He's angry with me.
He thinks I'm sending you away.

757
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,952
He says maybe you're not
as bad as you seem.

758
00:48:49,023 --> 00:48:51,046
I heard that too.

759
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:53,488
But he didn't say

760
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,455
maybe.

761
00:49:09,557 --> 00:49:11,715
Good night, Mrs. Stark.

762
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:32,417
Good morning, Millie.

763
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:34,480
Did you sleep well, dear?

764
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:38,153
Didn't you hear us?
Is there something wrong?

765
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:42,383
Is it true you burned down
one of the Baker's barns?

766
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:45,752
I don't think certain subjects should
be of interest to a girl your age, dear.

767
00:49:45,823 --> 00:49:48,755
- Did you burn it down?
- Millie!

768
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:51,016
He knows what he's doing.

769
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,578
Not always.

770
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,588
Otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

771
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,088
Millie, how dare you!

772
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:59,020
You apologize to Dana
immediately!

773
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,420
I wouldn't think of it.

774
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:02,514
Millie, you come back here!

775
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,386
I order you come back here!

776
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,778
- Nathan.
- What the devil you want, Garvey?

777
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:21,789
- Something happened last night.
- What?

778
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:25,085
Someone sabotaged the water pump
for the cattle.

779
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,950
Do you really think this is
such a good idea, Burt?

780
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:31,012
What are you afraid of, Jack?

781
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,783
- Pa won't like it?
- I ain't afraid of nothing.

782
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:36,846
But she is Nathan Mitchell's
daughter after all.

783
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:40,083
Yeah, but she's sincere when she
wanted peace between our families.

784
00:50:40,157 --> 00:50:41,747
You know she's educated,

785
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:43,846
trustworthy and she doesn't
choose sides.

786
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:46,855
And she's the most beautiful girl
these parts have ever seen.

787
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:48,855
Hold on, Burt.
I am the older brother.

788
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:50,752
Oh yeah?

789
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:52,380
Well, it means that I get
first crack at it.

790
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,513
No no no no way. What does that
have to do with anything?

791
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,522
- Well, it's a law of nature!
- Jack.

792
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,783
- What... Pa?
- Where do you think you're going?

793
00:50:58,857 --> 00:51:01,982
You have to help me deliver
potatoes to Mrs. Kroger.

794
00:51:02,057 --> 00:51:04,080
- Pa!
- You heard me.

795
00:51:04,157 --> 00:51:07,351
That's the law of nature,
big brother. We'll see you later.

796
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:08,787
- Pa!
- Come on.

797
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,323
All right!

798
00:51:20,523 --> 00:51:22,785
- Good morning, Silver.
- Mr. West.

799
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:25,687
- You didn't leave.
- I left.

800
00:51:25,757 --> 00:51:27,655
- But now I'm back.
- That's fantastic.

801
00:51:27,723 --> 00:51:30,689
So we can go for a ride today. I have
to run some errands for Mrs. Melody,

802
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,552
- but I'll be free later.
- That's a good idea.

803
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,055
Silver...

804
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,420
I have to ask you something.

805
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,423
- Something important.
- Go ahead, shoot.

806
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,423
Ask me whatever you want.

807
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,979
It's about Garvey.

808
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:50,448
He wasn't here.
He wasn't in Holysand!

809
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:52,751
- What are you talking about?
- Garvey.

810
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,914
He wasn't here

811
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,956
when the robbery
in Santa Fe took place.

812
00:51:57,023 --> 00:51:59,012
- Are you sure?
- Silver just told me.

813
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,715
Garvey takes three days
off every month.

814
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,256
Well, that don't mean
that he used them

815
00:52:04,324 --> 00:52:06,789
to rob the post office in
Santa Fe.

816
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,448
See, he could have a little lady
stashed away someplace.

817
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:12,489
- There's lots of ladies with no taste.
- Yeah.

818
00:52:12,556 --> 00:52:15,284
But if we were to find out

819
00:52:15,357 --> 00:52:18,050
that there were other robberies

820
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:21,318
that took place
during his days off?

821
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,686
- Then?
- If "we" were to find out?

822
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:25,620
You're the sheriff.

823
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,588
I am the sheriff.

824
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:29,781
And you know what
I'm going to do?

825
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:31,880
As soon as I finish
cleaning this weapon

826
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:34,684
I'm gonna walk over
to the telegraph office

827
00:52:34,757 --> 00:52:38,053
and I'm gonna send a telegram
to one of my associates in Hudson City

828
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:40,612
and ask him if he knows
of any other robberies

829
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,451
that has happened anywhere
on Garvey's days off.

830
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:53,185
I'm just waiting for you

831
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,552
to finish cleaning your shotgun.

832
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:02,718
You are something, Doc West.

833
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,385
All right, all right, let's go.

834
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,051
I have to admit, my dad's
a little guilty too.

835
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:21,056
He could've done more
to avoid butting heads with Nathan.

836
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,483
Will you help me find
a peaceful solution?

837
00:53:25,556 --> 00:53:28,420
Let me help you across
the river first.

838
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,988
I've never heard my dad say the things
he said yesterday.

839
00:53:33,057 --> 00:53:35,750
It's kinda like he forgot everything
he ever taught us.

840
00:53:39,723 --> 00:53:42,382
Why are you looking
at me like that?

841
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:46,150
I remember you as being
a spiteful boy,

842
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,190
so sure of being smarter
than everyone else.

843
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:52,484
I never thought you'd be wise.

844
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:54,317
I wouldn't have thought that.

845
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,652
Me neither.

846
00:53:56,723 --> 00:53:59,848
Maybe it's the effect
you have on me.

847
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,050
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hi, West.

848
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:08,589
I have that tea
ready for you.

849
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:10,588
Thanks.

850
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:21,387
Victor Baker! Damn you
and that fat kid of yours.

851
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:24,445
What the hell are you
talking about, Nathan?

852
00:54:24,523 --> 00:54:26,682
You don't know anything?

853
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:28,246
You don't know who
sabotaged the dam

854
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:30,312
on the pond
where I water my herd?

855
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:34,413
Maybe it was the same guy
that burned down my barn.

856
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,252
You're getting too big
for your britches, Victor.

857
00:54:37,323 --> 00:54:40,517
Sooner or later I'm going to have to
show you who the boss of this town is.

858
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,715
Oh really?

859
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:46,223
Why don't you do it now,

860
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,414
if you're able.

861
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,285
Hold it, Garvey.

862
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:52,084
I'll take care
of this myself.

863
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,581
Very good, Nathan.

864
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:03,679
Let's see what you can do,
what you're worth

865
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:06,848
without your henchmen.

866
00:55:06,923 --> 00:55:08,752
You crazy, Pa? You want
to get yourself killed?

867
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:10,413
Shut up, Jack.

868
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,945
There's no turning back now.

869
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:15,750
Right, Nathan?

870
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,755
That's right, Victor.

871
00:55:27,823 --> 00:55:29,846
No turning back.

872
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:45,547
Ow!

873
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:47,180
Aw, damn.

874
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,278
What the hell?

875
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,417
I wouldn't grab iron if I were you.

876
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,581
See, my aim ain't as good as his

877
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:21,849
and I might just
shoot you down by accident.

878
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:40,679
Hyah.

879
00:56:40,757 --> 00:56:42,484
This isn't over with yet.

880
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:44,249
You're damn right it don't.

881
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:53,282
I should have took them all in.

882
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:57,721
- It wouldn't have solved anything.
- Yeah, maybe.

883
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,221
Well, until that land goes
to one or t'other of them

884
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:02,585
there's going to be an awful lot
of bloodshed.

885
00:57:02,656 --> 00:57:04,485
- Maybe there's a way out.
- Well, yeah,

886
00:57:04,556 --> 00:57:07,750
you could stand right here and keep
shooting the guns out of their hands.

887
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:10,516
Yeah, I've got a better idea.

888
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:14,488
Ever heard the story
of the Horatii

889
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,420
- and the Curiatii?
- No, I ain't been to Mexico in a dog's age.

890
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:21,547
Mexico has nothing to do with it.

891
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:24,646
Now, gentleman, this here
picture in this book

892
00:57:24,723 --> 00:57:27,348
shows what happened
a time ago...

893
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:31,015
um, a long time ago, see?

894
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,783
It could be even like
100 years ago...

895
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:38,514
um, even 200 years ago.

896
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,180
2... 2,000.

897
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,052
Uh, even might even have
been 2,000 years ago.

898
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:45,988
It was a very old time.

899
00:57:46,057 --> 00:57:48,147
And they had these two cities then

900
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:50,849
and one of them was
the name of Rome

901
00:57:50,923 --> 00:57:54,377
and the other had the name
of "Abalongium."

902
00:57:54,456 --> 00:57:56,581
Now they come
to the understanding

903
00:57:56,656 --> 00:57:59,588
that the onliest way they's gonna
stop the war betwixt them

904
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:03,952
was is gonna have a duel.
And so they come to get

905
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,682
these two sets of brothers,
three brothers each...

906
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:09,552
the "Horatiaios"
and the "Capritiaios."

907
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:12,714
Let me get this straight, Sheriff.
Are you saying there should be a duel?

908
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,415
No, I'm not a-saying
there's gonna be a duel.

909
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,479
I say it is more like a challenge.
What we could have right here

910
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:21,886
in the center of Holysand...
no guns,

911
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,650
no weapons of any kind,
no eye gouging. I'll be the referee...

912
00:58:25,723 --> 00:58:27,882
Are you crazy?!

913
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:31,184
Should the fate of my land
depend on a stupid brawl?!

914
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,916
- That's our land!
- Damn it, Nathan!

915
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,751
If you say that land belongs to you
one more time, I'll shoot you!

916
00:58:35,823 --> 00:58:38,311
- You're a fool!
- Both of you, I'm gonna lock you up.

917
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,481
Sit down now!

918
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:52,354
Now looky here, you may not
like what I'm proposing

919
00:58:52,423 --> 00:58:55,389
but if you don't accept it

920
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:57,888
there's going to be
a lot of blood spilt

921
00:58:57,957 --> 00:59:00,354
and it's going attached
to your kinfolk,

922
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:03,514
the ones you love, like Millie
and Dana. Would you like that?

923
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,454
Or you two boys...
your two boys right here.

924
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:09,011
Cut down in the prime
of their lives!

925
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:11,920
Is that what
you're looking for?

926
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,922
Over a piece of dirt?!

927
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,649
See you soon, Victor.
Can't wait to see

928
00:59:22,723 --> 00:59:26,246
the three lambs you bring
to feed my three lions.

929
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:33,589
I'm afraid he's right.

930
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:37,418
His men are as used to fighting
as my boys are to working the land.

931
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,047
Reckon I can't keep
a count of how many fights

932
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:42,749
I had to bust up because
of them half-baked desperados.

933
00:59:42,823 --> 00:59:45,618
Figure they get
that feller Anvil...

934
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:50,088
killed a bull
with a head-butt I hear.

935
00:59:50,156 --> 00:59:53,145
We'll fight anyway, Jack,

936
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,485
even if it is hopeless.

937
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:58,044
Maybe not.

938
00:59:58,123 --> 01:00:00,783
I used to do some boxing.

939
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:03,414
I could train you.

940
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:07,785
It's a long story.

941
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:11,315
Trust me, boys.
You're in good hands.

942
01:00:18,956 --> 01:00:21,514
Are those the candidates
for your third fighter?

943
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,522
- Yep.
- Desmond, Kurt, Sean and Larry.

944
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,852
How are you gonna pick one?

945
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:29,411
I'll think of something.

946
01:00:31,623 --> 01:00:34,111
First thing, try to relax.

947
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:36,382
Yeah.

948
01:00:50,823 --> 01:00:52,516
- What's his name again?
- Larry.

949
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:55,055
Larry,

950
01:00:55,123 --> 01:00:57,180
I'm sorry but I have to be sure.

951
01:00:57,256 --> 01:00:58,552
Sure of what?

952
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:06,783
- Huh. How do you feel?
- I've been better.

953
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:13,052
Larry is our third man.

954
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,517
Now listen, each one of us

955
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,545
has a hidden talent.
And once we find out what it is,

956
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:30,782
- we become unbeatable.
- How do we do that?

957
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:34,584
It ain't easy...
hard work and intuition.

958
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:37,713
So wh... where do we start?

959
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,779
Hard work.

960
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:57,078
Why are we doing this?

961
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:00,551
You have to be fast and lethal

962
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:02,646
like the swing of an axe.

963
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:07,848
Well, heck, we've been
doing this for five hours. I'm bushed!

964
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:10,684
- Can we stop?
- Got enough?

965
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:14,780
Well, I reckon this'll
get me through December.

966
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:22,979
Come on.

967
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:30,445
You can do it.
Come on!

968
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:45,883
Why can't you understand this?

969
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:48,820
My family is depending on me.
I can't just back out.

970
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:52,981
Why don't you just say what you mean?
You don't want to.

971
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:54,420
Fine, I don't!

972
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:57,217
And if I did,

973
01:02:57,289 --> 01:02:59,811
I wouldn't be able to look
at myself in the face again.

974
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,355
After you fight with them,
you won't be able to look

975
01:03:02,423 --> 01:03:04,651
at yourself in the mirror
for a long time.

976
01:03:04,723 --> 01:03:07,689
- We'll see about that.
- You don't know what they're like.

977
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:10,154
They're animals!
Today they massacred

978
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:12,382
some farm workers
just for the fun of it.

979
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,479
Well, they'll have
a rougher time with us.

980
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:18,044
Stop being a hero, Burt.
It doesn't impress me.

981
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:24,612
Why won't you just tell me the real
reason why you don't want me to fight?

982
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,588
I told you.
Because it's ridiculous.

983
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:36,254
I want the real reason, Millie.

984
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,814
I don't want you to get hurt.

985
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:02,781
Mm-hmm.

986
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:08,287
For your punch to be
really powerful,

987
01:04:08,356 --> 01:04:11,981
you have to think of going
through your opponent

988
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,420
like a locomotive
through a tunnel.

989
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,281
Okay?
Watch again.

990
01:04:23,022 --> 01:04:25,386
- Through!
- What do you think, Jack?

991
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:28,917
What's with you, big brother?

992
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:31,080
- You haven't said a word to me all day.
- Shut up.

993
01:04:31,156 --> 01:04:33,088
So who's first?

994
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,850
- Ahhh!
- Let me see.

995
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:43,582
Your wrists are too small.

996
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:47,585
Sorry, but you'll never
be able to punch hard.

997
01:04:57,156 --> 01:04:59,781
I'd like to give that
a shot, Mr. West.

998
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:01,719
Mm-hmm.

999
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,388
- Good.
- Take that.

1000
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:06,944
Why don't you have
one of these?

1001
01:05:07,022 --> 01:05:09,420
Easy.

1002
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,388
Easy.
Jack, take it easy.

1003
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:14,047
Save it. Jack!

1004
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:18,021
Watch it!

1005
01:05:18,089 --> 01:05:20,521
Mr. West?!
Mr. West?!

1006
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,987
- Get him up, get him up.
- Is he all right?

1007
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:25,488
Mr. West.
Mr. West?

1008
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:27,783
He's breathing.
He's breathing.

1009
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:30,288
Go get Mrs. Stark!
Go! Go... Mrs. Stark!

1010
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:46,047
Estrella.

1011
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:55,148
Estrella.

1012
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:58,152
Estrella.

1013
01:06:36,856 --> 01:06:39,720
Good morning, West.

1014
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:42,119
How are you feeling?

1015
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:46,455
I have a headache.

1016
01:06:46,523 --> 01:06:48,852
Did someone get me drunk?

1017
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:52,116
No, you took a major hit
on the head.

1018
01:06:56,589 --> 01:06:58,055
I can't remember a thing.

1019
01:06:58,123 --> 01:07:00,748
It gave you nightmares.

1020
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,754
You seemed quite agitated.

1021
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,415
Did I say anything?

1022
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:11,945
Estrella.

1023
01:07:13,323 --> 01:07:15,221
You said it over
and over again.

1024
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:20,811
Is she the woman you love?

1025
01:07:53,489 --> 01:07:55,512
Hey, West, wahoo!

1026
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:58,783
Lower your shoulder
when you go in for the hit.

1027
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:02,084
- Lord, it's good to see you, West.
- It's good to see you, West.

1028
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:04,553
- Sorry about your head.
- That's okay.

1029
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,282
Let's start where we left off.

1030
01:08:08,323 --> 01:08:10,312
Remember what I told you

1031
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,912
before that beam hit me?

1032
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:13,921
We need to find our talent.

1033
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,579
Yeah, that ain't easy.

1034
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:18,349
- We need intuition.
- That ain't easy either.

1035
01:08:18,423 --> 01:08:20,581
That's right, Jack,

1036
01:08:20,655 --> 01:08:23,087
but I got lucky.

1037
01:08:23,156 --> 01:08:27,781
Intuition struck me when
that beam came down on me.

1038
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:30,379
Now I know what your talents are.

1039
01:08:30,455 --> 01:08:33,047
I just need to be sure.

1040
01:08:33,123 --> 01:08:35,316
Wait.

1041
01:08:42,555 --> 01:08:45,680
Kick this as high as you can.

1042
01:08:45,756 --> 01:08:47,483
Look out, Larry.

1043
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:55,311
See!?
Your legs and your feet.

1044
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:58,254
This is your talent.
Let's work on it.

1045
01:08:58,323 --> 01:09:00,880
Jack?

1046
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:05,288
Burt and Millie.

1047
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,682
See?
You're fixated.

1048
01:09:12,756 --> 01:09:15,348
Fixation is your talent.

1049
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:18,082
Let's use it.
But not now.

1050
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:20,281
- All right, let's go to work.
- What about me?

1051
01:09:22,022 --> 01:09:24,284
Oh yeah.

1052
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:27,753
- Think of yourself as a totem pole.
- What am I supposed to do?

1053
01:09:27,822 --> 01:09:30,754
Nothing.
Just stand there.

1054
01:09:35,123 --> 01:09:37,611
Sorry.
That was for me...

1055
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:40,587
I just wanted to make sure
that I'm back.

1056
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,212
You're back all right.

1057
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:58,087
Well, I was just to Hudson City,

1058
01:09:58,156 --> 01:09:59,553
and you were right.

1059
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:02,248
Every time Garvey
took time off,

1060
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,982
there was a hold-up.
And the good part of it is

1061
01:10:05,056 --> 01:10:07,113
now we got some witnesses.

1062
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:08,882
So now you can arrest him.

1063
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:11,149
Well, not so fast.

1064
01:10:11,223 --> 01:10:14,985
I asked the federals for the wanteds
and they should be here any day.

1065
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:20,950
Well, this day is here...

1066
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:23,147
I've never seen so many
people before.

1067
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:26,288
They're coming!

1068
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,185
They're coming!
The Mitchells are coming!

1069
01:10:28,256 --> 01:10:30,245
They're coming!
They're coming!

1070
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:34,984
They're coming!

1071
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,015
Whoa.

1072
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:04,385
There they are, the Bakers!
West and the Bakers.

1073
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:34,015
I want to welcome everybody
to Holysand.

1074
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:37,146
Now this here fight is
gonna decide

1075
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:40,416
onced and for all
who's going to get that land.

1076
01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:43,012
- That's right!
- Allow me to remind you

1077
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:46,384
there will be no weapons
allowed among the combatants

1078
01:11:46,455 --> 01:11:49,217
and neither among
the spectators.

1079
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:52,812
Now if you still got your sidearms
with you or you got your Spencer rifles

1080
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:55,980
I want you to give them to Gloria
who'll take them and put them away

1081
01:11:56,056 --> 01:11:58,681
till after this here contest.

1082
01:11:58,756 --> 01:12:01,381
Now the rules is
really simple:

1083
01:12:01,455 --> 01:12:03,683
This is a bare-knuckle fight,

1084
01:12:03,756 --> 01:12:05,449
the bare-knuckle contest.

1085
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,818
Onliest thing we will
not look kindly on

1086
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:11,377
is eye gouging.
Everything else is all right.

1087
01:12:11,455 --> 01:12:15,649
So if I got no more questions,
remember the last man standin'

1088
01:12:15,722 --> 01:12:19,745
is the winner.
Any questions?

1089
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,410
Get it on.

1090
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:27,254
Come on!

1091
01:13:28,922 --> 01:13:30,217
Oh!

1092
01:13:57,056 --> 01:13:59,214
Think of Burt and Millie.

1093
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:25,050
And stay down!

1094
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:33,918
Legs! Legs!

1095
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:35,579
Okay, yeah.

1096
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:40,145
Burt, yes!

1097
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:44,712
Get up!

1098
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:47,815
Get up!

1099
01:15:51,956 --> 01:15:55,115
Yeah, that's my boys!

1100
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:01,917
Well, due to the sudden
indisposition

1101
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:03,955
of their adversaries,

1102
01:16:04,021 --> 01:16:06,579
the last men standing
are the Baker boys

1103
01:16:06,655 --> 01:16:10,109
which means that that land
goes in perpetuity

1104
01:16:10,188 --> 01:16:12,746
to the Bakers!

1105
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:28,455
Whoo!

1106
01:16:51,722 --> 01:16:54,279
- Sheriff Basehart?
- That's me.

1107
01:16:55,422 --> 01:16:57,581
Sam Winchet...
Agent Sam Winchet.

1108
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,950
I'm supposed
to deliver you these.

1109
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:01,885
Thank you kindly.

1110
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:22,682
Hey, Joe.
Come here, come here.

1111
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:30,721
Hey, alhoot,
you're under arrest.

1112
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:33,721
You're not arresting
anybody, Sheriff. Not today.

1113
01:17:33,789 --> 01:17:35,550
Your gun belt.

1114
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:46,884
West!

1115
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:52,551
The sheriff's gun!

1116
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:58,052
I've had enough, West!

1117
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:05,512
Gloria, give West his gun belt.

1118
01:18:05,589 --> 01:18:06,714
Do it!

1119
01:18:26,822 --> 01:18:27,788
Good.

1120
01:18:29,322 --> 01:18:31,481
This is between
me and you now.

1121
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:35,447
Let's settle this like real men.

1122
01:18:40,288 --> 01:18:41,981
You and me.

1123
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,279
Like we should've done
from the beginning.

1124
01:19:24,288 --> 01:19:25,777
Don't move.

1125
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:14,455
No-ooo!

1126
01:20:14,522 --> 01:20:17,420
West!

1127
01:20:24,455 --> 01:20:26,421
Silver!

1128
01:20:33,589 --> 01:20:34,952
Oh God.

1129
01:20:35,021 --> 01:20:36,248
Okay.

1130
01:20:36,322 --> 01:20:38,981
Stay here,
stay here, Silver.

1131
01:20:39,055 --> 01:20:41,248
Stay here with us.

1132
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:49,979
In the back.

1133
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:53,021
His breathing is getting worse
and his temperature is rising.

1134
01:20:53,088 --> 01:20:55,952
I sent one of my men
to Hudson City to get Dr. Scottfield.

1135
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:58,613
He'll never get here in time.
We have to remove the bullet now,

1136
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:01,848
- otherwise...
- Oh, please, Silver can't die like this!

1137
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:03,353
Nathan, Nathan,

1138
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:06,183
there must be
something we can do.

1139
01:21:06,255 --> 01:21:08,153
Mother, there's no one
in Holysand

1140
01:21:08,222 --> 01:21:10,779
that can perform this kind
of an operation.

1141
01:21:13,188 --> 01:21:15,620
Well, yes there is.
Where is Mr. West?

1142
01:21:22,522 --> 01:21:24,545
West, West!

1143
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,278
West!

1144
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:30,412
Silver has to be operated on.

1145
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:32,352
Can you do it?

1146
01:21:32,422 --> 01:21:34,979
I'm sorry, I can't.

1147
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:38,249
But the bullet has to be
removed or he'll die.

1148
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:40,652
You have to do it.
You're a doctor.

1149
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:45,086
I was a doctor.

1150
01:21:47,522 --> 01:21:49,420
Remember

1151
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,148
when you asked me if Estrella

1152
01:21:52,222 --> 01:21:54,085
is the woman I love?

1153
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:57,053
- Yes.
- Estrella is not a woman.

1154
01:21:57,122 --> 01:22:00,316
She's a little girl

1155
01:22:00,389 --> 01:22:03,116
whose mother died
because of me.

1156
01:22:04,455 --> 01:22:06,250
I don't understand.

1157
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:09,049
I was drunk!

1158
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:17,186
I was drunk and I
operated anyway

1159
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:19,050
and I killed her.

1160
01:22:21,855 --> 01:22:24,844
I haven't had
a drop of whiskey.

1161
01:22:27,188 --> 01:22:29,347
It's been 10 years

1162
01:22:29,422 --> 01:22:31,887
since I've picked up
a scalpel.

1163
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:42,619
West, listen to me.

1164
01:22:44,422 --> 01:22:47,115
Destiny is giving you
a chance to make it right.

1165
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:51,920
You can't back away from that.

1166
01:22:54,422 --> 01:22:57,582
Besides, Silver saved your life.

1167
01:22:57,654 --> 01:22:59,813
If you don't help him,

1168
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,649
you'll never forgive yourself.

1169
01:23:58,855 --> 01:24:01,048
You can do this.

1170
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:56,318
Mommy?

1171
01:24:58,188 --> 01:25:00,483
Estrella.

1172
01:25:08,955 --> 01:25:10,148
Mommy?

1173
01:25:16,288 --> 01:25:18,220
West, everything all right?

1174
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:22,117
Yes.

1175
01:25:25,055 --> 01:25:27,248
You don't have much time.

1176
01:25:31,788 --> 01:25:33,720
Right.

1177
01:25:40,122 --> 01:25:42,451
Damnation!

1178
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:44,885
It's been almost two hours.

1179
01:25:44,955 --> 01:25:47,114
Mrs. Stark said it
wouldn't be easy.

1180
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:49,915
Let's just hope that West
knows what he's doing.

1181
01:25:49,988 --> 01:25:51,749
I'm sure he does.

1182
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:53,616
If Silver pulls through,

1183
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:55,551
I am going to bake him a pie

1184
01:25:55,621 --> 01:25:59,247
every day until he
can't take it anymore.

1185
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:11,646
- He'll be fine!
- Oh, thank heaven!

1186
01:26:13,988 --> 01:26:16,613
Remember, Grandma...
a pie a day!

1187
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:19,483
I'm going to get
started right away.

1188
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:21,543
I don't know how
to thank you, West.

1189
01:26:25,521 --> 01:26:28,283
Doc West.

1190
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,445
Dr. West.

1191
01:26:30,855 --> 01:26:32,980
I wouldn't be able
to forgive myself

1192
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:36,509
- if he hadn't pulled through.
- Me neither.

1193
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:39,111
Can we see him?

1194
01:26:39,188 --> 01:26:42,245
Of course. But he'll be
sleeping for a long time.

1195
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:46,383
As long as he wakes up.

1196
01:26:56,222 --> 01:26:57,619
Denise?

1197
01:27:02,188 --> 01:27:04,619
I couldn't have
done this without you.

1198
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:08,977
I just reminded you
that things can change...

1199
01:27:11,122 --> 01:27:13,451
Dr. West.

1200
01:28:15,488 --> 01:28:18,283
I owe you, Silver.

1201
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:23,077
I owe you my life.

1202
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:29,050
Thanks to you

1203
01:28:29,122 --> 01:28:32,020
I can believe
in myself again.

1204
01:28:36,588 --> 01:28:38,884
I have hope now.

1205
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:43,853
Melody will
fill you with apple pie.

1206
01:28:43,921 --> 01:28:46,114
You deserve it.

1207
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,710
And she's lucky...
she knows how to make you happy.

1208
01:28:54,388 --> 01:28:56,820
My daddy did the same thing
with me.

1209
01:28:58,955 --> 01:29:01,648
He'd wait till I was asleep

1210
01:29:01,721 --> 01:29:04,653
and then he'd tell me
he loved me.

1211
01:29:06,188 --> 01:29:09,086
He figured it wasn't
manly to say it,

1212
01:29:09,155 --> 01:29:11,178
but he just couldn't
resist it.

1213
01:29:11,254 --> 01:29:13,084
And you pretended
to be asleep?

1214
01:29:13,155 --> 01:29:15,121
Oh, that's right.

1215
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:21,244
Doc,

1216
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:22,753
why don't you stay?

1217
01:29:24,287 --> 01:29:26,049
There's so many folks here
would just love

1218
01:29:26,122 --> 01:29:27,587
to have you as their doctor.

1219
01:29:31,988 --> 01:29:34,510
You know I can't
do that, Sheriff.

1220
01:29:36,021 --> 01:29:38,543
As soon as Silver gets better,

1221
01:29:38,621 --> 01:29:40,246
I'll leave.

1222
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:47,986
Mrs. Melody's really going
to make all that pie for me?

1223
01:29:49,187 --> 01:29:51,346
You can count on it.

1224
01:30:09,088 --> 01:30:10,781
Dr. West?

1225
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:12,878
You're next, Doc!

1226
01:30:12,955 --> 01:30:14,682
Oh right.

1227
01:30:14,755 --> 01:30:16,584
To St. Joseph's School in Boston.

1228
01:30:28,888 --> 01:30:30,581
Thanks.

1229
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:45,347
Hold it!
Hands up.

1230
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:49,183
If I do that,
we'll drop the mail.

1231
01:30:49,254 --> 01:30:50,618
All right,
turn around!

1232
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:53,847
It's only post.

1233
01:31:01,121 --> 01:31:03,952
- Dusty out there, huh?
- That's why we's wearing these.

1234
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:05,782
Thanks for the tip.

1235
01:31:10,354 --> 01:31:11,445
Delivery.

1236
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:19,684
It sure has been good
to know you, Doc.

1237
01:31:19,755 --> 01:31:21,812
Yep.

1238
01:31:21,888 --> 01:31:25,183
See that you don't have to use
those fighting lessons I taught you.

1239
01:31:25,254 --> 01:31:26,777
We'll try not to, Doc.

1240
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:35,248
Millie, you better keep
an eye on them.

1241
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:38,412
You can count
on it, Doc West.

1242
01:31:43,554 --> 01:31:46,577
Damnation, you're going to be
one hard man to forget, Doc.

1243
01:31:46,654 --> 01:31:48,950
Yeah, I bet

1244
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:50,850
it'll take you at least a week.

1245
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,580
That's a bet
you're gonna lose.

1246
01:32:01,388 --> 01:32:03,149
Goodbye, Doc.

1247
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:19,582
Denise.

1248
01:32:19,654 --> 01:32:22,085
Don't say anything.

1249
01:32:22,154 --> 01:32:24,450
There's no need to.

1250
01:32:46,588 --> 01:32:48,383
You can't come with me.

1251
01:32:48,454 --> 01:32:51,511
Okay?
You be a good boy.

1252
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:53,611
All right?
Take it easy now.

1253
01:32:53,688 --> 01:32:56,518
Take it easy, okay?

1254
01:33:08,921 --> 01:33:11,478
I'll miss you, Doc!

1255
01:33:17,788 --> 01:33:19,754
I tried to get him to stay.

1256
01:33:19,821 --> 01:33:22,878
It was no use.

1257
01:33:22,955 --> 01:33:25,182
That's not true.

1258
01:33:25,254 --> 01:33:27,720
It let him know how much
your friendship means to you.

1259
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,543
You know, Silver,

1260
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:41,644
every man has a destiny
and old Doc chose his destiny

1261
01:33:41,721 --> 01:33:43,880
- a long time ago.
- Sheriff Basehart!

1262
01:33:43,954 --> 01:33:46,477
Por favor.

1263
01:34:04,287 --> 01:34:06,583
- Un... doctor!
- A doctor?

1264
01:34:18,087 --> 01:34:20,645
Doc!

1265
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:35,444
Doc West!

1266
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,250
Doc!

1267
01:37:16,565 --> 01:37:18,095
The End
