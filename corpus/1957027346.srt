00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,919
Basically, I don't shag much anymore

174
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,280
The yogis believe you shouldn't be
too profligate with your sexual fluids

175
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,159
Does that go for girls?

176
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,118
I can't speak for girls

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,830
Mmm

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,560
- [telephone ringing]
- [munching]

179
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,879
Mr Griffin

180
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,799
You're not the first ex-cop

181
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,794
They usually think
this is gonna be easier

182
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,556
Well, uh, I mean, technically,
it was, uh, depression

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,315
They don't like to say
"lacking the will to live"

184
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,711
Just kidding I'm fine now

185
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,951
It's just, you know, finding

186
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,635
what's right for you,
what you're good at

187
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,955
And right now I'm, uh,
cruising down Route 66

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
if, um if you know what I mean

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,234
Right OK

190
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,792
So as a family support worker,

191
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,000
you're qualified now for initial
assessments, visits and reports, OK?

192
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,232
Bit of advice: don't let yourself
get too involved

193
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,154
These people's lives,
take it from me, bit of a mess

194
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,596
They can try and suck you in
over your head

195
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
Keep it sharp, all right?

196
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,119
Some people can get into real trouble
for stepping out of line

197
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,000
You probably know all that
from being a copper

198
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,880
- Yeah
- Gloria Garcia Ramirez

199
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,713
de something?

200
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,109
Glorious year

201
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,114
We sent a letter, no reply,
needs an initial assessment

202
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,794
Single mother, one kid,

203
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,395
housing benefit, income support

204
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,031
Got hep C somehow That's it

205
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,714
Right So, uh, when's
the next visit scheduled?

206
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,394
Three weeks ago

207
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,549
Right

208
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,918
I'm thinking of starting
embroidery classes, needlepoint

209
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,232
I don't know, sounds ridiculous,
but there's something about

210
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,518
those tiny little stitches
I find it appealing

211
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,551
Of course I'll be hopeless

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,791
Tell me about the bird incident

213
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,189
Orlando

214
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,232
Well, there was a lot of blood and dirt

215
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,950
and then this lunatic screeching

216
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,237
that just cut right through me

217
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,552
Try to distinguish between
emotion and intellect, lona

218
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,878
You think there was a good deal
of blood, you feel horror

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,475
And the bird was what?

220
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,552
It was dead

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,792
Oh, uh magpie sort of thing

222
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,236
- Did Orlando kill it, do you think?
- No

223
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,313
When a child harms an animal
deliberately, alarm bells ring

224
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,837
No, no, no, no, no
No, no I mean, well

225
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,233
We adore him

226
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,993
Of course I mean

227
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,992
Of course

228
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,800

You send a birthday card,

260
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,190
and inside it says,
"We put you in a home "

261
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,114
Right, I see So, um

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,873
So that's how they do it, is it?

263
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,112
Jesus, are you stupid,
or are you just a real sickhead?

264
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,639
I'm not sure

265
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,837

Growth hormones, antibiotics,
carcinogenic PCBs

277
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,799
I presume the soapbox you preach
from is made from sustainable resources

278
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,397
Yeah, it is, actually
But it should make a good story, though

279
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,314

without giving you a little bonus

311
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,234
Jesus, Geoffrey,
these are worth £300,000

312
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,836
An expensive wife shouldn't have
to feel like a toothache

313
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,951
You've earned it [chuckles]

314
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,879

Sickhead!

332

Could be

333
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,598
Could be Rembrandt

334
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,269
I think it's a 1634

335
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,993

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,478
Oh, um, it's face cream

346
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,040

Marcus, Lord Killally

496

- Sorry I'm late Marcus Aylesbury
- Robert's fine

497
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,072
Lord Killally is minister of state
for housing and planning,

498
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,960
- and our long-term client
- Yeah, absolutely

499
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,352
We set up the blind trust that
administers all your assets, I remember

500
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,512
Who runs it for you now, sir?

501
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,037
I've been running it, but I'd like you
to take over the reins for awhile

502
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,637
Supervise the investments, etcetera,
on the trust's behalf

503
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,996
Um, thank you, sir I'm flattered

504
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,391
Um, I've done a lot of work
with the city,

505
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,279
so you should be in safe hands

506
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,229
Lord Killally's assets
comprise 17 listed companies

507
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,950
and a personal fortune
of some £400 million

508
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
I don't need to say there can be
no conflict of interest

509
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,479
between the minister's role in
government and his business affairs

510
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,630
Of course not

511
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,838
I'm not allowed to tie me shoelaces
without asking you first

512
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,560
In fact, I'm not allowed
to ask you at all

513
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,554
- Probably not allowed to wear shoes
- [chuckles]

514
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,474
Yes, well, I think we can

515
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,236
I think we can work a middle where
you look after Robert's interests

516
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,357
while he looks after those
of the nation

517
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,718
- Bless you
- We aim to please

518
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,031
Of course you do
I'll expect nothing less

519
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,270
Very good

an ETA on your return

Sorry We've got shitloads
of this Killally stuff

548
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,749
Oh Is this gonna be
a regular occurrence?

549
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,071
<i>Yes Probably Very likely</i>

550
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,799
It's expected now at weekends

551
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,917
They've put my name

552
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,471

Orlando, I've been looking for you
for ages

560
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,314
What's this?

561
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,199
What is it?

562
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,793
What the bloody hell
have you been doing? Huh?

563
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,600
Who gives a shit
about your rabbit's name!

564
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,116
- What is your problem?
- Please don't hit me!

565
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,559
I have never hit you in my entire life
though I really feel like doing it now

566
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,393
What the hell is going on in your head?

567
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,312
- [clamouring]
- Thank you, please!

568
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,392
Year ten, please!

569
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,279
Year ten!

570
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,959
Thank you

571
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,837
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr Tulloch

572
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,390
This morning Mr Tulloch is going
to share with us

573
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,472
some of his artistic knowledge

574
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,200
- And I wish him the very best of luck
- [boy] So do we

575
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,477
- [laughter]
- Thank you, Hendrix

576
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,950
Now, Mr Tulloch works
at an auction house,

577
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,079
where he deals with very old pictures

578
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,438
- called Old Masters
- [Hendrix] Like you?

579
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,880
OK, Hendrix Because the work
is masterful in its execution

580
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,076
- Welcome to year ten
- Thank you Hello

581
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,673
- Great Fantastic
- Hi there

582
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,877
Have some paperwork
for you to look over

583
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,874
- I want it centred on that wall
- Right, OK

584
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,158
Now, a great deal of what we know
about these artists

585
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,950
comes from the work
of a great Italian historian

586
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,396
called Giorgio Vasari

587
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,712
- He's got a jacket by him
- That's Giorgio Armani, you prick

588
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,794
Hendrix, please

589
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,791
- Here's another
- Where's his willy?

590
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,270
- [laughter]
- [Hendrix] Don't do it, sir

591
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,119
- Right there
- [laughing, clamouring]

592
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,071
Graffiti is one of the oldest art forms

593
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,709
You have to master the technique
of the spray can

594
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,553
just as you have to do with chalk

595
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,280
And I think we have a few minutes left

596
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,955
Um, before we finish,

597
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,192
I know that Mr Tulloch has something
very special to show us

598
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,991
Oh, yes This is something
which I've borrowed to show you

599
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,073
This is by an artist
you may have heard of

600
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,393
His name is Rembrandt

601
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,552
This is a This is

602
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,158
A study in hands
They seem to be hands at prayer

603
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,357
[Hendrix] How much
is it worth, then, sir?

604
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,751
It's worth a great deal
I couldn't say for sure

605
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,879
- Hundreds of thousands, maybe
- [gasping and murmuring]

606
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,350
- Let's have a look!
- Hendrix, back!

607
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,319
Don't touch Just sit down
and I'll come for you

608
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,960
- [school bell ringing]
- All right, that's enough

609
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,077
Thank you very much, Mr Tulloch

610
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,793
Next week we're gonna carry on
with this Thank you, Hendrix

611
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,912
The only sound I'm getting
is the whirr of your credit cards

612
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,560
- Can you take that?
- No

613
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,712
Take off the Manolos

614
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,630
Mm-mmm

615
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,032

621
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,390
- Yeah
- Um, I'm doing a big chuck-out

622
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,792

the garbage bags ready, shall I?

624
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,870

626
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,037
It's like Bruce Lee, that [chuckles]

627
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,431

Big house, isn't it?

639

I don't live in the whole house
I have a flat inside

640
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,149
It's a, uh, Victorian dispensary

641
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,358
- It's a listed building
- Oh, OK

642

"All have fallen short

[dance music playing]

660
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,311
[classical music playing]

661
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,110
[piano music playing]

662
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,317
Right, everybody, a toast, I think,

663
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,472
to my dear son Marcus

664
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,836
for his recent partnership

665
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,799
with the prestigious firm
of Wendell Wharton Blunt

666
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,314
- Marcus
- Cheers

667
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,154
Dad, haven't we
Haven't we done this once already?

668
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,913
Can't an old man have some pride?

669
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,958
- I mean
- [whispers] Big dick

670
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,192
- [woman] Jolly good
- You were saying that, um,

671
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,352
you're not going to plant anything new?

672
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,194
Not initially, no It's part of
a five-year programme

673
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,670
to run the estate
entirely on ecological lines

674
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,911
It's all Penelope She's brilliant

675
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,720
[Penelope] The idea is to keep
the hedgerows untouched

676
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,556
and have an eight-foot margin
either side before the crop line,

677
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,758
and do you know the ground nesting birds
have already quadrupled?

678
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,072
Oh, excuse me,
this is exactly my field

679
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,153
It's my job to let people know
how important this stuff is

680
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,310
Really?

681
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,200
We get the loonies ripping out
the snares by the lake

682
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,717
I mean, you know, we only
set traps to protect wild birds

683
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,236
like lapwings and grey partridges

684
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,872
Penelope manages to keep calm
I get I feel hot under the collar

685
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,235
People position
their passions differently

686
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,392
Usually through blind ignorance

687
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,280
I must say one finds oneself
increasingly preferring

688
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,000
the company of plants and animals
to that of people

689
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,560
Aah! Aah, aah!

690
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,952
- Oh, my God It bit Mrs
- [Mr Aylesbury] Oh, my God

691
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,840
I'm terribly sorry It's blood
from the local abattoir

692
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,559
They spray it in the fertilizer

693
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,110

you're still actively involved

872
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,479
- in your projects in your position
- I'm not You are

873
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,197
What I want's all in here

874
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,993
Robert Can I call you Robert?
I don't, um

875
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,313
I don't think you're allowed
to want anything to request

876
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,472
It's not a request

877
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,400
Yes, Marcus

878
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,997
Uh, Geoffrey, Killally gave me a list

879
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,199
Phoenix, VLC, Premiere Living?

880
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,919
The list?

881
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,391
Yes, he said the ring road won't be
voted through for a few weeks yet

882
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,711
Presumably you should have
a word with him

883
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,556
- You've worked with him for years
- We're not nannies, we're guardians

884
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,313
Leave the list with Murray

885
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,960
Thank you

01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,871
Hi Murray

888
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,238
That's one way of doing it

889
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,871

01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,600
Great affection

to inform you

But Gloria has no idea that I am "

893
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,555
I'm going to need
a copy of that report, OK?

894
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, OK

895
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,952
The energy's all wrong here
I could have told him that for free

896
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,077
Marcus is a tree, I'm a tree

897
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,993
I always knew that you were a tree

898
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,198
- I just had no idea about Marcus
- He kept that quiet

899
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,879
Listen, Orlando's dying to see you
Can you come over soon?

900
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,475
Well, I love seeing him any time
Bring him over

901
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,950
- He loves seeing you
<i>- Any time I'm here</i>

902
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,555
He's a wonderful child

903
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,431
Now listen, did you take my advice
about the vibrate option

904
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,478
on your mobile phone?

905
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,518

910
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,790
Wasn't it Byron who said that all
tragedies are finished with death,

911
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,839
all comedies are ended with marriage?

912
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,515
Anyway, look, everyone's wheel turns

913
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,718
You can have your 15 minutes
and I want to be there,

At least a good time, little shit

01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,712
Well, hello What a surprise

924
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,315
- Yeah, we were passing and
- Yeah

925
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,472
- We saw your lights on
- Oh, you did?

926
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,790
Yeah

That's unusual, isn't it?

932
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,197
It's Greek My dad's Greek

933
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:27,435
Oh, I see, right Now I was thinking,
well, of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>

935
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,398
Oh, OK

936
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,520
Do you gentlemen need anything?
Want to use the loo again?

937
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,399
- Have a drink?
- [both] Yeah

938
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,711
- Yeah, a drink would be all right
- Come in

939
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,473
- Ah, you already have
- Cheers

940
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,469
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm How's work?

941
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,873
Oh uh fine, fine

942
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,953
- How's Orlando?
- Orlando's fine

943
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,280
Sorry

944
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,074
Listen, I've decided to go ahead
with the boob thingy

945
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,476
Um, which means I probably
won't be able to go to Scotland

946
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,632
Right OK

947
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,631
It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other,

948
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,076
you know, about your boobs

949
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,634
They've always seemed fine to me
What's wrong with 'em?

950
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,837
What makes you think
I'm doing it for you?

951
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,639
No, clearly not

952
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,996
Just the thought of someone
cutting open your tits

953
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,914
sort of repulses me I don't even
bear to think about it

954
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,151
It's not like that, though

955
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,232
I've always wanted to do it

956
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,154
and I just want to

957
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,959
People do it all the time

958
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,194
- Well, people are very fucked up
- [scoffs] You should know

959
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,472
What's that supposed to mean?

960
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,393
What are you saying?

961
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,233
Come on, tell me

962
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,550
Oh

963
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,271
So, were you inspired to paint
like angels?

964
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,239
We do a different sort of art
Old stuff

965
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,835
Yes, but it's all new
when you do it, isn't it?

966
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,674
- What's this, then?
- That's a video camera

967

You can talk to your friends
anywhere in the world

968
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,358
and you can see each other

969
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,790
Or, you know, you can just
watch yourself

970
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,310
Cool

971
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,552

want out of life? Any idea?

We have no idea why he'd have
a recording like this

997
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,957
You were the last person
to speak to him

998
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,839
You'll have to make the statement

999
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,480
Sure Of course

1000
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,640
He was one of my oldest friends

1001
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,998
What were these three boys doing
in his flat late at night anyway?

1002
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,073
[man] We can't say,
but we're taking it very seriously

1003
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,756
Of course you're taking it seriously
How else are you going to take it?

1004
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:38,712
It means we won't be allowing Orlando
to spend hours on end

1005
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,792
with his godfather

1006

01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,279
ebecome the hottest properties
south of Oxford till they fall down

1215
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,716
'cause they're made
from spit and bog paper

1216
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,237
Yeah, I've gotta go

1217
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,437
[cell phone rings]

1218
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,910
- Hello Trent
<i>- [Marcus] Hi, mate</i>

1219
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,151
Hey, Marcus Hi

1220
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,870
Yeah, thanks for putting up
with all my drink-sodden tales

1221
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,238
of self-pity the other night
Can we forget it ever happened?

1222
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,154
- It's kind of boring anyway
- No, it's not boring at all

1223
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,074
You were in a really bad way
How are you? How's lona?

1224
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,880
- She's getting her boobs done
<i>- [Trent] No</i>

1225
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,032
I'll kill the man
that lays a finger on 'em

1226
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,159
And she blew me out We were
going to Scotland deerstalking

1227
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,552
- Listen, why don't you come along?
- Wow, uh

1228
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,916
- Yeah
- Come on, city boy, all paid for

1229
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,437
Killing stuff,
Arctic temperatures, haggis

1230
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,956
Um, it's very tempting
but it's not me, mate

1231
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,237
Ah, the voice of the countryside

1232
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,437
I bet you can't even tell
a stag from a cow

1233
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,389
No, I'm sure it's amazing
I actually can't I'm sort of

1234
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,712
stressed at the moment
Things are crazy right now

1235
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:43,351
Sure All right, well, I'll see you
in another five years, then

1236
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,912
Oh, now, fuck off Look, we can
hook up for a drink after work,

1237
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,120
get bladdered and we can stick pins
in a wax doll of Killally

1238
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,674
How is all that anyway?

1239
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,952
You look so terribly thin, my darling

1240
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,589
An old man worries about these things

1241
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,911
Women like to be thin

1242
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,472
Yes, but you don't look well

1243
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,393
Why don't you see a doctor, my darling?
Won't you, please?

1244
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,791
You can say anything to me, you know

1245
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,232
I don't want you to have any secrets

1246
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,560
What's that?

1247
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,359
She's beautiful

1248
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,755
Her father

1249
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,560
Her father was a good man

1250
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,869
Keep it

1251
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,633
Uh, there's something for you
over there on the side

1252
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,958
[sighs]

1253
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,719
Uh

1254
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,470
Call me if you need, you know

1255
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,191
[door opens and closes]

1256
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,951
[camera shutter clicking]

1257
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,359
<i>Chiquitita</i>

1258
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,680
You know how much I love you

1259
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,594
Mummy loves you so much

1260
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:56,997
Even Even when she's not here

1261
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,472
Mummy loves you forever

1262
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,480
[sobbing]

1263
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,111
I spoke to my source,
he confirmed everything

1264
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,556
This is not a confession
but he says what we need

1265
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,633
<i>[Bushey] I'm gagging for it,</i>
<i>hot shot Just press send</i>

1266
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,440
All right Well, just have a look

1267
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,116
<i>Our lawyer here wants you to stick</i>
<i>with him until the story breaks, OK?</i>

1268
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,671
<i>We don't want him changing his mind</i>
<i>or killing himself,</i>

1269
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,514
<i>or worse still, selling the story</i>
<i>somewhere else</i>

1270
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,114
Yeah Right

1271
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,835
Come on, Marcus, you've got to admit
this wall is a wall of carnage

1272
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,879
[Marcus] You'll love tomorrow,
I swear

1273
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,311
The land will power the soul

1274
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,235
And it's a big thing,
killing one of these guys

1275
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,950
You know, it might sound strange,
but it's

1276
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,830
You know, it'll be the biggest thing
in your life in a way

1277
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,320
You're actually serious?

1278
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,996
Yeah You know what they say about
the deepest of all of man's secrets,

1279
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,834
deeper than any role he might play
to the outside world

1280
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,391
is his passion for killing
It's an imperative

1281
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,793
When you hunt the killing's not just
about the food, prize, or need to do it

1282
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,879
It's about the ritual

1283
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,469
- It's deep
- Steady on

1284
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,190
I'm just a bit of a wuss about blood

1285
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,670
No, you're not,
you're just ignorant about it

1286
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,077
I'll give you the eco version, OK?
Make you feel better

1287
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,475
You kill the weakest stag, the one
that won't make it through winter

1288
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,712
Keeps the herd strong,
keeps them surviving

1289
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,473
You have to do it

1290
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,834
I don't know

1291
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,959
I don't know, but I
I do know

1292
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,511
that I couldn't kill
an animal like that

1293
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,680
Clean kill

1294
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,959
Straight through the heart

1295
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,799
[groans]

1296
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,634
- [Trent brushing teeth]
- [water running]

1297
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,314
I don't believe in much

1298
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,075
Whatever I do,
I believe it when I'm here

1299
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,471
Funny

1300
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,710
I want to tell Wharton I'm not gonna
manage his fucking blind trust anymore

1301
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,111
I don't care if he doesn't
want me as a partner

1302
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,237
I don't care if they don't
want me at all

1303
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,235
Wow

1304
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,120
The thing about you is

1305
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,992
is that you're just one of
those people everyone loves

1306
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,791
You've got that sort of
star attraction thing

1307
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,952
that some people are just born with

1308
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,238
Light shining from your brown eye

1309
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,830
[snoring]

1310
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,200
[vomiting and coughing]

1311
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,556
- [Colin] I wish you'd go to hospital
- No

1312
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,439
[Colin] I'm gonna have to insist

1313
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,951
No No

1314
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,994
No

1315
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,560
Never

1316
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,799
Come on What are you doing?
Mobiles never work out here

1317
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,280
I had two bars a minute ago

1318
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,955
Christ's sake, you can take
the girl out of the city

1319
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,679
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1320
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,719
Can you hear me? Good

1321
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,317
All right, I need to make a couple
of changes to the Killally story

1322
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,279
OK? Just take out a couple of paras

1323
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,550
I know, but I want to get it right

1324
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,953
I'm with my Aylesbury guy and
I really don't think he's involved

1325
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,954
So we have to take his stuff out, OK?

1326
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,233
It's very important

1327
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,875
[stammers] For Christ's sake,
get Bushey to call me back and

1328
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,554
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Sure, Trent

1329
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,598
Don't fuck it up

1330
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,553
Prat

1331

1332
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,470
- Now switch in the middle
- [cell phone beeps]

1333
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,759
Christ! Christ!

1334
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,038
Fuck us off again, it's not the stag
we'll be shooting

1335
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,510
- Yeah I'm sorry
- [deer bellows]

1336
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,314
Mate, come on

[deer bellowing]

1338
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,472
- Are you OK?
- Yeah

1339
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,838
I, uh I need to tell you
something, mate

1340
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,037
Now? Could it fucking wait? Come on

1341
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,431
[man] Come on, let's go

He's yours Your first

1343
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,960
I can't

1344
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,633
- No I just can't
- Yes, you can

1345
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,953
You can Take him, go on, come on
Go on, now he's still Go on

1346
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,431
You've got him before he moves
You'll miss him, you'll miss him

1347
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:26,353
- Go on, hurry Don't want him to move
- All right, OK

1348
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,989
On the front leg, two inches

Trent, come here Come here

It's a tradition

Your first kill

1360

[cell phone ringing]

Wharton

1362
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,791
Well, uh, that's a rumour

1363
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,714
What's in a rumour, Hugo?

1364
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,750
Yeah, thanks

1365
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,199
[knock on door]

1366
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,313
I'll be an hour, tops

1367
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,472
- She won't wake?
- Not a problem

1368

[playing rock music]

1369
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,480
Nice

1370
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,799
What up, mate?

1371
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:16,794
Really, it's OK It was only wounded for
a couple of seconds You heard Ronny

1372
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,389
No

1373
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,792
No, it's not fine

1374
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:26,473
Actually I've, um, ordered a taxi

1375
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,711
It's gonna be here any minute

1376
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,154
Why?

1377
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,393
'Cause

1378
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,639
I just fucked your life

1379
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:57,076
You know, everything I've
taken down everything you told me

1380
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,234
and [sighs]

1381
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,994
sold it

1382
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,472
I've destroyed your charmed life
