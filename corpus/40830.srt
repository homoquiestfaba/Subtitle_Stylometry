1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,784
Of all the wonderful things
in life you can find

2
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,880
They all can be yours
with the right frame of mind

3
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:24,169
-Just look and you'll find
- No run, no lie

4
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:27,713
- There are no secrets to hide
- No run, no lie

5
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:31,258
Leave your problems behind
Leave your problems behind

6
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:34,057
No worry, friends
No worry

7
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,491
Yuck!

8
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,617
Eww!

9
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:51,329
Swim trunks are loaded
with detergents...

10
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,408
and other hazardous chemicals
that could be harmful to fish.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,244
Ow! Ah!

12
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,458
Hi, Allison.

13
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:49,551
-Just quit my job at the aquarium.
- Heard you got fired.

14
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:52,847
Yeah. Aquarium's totally changed,
but don't worry about me.

15
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,228
I'll be fine. You know,
I got a lot of great offers.

16
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,021
You know, things are really
starting to happen for me.

17
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,863
- I was thinking, maybe later,
if you weren't doing..
- No.

18
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:03,189
I mean, uh, if you're..
when you're not workin'..

19
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:04,659
I don't think so.

20
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:09,079
Okay, I guess I'll just, you know,
take some sea snails and be on my way.

21
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:19,633
No, no, a little lower.
The ones on the bottom.

22
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:41,407
Uh.. Have a good nipple.

23
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,097
Colour me your colour, baby

24
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,524
Colour me your car

25
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,896
Colour me your colour, darling

26
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,524
I know who you are

27
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:27,861
- Come up off your colour chart
- Ah, you have beautiful skin, baby.

28
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,290
Get some olive oil,
rub it all over you.

29
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,500
We'll have a good time, huh?

30
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,546
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

31
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,879
Let's get him out of there.

32
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,940
Oh! Oh, Antoine! Yeah!

33
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,907
Yes!

34
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,750
Try to keep your goldfish
in this bowl.

35
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,882
If you like, I could
stick around for a while.

36
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,388
Every kid needs a father.

37
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,285
What the hell?

38
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,759
What the hell are you doing?

39
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,845
There's a mongrel koi in there.

40
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,227
It's the most dangerous
of all goldfish.

41
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:14,101
Do you have any ice?

42
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,816
Hey! Shoes off, huh?

43
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,694
Respect the 1 8th-century
Persian carpet.

44
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:27,039
Whoa! What are those?

45
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,581
Medieval weapons.
I'm a collector.

46
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,912
They're worth twice as much
If they've killed somebody.

47
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:40,254
I collect Canadian quarters.

48
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,590
I got about six of them.

49
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:50,435
Would you like anything to drink?

50
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,352
I wouldn't mind a glass of..

51
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:55,149
Whoa. What is that?

52
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:59,189
Is that a custom Living Colour,
anti-glare, retractable-top tank?

53
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:02,405
- I'm not sure.
- It is.

54
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,489
They assemble
each one of these by hand.

55
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:08,450
Whoa. Chinese tail bar lionfish.
He's a beauty.

56
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:11,581
That's an $800 fish!

57
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,460
- Try a grand.
- Well, then you overpaid.

58
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,845
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

59
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,091
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

60
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:26,471
Hey, an Australian rainbow fish.

61
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:29,648
You're not gonna wanna
put him in there.

62
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:33,601
- Oh, God!
- Women love it.

63
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,448
They find it erotic
when they eat each other.

64
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,408
Excuse me for a second, huh?

65
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,571
Must make pee-pee.

66
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,257
Antoine, hi. It's Regina. I'm flying in
from Luxembourg tomorrow.

67
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,387
I want you to be my driver.
SwissAir, flight 12.

68
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
Is itstill3,500?
See you. Ciao.

69
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,730
I finally figured out how you
pick up all these gorgeous women.

70
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,574
- How's that?
- You're a limo driver.

71
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,862
Sometimes I am.

72
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,196
So you just drive them back here
and have sex with them?

73
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,244
If they pay me enough, yes.

74
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,004
What kind of limo service is that?

75
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:31,005
Shouldn't you be taking them
to fancy restaurants or the theatre?

76
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:35,921
- I'm a gigolo.
- A gigo-who?

77
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:40,640
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

78
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,391
How'd you get that job?

79
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,357
I just kind of fell into it.

80
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,063
I'm gonna kill
my guidance counsellor.

81
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,830
Hey! Hey! Hey!

82
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:17,214
Down! Bad dog!

83
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:28,516
Hey, guys.
Did you miss me?

84
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:39,114
Well, there's been a slight delay
in our move-to-the-beach plan.

85
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,534
But don't worry.

86
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,923
It's gonna happen.

87
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:56,715
Hey, fish guy!

88
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,636
I think there's something wrong
with my, uh...

89
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,556
uh, duh, duh, big fish.

90
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,613
PH is off. The nitrates
are at a dangerous level.

91
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,280
I can neutralize it.

92
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,123
Oh, hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

93
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:23,457
They don't like that.

94
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,873
I think our little friend
has Malawi bloat.

95
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,132
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gill disorder.

96
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,212
Is it bad?

97
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,215
- Could be fatal.
- But is he gonna make it?

98
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:40,388
He's in shock. I gave him
some freeze-dried water fleas,
but he's gotta wanna live.

99
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,515
- The next 48 hours are critical.
- Forty-eight hours?

100
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:46,063
But I got to go to Switzerland
for business.

101
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,725
- I'll be gone for three weeks.
- Well, cancel it.

102
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,356
- You got a sick fish here, pal.
- Hey, hey, what about you, huh?

103
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,115
Sounds good, but I can't afford to go to
Europe right now. My passport expired..

104
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:59,205
No, no. I mean you can stay here
and look after my fish, huh?

105
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,367
No, I've got a full bar, huh?

106
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,911
Digital television.
You're on the beach.

107
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,415
I don't know. I..

108
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,508
I would be honoured
to care for your fish.

109
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,533
Just remember.

110
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:37,237
Don't use my car
and don't answer my phone.

111
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,905
No car, no phone.

112
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,124
So I guess throwing a big beach party
is out of the question, huh?

113
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,254
This is a 1 4th-century
Hungarian crossbow.

114
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:53,381
It has killed a king
and changed the history of Europe.

115
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,139
You mess up anything
in my apartment...

116
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:00,063
I'll shove it up your ass.

117
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,224
Have a good trip.

118
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,193
Come on, come on

119
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:20,036
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

120
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,676
Come on, come on

121
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:32,514
And tell me why you're standing

122
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:34,390
Come on, come on

123
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:37,227
It must be
Why you're demanding

124
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,055
Come on, come on

125
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,226
Come on, come on

126
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,150
-And stop
- I'm on the beach.

127
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,027
I mean, I open up my window,
I got sand blowin' in my face.

128
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,324
It's that crazy.
I'd love to show it to you sometime.

129
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,405
- No.
- You really owe it yourself to see..

130
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,574
- No.
- Hey!

131
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,909
Try to get laid
on your own time, pal.

132
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,624
- Yeah, come on!
- Let's go, pal. Really.

133
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,790
I guess I'll just take
some sea snails.

134
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:10,179
You better give me some
from the colder tank.

135
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,187
Oh!

136
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:59,977
Oh! Oh, yes!

137
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,439
Oh!

138
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,401 - Oh.
- I've been bad.

139
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:06,445
I've been really bad.

140
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,901
Oh!Ah!

141
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:12,117
But it was worth it.

142
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:16,578
Hi. Would you like to buy
some Girls of America cookies?

143
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:20,167
- Don't hit me with that.
- Could you come back later?

144
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,838
- Ohh!
- Eww! What are you watching?

145
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:28,552
You're gross! You're a sick man,
and I'm gonna tell!

146
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,631
- Hit me with it again!
- How much?

147
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,131
Great.

148
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,052
Hey, uh, Deuce, it's Antoine.

149
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,177
I just realized
I don't know you that well.

150
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:53,142
To be honest,
it's freaking me out a little.

151
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:56,812
You just make sure you keep my apartment
clean, or you will die! Bye-bye.

152
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,336
Six thousand dollars?

153
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,748
I know. It sucks.

154
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:05,180
- Neil, where am I gonna get
$6,000 in three weeks?
- I don't know your budget.

155
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:09,262
You may not want to blow
your whole wad on this tank.

156
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,388
I would.

157
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:16,482
- Can I pay in instalments?
- No.

158
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,734
I'm up to my bicep in it,
If you know what I mean.

159
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:24,233
I'm not trying to flip you over
and do you dry here.

160
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:28,075
Look. Squat on it for a night,
and let me know.

161
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:58,481
- What? Hello?
- Hi.

162
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:03,032
I've been staring at your number
For hours. I got it from a friend.

163
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:06,866
Um, I'm not really
supposed to use this phone.

164
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:11,498
Why don't you come over?
My address is 1235Radford Way.

165
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:17,540
Actually, uh, I've.. I've got
a lot of work to do here still.

166
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,625
I'm naked.

167
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,302
- Call me
- Call me

168
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,419
On the line

169
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:27,049
Call me, call me
any, anytime

170
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,518
Call me
 
171
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:40,272
Now there's my little
German tourist.

172
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:44,368
Is this it?
Is this the whole outfit?

173
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,410
It's perfect.

174
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:02,096
Yes. Use the map.
Use the map.

175
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,519
"Vohrest der
Statue of Liberty?"

176
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:16,273
You should have stuck
with the tour, Heinz.

177
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,438
Now you'll have to
pay the penalty.

178
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:23,651
It's.. It's no problem.
I'll just, um..

179
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:27,912
Let me slip on
a few of these babies.

180
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:37,007
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

181
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:42,134
Now, come here,
you naughty little sightseer.

182
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,937
- Wait a second.
I definitely heard something!
- Oh, that's just Wolfy.

183
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:55,236
He's been in there a while. Now,
you concentrate and stay in character.

184
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:59,442
Wolfy, settle down!

185
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,451
Now, you just focus
on your little Wiener schnitzel.

186
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,916
I gotta get outta here.

187
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,075
Don't worry. He never
gets all the way through.

188
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,453
Maybe you better go.

189
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,219
Wolfy has got to stop
doing this to Mommy's friends!

190
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:21,174
Yes, he does.
Yes, he does.

191
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:24,930
He'll be all right for a while. Here,
this is for you. It's all I could grab.

192
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,517
- Did I bring you pleasure?
- Not really.

193
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:30,682
Y-Y-You better haul ass.

194
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,659
Ten dollars?

195
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,791
Yeah!

196
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,261
Well, you can tell
by the way I roll shorty

197
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,890
That I'm a ladies' man
A businessman

198
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,558
I keep it intact
Yo, Clef

199
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:12,100
Do the track with John
Play the mack while I pay the taxi

200
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,317
Business as usual
watchin' suspects

201
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:17,074
- Steal my assets
- Martini and two olives.

202
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:20,194
- Drink sat the bar
- Martini. Two olives.

203
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,617
Any ladies need
some entertainment tonight?

204
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,782
He's kind of cute.

205
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,919
Eight-fifty.

206
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,719
- Eight dollars?
- And fifty cents.

207
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,928
Well, how much just for
a plain cranberry juice?

208
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,647
Oh, uh, three dollars.

209
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,809
I'll go for that.

210
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,939
There you go.
That's, uh, eleven-fifty.

211
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,117
Uh, no, no.
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

212
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:05,372
I wish to cancel my original order
Of the martini and two olives...

213
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:09,373
and go for just the plain cranberry
juice, by itself, for the three dollars.

214
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:12,666
And I apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused you.

215
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:14,585
Uh, perhaps you don't understand.

216
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:17,215
Uh, if you don't pay me now,
I'm going to, uh...

217
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,677
I'm gonna take this swizzle stick
and, uh...

218
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,924
I'll be shovin' that
right up your pee hole.

219
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:25,933
- Stayin' alive
- So that was eleven-fiifty, right?

220
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,682
- Right.
- Okay.

221
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:32,021
There's ten and six quarters.

222
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:35,232
And, uh, tell you what.
I'll go work on your tip.

223
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,989
I couldn't help
overhearing your Spanish.

224
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,877
It's French.

225
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:53,126
French. Nice people.
May l?

226
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,709
No..

227
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,343
Oop.

228
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,758
These leather seats.

229
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,308
Would you like a martini
or cranberry juice?

230
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:05,939
No.

231
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,016
Kinda celebrating tonight.

232
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,604
Possible career change.

233
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:19,985
- I'm pretty excited about it.
- You wanna get outta here?

234
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,370
Okay. I'm sorry.

235
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,955
I mean, together.

236
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:42,344
What happened to the carpet?

237
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:45,937
Oh, it's, uh, one of those
1 8th-century wet rugs.

238
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:58,239
Oh, that's certainly appreciated.

239
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,782
Hey, whoa.

240
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,330
Maybe we should take care
Of a little business first.

241
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:07,455
If you prefer.

242
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:10,916
I don't have a set price or anything,
but I have been getting ten dollars.

243
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:15,306
- I'm sorry?
- Well, that's my going rate.

244
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,058
But I'm willing to negotiate.

245
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:23,808
That's funny.
But the price is 500.

246
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:26,852
You're gonna pay me $500?

247
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:29,516
No, honey, you pay me.

248
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:34,942
Oh, I get it. This is
some kind of role reversal.

249
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:38,700
I'll play along with this.
Okay, 300, 400, 500.

250
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,580
You're my hooker.

251
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,742
No, seriously,
where's my ten dollars?

252
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:46,286
Look, asshole, I didn't come
all the way down here for nothin'.

253
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,248
Now, give me my $500!

254
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,715
You give me ten dollars!

255
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,630
500, now!

256
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,765
You pay me ten dollars.

257
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:04,686
Nice. Oh!

258
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,989
Is that all you got?

259
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,179
Ten dollars!

260
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,314
No! Please, don't!

261
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,361
Five hundred dollars,
or the fish gets it.

262
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,777
Let's talk about this.

263
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:08,381
- Why do you have a picture of Antoine?
- Well, this is his place.
I'm watchin' his fish for him.

264
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:16,635
Please, don't tell him
about the shoes, huh?

265
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:40,786
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Oh, my God.

266
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,293
I'm lookin' at a dead man.

267
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:48,082
You know, Claire told me
that Antoine's place was messed up...

268
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:50,846
but I had no idea.

269
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,884
- Claire?
- The hooker you ass-punched.

270
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,382
That was a misunderstanding...

271
00:25:56,477 --> 00:26:01,140
and I intend to have everything fiixed
by the time Antoine gets back.

272
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:04,483
I'm just.. just a little
strapped for cash right now.

273
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,320
Maybe there's something
we could work out.

274
00:26:07,406 --> 00:26:10,111
Claire mentioned
that you dabbled in harlotry.

275
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,489
- I'm sorry?
- You a man-whore.

276
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:15,247
-Well, I tried that for a couple hours..
-See this ring?

277
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,158
Topaz.
That's my mother's birthstone.

278
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,622
Got that from man-whorin'.

279
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,750
See this key chain?
That's right.

280
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:24,792
Mini yo-yo.
Know how I got the money for that?

281
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,626
- Man-whorin'?
- Stock market.

282
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,636
But I got the money for the stock market
from man-whorin'...

283
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,090
and representin'
man-whores like yourself.

284
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:38,431
- So, you're a pimp?
- T.J. don't consider himself no pimp.

285
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:40,978
More of a male madam.

286
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,768
That wasn't too well thought out.

287
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:49,908
Look at this proud fish.
It's like a coyote. King of the jungle.

288
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:52,745
Just like Antoine.
He don't need no pimp.

289
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:56,703
Now look at this
mid-level fish here.

290
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:00,042
Works hotels, conventions,
senior centres.

291
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:03,248
I represent several man-whores at this level of the game.

292
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,958
Now look at this little fella.

293
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:11,051
At the bottom, tryin' to get busy
with the scuba man.

294
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,928
You know, if you work hard
and listen to me...

295
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:17,517
this could be you.

296
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:21,022
Well, thanks,
but I already have a job.

297
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:25,903
- I clean fish tanks.
- You ever make $1 50
cleanin' fish tanks?

298
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:28,278
- A hundred and fiifty dollars?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,945
Fish ain't gonna pay
for all this.

300
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,406
I don't know.

301
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,788
You know, Antoine's
got a bad temper.

302
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:40,285
Remember once I dropped
a cigar ash on his rug.

303
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:44,793
He made me pick it up
with my anus.

304
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,132
Well, maybe I could
do a couple jobs...

305
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:52,845
just to get
this place fiixed up.

306
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,571
We got a lot of work to do.

307
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,785
I believe in miracles

308
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:22,421
Where you from

309
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:25,628
You sexy thing
Sexy thing, you

310
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,926
I believe in miracles

311
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,597
Since you came along

312
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,010 You sexy thing

313
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,959
You a man-whore now.

314
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:08,304
- I'm so proud.
- Thanks, T.J.

315
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,597
Now, remember, it's business.

316
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,886
Never, ever fall in love.

317
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:39,914
I'm upstairs!

318
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,811
Okay, Deuce,
don't fall in love.

319
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,996
I know what you're thinkin'.

320
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,466
You're thinkin' those are
the biggest boobies you've ever seen.

321
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,461
Can I please use your phone?

322
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,677
I'm not your average woman.

323
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:29,133
I like sex,
and I'm not afraid to admit..

324
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,687
Excuse me.
I just had pudding an hour ago.

325
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:40,318
- Dear God!
- You ever parked your bicycle
in an aeroplane hangar?

326
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,189
- I'm sorry?
- You ever thrown an toothpick...

327
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:45,862
into a volcano?

328
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:49,072
- What?
- Oh, nothin'.

329
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:53,458
Just makin' idle chit-chat.
Are you comfortable?

330
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:56,331
- Actually, no.
- Ooh.

331
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:00,005
I'm sweatin'.
You're gettin' me all hot.

332
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:04,214
- You don't like my hair, do you?
- I think there's been a mistake.

333
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:07,057
- Did you say "steak"?
- No mistake.

334
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:09,680
- Oh, see, now you got me all excited.
- Look, I'm gay.

335
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,271
- Well, how gay are you?
- Very, very gay.

336
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:16,434
You must have dialled
the Very Gay Escort Service.

337
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,978
Oh, shit. See, sometimes
my fingers swell up...

338
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,694
and I can't cleanly
hit the numbers.

339
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:25,156
They should make a phone
for full-figured girls.

340
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:28,162
- They should.
- So...

341
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:30,324
what do we do?

342
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:37,876
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

343
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:41,335
Cakes and Pies.
Cakes and Pies!

344
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:44,346
Okay, which pie
has the most sugar?

345
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:48,761
- Peach cobbler.
- You win again.
That's four games to one.

346
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,771
Well, fast food trivia
is my game, honey.

347
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:58,482
I must tell you, nobody has ever
pleasured Jabba the Slut.

348
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,648
Deucey, you have a way
of satisfying a woman...

349
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,817
that would sicken a normal man.

350
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,902
I can't do this any more.

351
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:07,367
You must have
a magical "man-gina."

352
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:09,579
- Huh?
- "Man-gina."

353
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:14,578
It's a professional term we man-whores
use to describe our he-pussy.

354
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,795
I'm not one of your man-whores.

355
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:18,377
Okay? I quit.

356
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,959
You ungrateful he-bitch.

357
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:23,130
How 'bout I get Antoine on the phone
in Switzerland...

358
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:26,259
and tell him how you
redecorated his poon palace?

359
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,305
I'm not an ungrateful he-bitch.

360
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:31,555
Just give me a minute
to think here.

361
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,169
Thanks.

362
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:02,718
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

363
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:05,843
- Hey, Dad, let me ask you a question.
- And what's that, son?

364
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:09,102
Do you think it's wrong for a man
to accept money from a woman...

365
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,893
to, you know,
show her a good time?

366
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,142
I was just thinking about that
this morning.

367
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:18,280
The idea of a man-whore
is a relatively new idea.

368
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,742
- Cologne?
- No, thanks.

369
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:27,115
These women are looking
for something more than just sex.

370
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,877
- They want romance.
- What do you mean?

371
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:33,543
Well, it was like
when I met your mom.

372
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,291
God rest her soul.

373
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:38,088
I didn't have so much
as a toilet to clean.

374
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:42,389
Still, I wasn't going
to pay her a dime for sex,
no matter what she was charging.

375
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,016
What?

376
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:47,801
Well, your mom could have had
any man she wanted in that strip club...

377
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:51,811
and this being my first time in Bangkok,
I was looking for a good time myself.

378
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,143
- You met Mom where?
- Oh, it's not important.

379
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:56,858
The thing is,
she saw something in me...

380
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,486
beyond the 200 baht..

381
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:01,402
a man with an eye
for adventure...

382
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:04,199
who wasn't afraid
to risk it all.

383
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,365
Dad, are.. are you saying that..

384
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:13,379
So, we took all
her one-dollar bills off the stage...

385
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:15,624
said goodbye to that donkey...

386
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:19,051
and two days later,
we were man and wife.

387
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:22,009
And we were happily married,
long time.

388
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,800
So, do you think I should be
more ofa risk-taker?

389
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:27,886
Worked for me.

390
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,930
Thanks, Pops.

391
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,821
Well, son...

392
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,067
Looks like I've got
some work to do.

393
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,120
You got yourself a man-whore.

394
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,919
My man!

395
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,181
- Is.. Is Tina here?
- Yes.

396
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,892
I'm Deuce Bigalow, her date.

397
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,021
I get my things.

398
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,987
I love this place.

399
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,484
- Where you from again?
- Norway.

400
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:23,152
- Freak!
- I hear great things about it.

401
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,582
- Holy shit, it's Bigfoot!
- So how'd you end up here?

402
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:30,334
I had a pituitary gland procedure
at UCLA Medical Centre...

403
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,462
and I just fell in love
with the people here.

404
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,761
- Hey, keep it in the circus!
- You know, this place
has gone way downhill.

405
00:35:36,846 --> 00:35:39,764
- What do you say we go somewhere else?
- That's a huge bitch!

406
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,598
I'm sorry about
what those people said.

407
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,929
You should be able to go
on all the rides.

408
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,940
I had a really great time,
but I should go.

409
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:57,655
Easy. Easy!
Take it easy!

410
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:01,071
Wait, wait.

411
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:03,405
Wait. Hey, I know
what we can do.

412
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,117
I got it. Give me
a second to think here!

413
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,755
Wait! Whoa!

414
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:14,501
Oh, yes! Oh!

415
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:15,970
Mmm!

416
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:29,018
Oh, no one has ever
touched my feet before.

417
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:47,337
Deuce Bigalow?
Detective Fowler, L.A.P.D.

418
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:51,335
I wanna ask you a few questions
about Antoine Laconte...

419
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,917
known gigolo, male prostitute.

420
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:59,183
- I'm just taking care of his fish.
- I'll bet you are.

421
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,852
You make me sick!

422
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:04,558
You gonna stand there and tell me
that gigantic woman...

423
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:06,724
didn't just pay you
to have sex with her?

424
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:09,438
- No.
- Let me tell you something, mister.

425
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:13,775
I can sleep at night, because I make
a decent, God-fearin', honest livin'.

426
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:16,737
I'm sure you do,
but there's nothing I can tell you.

427
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,701
I think there is.

428
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:20,615
What do you think of this?

429
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:24,206
- You think I can get anything
for it? You know, money?
- I don't know.

430
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:26,536
Yeah. You think
I'm a loser, don't you?

431
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:29,417
- No, I don't.
- Well, maybe I am a loser...

432
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:32,129
but I'm a loser
who can bust your ass.

433
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,635
Now you tell Antoine
I'm gonna nail him.

434
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,317
- Hello?
- Is this Ruth?

435
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:58,819
Yeah, I'll be right down.
Goddamn it!

436
00:37:59,873 --> 00:38:02,411
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah.

437
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:03,876
Shove it up your ass!

438
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,965
Jeez, you okay?

439
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:14,088
I'm sorry.
I have Tourette's syndrome...

440
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,881
and it causes me to have
these uncontrollable outbursts.

441
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,265
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah. It's okay.

442
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,263
I mean, you get used to it.

443
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:25,891
Ball sweat! Anus!
Anus licker!

444
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:32,946
You know, there are some places
I can't go! Nipple biter!

445
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:38,284
What are you talkin' about?
I barely notice it.

446
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,167
Scrotum! Sperm!
Sperm face!

447
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:48,580
I just can't go near places
like churches. Ha-ha! Vulva!

448
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:52,297
Elementary schools.
Jizz!Jizz trap!

449
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,924
Pretty much anywhere.

450
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:57,092
Fart! Dildo!

451
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:59,177
Big.. Big, big titties!

452
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:02,886
Shit! Shit whore!

453
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:06,683
Hey, uh, let's put the top up.
I'll put on the air conditioning.

454
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,233
You probably want to
take me home, don't you?

455
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:14,155
No.

456
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,197
Hey, I got an idea.

457
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,621
I'm nervous.
There's a lot of people here.

458
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,043
- Don't worry.
- Crap muncher!

459
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:29,422
- "Crap muncher"?
- I know!

460
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,883
He was definitely safe!

461
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:34,641
- Hey, what do you think
about the other team?
- Assholes!

462
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:36,717
- Hey, keep it down.
- Right.

463
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,855
And.. And their pitcher. I mean,
stop stalling and throw it already.

464
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,062
- Ball hair!
- "Ball hair"?
- Ball hair!

465
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,558
Yeah, ball hair.

466
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:48,570
What we need is
a strike hair.

467
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:51,443
That other team's
a bunch of high-priced babies!

468
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:54,570
- Whores!
- Yeah! You tell 'em, darlin'!

469
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,876
- They called him out?
- S-Scrotum licker!

470
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:03,539
- Yeah!
- Scrotum licker!

471
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,002
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

472
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:07,585
Piss face! Piss face!

473
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:10,962
Piss face! Piss face!
Piss face! Piss face!

474
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,807
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

475
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:20,057
Deucey, you the best he-bitch
in my man-stable.

476
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:23,897
If I had two more "man-ginas" like you,
I'd be a millionaire.

477
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:27,189
- T.J., I think I'm gonna get out.
- Sit down.

478
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,068
This next date is what we man-pimps
call a doozy.

479
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,526
- What's wrong with this one?
- Nothin'.

480
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,787
Have you seen her?
What is she, 80? Hunchbacked?

481
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,209
She just got outta college.

482
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:41,867
Some of her girlfriends pitched in
to get her a little beefcake.

483
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:45,296
- She thinks it's a blind date.
- It's a guy, isn't it?

484
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:50,342
I don't think so,
but I have been fooled before.

485
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,081
- You must be Kate.
- Excuse me. Waiter.

486
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:19,535
Ah. Uh, yes. Sorry.
We're busy tonight.

487
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:20,791
I'll have the..

488
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:26,001
- A number four?
- Yes. Thank you.

489
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,338
- I'm Kate.
- Are you sure?

490
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:35,974
- Think so.
- I'm sorry. You're just
not what I expected.

491
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,815
- Really.
- No, no.

492
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,023
I mean, in, uh..
in a good way.

493
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:46,979
They didn't say
you were so perfect.

494
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,358
"Perfect."

495
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:53,288
So, Sally and Megan
didn't tell me a lot about you.

496
00:41:53,372 --> 00:41:54,748
Who?

497
00:41:56,375 --> 00:42:01,536
Oh, right, uh..
Well, I clean, uh, tanks.. ers..

498
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:03,339
Tankers.

499
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:05,880
I'm sorry.
I'm still kinda shocked.

500
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:08,674
I mean, you're..
you're really normal.

501
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,800
Thank you.

502
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:14,644
My last couple of dates
have been horrible.

503
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:17,350
Oh, you get fixed up
on a lot of blind dates?

504
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:18,898
Only recently.

505
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:22,647
- H-How 'bout you?
- This is my first.

506
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:26,940
- I hope this place is okay.
- Are you kidding? It's terrific.

507
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,987
- Oh, God!
- Are you okay?

508
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,616
- Is this one of those, uh..
- It's a sushi bar.

509
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,869
- Are you allergic?
- You could say that.

510
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,462
That's a dog-faced
puffer fish over there.

511
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,835
He's not even fully matured yet.
He's a teenager, for crying out loud.

512
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:51,256
Can I ask you
to stop that, please?

513
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:58,939
I don't see how it could possibly
be pleasurable for a woman.

514
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:03,022
I just don't think it's natural.

515
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,106
You're not supposed to go up there.

516
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,235
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how men do it either.

517
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:11,696
You're not curious,
just to try somethin' new?

518
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,865
I'm just not into it.

519
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,492
So space exploration
is definitely out for you?

520
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:20,790
Definitely. I mean, more power to any
woman who wants to be an astronaut.

521
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:23,089
I just wouldn't do it.

522
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:25,252
Frankly, I'd rather
take it up the butt.

523
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:32,348
So you think this is a good spot?

524
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,647
It's perfect.

525
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:41,651
Life's funny, huh?
Some pretty close calls.

526
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:46,570
I wonder if he knew
how close he came to the end?

527
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,118
Oh, he knew.

528
00:43:49,788 --> 00:43:52,789
I bet he never thought he'd
be held by such a lovely woman.

529
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,203
Deuce.

530
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,791
You're embarrassing me
in front of our new friend.

531
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:11,390
That was a really nice thing
you did tonight.

532
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:15,930
Too bad it's a freshwater fish.

533
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:21,193
I-l=I'm kidding, see?
I'm just joking.

534
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:27,367
Take some time
For our feelings to grow

535
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:31,571
Good night.

536
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:33,742
- You're so close now
- Good night.

537
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:37,085
I can't let you go

538
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:42,635
And I can't let go

539
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:48,011
With you I'm not shy

540
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,674
To show the way I feel

541
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,095
With you I might..

542
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:56,939
You've had yourself
an interesting little evening.

543
00:44:57,026 --> 00:45:00,692
Just takin' care of his fish, huh?
She looks like a nice catch.

544
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,903
It was a first date.

545
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,111
Listen up, man-whore.
I oughta bust you right now!

546
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,619
- We just had sushi.
- "Sushi." Is that what
they call it nowadays?

547
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,328
Well, I'm hip
to your man-whore slang.

548
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,793
All right, fine.

549
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,460
Why don't I just go have a little chat
with your spicy tuna roll, huh?

550
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,042
No, don't!

551
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,505
All right. Okay, Deuce.

552
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,304
No problem, baby. Relax.

553
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,889
Maybe I'll even let this one slide
for some information.

554
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,219
Like Antoine's black book.
You know.

555
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,599
- The one with his list of clients?
- I don't know anything about it.

556
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,728
Oh, yeah?
You know anything about this?

557
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,062
See that red spot over there?

558
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,528
That wasn't there this morning.
I checked.

559
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,740
- You know what it is?
- Maybe it's a rash.

560
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:48,196
Something you got from jogging. How the
hell do I know? Get it away from me.

561
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:53,119
Maybe you're right.
You got three days, Bigalow!

562
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:06,262
T.J., I really like this girl.

563
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,969
Deucey, don't be fallin' in love with
no she-John. You're in it for the money.

564
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:13,847
Antoine will be back pretty soon.
Apartment ain't gonna pay to fix itself.

565
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:17,061
I know. Hey, there's been
this detective followin' me.

566
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:20,736
Goddamn it, white boy! You didn't
tell him nothin' about me, did you?

567
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:22,615
No, but what should I do?

568
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:27,194
- About what?
- About the cop!

569
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:29,661
Will you stop mentionin'
the damn cops?

570
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,992
Don't make me
he-bitch man-slap you!

571
00:46:43,515 --> 00:46:46,966
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow,
your man-whore for this evening.

572
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,183
Hi, I'm Carol..

573
00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:54,896
I have narcolepsy.
It's.. It's a sleeping disorder.

574
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:56,729
It isn't the worst thing
you could ever have.

575
00:46:56,821 --> 00:47:00,106
I'm just not allowed to fly
an aeroplane or.. or drive a car...

576
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:02,275
or work in a gun range.

577
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:04,904
Yeah.

578
00:47:22,932 --> 00:47:27,428
This is such a treat.
I've always wanted to try soup,
but there's the fear of drowning.

579
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:42,236
- I really had fun.
- Are you gonna be okay?

580
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,819
- I'll be fine.
- You sure?

581
00:47:44,913 --> 00:47:46,953
- Yeah.
- Good night.

582
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,482
I can't get enough of you, baby

583
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:18,489
I can't get
enough of you, baby

584
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:20,567
Yes, it's true

585
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:24,613
Yes, it's true

586
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:30,626
Whenever we kiss
I get to feelin' like this

587
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:34,378
I get to wishin '
that there were two of you

588
00:48:34,466 --> 00:48:36,459
Come on.
You can dance.

589
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:38,710
Come on, baby

590
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,046
It feels so nice

591
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,263
I want your arms to

592
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:47,218
Wrap around me twice

593
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,195
I can't get enough of you, baby

594
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,280
I can't get
enough of you, baby

595
00:48:57,366 --> 00:48:58,611
Right or wrong

596
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,196
Baby, right or wrong

597
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:13,918
- I can't get enough of you, baby
- Ohh, Deuce.

598
00:49:14,008 --> 00:49:16,844
- You look great.
- Thanks.

599
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:20,467
- I want you to meet my roommate.
- Who's there? Kate?

600
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:24,140
- I hear someone.
- It's just me and my friend.

601
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,683
Are you sure?
I hear three people.

602
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:28,765
You're the third person.

603
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:30,815
Oh. Oh, okay.

604
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,357
She's newly blind.
She's still getting adjusted.

605
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:36,985
Bergita, this is Deuce.

606
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:40,067
I think there's
something wrong with Cassie.

607
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:41,406
Oh, honey.

608
00:49:42,998 --> 00:49:44,492
This isn't Cassie.

609
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,576
Here she is.

610
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:50,829
Oh, there you are.

611
00:49:50,923 --> 00:49:53,414
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

612
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:59,968
Once you try it for the first time,
you're pretty happy with the results.

613
00:50:00,057 --> 00:50:02,513
I've never met
a hair transplant technician before.

614
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:14,197
Oh, man! I forgot.
It's my dad's birthday.

615
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,819
- Let's go see him.
- He's working.

616
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:18,902
So, what does he do?

617
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:22,446
He's in the restaurant industry.

618
00:50:26,377 --> 00:50:29,628
Kate, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Bob Bigalow.

619
00:50:29,714 --> 00:50:30,877
Bob, Kate.

620
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,966
- Hi.
- Son, I'm very proud of you.

621
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:38,426
She is a lovely young lady.

622
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,551
Thank you.

623
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,561
It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

624
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:47,220
- Thank you.
- Well, we should probably be going.

625
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:48,597
Deuce.

626
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:52,571
Dad probably has a lot
of paperwork to do and..

627
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:55,277
No, the paper's
completely stocked.

628
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:58,154
I've got plenty of time to get
more acquainted with the woman...

629
00:50:58,244 --> 00:51:00,071
who's made my boy so happy.

630
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:04,158
We got you a cake.
Deuce said it's your favourite.

631
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:07,457
We had to go to
a Filipino bakery to get it.

632
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:08,577
You didn't.

633
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,838
You did!
Raspberry bibingka?

634
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:15,588
Aw, you shouldn't have.

635
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,385
My wife,
God rest her soul...

636
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:20,716
used to make this all the time.

637
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,969
You would have liked her.

638
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:24,771
Bangkok Betty.

639
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:30,229
She had the most amazing mouth.
It paid for our honeymoon.

640
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,324
- Well, we should probably be going.
- Deuce, it's your dad's birthday.

641
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:43,662
Hi, Bob. We have an overflowing toilet
in the ladies' bathroom.

642
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,246
There is shit everywhere.

643
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:48,006
It's a real mess. You think you can get
in there and take care of that for me?

644
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:50,296
No worries, Vic.
Right on it.

645
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:52,460
I'd like you to meet
my son's girlfriend Kate.

646
00:51:52,552 --> 00:51:54,925
- Kate, nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Hi, Deuce.

647
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:56,673
So, could you get in there, Bob?

648
00:51:56,765 --> 00:52:01,926
I mean, I got a party often coming in,
and I am up to my ankles in human crap.

649
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:03,930
It's a real stink-fest back there.

650
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:05,683
Sure.

651
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:08,646
Well, looks like
I better get back to work.

652
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:11,227
It's a pleasure
meeting you, dear.

653
00:52:11,322 --> 00:52:14,277
It warms my heart
just being in your presence.

654
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:15,826
Oh, thank you.

655
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,579
See you, son.

656
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,786
See, my dad's
one of those guys, uh..

657
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:27,452
- He likes to be involved
in every facet of the business.
- It's okay.

658
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:29,790
There.. There's no, uh, problem
too small or too big.

659
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:32,636
- I mean, they come to him
for everything.
- Deuce, it's all right.

660
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:37,591
It's not his restaurant.

661
00:52:38,852 --> 00:52:40,928
My dad's not even a waiter.

662
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,141
He's the men's room attendant.
I'm sorry.

663
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,645
Don't be silly.

664
00:52:49,113 --> 00:52:51,319
You know what my dad does?

665
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,649
He's an aeronautical engineer.

666
00:53:05,438 --> 00:53:06,933
Bob?

667
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,313
Wanna blow out your candle?

668
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,874
Mmm, now that's good bibingka.

669
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,385
I had a really nice time tonight.

670
00:53:39,475 --> 00:53:41,514
I find that hard to believe.

671
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,896
I've never met anyone like you.

672
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:50,561
Good.

673
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,695
I have to see you again.

674
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,535
When we go inside, try to be quiet
so we don't wake up Bergita.

675
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:06,033
With you I'm not shy

676
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:08,798
To show the way I feel

677
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:12,499
With you I might try

678
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:15,963
My secrets to reveal

679
00:54:16,055 --> 00:54:19,092
For you are a magnet

680
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:22,932
And I am steel

681
00:54:23,021 --> 00:54:25,097
Why don't I get the light?

682
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,935
Hang on. I'll be right back.
Be right back.

683
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:41,491
You are good.

684
00:54:51,927 --> 00:54:54,003
- Hi.
- Hi.

685
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,727
Are you all right?

686
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,052
I need you
to be okay with something.

687
00:55:02,146 --> 00:55:04,554
What? I'm okay with everything.

688
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,725
Deuce.

689
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:10,104
There may be things about me
that you don't like.

690
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:12,485
I like everything about you.

691
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:15,610
I mean, physically.

692
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:20,074
So you're taller than me.
Big deal. I'll get over it.

693
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:22,241
It's not that.

694
00:55:23,294 --> 00:55:25,203
What?

695
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:30,635
If you were to find out something
about me and my body that was...

696
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:35,215
maybe a little different than what you
were used to, would that be okay?

697
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:38,343
There could be nothing on your body
that I wouldn't like.

698
00:55:39,478 --> 00:55:42,763
What are you talkin' about?

699
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:45,691
What, you got, like, six toes
or something? I can live with that.

700
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:51,394
- Deuce, I have to tell you. I have a..
- Shh.

701
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:26,434
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

702
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:29,979
- I tried to tell you!
- No, it's my fault.

703
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:32,743
I shouldn't have
pulled it so hard.

704
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,985
If you wanna leave,
I completely understand.

705
00:56:35,078 --> 00:56:37,949
I don't wanna leave.
I'm sorry I had that reaction.

706
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,412
I just.. I got a lot of things
going on in my life recently...

707
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,743
and they all sort of culminated
when your leg fell off..

708
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:44,876
came off.. disconnected.. I..

709
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:47,538
-Just get out.
- Oh, my God!

710
00:56:47,634 --> 00:56:49,425
Please, leave!

711
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:55,887
Kate. I'm sorry.

712
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:58,052
Just go home.

713
00:56:58,145 --> 00:57:00,351
Don't I have a say in this?

714
00:57:00,439 --> 00:57:03,642
- Hand me my leg.
- Then will you come out and talk?

715
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,810
I don't know.

716
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,944
Are you sure you want to stay?

717
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:18,612
Yes, but only
If you come out of there.

718
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:23,290
I need to know how you feel
about all this.

719
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:27,005
The same as I did an hour ago...

720
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,970
when I thought to myself,
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world...

721
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:32,763
to be with her leg.."

722
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:34,343
with you.

723
00:58:01,963 --> 00:58:04,335
Ow.

724
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,123
Is this normal?
My face is numb.

725
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,339
It's perfectly normal
in hair replacement surgery.

726
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:14,432
The local anaesthetic has numbed
the major nerves in your face...

727
00:58:14,518 --> 00:58:16,594
just like at the dentist.

728
00:58:16,687 --> 00:58:19,095
Ow!

729
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:22,272
You're Kate's best friends, and...

730
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,025
I know your opinions
mean a lot to her, and...

731
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:28,818
I'd like to get
really serious with her.

732
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:31,695
- You're a prostitute!
- Not any more.

733
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:35,452
And it's "man-whore."
Anyway, I just quit.

734
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,533
- I mean, Kate's the one for me.
- Listen.

735
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:39,868
You were only supposed to go
out with her one night...

736
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:42,038
show her a good time, and then
get the hell out of her life.

737
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:45,085
- You know she's not normal.
- She's not like other girls.

738
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:48,212
You know what her problem is?
Friends like you.

739
00:58:48,304 --> 00:58:50,427
She's perfect. She's kind.

740
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:54,180
She's sweet, she's funny,
and she likes me.

741
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:56,345
Now, I came here
to give you your money back...

742
00:58:56,437 --> 00:59:00,186
the money you paid a stranger
to have sex with your friend.

743
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,774
Hey! You stay away
from her, man-whore!

744
00:59:05,906 --> 00:59:09,524
Hi ya, Deuce. Your three days
are up, lover boy.

745
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:11,611
So where's Antoine's black book?

746
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:13,780
- I've looked everywhere.
- Listen, punk.

747
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:16,198
You are aiding and abetting
a known criminal.

748
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,617
Do the initials T and J
mean anything to you?

749
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:21,119
Uh, turkey jizz?
I don't..

750
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:23,337
You better show some respect,
or I'm gonna rip that little...

751
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:25,916
pleasure-giving tongue of yours
right out of your head!

752
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,968
One more thing.

753
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,593
I was at the precinct,
and I really had to use the john...

754
00:59:30,682 --> 00:59:32,924
and it's pretty filthy in there,
and I was in kind of a hurry.

755
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:36,138
I didn't have enough time to use one
Of those, you know, paper ass gaskets.

756
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,139
Anyway, I was doin' my business,
and, uh...

757
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:40,024
something splashed up on me,
you know, all over?

758
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,810
What do you do in situations like that?
You think I'll be all right?

759
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:47,404
- I think you're pretty safe.
- I better be.

760
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,783
Ugly is not a problem
for this guy.

761
00:59:55,876 --> 00:59:57,999
My man would stick his dick
in a he-monkey.

762
00:59:58,087 --> 01:00:00,163
All right, holler at you later.

763
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,294
What up, Deucey?

764
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:08,180
You should know that cop
won't leave me alone.

765
01:00:09,182 --> 01:00:11,851
- What about the cop?
- He's been asking questions.

766
01:00:11,935 --> 01:00:13,310
Goddamn, white boy.

767
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:15,186
Anyway, it doesn't matter
to me any more.

768
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:18,107
- I'm quitting.
- What about Antoine's apartment?

769
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:21,149
I'm gonna get the rest of the money
the old-fashioned way.

770
01:00:21,236 --> 01:00:23,229
You gonna steal it?

771
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:27,191
See ya, T.J.

772
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:37,708
Uh, see, I just quit.
I'm never doing it again.

773
01:00:37,795 --> 01:00:40,334
- You lied to me!
- Listen, please.

774
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:44,753
- It's not what you think.
- You were paid to go out with me!

775
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:53,513
- You want breakfast?
- Kate!

776
01:00:53,604 --> 01:00:55,976
Just go away!

777
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:59,019
- I never want to see you again!
- Me neither.

778
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,480
I'm sorry.

779
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,702
I feel sad when you're sad

780
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:19,465
I feel glad when you're glad

781
01:01:19,548 --> 01:01:23,214
And if you only knew
what I'm goin' through

782
01:01:24,595 --> 01:01:29,174
I just can't smile
Without you

783
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:38,148
You came along
just like a song

784
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:40,560
And brightened my day

785
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:43,406
Who'd have believed
you were part of a dream

786
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:48,117
And now it all seems
light years away

787
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:53,828
And you know
I can't smile without you

788
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,670
I can't smile without you

789
01:01:56,755 --> 01:02:00,966
And I can't laugh
I can't sing

790
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,127
I'm findin' it hard
to do anything

791
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,640
I'm 1 ,500 short. Isn't there
anything else you can do?

792
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:13,226
Listen, I came all over the place..
down from six grand.

793
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,639
This is a custom hand job.

794
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,275
Let me pay you monthly.

795
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,480
The last time I didn't get the money
up front, I got the big stiffie.

796
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:25,190
Hello?

797
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:26,779
What the hell are you doing
picking up my phone?

798
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,495
I found the coral you wanted.

799
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,285
If you're doing anything I disapprove of
in my apartment, I will kill you.

800
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:34,209
Rip your veins out one by one!

801
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:37,254
Murder! I will kill you!

802
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:47,431
Hey, Antoine, it's Elaine.
I really need to see you again.

803
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:49,593
Same price, same place?

804
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,349
I'll have the money.

805
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:57,478
Hi. Um, this isn't Antoine...

806 01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:59,693
but, uh, maybe we
can work something out.

807
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:07,277
Hi.

808
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,470
I'm Deuce.

809
01:03:41,783 --> 01:03:43,942
- Stop.
- Why?

810
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:46,990
- You don't wanna have sex.
- Yes, I do.

811
01:03:48,248 --> 01:03:50,241
I think we both do.

812
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,953
Don't you find me attractive?

813
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:59,583
Are you kidding? You're one
Of the hottest women I've ever seen.

814
01:04:00,512 --> 01:04:02,303
Easy, easy.

815
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:05,140
I just can't do this.

816
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:07,348
I'm head over heels
for a girl, and...

817
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:10,520
we're goin' through a rough time,
me bein' a man-whore and all...

818
01:04:10,606 --> 01:04:13,358
but I know it's gonna work out,
because I love her.

819
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:17,604
She's a lucky girl.

820
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:20,775
At least emotionally.

821
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:25,367
- My guy used to be like that.
- Hey.

822
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:28,451
Hang in there.

823
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,703
Things have a way of working out.

824
01:04:38,302 --> 01:04:40,378
Hey, where you goin'?

825
01:04:43,182 --> 01:04:46,017
Well, I thought we talked
and you understood.

826
01:04:46,102 --> 01:04:50,729
I understand, but the fact is
I still paid for your services.

827
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:52,938 Well, what did you have in mind?

828
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:06,869
Baby, let's get together

829
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:09,793
Honey, hon, me and you

830
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,245
And do the things
Ah

831
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:16,044
Do the things

832
01:05:16,134 --> 01:05:18,376
That we like to do

833
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:22,388
Oh, do a little dance

834
01:05:22,474 --> 01:05:26,175
Make a little love
Get down tonight

835
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:27,550
Get down tonight

836
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:32,396
Do a little dance
Make a little love

837
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:35,190
Get down tonight

838
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,738
Get down tonight, baby

839
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:38,317
Oh, get down, get down

840
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:40,531
Get down, get down

841
01:05:40,618 --> 01:05:42,741
Get down tonight, baby

842
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:45,700
Woo, woo, woo, woo
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

843
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,910
Get down, get down,
get down, get down

844
01:06:08,773 --> 01:06:10,433
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, God, you were amazing.

845
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:12,233
Are you kidding?

846
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,981
I just had to see for myself.

847
01:06:28,503 --> 01:06:29,878
Kate!

848
01:06:29,962 --> 01:06:31,623
I'm not in love

849
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:35,915
I'm not in love

850
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:52,610
- What?
- How's Elaine?

851
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:54,439
You know, your wife.

852
01:06:56,407 --> 01:06:58,199
- Bastard!
- Oh!

853
01:06:58,284 --> 01:06:59,909
This wasn't about some black book.

854
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:02,402
Your wife was a customer
Of Antoine's, wasn't she?

855
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:05,664
That son of a bitch is goin' down,
and you're gonna join him!

856
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,246
How's that gonna fix your marriage?

857
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:17,003
Look, I lost someone
that I love too.

858
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:22,014
You know why she did this?

859
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:24,474
You wanna know why
she went outside our marriage?

860
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:27,514
It's because of my dick, man!

861
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:30,561
I mean, that's the reason.
It's my dick!

862
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,111
Look, take it easy.

863
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,696
You're saying your wife cheated on you
because your penis is too small?

864
01:07:36,784 --> 01:07:39,701
It's not too small!
It's too thin! Okay?

865
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:41,578
My dick is too thin!

866
01:07:41,664 --> 01:07:43,657
I got a thin dick!

867
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:47,119
Okay, can you keep it down?
I'd like to come back here someday.

868
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:51,459
Everybody knows that it's width,
width that gives sexual gratification.

869
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:54,337
I've read it.
Cosmo, Redbook, you name it.

870
01:07:54,428 --> 01:07:58,046
What am I supposed to do?
I got the thinnest penis in the world.

871
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,883
Here.
It's like a Twizzler.

872
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,968
- Look!
- No, no! Stop that!

873
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:05,430
Look, sit down! Sit!

874
01:08:05,523 --> 01:08:08,939
It's not your dick!
It's you!

875
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:11,778
I'm tellin' you now, if you painted it
silver and twisted it on the end...

876
01:08:11,863 --> 01:08:13,690
it'd look like a kickstand.

877
01:08:14,908 --> 01:08:17,114
If man-whoring
has taught me anything...

878
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:20,203
it's that most women are
as unhappy with their entire body...

879
01:08:20,288 --> 01:08:22,162
as you are
with your small penis.

880
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:24,455
- Thin penis.
- Well, whatever.

881
01:08:25,627 --> 01:08:27,252
While you're worried
about your penis...

882
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:28,500
Thin penis.

883
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:31,294
women are worried about their height...

884
01:08:31,384 --> 01:08:34,089
their weight,
their giant feet...

885
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:35,459
the stream of obscenities...

886
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:37,880
that could burst through their mouth
at any second.

887
01:08:37,974 --> 01:08:40,430
If you make a woman
feel good about herself...

888
01:08:40,518 --> 01:08:42,926
it really doesn't matter
what's wrong with you.

889
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:47,684
Even if it's really, really thin?

890
01:08:47,776 --> 01:08:49,769
We're talkin' spaghetti stick.

891
01:08:52,531 --> 01:08:54,323
Tell you what.

892
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:57,860
Every time you're feeling
self-conscious about your thin dick...

893
01:08:57,954 --> 01:09:01,952
say something nice
to make your woman feel sexy.

894
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:06,952
I mean, is that it?
Is that all there is?

895
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,414
There is one other thing.

896
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:14,045
Do a little dance

897
01:09:14,137 --> 01:09:16,047
Make a little love

898
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,049
Get down tonight

899
01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:20,348
Get down tonight

900
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:22,263
Do a little dance

901
01:09:22,355 --> 01:09:24,513
Make a little love

902
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,683
Get down tonight

903
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:27,939
Get down tonight

904
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:29,522
Uh, yes, sir.

905
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:34,023
Um, you're sure there isn't
anything you can do?

906
01:09:36,703 --> 01:09:38,162
Yes, sir. I understand.

907
01:09:46,088 --> 01:09:49,671
Listen. I really appreciate
you helping me.

908
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:52,878
I guess I misjudged you.

909
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:55,923
Anyway, I got you off the hook.

910
01:09:57,225 --> 01:10:00,677
- Why am I still worried?
- You gotta give 'em T.J.

911
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:02,479
I can't do that.

912
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:05,814
You got no choice. I been workin' on this case for three months.

913
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,436
-Boss says somebody's gotta be arrested.
-But T.J.'s my friend.

914
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,072
They're serious, Deuce.

915
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:15,743
Look, I don't like it,
but it's either you or him.

916
01:10:19,457 --> 01:10:20,999
Your Honour...

917
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:24,749
sex for money
is morally reprehensible.

918
01:10:24,838 --> 01:10:30,462
Mr Bigalow has compounded this crime
by refusing to name his he-pimp.

919
01:10:30,552 --> 01:10:33,257
Therefore we ask
for the maximum term for each...

920
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:36,218
of the five counts
of prostitution.

921
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:00,291
Excuse me.

922
01:11:15,267 --> 01:11:17,840
We never had sex.

923
01:11:17,936 --> 01:11:20,143
We talked about it.

924
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,472
Well, I talked about it.

925
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:25,401
But Deuce
never took advantage of me.

926
01:11:25,486 --> 01:11:29,187
She should have,
but he's my friend.

927
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:32,566
He made me realize
that I wasn't just some...

928
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,949
hot babe with huge tits...

929
01:11:35,038 --> 01:11:37,908
even though I am.

930
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:41,084
Oh, and he also
got me walkin' again.

931
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,169
Deuce and I never had sex.

932
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:52,967
- It was physically impossible.
- Freak!

933
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:56,635
It's true I paid him money
to be with him...

934
01:11:56,727 --> 01:12:01,224
and I'd do it again, because he
made me feel good about myself.

935
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,774
Behemoth.

936
01:12:05,111 --> 01:12:08,445
And no one
ever touched my feet before.

937
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,275
That's a huge bitch!

938
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,569
Deuce taught me to be comfortable
with who I am.

939
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,662
Thank you, Deuce.

940
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,161
You asshole!

941
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,208
These are very serious charges,
Mr Bigalow.

942
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,376
I just have one question to ask you.

943
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:29,627
During your entire stint
as a he-whore...

944
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,299
did you have sex with anyone?

945
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:34,965
Yes, Your Honour.

946
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:39,188
Just one woman.

947
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:44,436
- And I'm in love with her.
- Order.

948
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:48,109
Order, please.

949
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:50,571
This is very important,
Mr Bigalow.

950
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,032
Did she pay you for sex?

951
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:58,496
No.

952
01:12:59,211 --> 01:13:00,373
Case dismissed.

953
01:13:03,715 --> 01:13:05,542
Yes!

954
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:20,229
These shots will deaden
the nerve area...

955
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:22,475
where your hair transplants will be.

956
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:26,813
There. That should do it.

957
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:30,241
Nurse, would you please remove
our donor hair?

958
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,403
I'll be back in a minute.

959
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:47,925
Mr Johnson, please just lie
back down now.

960
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:50,171
Oh, my God! Deuce!

961
01:13:50,265 --> 01:13:53,551
- Kate, listen to me.
- What are you doing here?

962
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,854
It's the only way
I could get you to see me.

963
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:00,396
Deuce, it's over between us.

964
01:14:03,196 --> 01:14:04,856
Listen.

965
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:09,195
Those shots hurt like hell.
Could you at least hear me out?

966
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:11,444
Well, I don't know how much
you charge by the hour...

967
01:14:11,538 --> 01:14:13,080
but you have one minute.

968
01:14:13,165 --> 01:14:15,952
Okay. I deserved that.

969
01:14:18,962 --> 01:14:22,129
I should have told you
right from the start...

970
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:23,544
but I was afraid.

971
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,254
Afraid of what?

972
01:14:26,345 --> 01:14:29,797
Afraid that a girl
as wonderful as you...

973
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,808
could never fall for a guy
who cleans fish tanks.

974
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:36,850
'Cause that's who I really am.

975
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,641
This whole gigolo thing
was just a mistake...

976
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:43,108
but I'm glad it happened.

977
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:46,149
'Cause I never would have met you.

978
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:49,906
I never would have known
what love was.

979
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,360
I'm sorry.

980
01:14:52,456 --> 01:14:54,698
I'm not perfect.

981
01:14:58,338 --> 01:15:00,876
I'm not perfect either.

982
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:04,793
Yes, you are.

983
01:15:04,886 --> 01:15:07,009
You're perfect in every way.

984
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,465
I knew it the moment I met you.

985
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:18,309
Kate...

986
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:23,440
"You have a smile
that could melt an iceberg.

987
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:27,944
Your lips are as sweet as honey.

988
01:15:28,036 --> 01:15:30,990
You may only have one leg...

989
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:33,833
but it's the most beautiful leg
in the world."

990
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,380
Are you kissing me?
'Cause I can't feel a thing.

991
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:48,721
...now boarding at gate 53.

992
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,012
Flight 1 4 to Sydney, Australia,
is now boarding at gate..

993
01:15:52,103 --> 01:15:54,345
I've never done this
in 1 2 hours before...

994
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:57,013
and I'm not responsible
if the seals leak, Deuce.

995
01:15:58,735 --> 01:16:01,143
Shit! Shit cabinet!

996
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,741
Come on, Deucey.
Put the fish in the tank already.

997
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,040
Antoine's plane
landed 20 minutes ago.

998
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,626
I think we're gonna be okay.

999
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:23,044
Could you step
this way, please?

1000
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:28,012
Is it time to put
the big guy in yet?

1001
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:32,100
Give him another minute.
Temperature's not right.

1002
01:16:41,281 --> 01:16:43,902
Spread them again, please.

1003
01:16:47,454 --> 01:16:49,447
Okay, we can put
the last fish in.

1004
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:52,743
- Looks like we pulled it off, kid.
- Time for some tequila!

1005
01:17:00,092 --> 01:17:01,670
Margaritas, anybody?

1006
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:23,693
I need...

1007
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:26,988
Chinese tail bar lionfish.

1008
01:17:29,332 --> 01:17:31,574
- Seven hundred, eight hundred.
- Where'd you get all that money?

1009
01:17:31,668 --> 01:17:35,713
- Friends.
- Yeah, right. Anything else?

1010
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,708
On second thought, you'd better
give me some of those sea snails.

1011
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,035
So, uh, how was your trip?

1012
01:18:13,295 --> 01:18:15,169
Very good...

1013
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:17,249
till about three hours ago.

1014
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:19,714
Yeah? What happened?

1015
01:18:19,802 --> 01:18:21,925
I don't want to talk about it.

1016
01:18:25,392 --> 01:18:27,384
The place looks good.

1017
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,764
Good to be home.

1018
01:18:30,856 --> 01:18:32,516
I should take off
so you can relax.

1019
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,731
There's something
you're not telling me?

1020
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,778
Yeah. I put your mail
on the nightstand.

1021
01:18:46,497 --> 01:18:47,956
Right.

1022
01:18:52,754 --> 01:18:54,213
What the hell is this?

1023
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,670
A chocolate margarita.

1024
01:18:56,758 --> 01:19:00,210
- You've been having a party?
- It was, uh, more like, uh...

1025
01:19:00,304 --> 01:19:02,178
a "welcome home" thing, really.

1026
01:19:05,017 --> 01:19:07,093
I guess I could really
use one right now.

1027
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:19,072
Spicy.

1028
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:23,615
- I should probably go.
- My fish.

1029
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:27,613
They look smaller.

1030
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:33,084
Sometimes
when they're, uh, sick...

1031
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,333
they'll shrink.

1032
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,047
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1033
01:19:40,138 --> 01:19:43,887
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishy, fishy.

1034
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:45,802
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1035
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:10,242
I did man-whore for a little bit,
but none of your clients.

1036
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:12,413
None of them.

1037
01:20:12,506 --> 01:20:15,377
I know an aquarium guy
who can fix all of this.

1038
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:17,840
- He's a little expensive..
- Ha!

1039
01:20:17,928 --> 01:20:19,886
Deuce!

1040
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:27,595
No!

1041
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,584
- Deuce!
- No!

1042
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:20,404
Hey! Tough guy.
What do you think of this?

1043
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,406
You're busted.

1044
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,245
What's goin' on out here?

1045
01:21:28,837 --> 01:21:31,044
I can see!

1046
01:21:33,551 --> 01:21:36,967
You're black.
I knew it.

1047
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:51,520
Love

1048
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:53,688
Is what I want

1049
01:21:54,948 --> 01:21:56,858
Oh, yeah

1050
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:03,243
And all you gotta do
is bring it to me, baby

1051
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,040
Talk

1052
01:22:11,132 --> 01:22:13,374
Is what I want

1053
01:22:13,468 --> 01:22:15,627
- What I want
- Oh, yeah

1054
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,919
What I want

1055
01:22:18,682 --> 01:22:22,597
And all you gotta do
is bring it to me, baby

1056
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,564
- Talk
- Come on, let's talk about it

1057
01:22:29,652 --> 01:22:32,108
- Talk
- Can't seem to do without it

1058
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:34,403
- Talk
- Don't wanna be one of the

1059
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:39,200
Broken-hearted

1060
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,529
So lift me up

1061
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,328

Rivers deep and wide

01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,600
Lift me up
