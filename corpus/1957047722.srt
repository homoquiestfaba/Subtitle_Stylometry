<i>"Its conquest deserves

16
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,663
<i>Pandemonium has swept across

17
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,764
<i>that an asteroid has collided
with the moon,</i>

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,634
<i>knocking it on a

19
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:28,837
<i>Emergency lockdowns are
being imposed in major cities</i>

20
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,640
<i>as law enforcement struggles

22
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,845
<i>Many countries have reported
power grid disruptions,</i>

23
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,015
<i>major earthquakes and
tidal flooding</i>

24

<i>along coastal cities

<i>Increased theological activity

<i>The moon is expected

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,034

00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,646
Hey, Jim...

36
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:12,181
<i>Our field reporters are
already starting to...</i>

37
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,849
Is this thing for real?

<i>NATO and cooperating

<i>[cellphone rings]</i>

42
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,226
This is Captain Lawson.

43
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>Paul's coming to airlift you
to the XVision Spaceport</i>

44
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,363
<i>in Nevada to stop this thing.</i>

45
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,500
You are recommissioned
to fly with

46
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,871
the XVision space fleet
effective immediately.

47
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,273
Well, tell Global Defense
we face total annihilation

48
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,940
in less than two hours.

49
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,944
NASA's initial projection of
the mission window is 3.5.

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,947
No, Colonel, this isn't
some meteor in Tunguska.

51
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:46,648
The sheer scale of
this will wreak havoc

52
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,651
before it even strikes.

53
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:51,285
Gravitational fluctuations,
earthquakes,

54
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,488
volcanic eruptions,
E.M.P.s

55
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,825
all around the world.

56
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,726
And if the moon
reaches our atmosphere,

57
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,194
friction will
super-heat the air

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,996
and incinerate everything
on earth.

59
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,532
<i>You get to XVision ASAP.</i>

60
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,335
Paul's responsibility is
to brief you on the rest.

61
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:10,473
Hey, Jumbo.
Good to see 'ya.

62
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,974
Come on, we gotta go.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,408
Hey, who's that?

64
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,976
My brother.

65
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,015
Come on.

66
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,216
[rumbling]

67
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,450
Whoa, whoa!

68
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:22,984
Was that because of the moon?

69
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,621
No. Gravity disruptions are
causing the earthquakes.

70
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,657
Come on, Bob.
We'll get you to the base.

71
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,194
My tab for the last two weeks.

72
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,429
[rumbling]

73
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,198
Oh!

74
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:37,666
[shouts]

75
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,136
We gotta help him.

76
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:43,639
No!

77
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:44,907
- Help me get him outa here!
- There's no time.

78
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,475
[moans]

79
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,142
Bobby, I'm gonna
get you outta here!

80
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,378
All right, grab my hand.

81
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:51,112
Come on?
I gotta pull you now!

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,049
[shouts]

83
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,618
Come on!

84
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,724
- [grunting]
- Come on, Bob.

85
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,634
Soak the gauze in antiseptic.

86
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,637
Oh, Jim, it hurts...

87
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:17,640
Hang in there, Bobby.

88
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:18,974
Look, Jim, I hate to say it,

89
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,108
but you were right
about everything.

90
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:21,309
I mean, everything.

91
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,977
The size of the asteroid,

92
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,479
when it would actually
strike the moon.

93
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:25,815
You called all of it.

94
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,085
- Keep feeding it to me.
- Okay.

95
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:34,223
Look, I might not get another
chance at this to apologize.

96
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,325
Jim, it wasn't your fault,
your co-pilot's death.

97
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,327
Look, we don't have time
for ancient history right now.

98
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:41,664
It's not ancient history, Jim.
It's only been a year.

99
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,599
And, look, if I had a
time machine, I would go back

100
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,267
and I would...

101
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,871
I should have listened
to your report, okay?

102
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,673
Jim, it wasn't you that
crashed your lander.

103
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,608
It was gravity from
a distant asteroid.

104
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:53,842
- We know...
- Just knock it off!

105
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,678
Look, I'm trying
to apologize here!

106
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:57,813
Like when you reported
that it was a year away

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,649
from striking the moon,

108
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:02,851
I should've never
had you discharged, okay?

109
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,953
It's my fault.

110
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,756
[alarm sounds]

111
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,159
God.

112
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,628
[sighs]

113
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,296
Hey, hey, hey, stay with me.

114
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,464
Yeah, I don't do blood.

115
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,700
Is Mom safe?

116
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,201
How are your wife and kids?

117
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,268
Yeah, Mom's safe.

118
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:25,140
I had our office in D.C.
take Mom down to the Pentagon.

119
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,609
Juni and the kids are there too.

120
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,377
I didn't have the heart
to tell them that,

121
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:31,546
if we can't stop this thing, it
doesn't matter where they are.

122
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,750
But, uh... Stacey's safe too.

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,823
Yeah, her new boyfriend took her
down to the Camp Pendleton Base.

124
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,960
Good.
Hand me the tape.

125
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,365
All right, we've got
about 15 minutes

126
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,765
before we reach the base.

127
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,104
Admiral Keller, this is Colonel
Hauser, Pentagon Command.

128
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,207
It's my understanding that
Paul is currently en route

129
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,909
with Jim Lawson
and you are keeping tabs

130
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,479
on their progress, correct?

131
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,046
That is correct.

132
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,015
We are currently tracking
them via satellite and have

133
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:09,116
an ETA of approximately
15 minutes.

134
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,986
Good. As you liaison
to the D.O.D.,

135
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,854
I've given you a lot of latitude
in developing your program,

136
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,192
but today I am assuming full
command of your department,

137
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,660
do you understand?

138
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,327
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,296
<i>As of now, our databases
are synced so that we</i>

140
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,198
<i>are both tracking
Lawson's progress</i>

141
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,434
<i>and the path of the Moon
in real time.</i>

142
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,804
<i>Communication interruptions
are inevitable.</i>

143
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,206
<i>We will
attempt to cover setbacks</i>

144
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,073
<i>relative to Operation
Godfather.</i>

145
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,311
<i>All pilots are standing by
on threat level Delta.</i>

146
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,082
Am I gonna be okay, Jim?

147
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,218
Well, I stopped
most of the bleeding.

148
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,152
Look, we have one hour
and 42 minutes

149
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,689
'til the moon reaches
the atmosphere.

150
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,958
Well, Hauser recommissioned me.

151
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,695
So you obviously need me to do
something your team can't do.

152
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:56,198
As hard as it is for me
to admit, yeah, we do.

153
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:59,267
As soon as you were discharged,
NASA and JPL still insisted

154
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,436
on using your antimatter engine
design for our drone fleet.

155
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,005
Now, given your reputation

156
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:07,508
Hauser was reluctant,
but NASA pushed her.

157
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,078
30 minutes before I saw you,
Hauser ordered us to launch

158
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,647
a drone fleet into orbit
to try and stop the moon.

159
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,715
So you're using
antimatter engines as bombs?

160
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:15,717
It's not gonna work.

161
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,152
No, not bombs, Jim.

162
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,755
NASA, the DOD, the entire
world is scraping

163
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,323
the bottom of the barrel
to try and stop the moon.

164
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,859
I mean, nukes won't stop it,

165
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:25,893
an exploding antimatter
engine won't stop it.

166
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,629
Where are we going, Jim?

167
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,799
I just need to know
so I can tell

168
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,433
some friends and some family.

169
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,537
Look, you're going to a
base called XVision.

170
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,636
You'll be safe there.

171
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:38,472
Yeah, I know what XVision is.

172
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,242
What I don't know is how are
you planning to stop this thing?

173
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:42,410
Look, I saw the news.

174
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:43,410
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

175
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:44,779
No.

176
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,080
Look, you'll be safe
at the base, okay?

177
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,515
And we do have a way
to stop the moon.

178
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:48,683
How are you gonna
stop the moon?

179
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,285
That's not even possible.

180
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,352
[gasps]

181
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,755
It is possible.

182
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,088
We have a spacecraft
with an engine on it

183
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,823
with special fuel
called "antimatter".

184
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,625
We're talking to
the military right now

185
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:00,096
on how to turn it on and start
a reaction to stop the moon.

186
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,332
He's talking about
a huge nuclear bomb!

187
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,734
No. I'm not talking about
a huge nuclear bomb.

188
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,602
All right, let me dumb
this down to you, Bob.

189
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:09,904
Imagine a racetrack, okay?

190
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,606
But, instead,
it's a closed tube.

191
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,842
And the atoms are cars running
in the opposite directions.

192
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,411
Now when they crash
into each other,

193
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:16,944
they explode and release energy.

194
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,948
Now that energy...
Bob, pay attention, please...

195
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,017
now that energy creates a thrust
kind of like a jet engine.

196
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,520
Now there's these little things
in the space called "neutrinos"

197
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,723
that are floating around
that will trigger the reaction.

198
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,023
They're gonna be acting
like the springs

199
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,825
that launch the cars
around the track.

200
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:32,894
And Hauser remembered what
you said a year ago,

201
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:34,730
that if somebody
deliberately destroys

202
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,398
the engine's cadmium
regulator...

203
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:39,769
A bombardment of neutrinos will
run the reaction out of control.

204
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,970
That's it.

205
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,938
So you're gonna
overload an engine,

206
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,408
create a black hole and
pull the moon back into orbit.

207
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:47,409
That's the plan.

208
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:49,177
Hold on.

209
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:52,080
A black hole, that's gonna
destroy everything, won't it?

210
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,082
No, Bob, it's not gonna
destroy everything.

211
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,318
There's places on earth
like the one in Switzerland

212
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,287
where they have the large Hadron
Collider.

213
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:01,690
They split atoms every single
day to create many black holes.

214
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,394
This is not good.

215
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,796
Look, just calm down.
Calm down, Bob!

216
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,263
If you keep exerting yourself,

217
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,133
you're gonna make
your injuries even worse.

218
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,433
Calm down?

219
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,836
This is all your fault!
Jim told me all about it!

220
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:18,373
Bob, look, relax!

221
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,074
Even if they had more time,
they know this is

222
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,409
just strategic suicide.

223
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,178
Yeah, it was dead last
on their list.

224
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,147
But they have no other
choice and no time, Jim.

225
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,151
Admiral Keller, we have a visual
on some of the drone's damage.

226
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:32,220
Are we certain that the
antimatter engine

227
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,121
affixed to the top of the
drone is still functional?

228
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:36,690
Affirmative, the antimatter
engine is functional

229
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:38,092
but it is programmed
to conserve power

230
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,528
and send a distress signal
if the drone

231
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:40,596
becomes terminally damaged.

232
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,129
And Paul Lawson's plan...

233
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:43,664
I have a room full of trigger
happy Joint Chiefs

234
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:46,434
still doubtful of
our proposed fix.

235
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,036
A nuclear strike will
not stop the Moon.

236
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:51,372
Clearing the lunar asteroids
with conventional missiles

237
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,908
and using the antimatter drive
to create a Black Hole

238
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,877
is the only way forward.

239
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,578
Okay, but if you don't
launch before an E.M.P

240
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,147
or magnetic pole reversal,
your missiles will be disabled.

241
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,318
The mission rides on you,
Admiral.

242
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,154
Five minutes after launch,

243
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:09,124
the meteor's destroyed all
the drones except for one.

244
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,226
Now it's dead in space on the
edge of the moon's far side.

245
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,861
But its antimatter engine
is sending

246
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:15,164
a distress signal right now.

247
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,566
They need someone
who'll reactivate it.

248
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:20,267
No, they need you
to reactivate it.

249
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:22,103
Our engineers are somewhat
familiar with it

250
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,073
and they could do basic
diagnostic tests and controls.

251
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,875
But you're the expert
on how it's built.

252
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,211
Jim, you're the only one
that can guarantee

253
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,082
that the reaction will
run out of control.

254
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,720
We're already encountering
E.M. disruptions.

255
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:42,123
They're only going to intensify.

256
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,625
So I'm sure the Pentagon's
planning a strike?

257
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,327
Yeah.

258
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,297
Hauser's coordinating a global
conventional weapon strike

259
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,065
into a lunar debris field
to clear a path for you

260
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:52,433
to reach the stalled drone.

261
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,901
And XVision will provide
a space fleet

262
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,637
leading you right into orbit.

263
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:57,772
But as the moon gets closer,
it's gonna reverse

264
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,108
the earth's magnetic pulse,

265
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,708
detonating the
missiles prematurely.

266
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,879
Okay, we have to ensure that
my launch precedes that

267
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,380
so we don't
compromise the mission.

268
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:06,881
It's not my first rodeo.

269
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,817
We've timed it so by the time
you get in your spacecraft,

270
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,417
the missiles will launch.

271
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:12,321
By the time you get to orbit,
they will dissipate,

272
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,690
leaving you a clear path
right to the stalled drone.

273
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:16,491
All right. Make sure Hauser
uses the Pentagon's

274
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,861
Colossus satellite dish
to maintain communications.

275
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,929
They'll cut through most
of the magnetic noise.

276
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,931
Colossus satellite dish
will already

277
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,868
be aligned to your jet path.

278
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:26,868
I got it.

279
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,002
All right.

280
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,570
One more thing.

281
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,807
Under no circumstances,
can Global Defense

282
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,409
change your mind
about a nuclear option.

283
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,845
A nuke and its gamma rays
will fry me and the spacecraft

284
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,279
and the mission ends.

285
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:42,250
Well, Hauser stopped all
that talk... for now.

286
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:43,619
Although China and
Russia are considering

287
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:44,685
a nuclear strike regardless.

288
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,087
[sighs]
Of course.

289
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,088
Yeah, it's the Russians.
What do you expect?

290
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:51,492
If it wasn't for XVision
and NASA's global reputation,

291
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,395
hell, they might not
have held off at all.

292
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,395
[rumbling]

293
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:55,463
Hold on!

294
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,332
We're about 30 miles out
from base.

295
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,501
That power surge
blew the circuit.

296
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:01,502
It damaged the propeller.

297
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:02,803
Damn!

298
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,573
You ever flown these
things before?

299
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,674
It's just basic aeronautics.

300
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,109
Roll, pitch, yaw.

301
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:10,177
All right.
The rotor's running 19,000 rpm.

302
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,548
Well, we have to equalize it.

303
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,583
- Where's the main circuit?
- It's right here.

304
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,820
The drone's default is
arc flight at 260 knots.

305
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:21,423
We're not flying coast to coast.

306
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:24,093
We don't need to account
for the earth's curvature.

307
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,629
There.

308
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,765
All right, I turned off the arc.

309
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,568
That stopped an rpm increase
to the other three rotors.

310
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,804
Now they can match the damaged
rotor without damaging our ETA.

311
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,506
Good.

312
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,675
You know, you place way too much
blind faith in these machines.

313
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:43,312
Yeah, well, I guess it could be
another thing we disagree on.

314
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,147
- Lawson to Base!
- [static]

315
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,750
Repeat, Lawson to Ba...

316
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:49,985
Lawson to Base!

317
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,055
Repeat! Damn it!

318
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,155
The E.M.P.s are already
getting our satellites.

319
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,157
Or they could have been
struck by lunar asteroids.

320
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:58,994
Yeah, that could be it.

321
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,564
[explosion]

322
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,065
No! No!

323
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,867
[alarm sounds]

324
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,502
Oh, God!

325
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:09,570
Jim!

326
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:14,742
Lawson to Base, come in!

327
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,844
Lawson to Base, do you hear me?

328
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,513
Lawson to Base!

329
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,460
[grunts]

330
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:38,499
Oh, sh...

331
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,403
Paul, you okay?

332
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,972
Ah! Ah!

333
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,774
Buckle up, we're going down!

334
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,342
Oh, Jim!

335
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,510
Jim!

336
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,650
[explosion]

337
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,433
Let's stop here.

338
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,310
This is Private
First Class Malcolm

339
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:25,178
requesting emergency evac.
Over.

340
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,914
<i>This is Squadron 229.</i>

341
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:30,351
<i>We have a report of major
damage to Camp Pendleton.</i>

342
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,520
Camp Pendleton was just
destroyed in a major earthquake.

343
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:36,323
Requesting emergency evac
to the nearest bunker.

344
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,626
<i>Evac denied, we are under
strict orders</i>

345
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,562
<i>to only address the
most dire threats.</i>

346
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,598
<i>We're also getting reports
the earthquake triggered</i>

347
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,433
<i>a massive tsunami.
You will need to get</i>

348
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,101
<i>to high ground immediately.</i>

349
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,135
229, we are en route
to a communications hub

350
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:50,637
to maintain
the southwest network.

351
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,707
<i>I understand, private,
but all units</i>

352
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,308
<i>are for essential support only.</i>

353
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,343
<i>Unless you're directly
supporting the Pentagon,</i>

354
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,946
<i>we cannot evac. Copy?</i>

355
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:01,917
This is communications support
for the entire region.

356
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,483
<i>Denied, private.</i>

357
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,786
<i>We have direct orders from DOD
that all assets</i>

358
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,723
<i>are dedicated
to the larger threat.</i>

359
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:13,661
Hey, tell them you're traveling
with Stacey Lawson.

360
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:15,296
I'm Jim Lawson's wife.

361
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:18,999
He's the astronaut they
recruited for their mission.

362
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:22,137
229, I have Stacey Lawson
accompanying me.

363
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,505
She is astronaut
Jim Lawson's wife

364
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:28,176
and Jim Lawson
is mission critical.

365
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,743
<i>Denied, Private Ninan.</i>

366
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,812
<i>Command says she's not
mission critical.</i>

367
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,215
<i>I'm sorry, there are
no available units</i>

368
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,517
<i>for a one-off rescue.</i>

369
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,519
Are you really
Jim Lawson's wife?

370
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,721
I am...

371
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,324
Or was.

372
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,060
We separated.

373
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:47,961
[sighs]
Well...

374
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,731
They have
a communications dish

375
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,202
outside the Pentagon
called Colossus.

376
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,671
It's huge.
It transmits deep into space.

377
00:15:56,737 --> 00:16:00,775
But with the fragments of the
moon deflecting the signal,

378
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:03,178
they'll need us
to reroute all the hubs

379
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:08,049
across the country to boost
their signal, including ours.

380
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,351
That's what this is for.

381
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:13,154
It'll convert
our regional signal

382
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,856
into something they can use.

383
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,696
You ready to keep running?

384
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:24,332
Absolutely.

385
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:36,211
[sighs]

386
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm sorry.

387
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,258
All right.

388
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:52,359
So base still has our
approximate location.

389
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,029
As soon as they see
a distress signal,

390
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,498
they send us
a rescue unit, so...

391
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,998
Thermal imaging
should still be able

392
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,534
to pick us up on the ground.

393
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,402
But they're gonna need
a clear place to land.

394
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,603
Let's get out in the open.

395
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,238
- Let's go.
- Come on.

396
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,877
There goes our rescue detail.

397
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,413
The EM disturbances
must be getting worse.

398
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:14,615
- They look like our UMVs.
- Glad no-one was on board.

399
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:16,584
Man, if we don't get you
airborne soon, we're done.

400
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,285
Yeah. If we don't get
a missile strike,

401
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,221
our chances of success
are cut in half. Come on.

402
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,623
Come on what?

403
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,391
Base has got to be
about five miles away.

404
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,894
I think we're about a mile
from George's mechanic.

405
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,996
George's mecha... what?
Dad's Air Force buddy?

406
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:31,832
Yeah, the guy who fixes your
base's cars for a handshake.

407
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,601
That was some
sweet deal you made.

408
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,036
We can use his phone,
grab one of his cars.

409
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:38,407
Let's go.

410
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:40,209
[sighs]
I hate running.

411
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,882
- Hey.
- God...

412
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:49,217
What are you doing?

413
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,018
- What?
- What is that?

414
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,319
I don't like hair in my face.

415
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,188
You carry that thing with you?

416
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,323
- Yeah.
- It's very fashionable.

417
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,127
Oh, sweet boots.
You get 'em at Costco?

418
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,395
I hope it makes you run faster.

419
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,697
Come on, Sally!

420
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:05,567
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!

421
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,568
Oh...
Oh, I felt all that.

422
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,771
How long did that take us?

423
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,772
What?

424
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,674
How long did it take us?

425
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,242
Six minutes.
That's not even that bad.

426
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,244
Let's keep going.

427
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,379
Let's go. Come on.

428
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,312
- [gun cocks]
- Whoa, whoa!

429
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,082
You're not running.

430
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,083
You're emptying your wallets,
giving your money to J.J. here.

431
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,450
And then you're
getting zip-tied.

432
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:24,552
Look, we don't have
any time for this.

433
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:25,753
- Okay, we got...
- [grunts]

434
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,222
- Hey!
- All right, all right.

435
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:28,589
All right.

436
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,727
The only way you two clowns
are out this far

437
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,496
is if you're working for
that Air Force Base.

438
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:37,564
You know, we got your
little alert back in town.

439
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,566
And we know you're lying
about the end of the world.

440
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,201
You got us, okay?
We work for the air force...

441
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:44,005
Move, and I will blow your
brains all over this ravine!

442
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,306
I knew your private military
was out here

443
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,242
trying to take over
this whole region.

444
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,477
I read about it
online for years now.

445
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,380
We don't know anything
about that, okay?

446
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,880
We're just trying to get
to the base to fix it.

447
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,283
Hands up!
Hands up!

448
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,284
We're just trying to get
to get to the base

449
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,986
to fix it, all right?

450
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,286
Wait a second...

451
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,787
[laughs]

452
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,056
Hey, Annie.
Look who it is.

453
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,959
It's that CEO.

454
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,264
That's him.

455
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,698
Look, we don't want any trouble.

456
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:13,000
Put your wallet on the ground!
Both of you!

457
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,000
All right, all right, all right.

458
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,602
Now!

459
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,906
Guys like you, Elon Musk,
Mark Zuckerberg,

460
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,608
pigs feeding off society,
crushing our brains.

461
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:23,544
You had your time lying to us,

462
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,514
lying about taking
expeditions to the moon.

463
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,948
Yeah, we've been
watching you, too.

464
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,951
We know you been keeping tabs on
every citizen in this country.

465
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,621
[chuckles]

466
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,389
So why don't you tell me?

467
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,091
How does it feel, Paul Lawson?

468
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:40,861
J.J., I knew we would
find private military

469
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,163
out here patrolling.

470
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:46,066
Now's the time.
Take a video.

471
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,102
The revolution starts here.

472
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,871
Guys, we are
a spacecraft company, okay?

473
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,440
There really is a threat to the
United States, the whole world!

474
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:54,708
He's lying, J.J.

475
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:55,909
Good thing I'm recording this.

476
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:57,711
Oh, oh, wait!
Don't kill us!

477
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,480
Paul, the bullies when
you were eight, you remember?

478
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,114
- You two shut up!
- Shut up!

479
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,784
Hey!

480
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,153
Wait, wait, wait!

481
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:06,554
What?

482
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,293
How does that work?

483
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,860
I don't know,
you yell loud enough,

484
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,495
they think you gonna
tell 'em something important.

485
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:15,996
Worked when you were
eight, worked now.

486
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,631
[laughs]

487
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,134
Lose that ridiculous
beanie, will you?

488
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,871
Keeps my hair outta my face.

489
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,639
This shop is just through
this clearing.

490
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:26,541
We're kind of in the middle
of nowhere.

491
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,444
[rumbling, creaking]

492
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,815
Oh, ho!

493
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,784
There's George's shop!
Keep going!

494
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:38,018
God damn!

495
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:43,257
George!

496
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:45,860
Hey, George!

497
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,262
Get us a car.
I'll call the base.

498
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:49,464
George!

499
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:51,332
Hey! George!

500
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,834
Hey, it's Jimmy Lawson!

501
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:54,634
Got anything?

502
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,102
Yeah, it's working.

503
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,907
We gotta be close to
an hour ETA for impact.

504
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:01,443
Hour and 16 minutes 'til
it reaches the mesosphere.

505
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,544
Exhibition... this
is Operation Godfather.

506
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,345
Get me the Command Center.

507
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,314
Lawson, Admiral Keller here.
We lost you on radar.

508
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,883
I'm on the line with Colonel
Hauser at the Pentagon.

509
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,685
Jim and I need a rescue ASAP.

510
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:15,289
We lost your GPS on our
Colossus Dish minutes ago.

511
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,957
<i>Keller, get Lawson to base</i>

512
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,294
<i>before these electromagnetic
pulses get worse.</i>

513
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,962
We sent out rescue helicopters,

514
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,330
but their guidance systems
went out of control and crashed.

515
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:24,765
We sent out two more.

516
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,200
Both those transports
have since crashed.

517
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,736
Have your flight captain
take the XVision fleet

518
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,371
to your underground bunker
to shield them

519
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,239
from the electromagnetic pulses.

520
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:33,807
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,108
<i>Is the antimatter engine
on the stranded drone</i>

522
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,110
<i>still sending a signal?</i>

523
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:37,178
Affirmative.

524
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:38,880
What's the mission status?

525
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,380
<i>I have word from the president
and the Joint Chiefs</i>

526
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,417
that China and Russia
are synchronized

527
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,419
to launch their nuclear payload.

528
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:45,853
<i>Once they detonate,</i>

529
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,721
Jim will have a safe path
to reach the drone.

530
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,056
Jim and I are headed
to the base ASAP.

531
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:50,691
<i>We gotta get Jim
here now, Paul.</i>

532
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:52,360
Threat Response
reported electrical damage

533
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:53,895
to our Colossus Dish.

534
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:56,096
<i>The longer we delay,
the less chance we have</i>

535
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:58,231
<i>to assist if our
guidance system fails.</i>

536
00:21:58,298 --> 00:21:59,299
I understand.

537
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,769
Hey, George!

538
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:03,371
You here?

539
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,973
Hey, George?

540
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:07,375
Come on, George.

541
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,144
And NASA's reporting such
a dense lunar asteroid field

542
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,578
that the pathway will
close roughly

543
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,313
one minute after the strike.

544
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,416
<i>So Jim has to follow directly
behind the strike zone</i>

545
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:18,220
<i>to avoid destroying
the antimatter engine.</i>

546
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,955
[rumbling]

547
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,063
Oh!

548
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,765
[Jim shouts]

549
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,700
Paul?

550
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,201
Paul, are you there?

551
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:36,871
Come in, Paul!

552
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,073
I'm here.

553
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,140
<i>These earthquakes
are getting worse.</i>

554
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,042
Get here now while
you still can!

555
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:43,945
Jim and I are headed
to the road ASAP.

556
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,648
<i>Once we get on the road,
I need all defensive personnel</i>

557
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,448
to maintain communication
on an open channel.

558
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,215
I have zero
digital communication,

559
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:51,451
repeat, zero digital
communication.

560
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,686
I need live updates.

561
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,155
Copy that.
You will have them.

562
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,061
Paul!

563
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:03,130
George!

564
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,178
[grunts]

565
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:25,820
Jimmy? Is that you?

566
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,421
Pull yourself out when I lift!

567
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:28,688
Now!

568
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:31,258
- [grunts]
- Come on!

569
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:32,593
Jimmy!

570
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:37,898
Jim?

571
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:39,400
Jim?

572
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,735
Paul!

573
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:42,169
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, Paul.

574
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:43,169
Jim!

575
00:23:43,236 --> 00:23:44,471
Come on, okay.

576
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:45,439
Jim, what the
hell are you doing?

577
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, ready?

578
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:47,440
One, two...

579
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:48,976
[grunts]

580
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:50,277
Okay, get underneath,
underneath. Go underneath!

581
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,446
All right. You ready?

582
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,380
- Go, go, go...
- You got it?

583
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:53,380
One, two, go!

584
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:55,216
[grunting]

585
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,252
Come on! Slide out!
Slide out! I got you!

586
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,188
Come on, come on.

587
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,661
Drop, drop, drop.

588
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,832
Are you good?
Got any breaks?

589
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,669
No, he's just gonna
be bruised for a long time.

590
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,838
I was just out back
turning off the gas

591
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,073
when I heard you guys yelling.

592
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:21,409
Hey, look, we need
a car right now.

593
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,709
We'll take you to the base.

594
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:24,577
All right,
I got you covered, man.

595
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:25,746
I got just the one.

596
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:27,046
Great.
Where are the keys?

597
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:29,217
Back there on the shelf,
number eight.

598
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,419
- On the board?
- Yeah. You can't miss it.

599
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:32,654
All right.

600
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,287
- You good?
- Your brother.

601
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:35,723
Oh, no.

602
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,691
A thank you would
have been nice, all right?

603
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,393
Shit, nothing changes
around here.

604
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,174
Before he went to the Air Force,

605
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,342
your dad had that
on his workbench.

606
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,412
Every day he'd look at it.
Man, I forgot all about it.

607
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,481
You know what? Take it.
I want you to have it, Jimmy.

608
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:03,049
For good luck.

609
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,186
Thanks.

610
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,989
Guys, I'm sorry I never made it
to your dad's funeral.

611
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,689
Hey, George, It's all right.

612
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:11,525
I was just...

613
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,361
What's our ETA to impact?

614
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,996
We got an hour and 12 minutes.
We gotta go.

615
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,764
All right, come on.
Let's go.

616
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,433
George.

617
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,170
Thanks, George.

618
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:27,675
Hey, man, she's is a
nitrous-burning monster!

619
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,111
Zero to 100 in a second!

620
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:32,447
[rumbling]

621
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:38,885
George!

622
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,053
- Come on.
- George!

623
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,255
Come on, Jim!
We gotta go!

624
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,622
Come on!

625
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,359
We gotta go!
Come on!

626
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:55,269
Go, go. Step on it.
Go, go, go.

627
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,880
You good?

628
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,448
Which way to the base?

629
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:08,816
Straight west.

630
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:16,122
Base, this is Lawson.
Do you copy?

631
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:19,326
Base! This is Lawson!
Do you copy?

632
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:21,662
<i>This is Admiral Keller,
Lawson, at XVision.</i>

633
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:22,764
<i>Go for base.</i>

634
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,198
Jim and I are three minutes out.

635
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:26,566
Repeat, ETA is three minutes.
Do you copy?

636
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:27,900
<i>Copy, three minutes.</i>

637
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,169
We're currently tracking
your position

638
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,238
with the Xvision
surveillance drones,

639
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:34,107
so we'll have a more accurate
sense of your ETA.

640
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,842
We've sustained massive
damage here at the base

641
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,378
due to these earthquakes.

642
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,914
<i>Some parts have
been completely decimated.</i>

643
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:41,548
<i>Most of our F-35s</i>

644
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:44,718
<i>and about 80% of all
aircraft are operational.</i>

645
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,688
XVision craft is
ready to launch.

646
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,421
We're just waiting
for your arrival.

647
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:49,789
Copy that, base.

648
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,192
Maintain protocol
on Operation Godfather.

649
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:52,325
<i>Copy that.</i>

650
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,227
You should have
visual confirmation

651
00:26:54,294 --> 00:26:57,398
of conventional weapons now
at 50,000 units and climbing.

652
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,069
Good. They launched early,
get ahead of

653
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:04,505
the earth's magnetic
poles reversing.

654
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,708
What's the ETA for the moon?

655
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:10,111
It's an hour
and eight minutes.

656
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:11,779
All right. See if you can find
something on the radio,

657
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,213
a newscast, anything.

658
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:16,283
[static]

659
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,986

I see it.
Just focus, brother.

666
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,136
We need to get to base.

667
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:46,147
Admiral, exterior damage
readings on the base

668
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:48,783
have overwhelmed our
damage-report live-stream.

669
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,217
Moving to the back-up feed.

670
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,920
Thank you, Major Romero.

671
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,189
Colonel Hauser...

672
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:02,563
China and Russia are chomping at
the bit to launch their nukes.

673
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,864
Is Lawson airborne?

674
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,165
Negative.
His helicopter crashed,

675
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,900
but we've regained
communication.

676
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,835
He's en route to the base
about one minute out.

677
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,270
We need him airborne
as of an hour ago.

678
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:14,275
We have Operation Godfather
on our threat screen.

679
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,009
We launched our missiles
to get ahead of

680
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,845
the reversal of
Earth's magnetic poles.

681
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,579
They're reaching
the mesosphere as we speak.

682
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:22,450
We will have Jim Lawson
airborne ASAP once he arrives.

683
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:28,988
Ma'am, an incoming meteor has
damaged above ground supports.

684
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,225
Below ground damage
is 20 yards at 5%.

685
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,327
Admiral, per the president

686
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:35,596
and the Joint Chiefs,
make it happen.

687
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:39,632
If Lawson doesn't tail
this strike,

688
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:42,469
every second decreases
our chance of success.

689
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:43,603
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,439
Our Colossus Dish is damaged.

691
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:47,941
Communication to the antimatter
engine is unstable.

692
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:49,611
Do you have steady contact?

693
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:51,678
Initializing communications
verification

694
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:52,979
with anti-matter engine now.

695
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:54,680
[signal sounds]

696
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:56,115
Signal still active.

697
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,684
The signal on the
antimatter engine

698
00:28:57,752 --> 00:28:59,453
on the drone is active, yes.

699
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,755
How much life is left
in its power reserve?

700
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:04,558
Last reading was 72%.

701
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:06,560
Are you able to patch
this call over to Lawson?

702
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:10,731
I have a very unstable radio
signal, but it's all I've got.

703
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,065
[sighs]
Do it.

704
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:13,333
Yes, ma'am.

705
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,138
- Admiral?
- <i>It's Hauser.</i>

706
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:20,241
<i>I can't hold Russia and
China back</i>

707
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:22,309
<i>from launching their nuclear
missiles much longer.</i>

708
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,544
They seem to think that they can
solve this with a nuke strike.

709
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,514
A nuke strike
won't work, Colonel!

710
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,582
The only thing that'll stop it
is a major gravitational event.

711
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,485
We both know that, Jim.

712
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,120
But their physicists
seem to think

713
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:35,455
that our process isn't viable.

714
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:38,525
We need to convince them before
they take us all down with them.

715
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:41,094
Colonel, that antimatter
engine is a miniature version

716
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:42,929
of the large Hadron Collider.

717
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,664
That makes black
holes every single day.

718
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:47,835
So it is strong enough to create
a temporary black hole

719
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,403
the size of a football field

720
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:51,371
pulling the moon
back into orbit.

721
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:53,774
The Russians and Chinese
are saying that a black hole

722
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:57,111
will pull the moon and the earth
into it, destroying everything.

723
00:29:57,177 --> 00:29:59,580
That's not true, Colonel!

724
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,015
<i>They're going with the nuclear
option unless we can prove it.</i>

725
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:03,116
<i>Do we have proof?</i>

726
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:04,451
Yes! It's something called

727
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:07,521
"Newton's Universal Law
of Gravitation".

728
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,024
<i>Gravity decreases
in an inverse square</i>

729
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,627
when moving away from
the center of a mass.

730
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:15,261
Colonel, the drone is
on the moon's far side.

731
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:16,830
So the earth is far enough away

732
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:19,198
from the event that
it'll only move a millimeter.

733
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,601
But that'll be enough to pull
the moon back into orbit

734
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:24,405
and back into equilibrium
with the earth. Copy.

735
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,474
Let's hope that
it's enough to ward them off.

736
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,543
Get it done.

737
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,681
[rumbling]

738
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,587
[alarm blares]

739
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:41,721
Ma'am, the Colossus Dish
has sustained heavy damage.

740
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:44,424
We've lost the distress signal
to the antimatter engine.

741
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,594
We're losing
its location, ma'am.

742
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:51,899
Threat Response,
this is Command.

743
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:55,769
Get above ground and repair
the Colossus Dish immediately.

744
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,639
If Lawson loses contact,
that dish is the only thing

745
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:01,308
powerful enough to communicate
the drone's coordinates.

746
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:03,743
Ma'am, radar indicates
Operation Godfather

747
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,379
clearing the mesosphere.

748
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,416
Lieutenant, when they strike,
get me a payload count.

749
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,017
[alarm sounds]

750
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,553
Colonel, we have
incoming meteors.

751
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,655
We have to find some
way to defend the dish.

752
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,455
Threat Response
is calling for artillery.

753
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:17,791
No.

754
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,326
If we use artillery, we
might as well be trying

755
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:20,960
to stop them with a pistol.

756
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:23,362
Diaz, get Threat Response
to set up

757
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,699
the LRAD sonic cannons
around the dish.

758
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,570
We'll launch a
sonic shield

759
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,105
to pulverize incoming
as it approaches.

760
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:32,739
Deploying sonic cannons, ma'am.

761
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:37,577
[rumbling]

762
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:43,551
Major Romero, how's the base's
earthquake stabilization?

763
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,653
Stabilizers are
still active, ma'am.

764
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,653
And the underground
line to the Pentagon?

765
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,856
Still active.

766
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,358
Ma'am, the missiles have reached

767
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,761
the leading edge of
the moon's debris field.

768
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:59,267
Field penetration at 18%,

769
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:04,738
30 degrees,
ordinance detonation at 31%.

770
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:11,679
<i>Absolute carnage...
it is the end times...</i>

771
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:15,850
<i>I have reports of
satellites crashing...</i>

772
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:18,686
<i>Words cannot... Now we can see
whole structures...</i>

773
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,621
<i>around Paris...
our own station now...</i>

774
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,831
Hey, the magnetic poles
are reversing.

775
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh...

776
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,736
Hit the nitrous!

777
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:37,871
What?

778
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,607
Hit the nitrous!
In the console!

779
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:41,607
Oh, God! Oh!

780
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,443
Hit it!

781
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,344
Oh!

782
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:46,913
- Hang on!
- Here we go!

783
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,448
Hold on! Hold on!

784
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,222
Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo!

785
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:05,799
Ordinance detonation
at 38%, 50%,

786
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,502
60%...

787
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,670
80%.

788
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:14,073
We're still at 18% penetration
into the debris field

789
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,544
and holding...

790
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,477
Holding...

791
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:19,845
and 17%.

792
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:22,782
The missiles are prematurely
to detonating, ma'am.

793
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,852
The earth's magnetic fields
are reversing.

794
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,355
[alarm sounds]

795
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:30,423
Ma'am, I'm also getting
a heat sensor reading

796
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,892
from the stabilizers
underneath the base.

797
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,095
Rate of increase is
one degree per second.

798
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,830
All right, stand by.

799
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,867
<i>Ma'am, we have to get our
spacecraft in the air now.</i>

800
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,002
<i>These earthquakes will
destroy our craft any minute!</i>

801
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:43,770
<i>What is Jim's ETA?</i>

802
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:46,338
Captain Hayes, stand by until
I give you the order to launch!

803
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:47,875
Stand by, Captain Hayes.

804
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:52,379
The moon's weakening
the earth's magnetic field,

805
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,914
sending subatomic particles
shooting

806
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,248
through the upper atmosphere.

807
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,583
[crackling]

808
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,388
Ma'am, I'm getting a security
alert from the Pentagon.

809
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:03,491
The pole reversal is
activating the detonator,

810
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:06,892
destroying the missiles before
they can reach the debris field.

811
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,662
Stand by, Romero.

812
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:11,064
I'm getting an alert that
the Pentagon's Colossus Dish

813
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:13,667
is experiencing a power surge.

814
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:16,803
Do we still have
a line to Washington?

815
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:18,505
Still connected
to the Pentagon, ma'am.

816
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:20,340
All right. Put me through
to Colonel Hauser.

817
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:27,381
Ma'am, the cannons are down.

818
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,215
And the dish's
mainframe is overheating.

819
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:30,383
[cellphone rings]

820
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,751
It's Admiral Keller, ma'am.

821
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,986
I see zero confirmation
of his flight!

822
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:36,356
Get Lawson in the air now!

823
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:41,395
This is astronaut
Jim Lawson to base.

824
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:43,697
<i>We are at XVision!</i>

825
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:45,298
Start the engine on my craft.

826
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:47,667
I'll be airborne as soon
as I reach the cockpit.

827
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:50,502
He's here and about
to board, Colonel.

828
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,039
Copy that, Captain Lawson.

829
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:54,173
All spacecraft are prepped
and ready to launch.

830
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,244
<i>You are at point position.
Repeat, you are at point.</i>

831
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,579
Captain Hayes,
initiate launch sequence.

832
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:02,717
Jim Lawson is on his way
to fleet point position.

833
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:04,951
Hayes and Matthews,
you're running the edge.

834
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,387
<i>Ready to launch.</i>

835
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:08,053
<i>Assuming left flank
to the point.</i>

836
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:13,193
Ma'am, the temperature under the
base has increased 300 degrees.

837
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,564
Our pressure readings
are blowing out the sensors.

838
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:19,367
The building stabilizers
are melting.

[ricochet]

841
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:42,423
Looks like it's
some type of geode.

842
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,360
Did this just come up
from under the base?

843
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:51,497
The last temperature
reading was 380 degrees.

844
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:55,468
The sensors are showing
a heat field at...

845
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:57,771
100 feet below ground!

846
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:59,805
Alert Lawson.

847
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,842
They might be driving right
into a volcanic eruption.

848
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:09,916
Ma'am, I'm getting an alert
from the power grid database.

849
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:13,053
All the power grids
in the U.S. are crashing

850
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,522
because the magnetic
poles are reversing.

851
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,662
<i>This is Captain Hayes.
Ready to launch.</i>

852
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:25,298
There's the fleet.
There's the fleet right there!

853
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:28,235
The engine's starting
to overheat.

854
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:30,803
The tarmac's heating up.
The tires are starting to smoke.

855
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:33,506
Yeah, the moon's pulling on
the earth's liquid core.

856
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:35,207
That's pushing magma
to the surface.

857
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,110
All right, we're gonna drive
right up to the craft,

858
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,679
get on the roof of the car, up
the ladder into the cockpit!

859
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:40,881
Copy.

860
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,818
Get those ships in the air!

861
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:46,519
Launch! Launch!

862
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:47,788
The channel's dead.

863
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:51,559
All right, we gotta get there
before another eruption!

864
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:53,760
Launch! Launch!
Break formation!

865
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,428
Go for launch!
Go for launch!

866
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:01,133
Fleet, damage report.

867
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,302
We've lost 22 ships, Captain.

868
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,171
We're the only craft remaining.

869
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,106
They're gone!

870
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:07,640
Matthews and Hayes made it out.

871
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:09,476
They can't complete the mission.

872
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,044
Where's the AI craft?

873
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:13,380
What? The one untested?

874
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,082
The experimental craft!
Where is it?

875
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:16,150
Hangar 13!

876
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:21,553
We're going in.

877
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:23,189
What? To the cargo hold?

878
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,291
Hang on!

879
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:25,392
You can't drive into the ship!

880
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:26,426
Here we go!

881
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:27,960
Stop! Stop!

882
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:30,030
[screaming]

883
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,048
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

884
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,490
<i>Hello, Jim and Paul Lawson.</i>

885
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,059
<i>Preflight protocol
is initiated.</i>

886
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,195
<i>Jim, I see you are
the pilot today.</i>

887
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,599
Go for launch!

888
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:09,035
<i>Manual flight engaged.</i>

889
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:10,604
Launch now!

890
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,306
<i>Protocol discourages
launching from inside...</i>

891
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:13,506
Launch now!

892
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:15,508
X.C., scan for imminent threats!

893
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:16,976
<i>Imminent threat detected.</i>

894
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:21,948
<i>Launch at t-minus
three, two, one.</i>

895
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:23,684
[Paul screaming]

896
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:31,858
- We got at least another mile.
- Okay.

897
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:36,129
So what brought you
to Camp Pendleton?

898
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:37,197
I was...

899
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:43,637
I started dating this guy,
a good guy, a Marine.

900
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,606
He had just started
his patrol on the base

901
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:46,874
when the earthquake struck.

902
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,910
Well, if everything goes
according to plan,

903
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:53,581
we'll get you reunited with him.

904
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:56,116
With who?

905
00:38:58,418 --> 00:38:59,519
The Marine.

906
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:00,821
[rumbling]

907
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,559
[gasps]

908
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,796
What's our ETA to impact?

909
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,734
Hey, Paul?

910
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,170
Paul, focus on my voice, huh?
Deep breaths.

911
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:19,072
What's the ETA to impact?

912
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,608
43 minutes.

913
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,510
How far is the moon
from the earth?

914
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,613
NASA and the DOD's
database is down.

915
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,749
Hauser said the Colossus
satellite is disabled.

916
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,217
I'm not getting any updates.

917
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,820
All right...

918
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:35,387
X.C., how far is the moon
from our current position?

919
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:38,791
<i>Calculating... there is no
GPS data available.</i>

920
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:40,427
<i>Communication satellite
shows fatal error.</i>

921
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:42,095
<i>Enabling laser distancing:</i>

922
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,197
<i>I detect a major disruption
of the Moon's orbit.</i>

923
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:45,698
<i>Current distance
from our location:</i>

924
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:48,068
<i>163,209 miles.</i>

925
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,669
All right, so the moon's
a third of the way here.

926
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,171
We don't have an escort.

927
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,606
[beeping]

928
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:55,242
<i>Jim, we are
receiving an alert.</i>

929
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,709
<i>Two XVision spacecraft are
approaching rapidly.</i>

930
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,282
Sir?

931
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:05,885
We are guarding you the rest
of the way to the drone.

932
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:08,755
Thank you, Captain.
We owe you one.

933
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:10,756
Tell me, what's
your payload today?

934
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:11,959
We have
two stinger missiles each,

935
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:13,627
plus the two on your craft.

936
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:16,329
I am first point,
Lieutenant Matthews is second,

937
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,664
your craft is last.

938
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:23,336
Don't tell me Excalibur's never
fired its weapon system before.

939
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:26,238
You want me to lie to you?

940
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:29,242
<i>Extremely hazardous conditions
detected in the troposphere.</i>

941
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:31,577
<i>Incoming meteors and
disabled satellites detected.</i>

942
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,213
<i>All ground contact is severed.</i>

943
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:35,180
<i>Advise safe landing
immediately.</i>

944
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,083
X.C., shut up.

945
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,252
Incoming! 10:00!

946
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:43,657
It's maneuvering in the opposite
direction I want it to go!

947
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,225
It's following its program.

948
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,293
Well, turn it off!

949
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,294
I can't!
It's reacting...

950
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,528
Turn it off!

951
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,063
X. C., quiet mode!
Manual function!

952
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,999
<i>Going quiet.
Manual function.</i>

953
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:53,200
Thank you.

954
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,369
Incoming dead ahead!

955
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:02,242
Incoming!

956
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:03,543
Matthews!

957
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,812
[screams]

958
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,283
Sir, stay your course!

959
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:11,752
Staying the course.

960
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:13,419
We're almost out
of the mesosphere.

961
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:16,022
Be in orbit in 30 seconds.

962
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:18,525
Uh... Jim?

963
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,860
Incoming!

964
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,029
Fox One.

965
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:27,735
It's still coming!

966
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,244
<i>Jim! What do we do?</i>

967
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,813
<i>Jim!</i>

968
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,416
[screams]

969
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,352
- Hayes!
- No!

970
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,424
We lost them.

971
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,111
It's quiet.

972
00:42:13,813 --> 00:42:15,182
Yeah, well...

973
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,550
We're in the middle
of the detonation zone

974
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:20,186
from the missile strike.

975
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:22,722
We're only gonna get
about a minute of this.

976
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:30,529
You all right?

977
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,365
Yeah.

978
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,767
I'm just not really used to
the physical impact of it.

979
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,736
[chuckles]

980
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:39,572
Well, we were pulling about
five Gs there,

981
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,907
so I don't blame you.

982
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,044
Yeah.

983
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:50,783
I hear this ship has
a cyclotron gyroscope

984
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:52,785
ballast here.

985
00:42:54,854 --> 00:42:56,990
You don't know what that is?

986
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:58,958
It's artificial gravity.
[chuckles]

987
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:03,764
Wow!

988
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,399
Wow, this is what you
feel all day?

989
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:08,400
This is awesome!

990
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:09,902
I like this.

991
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:12,037
Try it on for size.

992
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,706
All right, focus up.
We need to find that drone.

993
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:16,508
[sighs]

994
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:20,713
X.C., find the distress signal
on our drone.

995
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,215
<i>X.C. is back online.</i>

996
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,918
<i>Hello, Jim and Paul.
Locating drone.</i>

997
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:29,655
Now Excalibur
can navigate us

998
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:31,925
straight to the drone.

999
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:33,526
I thought you
said it wasn't tested.

1000
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:35,662
Yeah, it's untested,
but it has autopilot.

1001
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:37,363
You know what that is.

1002
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,999
Look, an AI component is a lot
different than an autopilot.

1003
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:43,370
Yeah, I get that, but
this one's one of a kind.

1004
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,004
You know, it's got
the robotic arm,

1005
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,874
laser guidance system,
smart controls.

1006
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,676
It'll save you from
doing a little moon walk

1007
00:43:49,742 --> 00:43:52,344
to get the antimatter engine.

1008
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,948
Look, you were there
before we wanted to take off.

1009
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:56,515
The ship wanted to delay
until we had to tell it

1010
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:58,284
there was a threat.

1011
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:01,889
Paul, look, human instinct
still has to be the baseline.

1012
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:05,058
Okay, bro.

1013
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:12,800
Diaz, the Damage
Response team

1014
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:15,168
needs to reactivate
that satellite ASAP!

1015
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,005
Run a fine-point signal to
capture any onboard functions.

1016
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,339
We have no communication
with Lawson or the drone.

1017
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:23,008
Their last alert was
10 minutes ago, correct?

1018
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:24,943
These are distress signals.

1019
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,213
The base was
completely destroyed.

1020
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,349
Do we have confirmation of that?

1021
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:31,884
Ma'am, some of the
distress signals

1022
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:34,988
and security footage reached
our feed before it went black.

1023
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:37,357
There's nothing left of it.

1024
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:39,159
Looks like there was
some kind of explosion

1025
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:41,494
that leveled at
a five-square mile radius.

1026
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:43,095
What about our Air Force?

1027
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:45,363
Are there any bases capable
of launching aircraft?

1028
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,300
Ma'am, the communication
database feed

1029
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:51,671
shows heavy damage
and destruction.

1030
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:53,940
All of our assets
are inoperable.

1031
00:44:54,006 --> 00:44:55,876
Half of them went down
in the ocean

1032
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,744
during the disruption
of the poles.

1033
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,213
The loss of life is enormous.

1034
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,982
[rumbles]

1035
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:09,956
This craft looks familiar.

1036
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:12,858
Yep. It ought to.

1037
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:14,326
You designed it.

1038
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:16,162
Really? So you just...
so you took my design?

1039
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:20,267
No, I didn't take
your design, Jim.

1040
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:23,703
I made the Defense Department
make sure that all the parts

1041
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:26,038
and designs go under your LLC.

1042
00:45:26,106 --> 00:45:30,575
So anything they use,
you get paid for.

1043
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:33,546
That was my way of trying
to make things right.

1044
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:37,950
I love that picture
you got from George.

1045
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:40,620
The one of us with
Mom at the beach?

1046
00:45:40,686 --> 00:45:42,488
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1047
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:44,658
Dad must have lost that
when he worked for George

1048
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:46,491
before he went in the Air Force.

1049
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,995
Man, he was so mad.

1050
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,063
He'd loved that picture.
It was his favorite.

1051
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:53,300
I barely remember it.

1052
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,102
Oh, you were only
about five years old.

1053
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,242
All I can remember is him
laughing at something you said.

1054
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,610
And then I tried
to say something.

1055
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,979
And he... He just patted
me on the head.

1056
00:46:11,383 --> 00:46:12,985
[sighs]

1057
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,923
Look, um...

1058
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,026
It wasn't entirely your fault.

1059
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:22,361
What wasn't?

1060
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:24,396
Firing me.

1061
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:27,267
Several years ago when you
were still in high school,

1062
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,870
you hadn't even
started XVision yet,

1063
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:32,972
I disobeyed a direct order
on my first lunar mission.

1064
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:37,043
I was ordered back
to the lander,

1065
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,246
but instead I went to recover
this metal sample

1066
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:42,381
that we'd lost
when our rover failed.

1067
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:44,249
I should have
gotten a reprimand,

1068
00:46:44,316 --> 00:46:46,320
but instead they said
I saved the mission.

1069
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,993
I kind of developed a reputation
for doing stuff like that.

1070
00:46:58,131 --> 00:46:59,533
I didn't know that.

1071
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,537
Yeah, well, everyone in
the Air Force loved Dad.

1072
00:47:03,602 --> 00:47:06,106
So they kind of loved
me by association.

1073
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,311
I mean, the reports, they should
have said I was "reckless".

1074
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,981
But they said
I was "quick thinking".

1075
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:20,387
And then when I lost control
during last year's mission...

1076
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:26,426
my reputation
went right out the window.

1077
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:30,029
I mean, it didn't matter that
it was a gravitational anomaly

1078
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:35,066
from 100 million miles out that
forced my craft into the moon.

1079
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,137
It didn't matter.

1080
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:40,140
I couldn't save my copilot.

1081
00:47:40,206 --> 00:47:42,808
No matter how thorough
my report was,

1082
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:44,945
warning everyone about
an asteroid so massive

1083
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,313
that it could affect
my spacecraft from that far out

1084
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:50,650
and it was gonna strike the moon
in less than a year...

1085
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:54,254
no one believed me.

1086
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:58,425
Not even you.

1087
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,570
What happened last year
wasn't your fault.

1088
00:48:12,037 --> 00:48:13,505
It wasn't your fault
at all, actually.

1089
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:14,573
It was mine.

1090
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,276
I was the one that
you discharged.

1091
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:19,379
I was the one that
threw you under the bus.

1092
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:26,619
Jim, your copilot's death
wasn't your fault.

1093
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:32,891
None of this is.
It's mine.

1094
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:34,461
But it could have been my fault.

1095
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:36,396
That's why it's
not unreasonable for you

1096
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:39,666
to strip me of my career
in order to save XVision.

1097
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:47,073
Just like it wasn't unreasonable
for Stacey to leave me.

1098
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,517
That's the dumbest
thing you've ever said.

1099
00:49:00,452 --> 00:49:02,454
If that's true, then why did
Dad have you drive him

1100
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:05,358
to the hospital every single
day for his treatments?

1101
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:09,028
Not once did he ask me.
You know why?

1102
00:49:09,095 --> 00:49:12,798
Because you're accountable.

1103
00:49:12,865 --> 00:49:15,702
You're accountable.

1104
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:18,271
No cancellations,
nothing ever came up.

1105
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:20,806
You were always there.

1106
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,809
And me...

1107
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:30,517
I'm selfish.

1108
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:33,552
Always trying to
prove something.

1109
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:41,294
You said Stacey's safe?

1110
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:44,865
Yeah.

1111
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:47,566
Yeah, Stacey's safe.

1112
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:52,839
Good.

1113
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,477

1114
00:49:58,544 --> 00:50:00,947

that distress signal.

00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:45,992

through to our astronauts.

the top of the next ridge.

1128
00:50:56,936 --> 00:51:00,740

Amplify the signal to catch
any onboard functions.

1193
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:38,117
We can build a
vectoring model

Are the electrical engineers
still at the mainframe?

1228
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,360
Yes, ma'am.

1229
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:57,262
Have them regulate the power
fluctuations manually.

1230
00:56:57,329 --> 00:56:58,730
Turn off the smaller systems.

1231
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:01,200
Just keep the main circuit
from melting down.

1232
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,102
Yes, ma'am.

1233
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:05,703
We're about 8,000 yards
out now from the drone.

1234
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:07,307
We should have a visual.

1235
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:11,910
Lawson...

1236
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:13,579
[static]

1237
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:15,214
[garbled speech]

1238
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:18,217
Go for Jim Lawson.

1239
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:19,452
[static]

1240
00:57:19,517 --> 00:57:22,088
Did not stop...
Repeat, did not...

1241
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:24,990
Oh, she's warning us
about something here.

1242
00:57:25,057 --> 00:57:26,792
X.C., can you break though the
static on the incoming message?

1243
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:30,328
<i>Clearing radio signal.</i>

1244
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:32,932
<i>Paul, I apologize but I cannot
clear the incoming message.</i>

1245
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,568
<i>Only discernible words are
"Repeat" and "Did not".</i>

1246
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:37,535
All right.
Keep monitoring the radio.

1247
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:38,905
We're almost to the drone.

1248
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,372
X.C., move the robotic
arm to port side.

1249
00:57:41,439 --> 00:57:44,008
<i>Repositioning arm to port.</i>

1250
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,278
X.C., can you tell how
much battery power is left

1251
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:48,147
in the antimatter engine?

1252
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:50,383
<i>Battery reserve on
the antimatter drive...</i>

1253
00:57:50,448 --> 00:57:52,851
<i>calculating 40%.</i>

1254
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:55,121
That battery's running out fast.

1255
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:56,988
If it encounters a
problem in orbit,

1256
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:58,957
it's programmed to send
the highest possible signal

1257
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:00,760
and make sure it reaches earth.

1258
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:02,861
Burns a lot of juice.

1259
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:08,034
Ma'am, the nuclear missiles
are exiting the atmosphere.

1260
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:10,401
Lawson, this is Hauser.

1261
00:58:10,468 --> 00:58:11,970
Come in, Lawson! Lawson!

1262
00:58:15,173 --> 00:58:19,445
X.C., extend the arm,
full extension.

1263
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:22,481
<i>Yes, Captain. Extending robot
arm to maximum extension.</i>

1264
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:24,183
Reverse thrust 12%.

1265
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:26,651
<i>Reverse thrust 12%.</i>

1266
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:31,456
<i>Acceleration at... 88%...76%.</i>

1267
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:33,392
<i>Target within 1,000 yards.</i>

1268
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:44,336
X.C., assume control
of the craft.

1269
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:46,103
Bring us into
a stabilized position

1270
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:47,873
on the port side
of the stalled drone.

1271
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:49,775
<i>Initiating guidance system</i>

1272
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:51,876
<i>and assuming control
of the spacecraft.</i>

1273
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:53,978
All right, X.C.,
use the robotic arm

1274
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:56,381
to remove the antimatter drive.

1275
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:59,117
<i>Are there any fine motor
fixtures which will require</i>

1276
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:01,420
<i>use of the arm's toolkit?</i>

1277
00:59:01,486 --> 00:59:04,055
X.C., there are 16 bolts
and a breakaway shield.

1278
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:06,159
Make sure they're all removed.

1279
00:59:07,693 --> 00:59:09,262
Yeah, I know a thing or two.

1280
00:59:20,439 --> 00:59:22,207
<i>Captain Lawson, now that
the bolts have been removed,</i>

1281
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:24,342
<i>I will need to use the arm's
welding torch</i>

1282
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,178
<i>to unseal the welded joints
on the engine's heat shield.</i>

1283
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:27,678
No, we can't risk
a welder damaging the engine

1284
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:29,148
under the shield.

1285
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:32,418
The drone's
too large to fit inside.

1286
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:35,020
I may have to go out
and recover it manually.

1287
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,988
- Let's suit up.
- Let's do it.

1288
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:42,794
X.C., prepare for space walk.
Open cargo bay doors.

1289
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:44,597
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

1290
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,831
<i>Air containment in progress
and opening cargo bay doors.</i>

1291
00:59:45,898 --> 00:59:46,865
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

1292
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:48,400
What do you need me to do?

1293
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:50,535
Well, when I tell the AI
to bring me back on the arm,

1294
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:51,804
you monitor the controls.

1295
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:52,871
Make sure it listens.

1296
00:59:52,938 --> 00:59:54,372
Copy that.

1297
01:00:00,244 --> 01:00:01,813
ETA?

1298
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,816
<i>We got 26 minutes!</i>

1299
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:19,365
<i>Incoming! Nuclear missiles are
approaching the debris field!</i>

1300
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:21,967
<i>Warning! Detonation within
the debris field is imminent!</i>

1301
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,468
Jim, we got a nuclear strike!

1302
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:24,670
Don't touch anything!

1303
01:00:24,736 --> 01:00:26,439
Stand by!

1304
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:28,441
<i>Nuclear missiles are
approaching the debris field!</i>

1305
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:29,740
<i>Jim, emergency
procedure requires</i>

1306
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:30,809
<i>that astronauts outside...</i>

1307
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:33,177
Disregard emergency procedures!

1308
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:35,080
X.C., do not listen
to that order!

1309
01:00:35,146 --> 01:00:37,048
I am bringing Jim inside!

1310
01:00:37,115 --> 01:00:40,052
<i>Paul, I see you've engaged the
manual functions on the tether.</i>

1311
01:00:40,117 --> 01:00:42,755
<i>Jim, get your butt
back in here now!</i>

1312
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:44,856
Don't bring me in!

1313
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:48,059
I've almost got it!

1314
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:50,563
I don't give a shit, Jim!
Get back in here now!

1315
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,631
<i>Detonation in seven, six, five,</i>

1316
01:00:53,698 --> 01:00:58,202
<i>four, three, two, one...</i>

1317
01:00:58,269 --> 01:00:59,472
Jim!

1318
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,343
- Oh!
- Oh.

1319
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,280
Closing cargo bay.

1320
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:13,451
<i>Severe damage reported.</i>

1321
01:01:13,517 --> 01:01:15,454
- <i>Fuel line has been breached.</i>
- Go, go, go, go!

1322
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:16,921
<i>Fuel is leaking from
the exterior</i>

1323
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:18,590
<i>and interior of
the spacecraft.</i>

1324
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:20,892
We need to shut off the fuel
before anything ignites it.

1325
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:22,495
- <i>Fuel remaining: 78%.</i>
- It's no use.

1326
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:24,162
All controls for the control
panel has been severed.

1327
01:01:24,229 --> 01:01:25,897
All right. We'll have to shut
down the engines.

1328
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:27,799
- Shut down the engines?
- <i>65%.</i>

1329
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,368
Any electronic onboard
can ignite it!

1330
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:31,703
I mean, we'd have to shut down
this entire ship!

1331
01:01:31,769 --> 01:01:33,104
Well, that's what
we're gonna do.

1332
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:35,874
Maybe you forgot
we just lost the drone.

1333
01:01:35,941 --> 01:01:37,576
I mean, we'd be floating
dead in space, Jim!

1334
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:39,711
Look, we don't have a choice!

1335
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,313
If that explodes, we die

1336
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,048
and every chance of saving
the earth goes with us.

1337
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:46,818
X.C., cease all
onboard functions.

1338
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:48,521
Power down the ship.

1339
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:50,555
<i>Captain, the craft is currently
spinning out of control.</i>

1340
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:53,457
Cease all engine and
onboard functions now.

1341
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:54,994
Shut down the ship.

1342
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:57,329
<i>Ceasing all engine and
onboard functions.</i>

1343
01:01:59,731 --> 01:02:01,400
You better be right.

1344
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,637
We need an alternate means of
propulsion to reach the drone.

1345
01:02:05,704 --> 01:02:09,108
We can use the ship's
air evacuator valves.

1346
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:11,643
What? So we use the onboard
air as propellant?

1347
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:14,313
Exactly.
Come on.

1348
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,885
We've lost them, ma'am.

1349
01:02:19,952 --> 01:02:21,453
No, not necessarily.

1350
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:23,755
We lost their onboard stream
to our Cloud database.

1351
01:02:23,822 --> 01:02:25,356
Check the radar.

1352
01:02:25,423 --> 01:02:27,759
We still have a radar
reading on Excalibur, ma'am.

1353
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:30,996
It looks like the majority of
their superstructure is intact.

1354
01:02:31,063 --> 01:02:33,331
Do we have any communication?

1355
01:02:33,398 --> 01:02:35,199
The systems are down, ma'am,

1356
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,903
and thermal imaging suggests
that their engines are off, too.

1357
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:39,572
[rumbling]

1358
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:47,111
Ma'am, the structures
above us have collapsed.

1359
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:48,579
Call engineering.

1360
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:51,750
Have them devise a brace
for the structure.

1361
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:53,918
Level Nine to engineers?
Code Grey!

1362
01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:56,020
The floor above us
is starting to collapse.

1363
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:57,756
I repeat, Code Grey!

1364
01:02:57,822 --> 01:02:59,190
If Lawson's systems are offline,

1365
01:02:59,256 --> 01:03:00,592
he may need us to guide him
to the drone

1366
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,194
using our radar coordinates.

1367
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,530
Level Nine engineers?
Come in, Level Nine engineers.

1368
01:03:05,597 --> 01:03:07,533
Ma'am, the engineers
aren't responding!

1369
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,367
Try to find them on
the server's location grid.

1370
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:11,503
What are the orbital
coordinates of the drone?

1371
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,407
29.09 north, 71.17 east,

1372
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:19,945
209 million 200 miles
per hour at 94 degrees.

1373
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,512
Threat Response team!

1374
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:24,882
Give a full electrical surge
to the Dish's mainframe.

1375
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:30,723
And Morse Code the following
coordinates, 29.09 north.

1376
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,093
Look, I have a visual
on the drone.

1377
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,160
But there's no accurate way
to judge distance

1378
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:36,595
or coordinates, Jim.

1379
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,796
Now what's the ETA
to atmospheric impact?

1380
01:03:38,863 --> 01:03:40,599
18 minutes.

1381
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,934
All right, look,
we got four ducts

1382
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,669
to evacuate air from the ship.

1383
01:03:44,736 --> 01:03:47,372
We got two here in the cockpit,
two back in the cargo hold.

1384
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:50,042
But we're going to need the
exact location of the drone.

1385
01:03:50,108 --> 01:03:51,476
[beeping]

1386
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,380
Is that Morse Code?

1387
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,448
Well, it has to be the Pentagon!

1388
01:03:56,514 --> 01:03:57,248
It's a number.

1389
01:03:57,316 --> 01:03:59,352
It said 29.09 north.

1390
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,354
Wait. That doesn't match our
coordinates.

1391
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:04,655
That's 12,000 miles
from our starting point.

1392
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:06,757
They're giving us the
coordinates for the drone.

1393
01:04:06,825 --> 01:04:09,028
Yeah, but we've lost access
to the ship's coordinates, Jim.

1394
01:04:09,093 --> 01:04:11,329
So we have no way
of tracking it.

1395
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,031
The compass, the compass!

1396
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:15,099
Compass?
What compass?

1397
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,168
Jim, what compass?

1398
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:21,373
Come on, come on, XC.

1399
01:04:28,247 --> 01:04:30,950
All right, look.

1400
01:04:31,017 --> 01:04:32,484
This is an old
World War II compass.

1401
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,218
The needle's painted
with radium 66.

1402
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:35,486
That's radioactive.

1403
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:37,822
The engine has a
proton cyclotron booster

1404
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:39,356
just like the Hadron Collider.

1405
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,526
Now when that blast went off,

1406
01:04:41,593 --> 01:04:43,629
this was within 40 feet
of that engine.

1407
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:45,296
So the subatomic particles
were affected?

1408
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:46,365
Exactly.

1409
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:48,200
Separated into ions
from the radium.

1410
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:51,637
So now instead of magnetism
pulling the needle,

1411
01:04:51,704 --> 01:04:55,073
the ions in the dial are
mirroring the ions in the drone.

1412
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:56,740
So it's overpowering
the magnetic forces?

1413
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:59,410
Right. And if we could find
a horizontal plane relative

1414
01:04:59,477 --> 01:05:01,746
to the drone's orientation
and relative

1415
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,615
to its vertical orientation,

1416
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:05,785
we can measure
the angles on the dial,

1417
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:07,285
triangulate the drone's
current heading

1418
01:05:07,352 --> 01:05:09,154
relative to our position.

1419
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,023
Yeah, but what about its speed?

1420
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,525
All right, we can trace our path
using the ship's database.

1421
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:16,095
From when the nuke hit
us 'til now,

1422
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,830
calculating for
distance over time.

1423
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:19,464
That would work.
That could work.

1424
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,731
Come on.

1425
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:22,467
Okay, use those dials
to orient the horizontal

1426
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:24,269
and vertical planes of
the Excalibur's vector map

1427
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:25,971
based on the direction
of the compass' needle

1428
01:05:26,037 --> 01:05:30,209
relative to the drone.

1429
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:31,910
Okay, the X and Y axis
are recalibrated.

1430
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:36,915
XC, calculate a vector path
based on the new X and Y axis.

1431
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:38,550
<i>Aligning vectors now.</i>

1432
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:41,086
<i>Vectors now synced.</i>

1433
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:43,456
Okay, let's get to
the cargo hold.

1434
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,726
What?

1435
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:49,561
Don't scrape anything.

1436
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:54,532
All right,
pull at the same time.

1437
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,702
This should bump us into
a clean trajectory.

1438
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:57,869
Yeah, I got it.

1439
01:05:57,936 --> 01:05:59,003
On three.
Can you count that high?

1440
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,005
Yeah!

1441
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,005
All right, one, two...

1442
01:06:01,072 --> 01:06:02,474
- Three.
- Three.

1443
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,980
All right.
We should be on target now.

1444
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,515
Yeah, hopefully.

1445
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:14,954
All right, we're on course.

1446
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,188
Let's slow our speed as
we approach the drone.

1447
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:17,722
Okay.

1448
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:18,922
You ready? We're gonna do this
together on three.

1449
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,092
Yep.

1450
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:21,226
One, two...

1451
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:22,727
- Three!
- Three!

1452
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:24,028
What happened?

1453
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:26,063
Nothing.
We must be getting out of air.

1454
01:06:26,131 --> 01:06:27,899
All right, again.
One, two...

1455
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:29,300
- Three!
- Three!

1456
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:31,202
We're not slowing down, Jim!

1457
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:32,303
All right. We're gonna have
to try to snag it

1458
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:33,771
as we pass the drone.

1459
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,173
Put on your helmet.

1460
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,641
What?

1461
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:42,481
Ma'am, look!

1462
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:44,382
The Excalibur craft
has changed course!

1463
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,117
It's steering towards the drone!

1464
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:49,421
Is our fine-point signal able
to detect any communications?

1465
01:06:52,323 --> 01:06:53,858
No, ma'am, wait!

1466
01:06:53,925 --> 01:06:55,860
There's a vectoring
update in data Cloud.

1467
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:58,696
It updated with
two parallel coordinates.

1468
01:06:58,764 --> 01:06:59,932
Good.

1469
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,232
There must be something
onboard their ship

1470
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:02,834
with an active database.

1471
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:04,336
[rumbles]

1472
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:06,938
Either their spacesuits
or the drone or both.

1473
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:08,207
[crash]

1474
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:11,843
Does the arm have a
dedicated power source?

1475
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,111
Yes.

1476
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:14,246
All right, we have
to turn it on.

1477
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:16,247
But it could ignite the fuel!

1478
01:07:16,314 --> 01:07:18,116
We have to risk it.

1479
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:19,885
- Okay.
- Give me a countdown!

1480
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,285
Got it.

1481
01:07:21,352 --> 01:07:24,657
Making contact in 10, 9,

1482
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:26,457
8, 7, 6...

1483
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:27,659
Extending the arm.

1484
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:32,497
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1485
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:36,034
- We got it!
- Yes!

1486
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:37,035
We got it!

1487
01:07:37,102 --> 01:07:38,403
Open the overhead doors!

1488
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,905
What is our ETA
to the moon's impact?

1489
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:42,674
Six minutes, ma'am.

1490
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,543
Ma'am, the ceiling's not
gonna hold much longer

1491
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:55,553
We have to hurry!

1492
01:07:55,621 --> 01:07:57,356
The moon's close enough
to the atmosphere

1493
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,592
that it's causing "sprite"
electrical charges!

1494
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:04,395
Jim, the power surges
are activating the ship.

1495
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:11,336
<i>The connection with
the anti-matter drone</i>

1496
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:12,838
<i>has been lost.</i>

1497
01:08:12,905 --> 01:08:14,473
- <i>Warning, power surge detected.</i>
- Oh, come on!

1498
01:08:14,539 --> 01:08:15,974
- <i>Power surge detected.</i>
- We just lost the drone!

1499
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,976
We have to shut down
the system before...

1500
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:20,812
[explosion]

1501
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:23,682
Ma'am, there's been an explosion
onboard the Excalibur!

1502
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:26,485
The spacecraft is headed
16 degrees, Vector 19

1503
01:08:26,552 --> 01:08:28,887
directly into
the sun's cosmic rays.

1504
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:30,589
And the drone?

1505
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:32,857
Do we have updates for the
fine-point reading on the Dish?

1506
01:08:32,924 --> 01:08:36,161
We did capture an active signal
to get it's last heading, ma'am.

1507
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:39,130
Did you send a vectoring model
to the ship before it exploded?

1508
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:41,798
I kept updating your
database every second, ma'am.

1509
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:45,838
Then send a vectoring model
through the Dish, maximum hertz!

1510
01:08:47,104 --> 01:08:48,473
Do we have the engine?

1511
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,876
No. It broke free in the arm!

1512
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:52,210
<i>Fatal error!
Fatal error!</i>

1513
01:08:52,277 --> 01:08:53,578
<i>The hull has been breached!</i>

1514
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:54,979
<i>Repeat, the hull
has been breached!</i>

1515
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:56,615
<i>Failure of all
artificial gravity</i>

1516
01:08:56,682 --> 01:08:58,250
<i>and emergency systems

1517
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:00,319
<i>Catastrophic explosion!</i>

1518
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:02,521
X.C., where's the antimatter
engine now?

1519
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:05,089
<i>I am unable to locate
the antimatter drive.</i>

1520
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,391
<i>The drive's distress
signal has stopped.</i>

1521
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:09,327
<i>Battery power is depleted.</i>

1522
01:09:09,394 --> 01:09:11,361
What's our ETA for the moon?

1523
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:12,631
- Paul!
- What?

1524
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:14,698
What's our ETA for the moon?

1525
01:09:14,765 --> 01:09:16,300
Three minutes and 20 seconds.

1526
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:18,704
[explosions]

1527
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,272
<i>Disintegration of the
spacecraft's superstructure</i>

<i>Warning, disinti...</i>

1531
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:27,911
The ship's breaking up!
Paul, the ship's breaking up!

1532
01:09:27,978 --> 01:09:30,548
Is there any other
propulsion onboard?

1533
01:09:30,615 --> 01:09:33,151
Paul, get it together!
Is there any other propulsion?

1534
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:34,920
No, just us.

1535
01:09:34,986 --> 01:09:36,622
That's it.

1536
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,660
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I need you.

1537
01:09:42,727 --> 01:09:43,896
Come on.

1538
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:47,098
Wait!

1539
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:50,502
My radio is picking up
a high-frequency pulse.

1540
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:52,303
There's a waveform reading
in the display.

1541
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,904
It's a sequence.

1542
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:56,575
It's a vector model, Jim.
The drone's behind us!

1543
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,076
<i>Warning! Disintegration
of the spacecraft</i>

1544
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,244
<i>superstrucutre is imminent!</i>

<i>Warning! Di...</i>

1546
01:10:00,411 --> 01:10:02,746
Hey, we can't stay on the ship.

1547
01:10:02,813 --> 01:10:05,582
We can use the car
before the gravity dies!

1548
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:08,318
What, Jim we can't use...

1549
01:10:08,385 --> 01:10:10,455
Zero to 100 in a second, baby.

1550
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:13,058
Oh, yeah!
Thank you, George!

1551
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:16,527
Let's get it.

1552
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,564
X.C., open cargo doors!

1553
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,803
Now! Go, go, go!

1554
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:32,811
Oh!

1555
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:34,513
Woo hoo hoo!

1556
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:38,883
Hey, you got a hole!

1557
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,818
Give me your arm!

1558
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:44,655
What's the time?

1559
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:46,558
A minute and 58 seconds!

1560
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,326
Here, fix it.

1561
01:10:49,393 --> 01:10:50,861
All right.
It's okay.

1562
01:10:50,929 --> 01:10:54,199
Hey, brother,
look, you trust me?

1563
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:55,968
Sure!

1564
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:02,741
Oh!
Whoa!

1565
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:07,378
What are you doing?

1566
01:11:07,445 --> 01:11:09,148
Paul, what's that light?

1567
01:11:09,214 --> 01:11:11,616
It's ionic particles
being pushed by the sun!

1568
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:13,051
Our suits can handle it!

1569
01:11:13,117 --> 01:11:14,952
Are you sure?

1570
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:16,186
I hope so.

1571
01:11:16,254 --> 01:11:17,522
All right, listen.

1572
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:19,591
We've got the nitrous
in the trunk.

1573
01:11:19,657 --> 01:11:22,160
We can use that to shoot
ourselves toward the drive!

1574
01:11:22,227 --> 01:11:23,362
That's the plan?

1575
01:11:23,428 --> 01:11:24,929
You got a better one?

1576
01:11:24,995 --> 01:11:26,363
No.

1577
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,467
All right, let's get
to the trunk!

1578
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:57,028
Come on, come on, come on.

1579
01:12:30,195 --> 01:12:31,595
Take these.

1580
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:33,630
Tape 'em to the side of the car.

1581
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:36,501
Make sure the nozzles
are pointed backwards.

1582
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:40,137
1:30,
we need to hurry!

1583
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:30,254
Okay.

1584
01:13:32,156 --> 01:13:34,359
Now pop that nitrous when
I give the word!

1585
01:13:34,425 --> 01:13:35,494
- You got it?
- Got it!

1586
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:37,028
All right.

1587
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:43,300
Three, two, one...

1588
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:44,969
Pop it!

1589
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,844
[laughs]

1590
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:55,346
All right, here we go.

1591
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:56,514
It's working!

1592
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,215
I'm gonna grab the drive.

1593
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:02,888
You're only gonna get one shot!

1594
01:14:06,057 --> 01:14:08,260
Don't miss it, Jim!
Here it comes!

1595
01:14:10,128 --> 01:14:11,963
Grab it!

1596
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,665
Yeah!

1597
01:14:15,098 --> 01:14:17,034
Woo!

1598
01:14:17,102 --> 01:14:18,970
Nice grab, Jumbo!

1599
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:30,314
The battery's completely dead!

1600
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,682
Time to impact?

1601
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,619
Minute and five!

1602
01:14:34,585 --> 01:14:36,153
What's that light?

1603
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,055
The Moon's reached the
earth's upper ionosphere.

1604
01:14:38,122 --> 01:14:39,790
The atmosphere is
about to catch on fire!

1605
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:41,259
Take that in the back!

1606
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,662
Hurry up, Paul!

1607
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:51,202
Jim, what's that?

1608
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,674
Paul!

1609
01:14:56,741 --> 01:14:59,344
- Paul!
- Ah!

1610
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:04,116
Jim!

1611
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:24,535
Jim!

1612
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:26,638
I got you, brother!

1613
01:15:26,705 --> 01:15:28,106
Pull me in!

1614
01:15:29,773 --> 01:15:31,910
Pull me in!

1615
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:34,612
I got you.
Come on, buddy.

1616
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:36,348
Come on back.

1617
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,687
[panting]

1618
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:45,322
Where's the tape?

1619
01:15:45,389 --> 01:15:46,892
Got it!

1620
01:15:49,393 --> 01:15:51,862
Hold it still.
I'm gonna tape it down!

1621
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:58,436
- We're almost out of tape!
- Use it all!

1622
01:15:58,503 --> 01:15:59,470
What are we doing?

1623
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:01,138
All right, look.

1624
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:03,275
The drive's battery has leads on
it just like any other battery.

1625
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,409
All it needs is
a current to turn it back on!

1626
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:08,479
I'll throw the switch,
the engine will start.

1627
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:10,580
I'll rip the shield off
the side of the battery.

1628
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:12,616
You can't!
It's screwed on!

1629
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:14,250
Well, keep pulling!

1630
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:15,320
Agh!

1631
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,554
Come on!

1632
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:18,956
Tear that thing off!

1633
01:16:19,023 --> 01:16:21,191
We need to get
the cadmium regulator!

1634
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:22,928
[grunts]

1635
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:35,407
[grunts]

1636
01:16:35,473 --> 01:16:38,041
I got it!

1637
01:16:38,108 --> 01:16:40,445
Great, let me
connect the battery.

1638
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:01,465
Okay, the battery
is connected.

1639
01:17:16,481 --> 01:17:18,081
All right, great!

1640
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:21,385
Here.
Attach these,

1641
01:17:26,456 --> 01:17:27,758
Just pull, man!

1642
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:30,028
Can't! It's too short!

1643
01:17:30,094 --> 01:17:31,795
All right. We need something
metal, something...

1644
01:17:31,862 --> 01:17:33,263
We don't have anything metal!

1645
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,432
Something that conducts
electricity.

1646
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:37,302
Look in the glove box!

1647
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:42,006
We don't have anything.

1648
01:17:42,072 --> 01:17:43,842
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1649
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,316
Hurry! Hook it up!

1650
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:57,155
All right, here we go.

1651
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,057
- You ready?
- I'm ready!

1652
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:03,061
Here we go!

1653
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:07,566
- It's working!
- It's working!

1654
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,339
All right, go!

1655
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:17,007
[screaming]

1656
01:18:32,522 --> 01:18:34,557
[alarm sounds]

1657
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:37,962
Ma'am, there's been an explosion
on the far side of the moon!

1658
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:40,531
It's a black hole!

1659
01:18:40,598 --> 01:18:42,733
They did it!

1660
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:44,201
[laughs]

1661
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:48,973
Phew!

1662
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:01,486
We're about
to re-enter the atmosphere!

1663
01:19:06,424 --> 01:19:07,626
Paul!

1664
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:14,633
Paul, hang on, buddy!

1665
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:19,436
Paul!

1666
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:22,941
Hang on, buddy!
I'm coming!

1667
01:19:34,552 --> 01:19:36,954
Need... to shield...

1668
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:38,689
slow the fall...

1669
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:46,731
All right, here we go.

1670
01:19:46,796 --> 01:19:47,999
All right.

1671
01:19:51,735 --> 01:19:53,438
Hang on, buddy.

1672
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:06,517
Hold on.

1673
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:11,488
Hold on!

1674
01:20:16,894 --> 01:20:18,595
Here we go!

1675
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:21,598
Almost there.

1676
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,548
All right, buddy.
We're going too fast.

1677
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,584
We gotta find
a way to slow us down.

1678
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:43,755
Let me secure us.

1679
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,192
Here we go.

1680
01:21:22,992 --> 01:21:24,396
All right.

1681
01:21:25,196 --> 01:21:27,831
All right.

1682
01:21:27,897 --> 01:21:32,870
You know you cried when Mom made
us share a bed on vacation.

1683
01:21:32,937 --> 01:21:34,037
[chuckles]

1684
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:36,173
Look at us now.

1685
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,809
I'm gonna get you home
in one piece, brother.

1686
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:45,784
Okay. Hold on.

1687
01:21:51,455 --> 01:21:53,624
Hold on!

1688
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:55,093
[yelling]

1689
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:10,407
Hang on, bro!

1690
01:22:15,446 --> 01:22:17,982
It's 50 below up here!

1691
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:19,684
But you gotta breathe, brother!

1692
01:22:32,862 --> 01:22:35,765
Come on, man.

1693
01:22:35,832 --> 01:22:37,134
You gotta breathe.

1694
01:22:39,036 --> 01:22:42,138
This air's too thin for me,

1695
01:22:42,205 --> 01:22:44,174
but you breathe
that oxygen, brother!

1696
01:22:46,376 --> 01:22:47,845
Go on, breathe!

1697
01:22:48,946 --> 01:22:50,348
Breathe.

1698
01:23:28,018 --> 01:23:31,055
Come on, Jim.
Wake up!

1699
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:32,990
Wake up, man!

1700
01:23:33,057 --> 01:23:34,358
Jim!

1701
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:38,162
Jim!

1702
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:00,617
Jim Lawson, do you copy?

1703
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:09,494
Jim Lawson, do you read this?

1704
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:18,101
Wake up, Jim! Come on!

1705
01:24:18,168 --> 01:24:19,603
Jim!

1706
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,939
[coughing]

1707
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:25,942
Oh!

1708
01:24:26,009 --> 01:24:27,544
Oh, thank God!

1709
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:30,046
Thank God! Come on.
Get you up. Come on

1710
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:32,849
[laughs]

1711
01:24:37,254 --> 01:24:40,323
You did it!
You did it.

1712
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:41,959
We both did it.

1713
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:45,463
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm proud of you, man.

1714
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:48,900
I bet Dad is too, man.

1715
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:51,602
Yeah.

1716
01:24:57,808 --> 01:25:00,544
<i>Gentlemen, congratulations.</i>

1717
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:02,679
Oh, Colonel Hauser!

1718
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:05,315
<i>We'll be sending a transport
to pick you up shortly.</i>

1719
01:25:05,383 --> 01:25:06,884
<i>D.C. just reopened our bunker</i>

1720
01:25:06,951 --> 01:25:08,218
<i>and there are a couple
of people down here</i>

1721
01:25:08,285 --> 01:25:09,653
<i>who want to say hello.</i>

1722
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:12,121
<i>Paul? Are you there, Paul?</i>

1723
01:25:12,188 --> 01:25:14,691
Juni! Juni, it's me.

1724
01:25:14,758 --> 01:25:16,794
We did it!

1725
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:21,165
- <i>I love you so much.</i>
- <i>We love you, Daddy.</i>

1726
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:22,866
- <i>Come home!</i>
- I love you, too.

1727
01:25:22,933 --> 01:25:25,169
Daddy's coming home!

1728
01:25:25,236 --> 01:25:26,537
Come in, Jim Lawson!

1729
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:31,576
<i>Jim?</i>

1730
01:25:31,642 --> 01:25:34,045
<i>Jim, it's Stacey!</i>

1731
01:25:34,111 --> 01:25:37,282
<i>Jim, please tell me
you're okay.</i>

1732
01:25:40,651 --> 01:25:43,887
<i>Stacey, is that you?</i>

1733
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:46,189
Jim, it's me.

1734
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:49,960
Are you okay?

1735
01:25:50,027 --> 01:25:51,962
Yeah, I'm okay.

1736
01:25:52,028 --> 01:25:53,464
Woo-hoo-hoo!

1737
01:25:56,099 --> 01:25:57,567
Come home.

1738
01:26:01,604 --> 01:26:02,874
<i>Come home, Jim.</i>

1739
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:06,344
I'm okay.
