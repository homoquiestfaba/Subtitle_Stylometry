00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,709
No, no.
Well, sure I do.

185
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,016
[laughs]
I insist.
No, honestly.

186
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,018
Let me replace that.It'’s truly nothing.

187
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,323
It'’s just a shirt.Oh, please.

188
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,978
Quiet!No--

189
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,720
No. I'’m trying
to find him.

190
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,550
Do you have
a restroom here?

191
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:52,728
Okay, Sandra, straighten up.

192
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,470
You don'’t even know this guy,
and you'’re coming on to him

193
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,254
like a steam train.

194
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:00,562
So just calm down,
all right?

195
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,824
That'’s it.

196
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,349
What is your problem?

197
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,660
I'’ll tell you
what your problem is.

198
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,319
Oh.

199
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,495
[sighs]

200
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,324
You'’re alone.

201
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,847
You think 400
will cover the damage?

202
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,718
I can leave more.Oh, no, no, no.

203
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,417
That'’s fine.
That'’s fine. You--

204
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,333
You know...

205
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,943
there'’s nothing that, uh--

206
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,902
that an older guy
like me wouldn'’t do

207
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,773
to spend some time
with a pretty women,

208
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,863
but that--
that lady friend of yours,

209
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:44,519
I think she--
she would appreciate it

210
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,477
if you would
drive her over there

211
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,479
to Pear Blossom
personally.

212
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,223
Okay.

213
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,399
Uh, no.

214
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:59,229
She would appreciate it
if you would drive her
over there...

215
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,796
[whispers]
personally.

216
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,583
So the guy comes
out of nowhere,

217
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:09,370
saves your life--
big deal.

218
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,764
Now, you just get real,
Sandra dear,

219
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,549
because by tomorrow,

220
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,857
you won'’t even
remember his name.

221
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,164
Bye-bye, Jake.

222
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,993
Oh, don'’t even
think about it.

223
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,214
Oh...

224
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,185
[thud]

225
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,839
[bang]

226
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,456
[footsteps]

227
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,384
Hey, Sandra.

228
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,690
What--
Are you all right?

229
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,997
That crazy guy,
he is back.

230
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,215
I-- What?

231
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,347
Right behind the house.

232
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,783
Are you sure?Sure I'’m sure.

233
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:46,092
I just almost fell over
his goddamn car.

234
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,746
Please, Jake,
let'’s just go.

235
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,363
Oh, God.
Oh, look at me.

236
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,147
I'’m shaking.

237
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,888
[laughs nervously]You'’re all right.

238
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,498
Shaking'’s just
a natural reaction.

239
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,761
You'’ll be fine.Oh.

240
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:04,936
[lighter clicking]

241
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,504
Mm. Mm-mm.

242
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,549
[inhales]

243
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:11,639
Wowee, that was wild.

244
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,052
Are we there?

245
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,010
We ran out of gas.

246
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,098
I didn'’t
want to wake you.

247
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,796
Oh. That'’s okay.

248
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,799
Excuse me.
How long has it been?

249
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,454
74 minutes.

250
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:48,023
74 minutes? Christ.

251
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,817
Might as well face it.
We'’re dead.

252
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,863
No one'’s going to come.

253
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,691
Sure, someone'’s
going to come.

254
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,823
I had a patient that
did this all the time.

255
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,825
Someone always
picked him up.

256
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:12,134
What were you
treating him for,
complete stupidity?

257
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,441
He'’s a professor
of mathematics,

258
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,617
and a very good guy,

259
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,966
till he woke up one morning

260
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,794
convinced his entire life

261
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:23,450
was one huge, inescapable

262
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:26,192
mathematical equation.

263
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,410
Huh.

264
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,585
So he took up hitching.

265
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,022
Well, that makes sense.

266
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,372
He thought a little
random adventure

267
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:35,026
might throw a wrench
in the works.

268
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,332
Did it?

269
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,856
You could say that.

270
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,816
His name was Max Tinder.

271
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,775
He killed seven people
in 11 days.

272
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,650
What kind of doctor
are you?

273
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,304
A truck.

274
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:53,697
Oh, my God![honking horn]

275
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,917
He'’s pulling my car!
Jake!

276
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,788
It'’s my car!
It'’s my car![continues honking

277
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,972
My God, did you see that?

278
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,366
I mean, what is it
with me today?

279
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,499
What is my problem?

280
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,718
Wrong place, wrong time.

281
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,242
That'’s all.
Don'’t take it personally.

282
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,243
[both laughing]

283
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,201
I was just joking, really.

284
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,594
Really?
Yeah.

285
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:23,379
Oh, to relieve
the tension.

286
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,207
What tension?

287
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,296
[both laughing]

288
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,866
Ahh.

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,491
I can take rejection.
I'’m a very big girl.

290
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,754
No, it'’s--It'’s just been
one of those days.

291
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,495
It'’s just that
it'’s getting late,

292
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,455
and we'’ve got
responsibilities,
remember?

293
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,239
No, I don'’t remember

294
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,589
because I don'’t have
any responsibilities.

295
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,635
I'’ve been lying, okay?

296
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:07,162
I just work for a stupid
little collection agency.

297
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,469
Or at least I did
until my boss sacked me

298
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:12,254
after he screwed me,
of course.

299
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,560
What about Pear Blossom?

300
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,083
Oh, Pear Blossom.

301
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,390
There I'’m going to pick up
my stupid sister,

302
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:21,045
and we'’re going to drive
the rest of the way
to Utah together.

303
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,005
Since Dad died, she'’s all
Mom can think about.

304
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,964
And I can bet you

305
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:30,272
that she
won'’t even turn up.

306
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,840
You can. How come?

307
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,412
Because Alice is a loser.

308
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,981
[Sandra]
Last year,

309
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,288
I wasted two whole days
in the middle of nowhere

310
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,682
just waiting for her
to show up.

311
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,730
Found out later
she shacked up

312
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:58,039
with some junkie musician type
halfway through Nevada.

313
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,003
But that'’s Alice for you.

314
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,658
Never gives a shit
and has all the fun.

315
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,925
She'’s the one
who makes me smoke.

316
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,321
I guess that'’s why I lied.

317
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,239
[sighs]
Just to make things
a bit more exciting.

318
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,980
I don'’t know.

319
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:29,113
I must sound like
a complete head case,

320
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:32,682
especially to someone
like you.

321
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,076
To someone like me...

322
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,079
you sound perfectly normal.

323
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,124
Well, no one'’s perfect.

324
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,518
[both chuckle]

325
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,956
[vehicle approaching]

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,349
Okay, buster,

327
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:50,047
you just try getting
past me this time.

328
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,093
You know, Sandra--Oh, no, no, no.
I'’m okay, I'm okay.

329
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,094
I tell you--

330
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,400
Get out of the road,
Sandra.

331
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,010
It'’s a bad habit.

332
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,621
Oh, I'’ll kick it
when I settle down
and have kids.

333
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,717
[Jake]
Wait--Shh!

334
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,415
Wait!

335
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,025
Where are you going?
Sandra--

336
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,374
It'’s him. It's him.

337
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,202
It'’s the crazy guy,
the one that wants me dead.

338
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,508
Sandra, wait a second.

339
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,205
First of all,
you don'’t know
that he'’s crazy.

340
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,598
Second of all,
if he wanted you dead,

341
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,382
he wouldn'’t have stopped,
would he?

342
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,384
He would have run
right over your head.That'’s not the point.

343
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,646
What is the point?

344
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,126
It'’s not the money,
is it?What money?

345
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,693
The money you took
out of his car.

346
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,611
Shit.

347
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,874
I'’ve never done anything
like that in my life.

348
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,050
I want you
to believe that, Jake.

349
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,835
On top of everything today,
I'’ve become a thief.

350
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,098
And you always thought
I was a normal person.

351
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,491
You are a normal person.

352
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:46,626
Stealing money
is a perfectly normal action.

353
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,933
Not for me it isn'’t,
Jake. No.

354
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:53,023
Normal people do not
go into some guy'’s car

355
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,416
and steal a load of cash.

356
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,505
Of course they do, Sandra.

357
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,334
Otherwise we wouldn'’t
be seeing a 17% increase

358
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,946
in domestic white-collar
dysfunctionalism, would we?

359
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,427

00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,190
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

538
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,893
What do you need?

539
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,722
Well, what everybody needs
from time to time.

540
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,682
A little change.

541
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,751
You'’re in my seat.

542
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,721
You a movie star?

543
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,505
No. I'’m a doctor.

544
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,246
Oh.

545
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,682
[bell tingles]

546
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:37,607
I'’m sorry
I was so late,

547
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,609
but it'’s a busy night
tonight.

548
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,437
I could only
get us one room.

549
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,178
It'’s big, two beds.

550
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,745
But if that'’s a problem,

551
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:46,529
we could always hang
a sheet between them.

552
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:47,791
Like in the movies.

553
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,706
Oh, the movies.

554
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,882
I like the movies.

555
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:53,145
Jake here could be
a movie star.

556
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:55,103
He'’s handsome enough.

557
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,497
This is, uh...

558
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,846
Shirley.

559
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:01,153
"Shirl" to my friends.

560
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,416
Hi, Shirley.
I'’m Sandra.

561
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,114
I'’m with him.

562
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:08,769
Oh, no.

563
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,250
I saw him first.

564
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,382
Didn'’t I, Jake?

565
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,429
Put any two cards down?

566
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,778
Is this a trick or what?

567
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,040
No, no, no.
Actually--

568
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:21,086
No. I mean,
are you trying to get--

569
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,262
Oh!Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

570
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:24,698
I'’m always doing that.

571
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,091
Lucky it wasn'’t
boiling coffee.

572
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,396
Forget it.

573
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,922
Take care
of yourself, Jake.

574
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:35,665
Maybe we'’ll meet again
on the other side.

575
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,889
So are you folks
ready to order now?

576
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:45,675
Our specials this evening
are the Dover Sole

577
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,764
with wild rice
and baked carrots,

578
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,550
and Lemon Chicken
with asparagus spears.

579
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,818
One of each.
We can share.

580
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,341
Yes, ma'’am.

581
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,864
What'’s up, Doc?

582
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:03,693
Powerless without
your little silver coin?

583
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,132
Don'’t know.

584
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,829
[laughs]

585
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:23,017
You know, I like you.

586
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,410
How'’s my little
love birds tonight?

587
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:25,933
All right? Eh? Eh?

588
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:28,370
Ready to gulp down
a bit of solid food?

589
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:30,242
Not tonight, Mr. Santini.

590
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:33,593
I don'’t think we'll be having
dinner together tonight.

591
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:34,811
It'’s on the house.

592
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:37,075
I said fuck off.

593
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:42,123
[laughs]

594
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,298
Now, look-- look, Jake,

595
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,778
I don'’t know
what the problem is,

596
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:46,432
but I was just having a word
with the officer over there.

597
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,042
Nice man. He helped me out
with a bit of change.

598
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,566
And I told him
I'’d be dining with friends.

599
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,307
Now, what'’s it going
to look like

600
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:55,354
if I suddenly
scoot out the door, eh?

601
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,965
I don'’t understand.
What'’s going on?

602
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,967
What'’s going on
is our friend here

603
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,404
makes his living
out of cheating people.

604
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:05,103
[laughing]

605
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,366
Now, God bless you.
What, that?

606
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,411
That was a bit of fun.

607
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,718
A couple of games
of chance, that'’s all.

608
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,328
A game of chance
does not employ a bias

609
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,896
favoring one
or more parties.

610
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,333
What you'’re operating
is a confidence trick--

611
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:22,598
a system disguised
as a opportunity,

612
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,339
which makes you
just another liar.

613
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,129
All right.

614
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:34,001
How'’s about practicing
a bit of what you preach?

615
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,481
How'’s about giving
a bloke a chance?

616
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,179
I mean,
I'’m not a bad man.

617
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,138
Know what I mean?

618
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,923
If you win,

619
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,795
we finish our dinner,
go our separate ways,

620
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,494
quietly
and without incident.

621
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,973
How do you feel
about that?

622
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,411
Oh, I feel a lovely
warm tingle in my gutty-wuts.

623
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,152
Now, what'’s the damage
if I lose?

624
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,284
You pay back the cop.

625
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:57,546
Plus ten percent.

626
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,113
[laughing]

627
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,810
What?
You his agent now?

628
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,030
Seems like
a suitable figure.

629
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,597
No, I'’m not doing this.
This is bloody stupid.

630
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,425
Heads or tails?
Tails.

631
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,209
No, it'’s going
to be heads.Makes a difference

632
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,906
when you don'’t know
what'’s next, doesn't it?

633
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,777
Yeah, except--

634
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,260
Heads. All right?

635
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:25,400
Hey. See what happens
when you'’re a nice guy?

636
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:28,751
Congratulations.
Let'’s eat.

637
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:31,363
All right.
Now it'’s my turn next.

638
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,103
Three in a row.

639
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,628
And if it'’s not heads
every time,

640
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,543
I'’ll get on this table
and lap dance

641
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,892
while the cop'’s
putting the cuffs on me.

642
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:39,980
Please give me back
the coin.

643
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,808
But if I win...

644
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,636
you pay me back
the thousand dollars

645
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,812
that your girlfriend
stole out of my car.

646
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,772
Plus ten percent.

647
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,471
Jake.

648
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,429
Seems like
a suitable figure.

649
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,998
[Jake]
You still don'’t
get it, do you?

650
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,129
It'’s not about
winning or losing.

651
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,480
It'’s about chance.Three in a row.

652
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,003
That'’s the promise.
Now shut it.

653
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,701
But you can'’t say that.Oh, I thought I just did.

654
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,529
Must be those bleedin'’ voices
in my head again.

655
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,623
Well, I don'’t want to say
I told you so,

656
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,843
but I told you so.

657
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:24,894
Real chance defies
the inevitable.

658
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:27,941
That'’s what
the coin'’s all about.

659
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:28,985
So what'’s the problem?

660
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,204
Go ahead.

661
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,250
Embarrass me in front
of my loved ones.

662
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,253
[coin spinning]

663
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,689
See, what you don'’t
understand, Jake,

664
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,256
is you can spin
that bleedin'’ coin

665
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,693
as many times as you like,

666
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,739
but you still can'’t defy...

667
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:47,700
[coin spinning slower]

668
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:48,788
[stops]...shit.

669
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,405
Excuse me.

670
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,761
[toilet flushes]

671
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:06,893
Oh.

672
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,377
One of us
is in the wrong room.

673
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,598
Probably me. Usually is.

674
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:18,905
Whoa.

675
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,519
Don'’t suppose
you want to make it
double or quits?

676
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,808
Jake.

677
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,423
How'’d you like to take
a nice little girl like me,

678
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:02,035
just stick her
in the trunk of your car...

679
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,515
take her
out of this place?

680
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:08,346
Just pull me out
whenever you want
to play, and...

681
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,830
[sigh]
Jake...

682
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:15,831
[whimpers]

683
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:16,919
Jake.

684
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:24,492
Sandra?

685
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:29,845
Are you okay?

686
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,673
You look upset.

687
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,023
Why should I be upset?
Just because you--

688
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:39,202
I thought you
were different.
I really did.

689
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,769
From what?

690
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:41,770
From the kind of guy

691
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,207
who gets off
with the town whore.

692
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,470
Speak of the devil.

693
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:47,254
I think she
needs a doctor.

694
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,038
I think she'’s
already had one.
[moans]

695
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:52,259
Sandra,
I think you'’ve got
the wrong idea.

696
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,956
Don'’t...
touch me!
[retching]

697
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,480
[retching]

698
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,439
Don'’t...
touch me.

699
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,223
[retching]

700
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,660
Fucking men!

701
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,139
Oh, this is great!
Look at this.

702
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:04,837
Is that
the kind of woman
you really want?

703
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,404
Is that the woman

704
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,971
that I am supposed
to be competing with?

705
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,973
Some...
drunken tart

706
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,541
that can'’t
even hold down
her...dinner?

707
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,239
She'’s just
a stupid fucking--

708
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,371
fucking--

709
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,372
Aah!

710
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,417
[clattering]

711
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,854
Ha ha.[dog barks]

712
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,204
I think "cunt"
might be the word
you'’re looking for.

713
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,945
You--

00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:58,365
Uhh! Let go of me!

897
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:01,716
Let go!

898
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,848
Let go of me!

899
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,851
Let me--[shouts, coughs]

900
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:10,159
[coughing]
Ohh...

901
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:11,509
[groans]
Oh, my God!

902
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:12,423
[grunting painfully]

903
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,513
Uhh!

904
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,905
Come on.Why?

905
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:18,951
[spitting blood]

906
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:20,344
Why?

907
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,433
[gurgling, sobbing]
What have you done...

908
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:24,913
[gurgling, spitting]

909
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,700
[spurting]

910
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:29,701
Uhh!

911
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:31,180
Uhh! [sobs]

912
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,532
You'’re not--

913
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:35,881
I'’m not who?

914
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:37,317
Who?

915
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,538
[spits] I--

916
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:43,454
Uh...

917
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:46,848
[sobbing] Here.

918
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,071
I'’m... not...

919
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:55,509
a bad man!

920
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:56,467
[sobs, chokes]

921
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,471
[choking]

922
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:01,428
[gurgles]

923
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:05,432
Don'’t die!

924
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:06,303
Please!

925
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,176
[sobbing]
Oh, God!

926
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,268
[sobs]

927
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:22,319
[sobbing]

928
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:32,938
He'’s dead.

929
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:34,983
I'’m sorry.

930
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,945
Didn'’t you hear
what I just said?

931
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:42,164
He'’s fucking dead, Jake.

932
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,514
I heard.

933
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:44,950
Hop in.

934
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:46,473
But we'’ve got
to get to a phone!

935
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,040
I mean, we'’ve...

936
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,216
we'’ve got to call
the official people.

937
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:51,522
Well, you--

938
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,219
They'’ll know
what to do.

939
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:56,222
Okay.
First place we pass.

940
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,659
First place we--
The first place
we pass could be--

941
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:01,445
It could be
hundreds of hours
away from here, Jake!

942
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,969
We'’ve gotta go
back to town now!

943
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,231
No.

944
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:06,928
What?
I can'’t let you.

945
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:08,930
What do you mean,
you can'’t let me?

946
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:10,889
I just killed a man!

947
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,630
I just killed
a human being!

948
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:14,501
Exactly,
and they'’ll have you

949
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:17,025
sweating over
your own guilt
in ten seconds

950
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:18,026
flat.
Guilt?

951
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,028
I'’m innocent!
Oh, come on!

952
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:21,029
It was an accident!

953
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:22,335
You'’re from
out of town.

954
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,684
Don'’t you see?
You'’re just
passing through.

955
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,033
You never spend
enough time
in one spot

956
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:27,122
to keep a job down!

957
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,341
You are unbelievable!

958
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,474
Do you think
they'’ll care one bit

959
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:32,171
about your side
of the story?

960
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:34,695
Christ, woman,
you'’re a-- you're
a natural victim!

961
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,262
What makes you think

962
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,265
that you know
anything about me?

963
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:42,050
I don'’t. I just...
know your type.

964
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,793
Ohh! Fuck you!

965
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:47,578
Fuck you!

966
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,102
All right.
I know. I'’m sorry.

967
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,712
It was irrational
and stupid.

968
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:53,584
Alice, wait.
Listen.

969
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,934
We'’ll flip for it.
Alice.

970
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:57,762
Heads, we go on.

971
00:56:57,805 --> 00:57:00,547
Tails, we head back
and face the music.

972
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:03,376
I'’ll even go back
with you. Come on.

973
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,596
Uhh! That'’s what
I think of that!

974
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,989
I'’ll do it
by myself![horn blares]

975
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,818
[horn blaring]

976
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:32,971
[Radio host]
Hi. This is Chad Summers
with a KRBT news update,

977
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,494
and hot on the wire
for this afternoon

978
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,148
is the discovery
of a woman'’s body

979
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,716
at the Pear Blossom Motel
in Pear Blossom.

980
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,631
The victim, a woman
in her thirties,

981
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:42,763
was found dead in a room
earlier this morning.

982
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,635
Police are still
investigating the scene

983
00:57:44,678 --> 00:57:46,375
and treating the find
as suspicious.

984
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:48,116
More news as
it becomes available...

985
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,378
Sandra.

986
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:52,338
[Man] Ho!
Back up! Back up!

987
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:53,557
Get back
in the car right now.

988
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,167
You hear me?
Get over there,
folks.

989
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,516
Just back up.
All right?

990
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,909
This is not
a goddamn circus.

991
00:57:57,952 --> 00:57:59,171
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Where you goin'’?

992
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:00,302
That'’s my sister!Ho! Ho!

993
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:01,608
Let me go!Where you goin'’?

994
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,567
That'’s my sister!No! I don'’t care
who it is!

995
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,568
You don'’t
understand!You--

996
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:05,482
Young lady--That'’s my sister!

997
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:11,009
All finished, Frank.

998
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:17,537
All right,
Miss Thomas.

999
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,234
Let'’s see if we can
straighten this thing out.

1000
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,286
Now, you'’re
at the motel...

1001
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:30,202
waitin'’ for your sister
to show,

1002
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:33,031
and when
she doesn'’t show...
you hitch a ride.

1003
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:37,339
Before you know it,
some lunatic is trying
to run you off the road.

1004
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:40,821
He ends up getting
himself killed.

1005
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,264
But before he dies...

1006
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:52,616
he gives you
this lighter...

1007
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,358
which you claim
is your sister'’s.
That right?

1008
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,406
Right
around then...

1009
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,889
you learned about
this motel murder
business.

1010
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:08,370
And you figure
he got it off of her.

1011
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:09,328
Right?

1012
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,767
It'’s her lighter.

1013
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:14,768
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:16,509
It always
takes three tries.

1015
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:22,297
Miss Thomas,
how old are you?

1016
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,563
I'’m 25.

1017
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:28,173
[sigh]

1018
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,174
Ain'’t that
a hell of an age

1019
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:30,654
to be looking
for a free ride?

1020
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,179
Is that against
the law around here?

1021
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,486
Only the law
of common sense.

1022
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,751
I ain'’t saying it's wrong.

1023
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:42,970
I'’m only saying
shit happens.

1024
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,711
And you got to
take it into account.

1025
00:59:46,452 --> 00:59:48,585
I always take that
into account.

1026
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:59,900
Alice, the woman
in the morgue
is not your sister.

1027
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,728
What?

1028
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:03,425
Her name is
Shirley Dutton.

1029
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,645
The only step she ever took
out of Pear Blossom

1030
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:06,777
brought her right back,

1031
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,562
each time
a little more
busted up.

1032
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,346
Sammy.Yeah.

1033
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,434
Gimme that folder.

1034
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:20,486
Now...

1035
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,837
the fella you had
the misfortune of meeting...

1036
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,623
goes by the name
of Santini.

1037
01:00:29,495 --> 01:00:31,715
Now, we already have
a bunch of witnesses,

1038
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:33,499
including my deputy,

1039
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:36,894
putting them together
from around 9:30
last night.

1040
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:39,723
This fella,
sometime in the middle
of the night,

1041
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:42,943
goes berserk,
trashes this room,

1042
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:46,599
and leaves
poor Shirley dead
right there.

1043
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,212
If you ask me,
you ought to thank
your lucky stars

1044
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:52,300
that you'’re still
in one piece.

1045
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,435
As far as
your sister'’s
concerned...

1046
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:59,307
I checked
the motel register.

1047
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,700
There were no single women

1048
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,876
staying in the motel
last night.

1049
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,095
So I called your mom.

1050
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:07,794
She told me about
some car trouble

1051
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,317
that your sister
apparently had

1052
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:10,492
and apparently
spoke to you about.

1053
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,278
Is that true?

1054
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:15,280
Yes, sir.

1055
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,548
Alice,
I know about you.

1056
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,898
I know about
the juvenile hall.

1057
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:27,118
And I know about
the psychiatric stuff.

1058
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:30,730
And I know
about the drugs.

1059
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:33,298
I don'’t do drugs.
I'’ve never done drugs.

1060
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,692
Not since your
junkie fellow died.

1061
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:37,345
Junkie fella?

1062
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:39,217
He was no drug addict.

1063
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,567
He never even did drugs.
That was his first time.

1064
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,656
And his name was John!

1065
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,485
And he was all the colors
that you have never seen!

1066
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:49,793
He was pink and white,
and he was my love!

1067
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:55,276
[sniffles]

1068
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:00,325
And the child
that you'’re carrying
inside your body

1069
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:01,152
is his, isn'’t it?

1070
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:05,286
Look.

1071
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:07,854
What'’s mine
is mine.

1072
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,335
Frank.

1073
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:11,902
Phone.

1074
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,294
They found Santini.

1075
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:15,166
Right
where she said.

1076
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,472
And, uh,
Doc wants to know
if you'’re done yet.

1077
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:28,048
Alice.

1078
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:31,486
You gotta
take care of yourself.

1079
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,316
You don'’t always
get a second chance.

1080
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:41,453
All right, doctor.

1081
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:46,023
All yours.

1082
01:02:49,504 --> 01:02:50,418
Come on, Alice.

1083
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:52,943
Let'’s go before
the good sheriff

1084
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:54,466
changes his mind, eh?

1085
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:01,299
You really are
a psychologist.

1086
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,430
Psychiatrist.

1087
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:05,085
Psychiatrist?

1088
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:06,304
[snickers]

1089
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:07,566
So they
believed that?

1090
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:08,828
They swallowed
the whole thing

1091
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,743
about me being
a psycho?

1092
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,572
Hey, I just told them
that, uh, you were
a patient of mine

1093
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:16,140
who slipped
from medication.

1094
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:17,706
They had
an open-and-shut case

1095
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,230
against the Santini
thing

1096
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:21,145
until you got
hysterical with them.

1097
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:22,842
They naturally
resented it,

1098
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:26,367
and I just gave them
a rational alternative
to paperwork.

1099
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:29,414
God. You know,
somebody dies, and--

1100
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:31,590
and somebody else
just fills out a form.

1101
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:34,027
[sigh]

1102
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,987
Maybe if the world
ran out of ink,

1103
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,032
we'’d all live
forever, huh?
[chuckles]

1104
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:41,339
[chuckles] Hmm.

1105
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,824
God, I thought
Sandra was--

1106
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,913
I th-- I-- [sigh]

1107
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:53,307
I-- I really thought
she was dead.
[chuckles]

1108
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:55,092
She is.

1109
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,050
I'’ve got her
in the trunk of my car.

1110
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,141
[laughing]
No, no, no.

1111
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:03,491
Alice, it was just a joke
to relieve the tension.

1112
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:08,845
[sigh]

1113
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:10,977
A joke.

1114
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:14,763
You know...
[chuckles]

1115
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,070
[sigh]

1116
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:18,506
Maybe I should, um...

1117
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,900
go my own way.

1118
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,859
I hope you don'’t have
a problem with that.

1119
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:25,426
You know...

1120
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:30,301
I'’ve never met a woman
like you, Alice.

1121
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:32,085
Never. Ever.

1122
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,741
No, I don'’t have
a problem with that.

1123
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:53,150
For luck?

1124
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:10,645
Rats.

1125
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:27,662
[door-open
warning bell]

1126
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:28,359
I'’m sorry.

1127
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:34,800
Forgive me?

1128
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,333
[chuckles]

1129
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:49,858
[starts motor]

1130
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,216
Thomas. Thomas.
Thom---

1131
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,652
It'’s just
not here, Frank.

1132
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,959
Well...

1133
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:04,308
I tell you, humor me.

1134
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:06,353
You know, I miss a lot
of stuff all the time.

1135
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,057
Do you remember...

1136
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,276
who you let 7
to last night?

1137
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,887
7. Let'’s see now.

1138
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,889
It was a young woman,
I believe.

1139
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,805
Yes, that'’s right.
She was looking
for her sister.

1140
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,198
Her sister, huh?

1141
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,203
Did she look
anything like that?

1142
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:33,119
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,165
She was more
of a lady, though.

1144
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,036
Lipstick and stuff.

1145
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,646
She left
her room perfect.

1146
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,170
Mmhh.

1147
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:41,910
Did you see the person
she was with?

1148
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,042
Only the car.

1149
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,479
It was, like,
a black sports thing.

1150
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:50,658
Mm-hmm.
Can I see the room?

1151
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:51,616
Sure.

1152
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,058
[flushes toilet]

1153
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,408
[loud gurgling]

1154
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,300
Here'’s the profile
on Nyman.

1155
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:12,175
Sammy, I'’m really
sorry about Shirley.

1156
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:14,481
If you want to talk...

1157
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:16,092
you know...

1158
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:17,876
Anything new,
Sammy?

1159
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:19,660
Doc Muller
just phoned.

1160
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:22,228
Says that
Shirley wasn'’t
murdered.

1161
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,316
What?

1162
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,666
Seems she died
of a heroin
overdose.

1163
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,233
What about Nyman?

1164
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:29,888
Jake Gordon Nyman.

1165
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:32,717
Uh, Los Angeles
part-time employee.

1166
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,415
The Los Angeles
Criminal Psychiatric
Department.

1167
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:37,461
One of those
big-city shrinks

1168
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,245
with a dozen-
and-a-half titles.Jesus Christ.

1169
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,986
This is six months old.
Get me an update.

1170
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:42,683
Call ahead to Bernie'’s.
Let'’s see if we can stop Nyman

1171
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:44,294
from crossing
the state line.
Let'’s go.

1172
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:47,166
Wait. Wait. Wait.
He'’s-- He's legit.
He'’s no psycho.

1173
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,907
Well, that'’s good.
Maybe you can explain

1174
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,735
what this was doing
in the crapper
of his motel room.

1175
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:52,345
What is it?That'’s
a human tongue.

1176
01:09:11,712 --> 01:09:13,105
Oh, wow.

1177
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:15,977
This is amazing.

1178
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:31,341

[clatter]

1181
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,138
Hey. Hi.

1182
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:50,447
You folks
coming or going?

1183
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,839
[Jake]
Coming or going?

1184
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:53,754
State line.
You coming in
or going out?

1185
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:56,017
Going out.

1186
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:57,845
Gonna go
visit my mom.

1187
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:00,196
Oh. How is
the little
lady?

1188
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,153
She'’s old.

1189
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,200
She'’s beautiful,
though.

1190
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:07,464
Tired.

1191
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,727
Tired, huh? Well,
maybe she could use

1192
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,728
a little snake oil.

1193
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:11,772
Snake oil?

1194
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:12,904
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,122
What does that do?

1196
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,516
Just about anything
you want it to.

1197
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,997
But, uh, mostly
just gives you
a nice buzz.

1198
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,042
[phone rings]My wife
loves the stuff.

1199
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:22,696

right up.

[exhales]
But...

1202
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:31,531
100 and some proof,
you can'’t really
call it...

1203
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:33,490
snake oil.
It-- you know.

1204
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,666
Bernie.
Got a phone call.

1205
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,233
Mmhh.Sheriff Noonan.

1206
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,061
[Bernie]
Sheriff Noonan.
Well...

1207
01:10:40,105 --> 01:10:43,369
Heh. You might
not know it
to look at me,

1208
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:45,850
but I'’m a pretty
important person
around these parts here.

1209
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:48,156
You-- Junior. Junior'’ll
take care of you.

1210
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:52,335
[Bernie]
Yeah, Frank?

1211
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:54,337
[Bernie]
Mm-hmm.

1212
01:10:58,515 --> 01:10:59,211
Yeah?

1213
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,999
Uh, yeah,
dinner sounds great.

1214
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:06,784
[chuckles] Yeah.

1215
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:09,047
Can I help you
find something?

1216
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:13,747
I need...a shovel.

1217
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,749
[Bernie]
Sure.

1218
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:19,797
I'’ll be over
for dinner later,
Frank. Yeah.

1219
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,234
That sounds good.
Bye-bye.

1220
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:28,980
Ha ha! You folks
been taken care of?

1221
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,199
Needs a shovel, Bern.

1222
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:32,897
Well, we
got all kinds.
We-- We got--

1223
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,203
We got all kinds
back there. You just--

1224
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:37,510
All-- All depends
on what you need it for,

1225
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,904
not that that'’s
any of my business.

1226
01:11:39,947 --> 01:11:42,646
I want it to...
dig a hole.

1227
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,125
Hey, Jake!

1228
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:46,737
So what do you think?

1229
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,306
Very nice.

1230
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:51,524
Aw, you'’re
just sayin'’ that.

1231
01:11:51,568 --> 01:11:53,309
I got a list
of them.

1232
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,963
I-- I got a list
of...the kinds
we got.

1233
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,574
Uh, inventory'’s
in the back, Bern.

1234
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:59,402
No.
I got it... here.
I got a list--

1235
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,099
Did it last night,
Bern.

1236
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:02,492
It'’s in the back.[chuckles]

1237
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:03,841
Don'’t-- Don't
ever own a store.

1238
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:06,191
Your brain goes to hell
in a shit bucket.

1239
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,194
[cocks trigger]
What'’s this?

1240
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:11,979
[chuckles]
What'’s this? What were
you gonna do with this?

1241
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,155
I wasn'’t doing nothing.What were you
gonna do with this?

1242
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:15,548
Come on out.
You, too. Out here.I wasn'’t doing nothing.

1243
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:16,680
Swear to God.

1244
