00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,435
YOU HAVE SO NOT EARNED
THE RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS.

180
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,453
WHY WOULD YOU
LEAD THIS GUY ON?

181
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,790
YOU GOT BETTER OPTIONS.
YOUR BEST OPTION'S RIGHT HERE.

182
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,457
HE'S DOING ME A FAVOR.

183
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,960
YOU SEEM SMART ENOUGH. WHY DON'T
YOU WRITE YOUR OWN PAPERS?

184
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,628
BECAUSE I CAN GET HIM TO.

185
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,964
I HAD GUYS LIKE THAT
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

186
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,867

SHE REALLY LIKES
SITTING THERE.

205
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,683
I SAT THERE

206
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,185

00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,758
YOU SHOULD GO IN ANYWAYS.

224
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,179
YEAH, NO, THOUGH, 'CAUSE,
UM, 'CAUSE I'M SCARED OF HER,

225
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,181
SO, YEAH.

226
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,183
BESIDES, ANG-ANGELA
NEEDS HER TIME.

227
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,935
WELL, YOU CAN WAIT
IN MY ROOM,

228
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,489
AND THAT'S NOT
A PICKUP LINE OR ANYTHING.

229
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,657
I LIKE

230
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:59,743

238
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:22,866

ROOMMATE. (clears throat)

244
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,312
DID I INTERRUPT SOMETHING?

245
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,164
NO.

246
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,766
GAVIN, YOU STAY.

247
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,135
I- I-I CAN-I CAN TAKE CARE

248
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,853

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,112
I SHOULD GO. BYE.

252
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,516
SHE'S SHY...

253
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,868
AND KIND OF A FREAK.

254
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,438
(chuckles)

255
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,657
HE IS SO PAINFULLY

PLAYING HARD TO GET?

259
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,518
UM, NO, I AM HARD TO GET.

260
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,520
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
(laughs)

261
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:19,523
I... I'M JUST-

262
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,459

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,042
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THERE!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

270
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,627
THERE'S-THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN THE BATHROOM.
OKAY.

271
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:04,995
THERE'S SOMEONE-

272
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,264
(Tim) WHAT'S WRONG?
JENNY SAW SOMEONE
IN THE BATHROOM.

273
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:08,999
ARE-ARE YOU SURE?

274
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,734
IF SHE SAYS SHE IS,
SHE IS.

275
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,286
YOU TOLD ME
I COULD GO IN NOW.
(laughter)

283
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,859
HEY, JENNY.
OH.

YOU ARE A CREEP.

286
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,649
I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOU.

287
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,236
WAIT, SO YOU WANTED THAT GUY
TO WALK IN ON SOMEBODY?

288
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,787
HE'S LONELY.

THAT'S WHAT I DO.

290
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,476
YOU'RE DISGUSTING. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE.
IT'S WELCOME WEEK.

291
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,812
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PULL PRANKS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

292
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,580
OKAY, WOULD IT HELP

293
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:16,800
IF I SAID THAT I AM SORRY
THAT I TARGETED YOU?

294
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,820
BAD JUDGMENT CALL. WHAT?
UM, NO.

295
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,672
I'M A DICK.
I CROSSED THE LINE.

296
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,241
I AM SORRY. I-I WON'T
DO IT TO YOU AGAIN.

297
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,660
AND WHY SHOULD I
TRUST YOU?

298
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:31,481
I PROMISE NOT TO BE A DICK
AGAIN, SO SAFE, RIGHT?

299
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:34,151
CAN I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?
HOW?

300
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,953
THERE'S STILL TIME TO SIGN UP
FOR THE SCAVENGER HUNT.

00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:17,581
DID ANGELA TELL YOU?

354
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,383
YEAH.

355
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,386
SHE KINDA TOLD EVERYBODY
ABOUT YOU BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

356
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,888
NICE.

357
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,890
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT

358
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,893
IF I TOLD YOU THAT
I'M KINDA GLAD SHE DID?

359
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:34,831
¶¶ AND THE NOISE DROWNS ME ¶¶

360
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:38,151

361
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:40,287
¶¶ HASN'T FOUND ME A WAY ¶¶

362
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,256
¶¶ DON'T WANT
TO BE FULL OF MYSELF ¶¶

363
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:45,759
¶¶ JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ¶¶

364
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,761
¶¶ IT'S GETTING HARDER... ¶¶

365
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,096
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I DON'T KNOW.

366
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,748
¶¶ TO BE ANYTHING
BUT ORDINARY ¶¶

367
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,618
DO YOU WANT
TO HOLD MY HAND?
I DO.

368
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,620
UM, THIS.

369
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,622
DO YOU WANT SOME-
SOME SORT OF BACON?

370
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,457

(ring)
THEN I'VE LOST.

391
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,173

394
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:18,034
HI, MOM.

395
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,986
NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

396
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:24,007
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
I LOVE NEW YORK.

397
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,309
YEAH, I-I EVEN
BOUGHT THE T-SHIRT.

398
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,311
(laughs) YEAH.

399
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:30,297
LISTEN, I HAVE
TO GO, THOUGH,

400
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,799
BECAUSE, UM, THERE'S
A NEW STUDENT BARBECUE,

401
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,385
SO, UM, I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

402
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:37,104
YEAH, YEAH.

403
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,089
TELL-TELL DAD
I SAID HI.

404
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,659
I LOVE YOU, TOO. BYE.

405
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:50,617
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ACTRESS IN THIS ROOM.

406
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:53,954
(scoffs) YES, BUT THIS ONE
HAS AN AUDITION TOMORROW,

407
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,573
YOU'RE LEAVING SCHOOL?

408
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:00,675
HELLO,
IT'S A BROADWAY SHOW.

409
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,495
IF I BOOK IT,
I WILL NOT NEED COLLEGE.

410
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:07,215
HEY, ANGELA.
NOT INTERESTED,
NOT ANYMORE.

411
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,217
HEY, GUYS.

412
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:11,519
LOOK, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
MUCH FUN THIS IS GONNA BE.

413
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,539
DON'T EVEN-NO IDEA.
IT-IT'S GONNA BE LIKE CAMP.

414
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,875
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY PEOPLE
THINK YOU'RE UNAPPROACHABLE!

415
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,728
OH!

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

¶¶ WHERE I'LL BE
COME TOMORROW ¶¶

423
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:47,004
¶¶ BUT TONIGHT ¶¶

424
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:49,124
¶¶ I'M HERE WITH YOU... ¶¶

425
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,825
OW.

426
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:53,762
OH, I'M SORRY.
OW.

427
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,764
SORRY.

428
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,999
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

429
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,437
MM. IT'S A HAND-ME-DOWN
FROM MY BROTHER.

430
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:07,458
¶¶ SO TONIGHT ¶¶

431
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:12,130
¶¶ I AM HERE FOR YOU ¶¶

432
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:15,484

¶¶ DON'T RUN AWAY,
AND DON'T LOSE YOUR BREAKFAST ¶¶

LOOK HIM IN THE EYE ¶¶

436
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:50,117
¶¶ BE A LITTLE WHILE... ¶¶

437
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:52,119
YEAH, I-I DON'T-I DON'T
WANT TO BE HER PARTNER.

438
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,622
OH, COME ON. YOU GET TO BE
WITH A SOPHOMORE.

439
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,325
SHE'S A LOT OF FUN,
TRUST ME. I DID HER.
YEAH, RIGHT.

440
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:59,527
PAULA.

441
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:01,962
NO.
I THINK
THAT THE SCAVENGER HUNT

442
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:05,200
WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT STORY
FOR THE "DAILY YORKER."

443
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,452
RELEVANT TO ME HOW?

444
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:09,754
I CAN, UH,
GET YOU ON STAFF.

445
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:11,539
YOU COULD GET ME
ON THE PAPER?

446
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,541
GOD, PAULA,
FOR SOMEONE SO TOUGH,

447
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,660
YOU CAN BE SO NAIVE.

448
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,795
OH, PLUS I SCORED
WHITE STRIPES TICKETS

449
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,380
FOR THE PRIZE.

450
00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:20,799
BACKSTAGE PASSES, TOO.

451
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,801
YOU KNOW, I HAVE IT
ON STRONG AUTHORITY

452
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,785
THAT SOME EXECS
FROM WARNER MUSIC

453
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:27,005
ARE GOING TO BE THERE.

454
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:29,640
IF YOU WIN THE TICKETS,

455
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:32,494
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE HER,
OKAY? TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE.

456
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:33,995
OH, HEY, CAMILLE.

457
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:36,314
WHOA, THAT-THAT-
THAT CONCERT'S SOLD OUT.

458
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,698
EVEN MY DAD'S FIRM

459
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:40,818
CAN'T GET THEIR HANDS ON TICKETS
TO THE WHITE STRIPES CONCERT.

460
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,005
THE WINNING TEAM
GETS THE TICKETS.

461
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,306
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

462
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:46,991
HE SAID HE'S GONNA WIN
THE SCAVENGER HUNT,

463
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:49,344
OH, AND CAMILLE.
YOU GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN?

464
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,145
YEAH, CHAPPY, ARE YOU
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN?

465
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:53,214
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

466
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:55,266
IF YOU'RE THE WINNER.

467
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,101
I'M IN.

468
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:59,721
NOBODY'S GETTING THEIR HANDS
ON ANYTHING BUT ME.

469
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,206
I'LL DO IT.

470
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:03,825
I'LL PLAY YOUR
LITTLE GAME, TIM.

471
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:09,314
I...

472
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:32,170
THAT MAN HAS
BECOME A PUTZ.

473
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,038
(sighs)

474
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:42,363
YOU HAVE BEEN
REALLY PATIENT WITH ME.

475
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,549
THANK YOU.

476
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,468
HEY, I WAS THERE.

477
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:50,155
BUT YOU HANDLE IT
WAY BETTER THAN I DO.

478
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:53,190
WELL, FOR ONE,
I LEAVE MY ROOM.

479
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:56,928
OKAY, IF YOU-IF YOU WANT TO GO
ON THE SCAVENGER HUNT THING,

480
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,096
THEN GO,

481
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:01,683
WIN THE CONCERT TICKETS.

482
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:04,068
WILL YOU LEAVE YOUR ROOM
TO GO WITH ME?

483
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:05,987
MM.

484
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:08,039
I DON'T WANT THE TICKETS,

485
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,108
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
ON SOME STUPID SCAVENGER HUNT

486
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,010
WITHOUT YOU.

487
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,415
BUT...

488
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,150
YOU CAN'T STAY IN HERE
FOREVER, JENNY.

489
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:21,485
STOPPING YOUR LIFE
LIKE THIS

490
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,105
MEANS YOU'RE NO BETTER OFF
THAN YOUR SISTER.

491
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:27,575
HOW COULD YOU
SAY THAT...

492
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,394
TO ME?

493
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:33,063
BECAUSE I SAY IT
TO MYSELF EVERY DAY.

494
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,555
IT'S LIKE...

495
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,126
IF I GO OUTSIDE,
I'LL GET KILLED.

THING YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

498
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:53,751
NO,

499
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,754
BECAUSE YOU COULD BE KILLED
INSIDE THE ROOM.

500
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,256
YOU'RE BAD.

501
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,575
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
HOW I GET THROUGH IT.

502
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:02,810
YOU GOTTA HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

503
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,479
SO DID YOU...

504
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,150
REALLY WANT TO GO
ON THAT SCAVENGER HUNT?

505
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,818

00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:58,743
OOH, OKAY,
SORRY, EVERYONE.

529
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,611
SORRY. SORRY, EVERYBODY.
SORRY I WAS LATE.

530
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:03,131
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T START
WITHOUT ME, BUT IF YOU DID,

531
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,917
I'M SURE SOMEBODY CAN CATCH
ME UP. ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

532
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:08,686
WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.
OH, GOOD. DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY I WAS LATE?

533
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:10,088
NO.
NO.

534
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,173
I TOTALLY STOOD IN LINE
FOR THE OPEN CALL

535
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:14,676
FOR "SPRING AWAKENING."
OH, WOW, DID YOU GET
TO "SING" FOR THEM?

536
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,511
UH, "THAT'S
SO NOT THE POINT."

537
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:18,346
DOES HE HAVE
TO BE MY PARTNER?

538
00:30:18,347 --> 00:30:20,014
HE SO DOESN'T GET ME,

539
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,016
AND, P.S., YOU HAVE GOT
TO MAKE A COSTUME CHANGE

540
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:24,519
BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEN
ANYWHERE IN THE CITY NEAR ME.

541
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,505
BUT THIS IS
MY "JOHNNY DEPP"-
IT IS
UNFORTUNATELY WRONG.

542
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,740
ALL WE'RE MISSING
IS GAVIN AND JENNY.

543
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,409
OH, YEAH, SHE CAME OUT,
UNLIKE CERTAIN PEOPLE WE KNOW.

544
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,312
(giggles)
(imitates
AnGELa's giggle)

545
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:37,581
HI, GUYS.

546
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:40,651
(sighs)
WHERE'S GAVIN?

547
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:43,370
WELL, YOU-YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.
START WITHOUT HIM.
IT'S FIVE AFTER.

548
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,990
HE SAID
HE WOULD BE HERE.

549
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,442
IS SHE GONNA FREAK OUT?

550
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:51,212
OH, NO, SHE DOESN'T FREAK OUT.
SHE IMPLODES.

551
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:53,931
GUYS, I AM RIGHT HERE.
I'M NOT DEAF.

552
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:56,150
I'M BACK. LET'S START.

553
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:58,636
YOU ALL, THIS GAME'S SUPPOSED
TO BRING US CLOSER, OKAY?

554
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:01,138
YOU KNOW, SORRY, JENNY,
WE GOTTA START.

555
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:04,609
OKAY, YOU CAN FILL IN GAVIN
WHEN HE GETS HERE, ALL RIGHT?

556
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,478
WELCOME, EVERYONE,

557
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,747
TO THE 12 TO 12
SCAVENGER HUNT.

558
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:11,916
(cheering)
(speaking indistinctly)

559
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:34,589
SO ALL OF YOU
CHECK YOUR CELL PHONES.

560
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,091
YOU SHOULD ALL BE
RECEIVING A MESSAGE

561
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:38,792
FROM RED HOOK.

562
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:41,262
(cell phones ringing)
I DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.

563
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:44,315
YEAH, I JUST
SENT IT TO YOU.
OH, NO,
I MEAN FROM GAVIN.

564
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,851
HE SAID THAT HE WAS
GONNA BE HERE AT NOON,

565
00:31:46,852 --> 00:31:50,337
AND HE'S NOT HERE, SO...
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

566
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:52,590
(scoffs) FREAK.
SAVE RED HOOK
TO YOUR PHONE BOOK.

567
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,226
TRUST ME.
GONNA COME IN VERY HANDY.

568
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,094
NOW EACH OF YOU
SHOULD HAVE A CLUE,

569
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,096
SOME THE SAME,
SOME DIFFERENT.

570
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:01,532
YOU MAY INTERSECT ONE ANOTHER,
YOU MAY NOT.

571
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,450
YOU EACH HAVE 12 TO SOLVE.

572
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:06,870
"WASHINGTON SQUARE ARCH."
THAT'S OUR FIRST CLUE.
SHH!

573
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:09,090
SO SHE THINKS. WHEN YOU
ACTUALLY FIND OUT THE CLUE,

574
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,792
YOU GO TO A LOCATION
WHERE YOU LOOK FOR AN OBJECT.

575
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:14,561
A POM-POM?
WAIT, THAT'S-THAT'S NOT
THE OBJECT IN THE CLUE, IS IT?

576
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,464
LET'S LISTEN, PEOPLE.

577
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:18,466
YOU THEN HAVE TO TAKE
A PICTURE OF YOURSELF

578
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,468
WITH THE OBJECT
AT THE LOCATION

579
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:23,004
AND THEN SEND IT
VIA TEXT MESSAGE TO RED HOOK.

580
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,272
I WILL THEN TEXT YOU BACK

581
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:28,659
WITH YOUR NEXT CLUE TO YOUR NEXT
LOCATION AND OBJECT AND SO ON.

582
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,111
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO...

583
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:33,047
GRANT'S TOMB WITHOUT GAVIN.

584
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:36,851
OKAY, FOR THOSE OF US
WHO ARE GOING TO PLAY,

585
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,335
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

586
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,188
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S 12 TO 12.

587
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:42,190
THE FIRST TEAM TO GET

588
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:46,227
TO THE FINAL DESTINATION
BY MIDNIGHT WINS.

589
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:48,445
WHERE IS THAT?
HE'S NOT GONNA TELL US.

590
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:51,431
IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT. WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO FIGURE IT OUT.

591
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:53,284
I'LL GIVE YOU PART
OF THE ANSWER, OKAY?

592
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,953
FOR ALL OF YOU, YOUR FIRST
LOCATION IS IN MANHATTAN.

593
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,956
IT'S NOT FAR FROM CAMPUS,
BUT BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT,

594
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,724
YOU WILL FIND YOUR WAY
TO A LOCATION

595
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,660
IN ONE OF
THE OTHER FOUR BOROUGHS.

596
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,063
THE WINNING TEAM
GETS THE TICKETS.

597
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,565
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE FLOOR SPIRIT?

598
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,700
(laughs uncomfortably)
HUH? FLOOR SPIRIT!

599
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:11,435
FLOOR SPIRIT, COME ON!

600
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:14,238
COME ON, IT'S ALL PART OF
THE BONDING. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

601
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,591
HONEY, HONEY, HONEY.

602
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:19,777
ALL RIGHT,
ONE, TWO, THREE...

603
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,695
(all) BREAK!

604
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:24,549
(laughs)
ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY,
WHERE'S YOUR CLOSET?

605
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,300
YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

606
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:28,002
OH... (laughs)

607
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:30,004
CRAP. I GOTTA
GO PLANT A...

608
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:33,073
YEAH, LIKE I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT THE CLUE IS.

609
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:38,379
(cell phone rings)

610
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,297
HI, GAVIN, IT'S JENNY.

611
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:42,366
UH, I GOT THE FIRST CLUE,

612
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,535
BUT I NEED A NEW YORKER
TO HELP FIGURE IT OUT,

613
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:48,405
SO COULD YOU CALL ME?

614
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:05,189
SEE?
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID PIANO BAR.

615
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,692
UM, I WAS
IN THE RIGHT VICINITY-

616
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:10,194
THE WEST VILLAGE,
A PIANO AND A BAR.

617
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:13,197
SO WHAT THE HELL DOES
"SING FOR THE CAMERA" MEAN?

618
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,332
DO YOU PLAY THE PIANO?
DEPENDS.

619
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,684
GIVE ANGELA YOUR PHONE.

620
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,187
OKAY, BUT I HAD
TO DESIGN FIVE WEB SITES

621
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,189
TO AFFORD
THAT PHONE, SO...
EXACTLY.

622
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,192
TIM KNOWS YOU HAVE A VIDEO
PHONE. SING FOR THE CAMERA.

623
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:26,694
HI, COULD YOU
DO US A FAVOR?

624
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:28,729
(sighs)
OH, YAY.

625
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,865
HELLO, NEW YORK.

626
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:34,869
LIVE FROM THE DUPLEX...

627
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,238
SO, SERIOUSLY, THAT
PHONE'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.

628
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,574
HOW DO YOU
USE THIS THING?

629
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,442
(hums)

630
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:44,445
¶¶ IS THIS THING ON? ¶¶

631
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:46,447
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THIS?

632
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:49,083
SOME KID CAME BY A WEEK AGO,
TALKED TO THE NIGHT GUY,

633
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:50,751
CONVINCED HIM
TO LET OUR PLACE

634
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,337
BE A PART
OF THE SCAVENGER HUNT THING.

635
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,340
NOW WAS THE KID
REALLY, REALLY CUTE?
A REGULAR BRAD PITT.

636
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,976
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS PICTURED TIM
AS MORE OF AN ADAM BRODY TYPE.

637
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,445
YEAH.

638
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,364
(scoffs) THIS IS SO TIM.

639
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,566
HIT IT.
MM-HMM.

640
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,102
OKAY.
¶¶ OH, AN INTERNET CAFé ¶¶

641
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:10,471
¶¶ IS THE NEXT PLACE
YOU'VE GOTTA SEEK ¶¶

642
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:12,823
¶¶ THERE'S A GIRL
BEHIND THE COUNTER THERE ¶¶

643
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:14,825
¶¶ WHOSE NAME
IS QUITE UNIQUE ¶¶

644
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,327
¶¶ FIND ASMERET ¶¶

645
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:19,247
¶¶ IT MIGHT NOT BE EASY,
BUT ASMERET HAS A HINT FOR YOU ¶¶

646
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,749
¶¶ SHE'LL HAND YOU A CD ¶¶

647
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,752
¶¶ OH, GO ANGELA
AND HIGGINBOTHAM, TOO ¶¶

648
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:27,255
¶¶ GET YOUR ASSES
OFF THAT STAGE ¶¶

649
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:31,259
¶¶ AND FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER CLUE ¶¶

650
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,261
(laughs)

651
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:35,263
OKAY.

652
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:37,198
ARE YOU COMING?

653
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,202
DON'T FORGET MY PURSE.

654
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:45,939
(Jenny) HI, IT'S ME AGAIN.

655
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,824
I FEEL LIKE A STALKER.

656
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:50,327
UM, CALL ME.

657
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:53,830
WELL, ACTUALLY, DON'T CALL ME.
JUST COME TO MY DORM ROOM.

658
00:35:53,831 --> 00:35:57,834
PAULA AND ROY ARE GONNA WIN
THE SCAVENGER HUNT ANYWAY.

659
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:59,836
I... (sighs)

660
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:03,774
I- I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU.

661
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:06,093
(sighs)

662
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:08,212
(cell phone rings)

663
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:12,482
THANK YOU, TIM.

664
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:28,049
I AM NOT PICKING UP A USED
CONDOM FROM THE GROUND.

665
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,550
UGH, DIRT.

666
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:31,552
YEAH, BUT THE CLUE SAYS

667
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:34,055
WE NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING MADE OF LATEX.

668
00:36:34,056 --> 00:36:36,573
WAIT, I HAVE A CONDOM
IN MY PURSE.

669
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,558
BUT IT HAS TO BE USED.

670
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,979
HMM.

671
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,981
(scoffs)

672
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:45,916
(knock on door)

673
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,394
(cell phone rings)

674
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,130
(sighs)

675
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,898
WHAT, WHAT?

676
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,936
GAVIN?

677
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:08,723
TIM?

678
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,293
I TOLD YOU WE WERE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

679
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,045
LET'S JUST GET THE CLUE.

680
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:33,714
TIM SENT THE P.D.F. HERE, SO IT
SHOULD PRINT OUT BEHIND US.

681
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:36,050
I KNOW MY WAY AROUND
A NEWSPAPER OFFICE.

682
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,869
I WAS EDITOR.
YEAH, THIS IS
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

683
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,871
AND WHILE I'M HERE,

684
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,373
WHO CAN I TALK TO
ABOUT AN INTERNSHIP?

685
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,676
(scoffs)

686
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,611
LEAD THE WAY.

687
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:53,350
UM, NEED HELP?
I GOT IT.

688
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,785
(clears throat)

689
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,888
PAULA, LOOK AT HER.

690
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:01,175
IT'S CAMILLE.

691
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:04,778
YOU KNOW, I CAN-

692
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,681
I CAN KINDA SEE WHY
THE FAGS LIKE DOIN' IT HERE.
CHAPPY.

693
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:09,583
WHAT? I HEARD
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

694
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:12,420
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, LIKE,
WHY DO THE DUDES DOING DUDES

695
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:15,556
GET TO BE THE ONLY ONES
WHO GET TO ENJOY THE OUTDOORS?
I DON'T KNOW.

696
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,441
COULD BE KINDA HOT
DOING IT IN PUBLIC.

697
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:19,443
YEAH, KNOWING
YOU CAN GET CAUGHT.

698
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:20,945
AND ARRESTED.

699
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:22,947
DIRTY.
THE GROUND IS SOFT.

700
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:24,748
OH, YOU OKAY?

701
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:28,135
YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

702
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:30,137
(clears throat)

703
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:33,573
SO, UH, WHERE ARE WE-WHERE ARE
WE GONNA FIND A USED CONDOM?

704
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:35,575
AROUND...

705
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:39,363
HERE.

706
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:45,185
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

707
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:47,104
THE SOONER WE GET IT,

708
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:49,590
THE SOONER WE CAN
WIN THOSE TICKETS.

709
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:51,459
(chuckles)

710
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:56,780
(chuckles)
(giggles)

711
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:05,723
OH, WHOA, IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS BEEN HERE.

712
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,658
GOD, IT'S DIRTY.

713
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,323
(Roy)
THAT'S REALLY CREEPY.

714
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:25,259
(Paula) YEAH.

715
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:31,281
TIM IS REALLY GOOD
AT PHOTOSHOP.

716
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:34,185
"COMING TO A VIDEO STORE
NEAR YOU"?

717
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:38,055
OH, LOOK, HE PUT OUR NAMES
ON TWO BOOTS.
WHY?

718
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,174
OH, I GET IT.
TWO BOOTS-UH, THE-

719
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:42,309
THE PIZZA PLACE.
DO I EXIST?

720
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,561
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH A VIDEO STORE?

721
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:47,114
TWO BOOTS
IN THE EAST VILLAGE-

722
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:49,249
THEY SHOW MOVIES.
EXCUSE ME?

723
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,318
TWO BOOTS.
OH, I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

724
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,171
I JUST DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE
WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP US

725
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:55,822
ON A SCAVENGER HUNT.

726
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:57,725
I GOT WORK TO DO,
AND YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

727
00:39:57,726 --> 00:40:02,012
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.
LET'S GET A PICTURE.

728
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:06,333
(clears throat)
OH.

729
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,902
(camera shutter clicks)

730
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:12,739
(giggles)
(chuckles)

731
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,908
OH, MY-OH, MY GOD.

732
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:19,529
I WOULD KILL TO SEE TIM'S FACE
WHEN HE GETS OUR PICTURE.

733
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,984
(cell phone rings)

734
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:25,853
(ring)
(cell phone rings)

735
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:28,856
WHO IS THAT?
MUST BE THE NEXT CLUE.

736
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:31,859
NO, NO, THE CLUE CAME
ON MY PHONE.

737
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,861
WHO-WHO THE HELL
IS ASMERET?

738
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:36,363
THEN I MUST HAVE GOTTEN
A WRONG NUMBER.

739
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,866
THEN WHY DID YOU
TURN IT OFF SO FAST?

740
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,368
ARE YOU ALWAYS
THIS CRANKY AFTER SEX?

741
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,370
YEAH, I GUESS.

742
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:45,873
OH, MY GOD. (scoffs)

743
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,875
IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME?

744
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:49,877
CAMILLE, WHO TEXTED YOU?

745
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,879
NO ONE.
GIVE IT UP, OKAY?

746
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,882
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WEREN'T AT HOME
WITH A COLD THE OTHER NIGHT.

747
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,967
(sighs) WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

748
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,719
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

749
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,156
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUT OF HERE. YOU...

750
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:04,158
I'M GONNA GO FIND
THE NEXT CLUE.

751
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,660
IF YOU WANT
TO FIGURE IT OUT,

752
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:09,163
YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME.

753
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:11,748
(scoffs)

754
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:28,699
CHAPPY?

755
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:34,772
(sighs)

756
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:38,275
COME ON,
GIVE ME MY SHIRT.

757
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:41,712
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

758
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,451
NOW IT'S EVEN DIRTIER.

759
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:49,586
(gasps)

760
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,521
(knock on door)

761
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,374
(footsteps retreating)

762
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:02,833
(door squeaks)

763
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:11,625
(cell phone rings)

764
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:13,827
STILL NO SIGN?

765
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:15,979
GOOD GOD, TIM. WHAT-

766
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,432
OH. (chuckles)
PLANTING CLUES.

767
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,634
WHY'D YOU SEND ME
THOSE TEXT MESSAGES?

768
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:23,854
THEY'RE YOUR CLUES
TO START THE GAME.

769
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:26,139
BUT GAVIN WAS NOT
IN HIS ROOM,

770
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,909
AND WHY DID YOU
SEND ME "OOPS"?

771
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,261
THAT WAS
REALLY, REALLY CRUEL.
IT WASN'T ME.

772
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:33,664
THE MESSAGES ARE
FROM RED HOOK.

773
00:42:33,665 --> 00:42:36,149
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW. "OOPS"
IS ONE OF MY QUICK NOTES.

774
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,618
I MIGHT HAVE ACCIDENTALLY
SENT THAT INSTEAD OF A CLUE.

775
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:40,554
ALL THE CLUES ARE
PROGRAMMED IN, SEE?

776
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:43,557
"GAVIN IS IN HIS ROOM."
MUST HAVE BEEN
AN OLD MESSAGE.

777
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:46,609
LOOK, IT HAD-IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR FIRST CLUE.

778
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,129
GRANT'S TOMB?
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
YOU'RE PRETTY MORBID.

779
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,165
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

780
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,667
I INTENTIONALLY MATCHED
ALL OF THE CLUES

781
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:56,703
WITH EACH PERSON
IN THE GAME.

782
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,972
UM, I DON'T GET IT.

783
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:01,207
ALL THE PICTURES THAT
EVERYONE IS SENDING ME-

784
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,143
I'M PUTTING THEM
ALL TOGETHER.

785
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:05,929
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MOVIE,
YOU KNOW, DRAMA, RIGHT?

786
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,014
LIKE, I HAVE IT SET UP

787
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:10,934
SO THE CHAPPY HAS TO MEET UP
WITH HIGGINBOTHAM AND ANGELA

788
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:13,437
AT AN INTERNET CAFé
FOR A SURPRISE CLUE.

789
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:15,939
WE GET TO SEE
HOW THEY GET ALONG.

790
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,241
SO WAIT,
WHAT KIND OF SITUATION

791
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:20,594
WERE YOU PLANNING
ON PUTTING ME AND GAVIN INTO?

792
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:23,664
I THOUGHT GRANT'S TOMB MIGHT
GET YOU ALL HOT FOR EACH OTHER.

793
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:26,666
DO YOU ACTUALLY
ENJOY BEING A DICK?
CUT YOUR LOSSES.
SO YOU GOT STOOD UP.

794
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,869
YOU STILL HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME

795
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,255
TO FIND ANOTHER PARTNER
FOR THE GAME.

796
00:43:31,256 --> 00:43:33,140
I GUARANTEE YOU
IT IS SO WORTH IT.

797
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:35,008
THE FINAL DESTINATION-
SO COOL.

798
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,010
TELL ME WHAT IT IS.
WHAT IS IT?

799
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:39,446
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO BE THERE BY MIDNIGHT.

800
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:41,715
A HINT, A HINT.

801
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:44,100
OH, THE HINT-
THE CLUE IS IN THE CLUES.

802
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,520
(gasps)
WAIT, WAIT,
SO ALL OF MY CLUES,

803
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:49,973
WHAT DID YOU SAY, THEY'RE-
THEY'RE GONNA BE MATCHED TO ME?

804
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,492
JOIN THE GAME
AND FIND OUT!
COME ON, GOD!

805
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,615
(breathing heavily)

806
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,919
JENNY!

807
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,439
(grunts)

808
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,642
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE CHASING JENNY

809
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:10,644
AND HOW THE HELL
YOU GOT IN?

810
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:12,996
IT'S OKAY DEENA, DEENA.

811
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:16,450
SO DO YOU, UH,
WANT TO TELL ME

812
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:19,920
WHY YOU'RE CHASING ME
AND HOW THE HELL YOU GOT IN?
UH, YEAH.

813
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:21,938
OW.
(speaking indistinctly)

814
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:23,440
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

815
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,343
YEAH, UM, YOUR PARENTS
WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

816
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:29,863
AND THEY KNEW I'D RETIRED UP
HERE, SO THEY CALLED ME.

817
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:31,548
(scoffs) WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME?

818
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,817
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM

819
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:36,703
LIKE THEY WERE
CHECKIN' UP ON YOU.

820
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:39,473
SO WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN I WAS BEING SHOT AT?

821
00:44:39,474 --> 00:44:42,492
SHOT AT?

822
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:49,647
JENNY, YOUR PARENTS
CALLED ME TWO DAYS AGO.

823
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:54,084
OKAY, THEN SOME-SOMEBODY
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ME AROUND

824
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:56,537
SINCE THE DAY
THAT I GOT HERE.

825
00:44:56,538 --> 00:45:01,041
OKAY, HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
NO? ANY DESCRIPTION?

826
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,978
UH, THAT'S THE THING.
I HAVEN'T-

827
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:06,481
I HAVEN'T REALLY
SEEN ANYBODY,

828
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:10,184
BUT IT'S JUST
THIS FEELING THAT I GET.

829
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,186
OR MAYBE I'M CRAZY.

830
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,655
AFTER WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

831
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:17,975
YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO JUMP
AT EVERY NOISE YOU HEAR.

832
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:21,812
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SHOW YOURSELF?

833
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,865
I WAS PUTTIN' YOUR PARENTS
BEFORE YOU, AND I'M SORRY.

834
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:27,284
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

835
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:29,821
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

836
00:45:29,822 --> 00:45:33,691
CAN YOU TELL MY PARENTS
THAT YOU LOST MY TRAIL

837
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:36,343
BECAUSE I STARTED
SELLING DRUGS,

838
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:38,045
AND I JOINED A CULT,

839
00:45:38,046 --> 00:45:40,080
AND MY PIMP REALLY
DOESN'T APPRECIATE

840
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:41,882
YOU FOLLOWING ME AROUND.

841
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:45,169
OKAY, I GET IT.

842
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,806
IF YOU NEED ME,
PLEASE, CALL ME.

843
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:51,025
I WILL.

844
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:53,277
I WILL CALL YOU
IF SOMETHING REAL HAPPENS.

845
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:55,079
OKAY.

846
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,816
AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
IN PRETTY GOOD HANDS

847
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:01,135
WITH, UH, ANNIE OAKLEY
HERE ANYWAY.
(chuckles)

848
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:03,137
YOU WERE LEAVING.

849
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,940
YEAH, YEAH.

850
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:08,142
THANK YOU.

851
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:16,150
LOOK AT YOU,
ALL GROWN UP.

852
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,152
EW.

853
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:22,089
BYE.

854
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:31,098
YEAH, AND YOU'RE WELCOME,
BY THE WAY.

855
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:33,084
(scoffs)

856
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:36,604
OH, THANK YOU
FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

857
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:40,057
(laughs)

858
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:42,293
OH, YEAH, DON'T WAIT UP.
DON'T BE SLOW.

859
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,378
ARE YOU GONNA TREAT ME
LIKE THIS ALL DAY?

860
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:46,313
HELL, ARE YOU GONNA
TREAT ME LIKE THIS

861
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:48,315
OUR WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER?
ARE YOU COMING IN?

862
00:46:48,316 --> 00:46:49,851
YEAH.

863
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:52,853
WELL, SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW YOUR
STALKER'S NOT REALLY A STALKER,

864
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:54,855
ARE YOU GONNA FINALLY
LEAVE YOUR ROOM?

865
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,357
YEAH, I'M TOTALLY CURED.

866
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:57,858
(scoffs)

867
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:00,361
IT SO WORKS THAT WAY.

868
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,730
OH, WHEN DID THAT
GET THERE?

869
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,877
HELLO, I CALLED YOU
ABOUT THE VIDEO DROP BOX.

870
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:19,213
WAIT, WHEN DID YOU-
WHEN YOU WERE NEGOTIATING
WITH THE CAB DRIVER,

871
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:20,698
I CALLED AHEAD.

872
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:22,216
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME

873
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,685
BECAUSE, WELL, HEARING ME'S
NOT ONE OF YOUR STRONG SUITS.

874
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:26,770
ANYWAY, UH, WE'RE HERE
ON A SCAVENGER HUNT

875
00:47:26,771 --> 00:47:28,973
THAT I'M SURE THAT OUR R.A.

876
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:30,925
TOLD SOMEONE HERE TO PUT
SOMETHING IN A VIDEO DROP BOX.

877
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:33,394
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST OPEN SAID DROP BOX,

878
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:35,963
WE'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR,

879
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:38,582
AND I'M SURE THAT SHE'LL BE
OUT OF YOUR HAIR EVEN SOONER,

880
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:41,168
'CAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS
FIVE PACES AHEAD OF ME.

881
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:44,071
YEP, THAT GUY
WAS JUST HERE.

882
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,226
WELL, SHOW US.

883
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:51,395
YEAH, APPARENTLY,
THIS IS A SCAVENGER HUNT.

884
00:47:51,396 --> 00:47:54,515
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK.

885
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:57,451
(Jenny)
I'M NOT OPENING IT.

886
00:47:57,452 --> 00:48:00,438
HINT-IF HE WAS GONNA
BREAK UP WITH YOU IN A LETTER,

887
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:02,940
HE'D LEAVE IT
ON YOUR DOOR.

888
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,717
THAT'S WEIRD.

889
00:48:30,718 --> 00:48:32,670
"FIND JENNY TRAYLOR."

890
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:34,605
(scoffs)

891
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:40,761
THIS HAD BETTER BE
THE RIGHT ONE,

892
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:43,414
'CAUSE IF I GO TO ANOTHER
INTERNET CAFé, I WILL SCREAM.

893
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:45,082
I WAS STARTING TO THINK

894
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,718
WE WERE NEVER GONNA FIND SOMEONE
REALLY NAMED ASMER-MER-MER...

895
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,253
(giggles)

896
00:48:49,254 --> 00:48:52,256
YOU MUST BE
FROM THE SCAVENGER HUNT.
YES, WE ARE.

897
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:54,758
WAIT, THAT'S MINE!
WE-WE GOT HERE FIRST.

898
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:57,761
HEY, HOW MANY OF THESE CAFéS
HAVE YOU BEEN TO?
SIX.

899
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:00,264
AND HOW MANY ASMERETS
HAVE YOU TALKED TO?

900
00:49:00,265 --> 00:49:02,200
ACTUALLY,
SHE IS THE FIRST. YOU?

901
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,602
SEVEN.
(laughs)

902
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,537
I HAVE OTHER CUSTOMERS.
OH.

903
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:13,828
IT'S TOO SMALL
FOR A DOOR.

904
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,832
I'M SO TIRED
OF TIM'S GAMES.

905
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,834
YEAH... (sighs)

906
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:23,337
UH, SINCE NO ONE WANTED TO BE
MY PARTNER FOR THE HUNT,

907
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,872
AND SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN STOOD UP,

908
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:28,325
YOU'RE AS BIG A LOSER
AS I AM.

909
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:31,328
I SAY WE SCREW 'EM ALL,
WIN THE TICKETS,

910
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:35,299
WIN THE HUNT,
GO TO THE CONCERT.

911
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,301
JACK WHITE COULD TURN ME.

912
00:49:37,302 --> 00:49:39,303
(Paula) OF COURSE
SHE'LL BE HERE.

913
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:41,238
SHE'S ALWAYS IN HER ROOM.

914
00:49:43,374 --> 00:49:46,043
HI.

915
00:49:48,546 --> 00:49:51,548
OH, PLEASE,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

916
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:53,450
(thud)

917
00:49:57,488 --> 00:49:59,940
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S A FINGER.

918
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:01,975
GOD.
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

919
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:04,161
DON'T-DON'T- DON'T TOUCH IT.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

920
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:06,180
OH!

921
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:13,487
"FOLLOW THE CLUES
AND GAVIN LIVES.

922
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:15,256
"FIND THE FINAL
DESTINATION

923
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:18,259
BEFORE GAVIN MEETS HIS."

924
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,761
OH, COME ON.

925
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:23,564
THIS IS NOT
A REAL FINGER.

926
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,567
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE THE CADAVER
WE STUDIED LAST SUMMER.

927
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,070
OH, AND I ASSUME
THE WRITING IS BLOOD?

928
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,572
THIS IS PLASTIC.
I- IT'S A SHARPIE.

929
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:35,676
REAL BLOOD WOULD BLEED.

930
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:38,012
HEY, WHERE'S CAMILLE?
BONING SOMEBODY ELSE,
I GUESS.

931
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:40,848
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I'M WINNING
THOSE TICKETS,

932
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:43,184
AND WHEN CAMILLE GETS
EXCITED THAT I DID,

933
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:45,186
I'M GONNA TAKE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

934
00:50:45,187 --> 00:50:47,188
TAKE ME. WE COULD
ALSO PISS OFF TIM.

935
00:50:47,189 --> 00:50:49,190
HEY, I THOUGHT
WE WERE A TEAM HERE.

936
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,859
OH, COME ON. YOU'D MOW ME
DOWN TO TAKE CAMILLE.

937
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,695
I- I WOULDN'T. I WOULD NOT.
I- I WOULDN'T.
YOU CAN HAVE HER.

938
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:56,630
WHICH HER,
CAMILLE OR ANGELA?

939
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,369
I'LL BE DONE
IN A MINUTE.
FABULOUS.

940
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,071
GAVIN COULD BE
REALLY HURT RIGHT NOW.

941
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:06,273
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT GAVIN'S
PROBABLY IN ON THIS, TOO.

942
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:09,876
IT IS NOT A JOKE. GAVIN WOULD
NOT CUT HIS OWN FINGER OFF.

943
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:12,646
IF IT EVEN IS A FINGER.
JENNY, IT LOOKS PRETTY...

944
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:14,849
(sniffs) FAKE TO ME.

945
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:22,906
NOW YOU WANT TO CALL THE COPS,
WE'LL CALL THE COPS.

946
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:25,876
I'M GONNA TAKE A PICTURE
OF THE FINGER AND ALL OF US.

947
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:28,595
COME ON. COME ON.

948
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:31,298
SO YOU REALLY
DON'T CARE ABOUT JENNY.

949
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:34,268
YOU JUST-YOU JUST
WANT TO WIN THE GAME.

950
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,103
(camera shutter clicks)

951
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:38,205
ACTUALLY, I DO CARE.

952
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:40,290
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET INTO

953
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:42,526
YET ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR "CRY WOLF" MOMENTS.

954
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:45,029
SERIOUSLY, I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

955
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,832
BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO GET
OVER THIS PARANOIA THING.

956
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,167
OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, SHE'S
KINDA RIGHT.

957
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:52,486
YOU DID THINK
LIEUTENANT FOX WAS A STALKER.

958
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:55,489
DOES ANYBODY THINK THAT MAYBE
GAVIN IS ACTUALLY IN TROUBLE?

959
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,509
AND THAT-THAT WHETHER
THIS FINGER IS REAL OR NOT,

960
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,012
THAT WE NEED
TO FIND HIM?
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
EITHER WAY,

961
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,914
TIM WAS
WAY OUT OF LINE.

962
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:06,466
(mumbles)
DON'T DELETE
THE PICTURE.

963
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:09,970
(cell phone rings)

964
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,989
TIM, IT-IT'S ROY.
PLEASE CALL ONE OF US BACK.

965
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:19,146
OH, MY GOD.

966
00:52:19,147 --> 00:52:22,766
IT'S GAVIN'S RING.
STAY CALM.

967
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:25,035
LET'S FIND TIM.

968
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:34,311
OKAY,
GO, GO, GO, GO.

969
00:52:36,547 --> 00:52:38,215
ALL RIGHT.
STICK IT IN.

970
00:52:38,216 --> 00:52:40,017
I KNOW. OKAY.

971
00:52:40,018 --> 00:52:42,303
TIMMY!

972
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,621
(scoffs)

973
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:46,840
OKAY.

974
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,899
COME ON. TIM!

975
00:53:05,893 --> 00:53:08,462
WHAT?

976
00:53:08,463 --> 00:53:11,998
HE'S NOT HERE.
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO LOOK.

977
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:14,301
HEY, IT'S...
(AnGELa and Higginbotham) WHAT?

978
00:53:32,704 --> 00:53:34,705
ARE YOU INSANE?

979
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:36,373
OH, COME ON.

980
00:53:36,374 --> 00:53:38,275
THIS IS TIM
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

981
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:41,078
TOTAL DRAMA QUEEN
CINEMA GEEK.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

982
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:43,581
LOOK AT THE TRIPOD LEG.
HE STAGED IT.
LOOK AT THE PICTURES.

983
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:45,916
THE GUY IN THE SWEATSHIRT'S
IN ON IT.

984
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:49,119
OH, HE IS SO OVER THE TOP.
I LOVE HIM.

985
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,788
(giggles)
WHAT DO WE DO?

986
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:53,457
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE WANTS ME
TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAME.

987
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,960
MEN AND THEIR GAMES. MM.

988
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:58,128
OKAY, TIM, I ADMIT IT.

989
00:53:58,129 --> 00:54:01,999
YOU GOT ME.
(giggles)

990
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,785
(cell phones rings)
OH.

991
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:08,455
I'M GOING BACK TO CAMPUS.
WE NEED TO FIND TIM.

992
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,491
COME ON. YOU DON'T
REALLY THINK HE'S DEAD.

993
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:11,992
IF HE'S NOT,

994
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:14,494
THEN WHY HASN'T HE
SENT US HIS NEXT CLUE?
(cell phone rings)

995
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:15,995
HA! SEE?

996
00:54:15,996 --> 00:54:18,665
"SAY OM WITH
'THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA.'"

997
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,318
"THE DRAMA BOOKS HOP."

998
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,671
"THE GATE"...
"OF HELL"...

999
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:27,007
"IS OPEN."

1000
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:28,942
THE GATE OF HELL
IS OPEN.

1001
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:31,611
NO, NOT "BOOKS HOP."
BOOK SHOP.

1002
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:32,863
THE DRAMA BOOKSHOP.

1003
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:34,798
IT'S WHERE TIM AND I
HAD OUR FIRST DATE.

1004
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:37,818
GOD, HE IS SO OBVIOUS
AND SO ALIVE. ARE YOU COMING?

1005
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:39,620
DOESN'T CAMILLE DO YOGA?

1006
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:41,705
YEAH, AT A PLACE CALLED
THE OHM STUDIO.

1007
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:44,325
AND YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER
AT ALL SINCE YOU LEFT HER?

1008
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,577
HELLO! WHO'S
COMING WITH ME?

1009
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:49,012
YOU GO AHEAD.
BYE, LOSERS.

1010
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:50,814
GATE OF HELL...

1011
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:53,434
HELLGATE.
THERE'S A BRIDGE.

1012
00:54:53,435 --> 00:54:56,253
YOU CAN SEE IT
FROM THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

1013
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:57,671
OKAY, I'M FROM THERE.

1014
00:54:57,672 --> 00:54:59,973
MY PARENTS HAVE A DOORMAN,
AND I WENT TO SPENCE. WHAT?

1015
00:54:59,974 --> 00:55:03,444
(cell phone rings)
DO YOU GUYS REALLY STILL THINK
THAT THIS IS JUST A GAME?

1016
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:06,013
IF IT IS,
I'M GONNA WIN IT.

1017
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:09,599
LOOK.
OH, GOD.

1018
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,952
WELL, WE BETTER
FIND HIM.
(cell phone rings)

1019
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:14,621
(sighs)

1020
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:18,124
"CALL THE COPS,
AND HER BOYFRIEND DIES."

1021
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,727
PRETTY CLEAR TO ME.
WHO SENT YOU
THAT TEXT?

1022
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:22,295
UM, RED HOOK.

1023
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:25,632
OKAY, PEOPLE,
TIM IS SOMEWHERE,

1024
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:28,151
AND HE'S STILL BEING
DORK DUNGEON-MASTER.

1025
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:31,605
I SAY WE KEEP PLAYING.
OKAY, BUT DEENA NEVER
SIGNED UP FOR THIS GAME.

1026
00:55:31,606 --> 00:55:34,024
IT'S TIM'S WAY
OF GETTING HER INVOLVED.
OKAY, OKAY.

1027
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:37,177
UM, VINDIGO SAYS THAT
THERE IS A BAR CALLED HELLGATE.

1028
00:55:37,178 --> 00:55:39,162
IT'S IN ASTORIA.
1230th AVENUE.

1029
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:41,398
SEE? IT'S A 12 THING.
(groans)

1030
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:43,316
I LOATHE ASTORIA.

1031
00:55:43,317 --> 00:55:45,352
SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO TO THE BAR.

1032
00:55:45,353 --> 00:55:48,572
(groans)
AND JENNY AND I WILL
WALK AROUND THE BRIDGE.

1033
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:51,374
ROY, WHERE IN ASTORIA
DID YOU SAY THAT BAR WAS?
PAULA!

1034
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,827
WHETHER IT'S A GAME
OR SOMETHING ELSE,

1035
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,345
WE HAVE TO WIN.

1036
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:58,732
I'M NOT FUCKING AROUND.
COME ON, ROY.

1037
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,637
YOU COMING?

1038
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:17,901
HEY, IF THERE'S
SOMETHING UP WITH CAMILLE,

1039
00:56:17,902 --> 00:56:20,537
I WANT TO KNOW.
HEY, DUDE, PLEASE.
YOU NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

1040
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:23,156
"HAD"?
OKAY, LISTEN.

1041
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,292
CAMILLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A RAMPANT SLUT,

1042
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:28,295
BUT SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE
IN HER WILDEST DREAMS

1043
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:30,463
LOWERED HERSELF
TO GET IT ON WITH YOU.

1044
00:56:30,464 --> 00:56:32,632
"MIGHT HAVE BEEN."
WHAT? IS SHE, LIKE, DEAD?

1045
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:35,802
SHE'S DEAD TO ME.
YOU WANT HER, YOU GOT HER.

1046
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:37,821
I'M GOING BACK TO CAMPUS.

1047
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:39,806
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIND TIM THERE.

1048
00:56:39,807 --> 00:56:41,508
WHY NOT?
IT'S GETTING LATE,

1049
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:43,594
AND HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY
AT THE FINAL DESTINATION.

1050
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:46,847
ARE YOU STILL
PLAYING THIS GAME?
HELL, YEAH.
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

1051
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:48,565
WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND ANGELA?

1052
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:51,468
THERE'S SOMEONE
WHO'D GET IT ON WITH YOU.

1053
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:55,289
CALL OR TEXT ME IF YOU
FIND OUT ANYTHING ON CAMILLE!

1054
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:38,582
OOH, I THINK...

OH.

1060
00:58:31,268 --> 00:58:33,637
UM, HELLO?

1061
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:36,005
SOMEBODY?

1062
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:38,675
OH, THEY'RE VINTAGE!

1063
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:42,178
OKAY, I GOT 'EM IN CHINATOWN,
BUT THEY'RE ONE OF A KIND.

1064
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:44,247
ANYONE?

1065
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:45,649

1085

SHE'S DEAD. SH-SHE-

1086
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:58,498

1087

BE HONEST.
(Jenny) YOU'RE
A BROKEN RECORD.

1093
01:01:31,432 --> 01:01:33,933
YES, DEENA, I REALLY THINK
THAT GAVIN IS IN TROUBLE.

1094
01:01:33,934 --> 01:01:37,337
THE PICTURE WAS REAL.
HOW CAN YOU TRUST GAVIN?

1095
01:01:37,338 --> 01:01:39,472
I JUST GET HIM, OKAY?

1096
01:01:39,473 --> 01:01:41,140
OKAY, THERE'S
NO CLUE HERE.

1097
01:01:41,141 --> 01:01:43,577
LET'S JUST MEET UP
WITH PAULA AND ROY.

1098
01:01:43,578 --> 01:01:46,513

¶¶ DON'T YOU SEE
IT AIN'T WORKIN'... ¶¶

1104
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:12,272
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?
WHAT NOISE?

1105
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:14,591
THERE WAS A NOISE.

1106
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:16,426
OKAY, I DON'T GET YOU.

1107
01:02:16,427 --> 01:02:18,294
YOU FREAK OUT
OVER EVERY NOISE,

1108
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:20,931
AND YET YOU TRUST
SOME KID YOU JUST MET.
SHH!

THANKS.
UH-HUH.

1113
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:45,989
WHAT WAS THAT?

1114
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,158
IT'S-I WAS
TEXTING CAMILLE.
WHY?

1115
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:50,827
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS IS WEIRD.

1116
01:02:50,828 --> 01:02:53,063
THAT POSTER
WITH THE PICTURE OF CAMILLE

1117
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:55,081
AND THE FINGER.
YEAH.

1118
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:56,666
I'M STARTING TO THINK

1119
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,835
GAVIN MIGHT REALLY BE
IN TROUBLE.

1120
01:02:58,836 --> 01:03:01,171
WOW.
COMPASSION BECOMES YOU.

1121
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:04,140
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT JENNY.

1122
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:07,109
OH. SURE, THAT, TOO.

1123
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,130
WAIT, WHAT?
OH, COME ON.

1124
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:11,915
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

1125
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,918
THIS WOULD MAKE
A GREAT STORY FOR THE PAPER.

1126
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,703
PRICELESS.

1127
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:18,955
REALLY, PAULA.
THANKS.

1128
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,657
I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.
OKAY.

1129
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:23,060
¶¶ IN THE MOONLIGHT
SOMETHING'S HIDING ¶¶

1130
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:24,761
(whispering)
THERE'S SOMEBODY OVER THERE.

1131
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:27,431
WHAT?
THERE'S SOMEBODY
OVER THERE.

1132
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:30,267
OKAY, I'LL GO LOOK.

1133
01:03:30,268 --> 01:03:33,069
(toilet paper roll squeaking)

1134
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,458
(cell phone rings)

1135
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:49,002

1136
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:53,907

GET OUT OF HERE!

1141
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,804
(chuckles)
(dog whimpers)

1142
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:27,040
THAT WAS AWESOME.
OH, MY GOD.

1143
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,958
I'LL GET IT.

1144
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:33,880
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

1145
01:04:33,881 --> 01:04:36,950
HE WAS MORE SCARED OF YOU
THAN WE WERE OF HIM.

1146
01:04:36,951 --> 01:04:38,785
YEAH.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

1147
01:04:38,786 --> 01:04:41,187
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1148
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,126
YOU'RE WELCOME,
BY THE WAY.

1149
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,995
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

1150
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,544
(Jenny) IF THERE IS
ONE THING I LEARNED-

1151
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:06,379
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE PARANOID,

1152
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,381
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE NOT AFTER YOU.

1153
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:09,883
UH...

1154
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:13,220
YEAH.

1155
01:05:13,221 --> 01:05:16,723
AND... YES.

1156
01:05:16,724 --> 01:05:18,675
YES?

1157
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:26,382
(chuckles)
Y- Y-YES, I TRUST YOU.

1158
01:05:26,383 --> 01:05:29,152
MM.

1159
01:05:33,474 --> 01:05:36,543
JENNY! DEENA!
ROY'S GONE!

1160
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:38,545
DID HE
FINALLY BREAK UP WITH YOU?

1161
01:05:38,546 --> 01:05:40,713
I DON'T KNOW.
H- HE WENT TO THE MEN'S ROOM.

1162
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,682
I WENT TO CHECK ON HIM.
HE'S NOT THERE.

1163
01:05:42,683 --> 01:05:44,617
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I'M CALLING LIEUTENANT FOX.

1167
01:05:51,142 --> 01:05:53,109
LOOKING FOR THE SHITHEAD
WHO KILLED CAMILLE.

1168
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:55,945
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
THE ONE DOING ALL THIS?
WHY WOULD I KILL HER?!

1169
01:05:55,946 --> 01:05:59,065
I'M GOING TO SEND
A TEXT MESSAGE TO RED HOOK.
WHY?

1170
01:05:59,066 --> 01:06:01,617
TO SEE IF YOUR CELL PHONE
GOES OFF.
AND WHILE YOU'RE WAITING,

1171
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:03,470
JENNY TRAYLOR'S GONNA
GET HERSELF KILLED!

1172
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:05,038
I HAVE TRIED CALLING JENNY

1173
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,840
A THOUSAND TIMES OVER
FROM ANGELA'S PHONE.

1174
01:06:06,841 --> 01:06:09,342
LOOK, MY CELL PHONE

1175
01:06:09,343 --> 01:06:12,061
D- DO YOU TRUST ME YET?
I HAVE ALL FIVE BARS.

1176
01:06:12,062 --> 01:06:13,696
OH.

01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,153
OKAY. SO WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

1178
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:21,704
(sighs)

1179
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:24,657
WE HAVE TO-WE HAVE TO FIND-
FIND THE FINAL DESTINATION.

1180
01:06:24,658 --> 01:06:26,826
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?
"THE-THE DESTINATION

1181
01:06:26,827 --> 01:06:28,795
IS THE CLUE."

1182
01:06:28,796 --> 01:06:30,864

OH, MY GOD.

1199
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:08,065
I'M AN IDIOT.

1200
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:13,170
BROOKLYN.
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE LYING.

1201
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,546
THEY DIDN'T SEND HIM.
WHAT?

1202
01:07:21,547 --> 01:07:24,966
I KNEW HE WAS A PSYCHO,
BUT HOW...
WHOEVER IS DOING THIS

1203
01:07:24,967 --> 01:07:27,434
HAS SOME SICK FASCINATION
WITH HER.

1204
01:07:27,435 --> 01:07:29,788
OKAY, BUT HOW WOULD HE KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

1205
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:31,605
'CAUSE MY PARENTS
GOT ME...

1206
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:33,941
(groans) A GPS PHONE
WHEN ELLEN WAS KILLED.

1207
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:36,010
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M PLAYING THEIR GAME.

1208
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,012
(camera shutter clicks)
SOMEBODY
OBVIOUSLY WANTS ME TO.

1209
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,997
(cell phones ring)

1210
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:42,300
"DON'T TAKE THE SUBWAY."
"DON'T TAKE A BUS."

1211
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:45,169
"SO PICK UP YOUR CAR
AND COME TO US."

1212
01:07:47,322 --> 01:07:50,958
(Jenny)
I FOUND THE CLUE.

1213
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:58,283
(groans)
I LOATHE BROOKLYN.
(cell phone rings)

1214
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:01,085
MOM?

1215
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:03,154
HELLO?
HELLO?

1216
01:08:03,155 --> 01:08:05,489
WHAT'S WRONG?
OKAY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

1217
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:08,326
WHERE-WHERE ARE YOU?
LISTEN TO ME,

1218
01:08:08,327 --> 01:08:11,395
ANGELA IS DEAD.
CAMILLE, TOO.

1219
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:13,331
AND... HELLO?

1220
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:15,266
WHAT'S WRONG?

1221
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:20,038
IT'S-IT'S HIGGINBOTHAM.

1222
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:22,256
CAMILLE'S DEAD...

1223
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:24,658
AND ANGELA.

1224
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:26,928
OKAY, ARE YOU SURE
HE'S NOT PART OF THE JOKE?

1225
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:28,596
THERE IS NO JOKE!

1226
01:08:28,597 --> 01:08:32,049
THEN WHY ARE WE
HEADING INTO A TRAP?
I- I NEED
TO FIND GAVIN.

1227
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,052
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S NOT
BEHIND THIS WHOLE THING?

1228
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:37,221
HE'S NOT!
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1229
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:39,923
BECAUSE I DO.

1230
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:05,449
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1231
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,418
UM, I'M GONNA
CALL THE COPS,

1232
01:09:07,419 --> 01:09:09,870
AND I WANT TO TELL THEM
WHERE WE ARE,

1233
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:11,723
AND I WANT
TO HAVE SERVICE.

1234
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:14,458
DOES ANYBODY
HAVE SERVICE?
UM, NOPE.

1235
01:09:14,459 --> 01:09:16,761
MNH-MNH.
I'LL GO CHECK OUTSIDE.

1236
01:09:16,762 --> 01:09:20,014
D- D-DON'T-DON'T-
DON'T GO OUT THERE.
OH, IT'S FINE.

1237
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,176
NOTHIN'.

1238
01:09:32,177 --> 01:09:34,011
(car door thuds)
(thud)

1239
01:09:34,012 --> 01:09:37,131
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?
I JUST SHUT THE DOOR.

1240
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,088
(thud)
OKAY, NOW I HEAR IT.

1241
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,073
(groans) WHAT?
DID I HIT SOMETHING?

1242
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:48,642
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
I'M GONNA
GO CHECK IT OUT.

1243
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,311
DON'T.

1244
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:53,314
COME ON!
TWO PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
YEAH. HOW DID WE
FIND THAT OUT?

1245
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:55,316
FROM A PRETTY SHADY SOURCE.

1246
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:57,284
IT'S NOTHING.

1247
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:13,684
(gasps)

1248
01:10:13,685 --> 01:10:16,454
(sobs)
WELL?

1249
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:18,756
STAY IN THE CAR.
OH, GOD.

1250
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,641
(crying) YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THIS.

1251
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:27,782
(grunting)

1252
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:30,084
WHAT IS IT?

1253
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:32,253
START THE CAR!

1254
01:10:32,254 --> 01:10:34,822
WHERE ARE THE KEYS?
START THE CAR!

1255
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,024
(grunts)
WHERE ARE THE KEYS?!

1256
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,093
I DON'T HAVE THE KEYS!

1257
01:10:39,094 --> 01:10:41,545
(grunting)

1258
01:10:41,546 --> 01:10:43,581
WHERE ARE THEY?

1259
01:10:43,582 --> 01:10:45,416
DEENA, YOU HAVE THE KEYS!

1260
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:47,585
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?

1261
01:10:47,586 --> 01:10:50,053
DO SOMETHING!

1262
01:10:50,054 --> 01:10:53,190
(grunting)

01:11:14,596 --> 01:11:18,499
OH, MY...

TEN.

1279
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:02,326
ELEVEN.

1280
01:12:02,327 --> 01:12:05,629
THERE'S NO SIGNAL.
IT'S WORSE IN HERE!

(voices speaking indistinctly)

1341
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:57,527
HE SAID,
"IT WAS LIKE A MOVIE."

1342
01:15:57,528 --> 01:15:59,730
(woman groaning)

1343
01:15:59,731 --> 01:16:03,233
OH, MY GOD.
WE'RE ALL A PART OF IT.

1344
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:08,656
HE HAD CAMERAS
SET UP EVERYWHERE.

01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,853
I'M FINE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1352
01:16:38,854 --> 01:16:42,522
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

1353
01:16:42,523 --> 01:16:44,291
IT WAS WORTH IT.

1354
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:51,132
WHAT?

1355
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,884

01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:17,274
D- DID YOU DO THIS?

1360
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:25,298
DON'T LOOK SAD.

01:17:25,299 --> 01:17:29,003
TELL ME
YOU DID NOT DO THIS.

1362
01:17:29,004 --> 01:17:31,271
