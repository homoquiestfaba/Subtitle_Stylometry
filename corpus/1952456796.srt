Don't be afraid, darIing.

185

She can't hurt you

186
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,709
You are the future
of Treesum, Diana.

187
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,082
Never forget that.

188
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,225
Hey.

00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,587
Oh, I--I found it.

00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,949
Workin' hard,

205
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,788
Leave me aIone,

206
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,954
I'm not having

207
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,758
Yeah?

208

TeII me.

209
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,495
There's something
wrong with my head.

210
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,237
It's Iike there's this...

211
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,866
fucked-up
speedy sIide show
inside my brain.

212
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,171
It's the cove.

213
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,737
It's haunted shit.

214
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,807
There's this girI...

215
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,579
this girI that keeps
foIIowing me around town.

216
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,120
She's inside my head, too,
and I don't even know why.

217
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,155
[inhaIes

218
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,484
Hey...
it's not somethin'

219
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,819
a IittIe saint

220
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,519
I don't think
that wouId heIp.

221
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,528
Listen.

222
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,663
Just think of it...

223
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,666
as a vacation
for your brain.

224
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,768
Think it wouId stop
the pictures roIIing
around inside my head?

225
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,842
It's caIIed ''saint''
'cause this shit's
a miracIe.

226
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,537
Gives you the nerve
to handIe anything.

227
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,654
Thanks.

228
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,756

242
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,259
[Iaughing]
Adam was right.

243
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,455
Saint is great.

244
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:00,999
[man chuckIes]

245
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,468
[Iaughing]

246
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,799
Hey! Watch it.

247
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,432
Hey, MicheIIe.
TabIe seven wants a--

248
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,770
I'm off the cIock.

00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,208
Come on.
The cabana's

250
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,711
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey,
Hey, hey, hey.

251
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,711
Ow! Ow!

252
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,712
Sorry. No vacancies.

253
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,271
Hey, man!
Come on,
I need this.

254
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,976
This is not
that kind of pIace.

255
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,986
And you...

256
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,454
you're not
that kind of girI.

257
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,614
[Iaughs]
Whatever.

258
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,782
[Iaughing]
Come on.

259
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,825
[man Iaughs]

260
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,025
So, is there
a transIation key

261
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,121
for these pages
I can't read?

262
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,325
You'II be abIe
to read them
when you're ready.

263
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,630
When?

264
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,603
When? How
do I get ready?

265
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,139
The text has to be
reIeased to you.

266
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,177
When the time is right,
it'II aII make sense.

267
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,680
When do you think
I'II be abIe
to read this?

268
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,890
Where did you get this?

269
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
I found a Iot
of interesting stuff
at--

270
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,264
the HistoricaI Society.

271
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,530
You're not ready

273
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,235

277
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,672
We need to put

278
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,542
I need your heIp, Van.

279
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,207
Why? What's going on?

280
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,477
It's Adam. He's using.

281
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,041
Big time.

282
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,883
Yeah. He Iooks pretty bad.

283
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,719
I know he's a fuck-up.
But he's my oIdest friend.

284
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,418
I can't stand
to see him Iike this.

285
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,098
We aII need to go

286
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,725

[coughs]

289
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,286
Ah.

290
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,521
Why's everybody
Iookin' so serious?

291
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,934
Adam...we're
worried about you.

292
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,496
I can take care
of myseIf.

293
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,701
We want to heIp.
So...whatever

294
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,936

295
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,171
we're here for you.

296
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,475
Is that what this

297
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,314
So I Iike
to party a IittIe.

298
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,214

Oh, Come on.

302
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,690
You never want
to hang out
with me anymore.

303
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,058
Not since
Kevin showed up.

304

I heard she was
making out with some guy!

310
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,797
No drug makes you
jump to the wrong sex.

311
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,638
You can't pin that
on the saint.

312
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,178
Look...right, we're
not here to taIk

You're messin' up
the vibe of the house.

323
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,659
And finding new tenants
is a drag I don't need.

Weird.

353
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,993
I couIdn't read it,

Yeah. Sure.

I have to know.

00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,683
Were we together?

No.

We were never

remember this.

765
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,611
So what is going on?

766
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,974

do that?

couId I do?

She's better off

No matter
how much it hurts.

everything.

If she hates you for it,
she hates you.

779
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,820
That's the risk you take.

780
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,379
I can't do
anything for her!

781
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,322
