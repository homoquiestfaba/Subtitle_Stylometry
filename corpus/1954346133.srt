00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,558
<i>Hi, this is Bethan.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

2
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,560
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

3
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,065
Hi, it's Ivan. I got your message.

4
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,026
I'm on my way and <i>I'll</i> get there.

5
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,404
I'm in the car now and...

6
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,533
It will be about an hour and a half,
unless there's traffic.

7
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,785
Now, if the nurses or anybody
wants to talk to me,

8
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,745
I'm only on this number.

9
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,915
Or if the doctors or anybody at all,

10
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
if they need to talk to me,
I'll be on this number.

11
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,003
Now, it'll be okay.

12
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,465
I will get there
and the traffic should be okay.

13
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,942
Hello, can I speak to Gareth, please?

14
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,945
<i>He's not back yet. Can I ask who's calling?</i>

15
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,405
It's Ivan Locke.

16
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>- Can I say what it's regarding?
- Yes, concrete.</i>

17
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,453
Can you... Can you tell
him that it's urgent?

18
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,079
Can you tell him to call me back?

19
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,664
<i>Yep. Does he have your number?</i>

20
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,624
Yes. Yes, he does.

21
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,295
- Sorry. what was your name <i>again?</i>
- Ivan Locke.

22
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,631
<i>- Something about concrete?
- That's right, yes. Can you...</i>

23
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>- Will he know what?
- No, no, he won"t.</i>

24
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,265
Something has come up
and I need to tell people. It's urgent.

25
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,642
- Sorry, <i>what?</i>
- I said... I said it's urgent.

26
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,145
Very urgent. Thank you.

27
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,095
<i>Hello?</i>

28
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,015
Eddie, it's your dad. Is your mother there?

29
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,351
<i>No, she's not back from the shops yet.</i>

30
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,687
<i>She's getting that German beer
that you like for the match.</i>

31
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,357
Okay. Listen, I won't be back for that.

32
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,150
<i>What?</i>

33
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,737
Something's come up. I can't get out of it.

34
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,698
<i>I'm wearing the shirt.
Mum's getting sausages.</i>

35
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,368
<i>Yeah, and guess what?
She's wearing the shirt as well.</i>

36
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,037
<i>Dad, it is so embarrassing.</i>

37
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,581
<i>Yeah, what did you say
about coming home?</i>

38
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,042
I won't be back for the match.

39
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,878
I'll have to listen to it on the radio.

40
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,549
<i>Dad, you said you'd be back.
It's rubbish on the radio.</i>

41
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>Mum's doing sausages and all.</i>

42
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,555
Is your brother there?

43
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,392
<i>- Yeah. Do you want a word?
- No. Just tell...</i>

44
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,061
Can you just tell your mother to call me
when she gets back? Thank you.

45
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,428
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Eddie, come on.</i>

46
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,814
<i>- I love you.
- It's started.</i>

47
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,065
<i>What?</i>

48
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,562
It's okay. Do you know what?

49
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,028
Just get her to call me when she gets back.
Thank you.

50
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,739
<i>- All right. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, bye.</i>

51
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,552
Ivan Locke.

52
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,764
<i>I just got your message.
It's a joke, is it?</i>

53
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,560
Look, I know it's a shock,
but it will be okay.

54
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,271
<i>Okay-</i>

55
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,400
Yes, well, I will go through everything
with you and it'll be okay.

56
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,194
<i>You know where I am, Ivan?
I'm at the service station.</i>

57
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,113
<i>I'm turning the fucking van around.</i>

58
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,490
<i>I put a few other lads on the hard
shoulder. I was halfway home.</i>

59
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,619
<i>- Yeah.
- What the fuck's happened?</i>

60
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,496
- It's a family thing.
<i>- Right.</i>

61
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,459
<i>Is someone... Has... Is it a bereavement?</i>

62
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,502
I don't have a choice.

63
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,923
<i>Is it one of the kids?</i>

64
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,427
Donal, look, I just need you to fix this up
and be all right, okay? And solid.

65
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,305
Which you are. Which you are, okay?

66
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,767
Just from when the sun comes up
tomorrow morning

67
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,102
until when it's all been pumped.

68
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,521
I need you to hold it
together for me, okay?

69
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,149
You won't be alone. I will be on the phone.

70
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,235
I will talk to you every five minutes
until the pump is finished.

71
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,239
<i>- Talk to me, what, on the phone?
- On the phone.</i>

72
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,199
<i>What? Have you gone mad?</i>

73
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,492
No, I don't think so.

74
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>Ivan, at 5:45 tomorrow morning,</i>

75
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,165
<i>we have 350 metric tons of wet concrete
being delivered to the site.</i>

76
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,044
<i>We've got 200 trucks from all over the
fucking country descending on us at 5:45.</i>

77
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,174
355 metric tons and 218 trucks.

78
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,261
<i>Okay, this is a joke, is it?</i>

79
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,806
I have no choice.

80
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,352
<i>Ivan, look, I hate myself
even hearing myself saying this,</i>

81
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,479
<i>but if someone has died,
like your mother or...</i>

82
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,231
<i>- No one is</i> dead, Donal.
<i>- ... just go where you have to</i>

83
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,314
<i>go tomorrow after 12:00.</i>

84
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,442
I need you to just do this, okay?

85
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,445
I need you to be there with enough stuff

86
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,609
and the right heads when the sun comes up.
That's it.

87
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:15,036
<i>Holy fucking Mary!
I can't. I'm a fucking concrete farmer.</i>

88
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,402
<i>You've never seen me
read anything written down on paper.</i>

89
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>- I</i> can't...
- You're okay. Listen, you're okay.

90
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,003
You know how to run a pump, don't you?
You know how to run trucks back to back

91
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,963
and turn trucks back,
and you know how to test for slumps.

92
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>I've never even shoveled
on a pump this big!</i>

93
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,342
Well, it's the same.
It's just there's more of it.

94
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,470
You just...
You just do the same but for longer.

95
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,307
You check it, slump it,
send it back if it's piss

96
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,101
and pump it if it's right. That's it.

97
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,858
<i>- What does Gareth say about this?
- I haven't spoken to</i> him <i>yet.</i>

98
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>Well, he's gonna fucking... He's gonna...</i>

99
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,529
<i>He'll go fucking sideways
around the houses...</i>

100
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,739
I know.

101
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,575
<i>- ...like his arse is on fire.
- I</i> know.

102
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,995
<i>- I</i> know.
<i>- Ivan, you're gonna get the sack.</i>

103
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,371
I know, Donal.

104
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,043
<i>Jesus, you're the best foreman
I've ever fucking worked with!</i>

105
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,587
<i>The best site manager. What the hell is it</i>

106
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>that's gonna make you go and risk...
You're gonna risk the sack?</i>

107
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,509
Look, I need you
to do this for me, Donal, right?

108
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,096
So, start rounding up some cowboys
and then call me back.

109
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,723
I'll be on the road.

110
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,785
<i>- Ivan Locke.
- Ivan?</i>

111
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,787
Where are you?

112
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,247
<i>I just got admitted.</i>

113
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,792
<i>I'm in the labor ward.
It's called Bailey Ward.</i>

114
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,293
Did they say how long?

115
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>- I'm five centimeters.</i>
- What <i>does that mean?</i>

116
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,758
- Dilated.
- I know what that means, but how long?

117
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,053
<i>I... They just... They just left me.
I'm on my own.</i>

118
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>- ls there a</i> bell?
<i>- A what?</i>

119
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't know, a buzzer
or something to get a nurse.

120
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,311
<i>They just put their head round
and they said it could be hours.</i>

121
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,813
Are you okay?

122
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,983
- I need the <i>loo.</i>
- Well, tell them. Tell them.

123
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,569
<i>- Well, there's no one here.
- Well, is there a</i> bell?

124
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,614
<i>They don't have bells. What do you mean?</i>

125
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,283
When they put their head around the door,

126
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,286
you tell them that you need the lavatory.

127
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>It's like a pain I've never had right
inside, all the way up to my chest.</i>

128
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,628
Have you talked to anyone about the pain?

129
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,005
<i>No, what... What do you mean?</i>

130
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>Ivan, what do you mean?</i>

131
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,428
I'm saying, have you talked to anybody
about stopping the pain?

132
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,849
<i>- Have you deemed'?
- Well, they said let's see.</i>

133
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,851
Well, just have whatever
there is, seriously.

134
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
- What?
- I don't know. For the pain.

135
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,064
Because it's fucking... Jesus, it's...

136
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,235
<i>It's cold and all the windows are open.</i>

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,155
Tell them to close the windows.

138
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,615
And the traffic is okay.
Go to the lavatory.

139
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,326
I'll be there.

140
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,542
<i>Have you even told your wife
that someone's having your baby?</i>

141
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,546
I'm about to do that.

142
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:17,051
I have... I have a list of things that I
have to do tonight while I'm driving.

143
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>- So, am I on</i> a <i>list?
- Yes. Tonight, yes.</i>

144
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,475
<i>Do you love me?</i>

145
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,355
That's a question you're asking
probably because of the pain or something.

146
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,274
How could I love you?

147
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,693
I...

148
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,904
Hell.

149
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,334
<i>Hi, love.</i>

150
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,087
- Hello, Katrina.
- Hi, <i>love.</i>

151
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,926
<i>Look, I got you six of the German lagers
and I got sausages.</i>

152
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,930
<i>I thought we could have hot dogs again.
And guess what?</i>

153
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,391
<i>I am finally wearing the shirt.</i>

154
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,686
<i>Ivan?</i>

155
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,605
Did Eddie not give you the message?

156
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,984
- What message?
- I'm not coming home.

157
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,779
<i>What?</i>

158
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,697
<i>What do you mean?</i>

159
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,908
<i>It's the match. I'm wearing the shirt.</i>

160
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,826
Which phone are you on?

161
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,746
<i>- What do you mean?
- I can hear the TV.</i>

162
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,458
Can you take this call upstairs,
on the phone upstairs?

163
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,293
<i>Upstairs? Why?</i>

164
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,462
I have something...

165
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,131
I have something to say.

166
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,717
<i>Well, can't it wait until you get home?</i>

167
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,636
I won't be home.

168
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,806
<i>What's happened?</i>

169
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,934
Will you just...
Will you get to the phone upstairs?

170
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,727
<i>What's happened?</i>

171
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,692
Just go to the phone in the bedroom
and I'll tell you what's happened.

172
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,069
<i>Okay-</i>

173
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,993
<i>Sean, when I shout,
put the phone down, please.</i>

174
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,948
<i>- Hey, Dad, are you coming back?
- Eddie.</i>

175
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,825
Yeah, I'm talking to your mother.

176
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,078
<i>He hasn't put any wingers on
and he's put Caldwell back on again.</i>

177
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,246
<i>Hello?</i>

178
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,081
Eddie, will you put the phone down, please?

179
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,708
<i>Dad, I can't believe the team he's picked.</i>

180
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,793
Eddie, please,
can you put the phone down, please?

181
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,295
<i>Eddie.</i>

182
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,174
<i>So, go on, tell me. What is it?</i>

183
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,848
Last year, this job...
You know, the job in Croydon.

184
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,351
Do you remember? I was up and down there
for three months. Remember?

185
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>Yes.</i>

186
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,316
I stayed in the guesthouse,
the one that had...

187
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,525
It had bad damp, I said.

188
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,152
Remember? The...

189
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,155
<i>Yeah.</i>

190
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,406
They gave me an assistant.

191
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,034
She worked with me
on the block construction.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,662
- She?
- She was a secretary, quite old.

193
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,540
We... We worked together.

194
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,211
She's quite old and she lives on her own.

195
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,921
She's 43 or something.

196
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,548
She's...

197
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,634
<i>Why are you telling me about some woman?</i>

198
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,224
This is the only time I ever did
this, Katrina. The only time.

199
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,439
Look, after the block was settled in,
there were some drinks to celebrate.

200
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,641
Now, the block going in is a big thing
because it's the base of a whole building.

201
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,737
And she came back to the guesthouse.

202
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,908
She isn't what you would call
an oil painting,

203
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,911
but it was wet and cold,
and she talked about being lonely

204
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,579
and I talked about being happy.

205
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,958
But I'm lonely sometimes, you know,
when I was away, and...

206
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,504
And there was this wine and...

207
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,302
This was the only time I did this
in all our 15 years.

208
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,100
And now tonight she's giving birth.

209
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,186
Tonight she's giving birth and it's mine.

210
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,334
Ivan Locke.

211
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,962
<i>Yeah, it's Gareth, Ivan.
I just spoke to Donal.</i>

212
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,964
<i>This had better be more than good!</i>

213
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,507
Hello, Gareth.

214
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,969
<i>Speak to me only
about tomorrow morning, Ivan.</i>

215
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,137
Right, well...

216
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,932
I won't be on site for the pump tomorrow.

217
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,187
<i>Sweet monkey Jesus! This is not happening.</i>

218
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,567
The truth is,
tonight I'm going to become a father.

219
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,822
And she's in London, so I have to be there.

220
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,407
<i>Okay, Okay-</i>

221
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,161
<i>Jesus!
I'm just gonna read you something, Ivan.</i>

222
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,288
<i>- Are you listening?
- Yes.</i>

223
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>"Good luck tomorrow with the pour.</i>

224
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,751
<i>"We just had it confirmed by CGO</i>

225
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,587
<i>"that this will be
the biggest single concrete pour</i>

226
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,216
<i>"ever made in Europe
outside of nuclear military projects.</i>

227
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,637
<i>"I know the day is in the safest of hands.
Best wishes, Mitchell."</i>

228
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,767
<i>That is Mitchell Dean himself,
the president of the whole fucking company.</i>

229
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,103
<i>Did you hear that, Ivan? From Chicago, USA.</i>

230
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,107
Yes.

231
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,943
<i>You're gonna have to speak up, Ivan.
I can't hear you.</i>

232
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,444
Yes, I heard.

233
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,686
<i>And so, you're the man in charge
of the entire operation,</i>

234
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,492
<i>but with 10 hours to go,
you've decided you ain't gonna be there!</i>

235
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,495
Well, Donal will handle it
and he's a good man.

236
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,997
<i>Don't you fucking dare say that to me!</i>

237
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>Don't you fucking dare
give qualitative appraisals on my staff</i>

238
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:28,089
<i>and say "good man," like he's going off
to buy a fucking ice cream!</i>

239
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,259
<i>Jesus, this is fucking concrete.</i>

240
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:36,472
<i>Like shit, Ivan. Like piss.
When it comes, you pump it.</i>

241
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,016
Like babies.

242
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,644
<i>Shit. This is a joke to you.</i>

243
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,690
No, no.
Right now nothing is a joke anymore.

244
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,693
<i>Oh, God!</i>

245
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,114
<i>And so, it's not your wife giving birth?</i>

246
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,032
No.

247
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,826
<i>- Jesus!
- It's someone else.</i>

248
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,079
<i>Ivan! You're the last person on earth...</i>

249
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,458
Yes, I know, I am the last person on earth,
but it happened.

250
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,004
<i>And this woman, she can't just...
She can't give birth on her own?</i>

251
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,213
I have made a decision.

252
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,299
There is nobody else
who could be with her, okay?

253
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,344
She has no friends in London
and is quite a fragile person.

254
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,222
<i>Fragile!</i>

255
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>You're gonna abandon
the biggest fucking concrete pour in Europe</i>

256
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,977
<i>to hold someone's fucking hand
because she's fragile?</i>

257
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,855
And because the baby was caused by me.

258
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,358
That is my decision I have made.

259
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,070
I have not behaved in the right way
with this woman at all.

260
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,782
I have behaved in a way that isn't like me.

261
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,327
But now I am going to do the right thing.

262
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,495
<i>What, and Chicago can go to fucking hell?</i>

263
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,875
It is a decision that I have made.
I'm not gonna turn back.

264
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,004
<i>Do you know how many millions of pounds
are riding on tomorrow?</i>

265
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,508
<i>If any one of those pumps fucks up, Ivan,</i>

266
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,887
we <i>are facing 10 million pounds
worth of losses in 15 minutes.</i>

267
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,181
<i>So if we get that 15 minutes
for the whole morning,</i>

268
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,557
<i>a total shutdown,</i>

269
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,726
<i>$100 million.</i>

270
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,900
<i>- Are you still there, Ivan?
- Yes, yes.</i>

271
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,071
Look, I have no explanation.

272
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,198
Apart from the one that I've given you.

273
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,824
But, Gareth, listen...

274
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:24,372
I have made a pledge to myself
that I will not allow the pour to fuck up.

275
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>This is a joke!</i>

276
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,752
<i>Are you wearing a fucking red nose?</i>

277
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,214
<i>This is a fucking joke, Ivan.</i>

278
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,134
<i>I'm gonna call Chicago, right?</i>

279
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,054
<i>If it weren't for the fact that you've been
so solid for us for so many years,</i>

280
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,889
<i>I'd fire you down the phone.</i>

281
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,817
<i>Ivan, have you lost your fucking mind?</i>

282
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,736
I have made my decision.

283
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,925
What the fuck are you looking at?

284
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,430
You're laughing, aren't you?

285
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,765
Laughing at my predicament.

286
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,396
It's a familiar predicament
to a man like you, isn't it, Dad, eh?

287
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,941
You think, "There he is, look.
Like father, like son.

288
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,279
"There's the man I made."
What is it they say?

289
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,532
"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

290
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,076
Well, that's where you're wrong.

291
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,538
Listen to me,
you fucking piece of worthless shit.

292
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,623
I want you to watch.

293
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,544
Do you know, in fact,
I would like to take a fucking shovel

294
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,423
and dig you up out of the fucking ground
and make you watch me tonight.

295
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,133
I would pull open your eyes

296
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,886
and kick the mud and worms and shit
out of your fucking ears

297
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,054
just for the duration of this journey.

298
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,601
Because it's me driving. Me, not you.

299
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,229
And, unlike you, <i>I will</i> drive
straight to the place where I should be,

300
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,107
and I will be there to take care of my...

301
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,278
To take care of my fuck-up.

302
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,592
Yes, Donal.

303
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,553
<i>Okay, okay, I'm driving back now
so I'm gonna be quick.</i>

304
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,516
<i>I called Ryan
and I got half a dozen Poles off him,</i>

305
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,185
<i>and I got some Hungarians from Patrick.</i>

306
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,064
<i>I've got breakfast tickets
for the concrete farmers,</i>

307
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,859
<i>and the shutter boys are done, apart
from the fucking-about with the clips.</i>

308
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,654
<i>I've asked Albanian Alby
to test the pumps on the Argyll side,</i>

309
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,197
<i>and he said that they're pissing it out.</i>

310
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,157
No, listen... Okay, stop, stop, stop.

311
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,786
Listen, when you get back on site,
you check every pump yourself,

312
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,914
individually and
with your own hand on the turner.

313
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,959
You don't ask anybody else
to check and sign off.

314
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,337
You go around the whole site
and you check each one yourself.

315
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:23,384
And you don't trust Alby after 5:00
because he drinks, okay?

316
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,263
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>
- Now, will you talk to me about the mix?

317
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,225
<i>The mix... Yeah, the mix. Did we say C6?</i>

318
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,853
Don't say that like it's a question.

319
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:34,979
<i>Okay, yes, okay.</i>

320
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,982
<i>Sometimes I say things and it sounds
like a question and it's not a question.</i>

321
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,694
Well, all the mixes for the pump
will be C6. Why do you even ask?

322
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,237
- It's written on the whiteboard...
- I'm not <i>asking.</i>

323
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,366
...in fucking giant letters. I put "C6"
all over the cabin in big red letters.

324
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,243
- Slump of one inch, C6.
- Okay.

325
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,120
Don't ask me questions like that.

326
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,623
<i>I'm not asking a question.
I know you don't like questions.</i>

327
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,250
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

328
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,627
All right, what time are you unlocking?

329
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,254
<i>I don't know. I'm gonna sleep here tonight.</i>

330
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,048
Good, good, except you don't sleep, okay?
Check everything.

331
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,508
You've got the client sign-off?

332
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,553
<i>Yeah, yeah,
and the client sign-off on the gates.</i>

333
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,512
That's what I mean, the gate sign-off.

334
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,640
Donal, the construction sign-off
should already be filed.

335
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,936
<i>Yes, it is. It's already... It's already
filed, it's okay. That's what I meant.</i>

336
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,315
Okay, right. Well, you have
the phone numbers of the plants, don't you?

337
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,691
- Yeah.
- Call them now, Donal.

338
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,652
Call every one of those bastards,
get them to repeat the order.

339
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,615
C6 on the nose
or we send those trucks back.

340
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,241
Seriously, those fuckers will fuck you up

341
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,493
with the water in the gullies
if it rains tomorrow.

342
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,038
<i>Well, it's not gonna rain tomorrow.
It's gonna be dry.</i>

343
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,208
<i>I've got a direct line to God
up in heaven, you know.</i>

344
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,672
Donal, you don't trust God
when it comes to concrete.

345
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,133
You call the plants, Donal,

346
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,537
<i>- every one of them.
- I will, okay.</i>

347
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,386
And get them to fax the order back
so you can check it.

348
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,680
<i>I will. I'll do that. I'll do that now.
Did you speak to Gareth?</i>

349
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,017
Yes, I did, actually. He's calling Chicago.

350
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:59,229
I'm guessing Chicago's going to fire me
and he'll put some fucking kid on it, so...

351
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,981
<i>- No, no, no.
- Don't take his calls.</i>

352
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,146
Just don't take his calls.

353
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,193
<i>- Don't listen to anybody else.
- I can't not take his calls.</i>

354
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,404
Don't take his calls. Don't listen to
anybody else until the morning.

355
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,281
This is me and you, okay?

356
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,158
<i>So, I'm not gonna answer his calls?</i>

357
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,161
No. Just me and you till the morning, okay?

358
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,580
- Okay.
- Cool.

359
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>Fucking hell, okay.</i>

360
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,435
<i>Hello. This is Bethan.
I'm afraid I can't get to the phone.</i>

361
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,907
<i>- Did you call?
- Are you</i> okay?

362
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,702
<i>Yeah. Someone closed the windows.</i>

363
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,620
Did you talk to anyone about the pain?

364
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,915
- No, <i>no</i> one's been in.
- But is everything all right?

365
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,210
<i>No. It hurts like nothing ever.</i>

366
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,921
Okay, well, I'm on the M6.

367
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,924
An hour and a quarter
if the traffic stays okay.

368
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,648
You must speak to someone about the pain.

369
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,345
<i>Just then I felt like I hate you.</i>

370
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,098
Well, we don't know each other, Bethan.
That's the simple truth.

371
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,767
- This thing just happened.
<i>- Thing?</i>

372
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,061
So we can't really love each other
or hate each other, can we?

373
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,856
This thing just happened and that's it.

374
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,860
And it will go up and down, I suppose,
but at least I'm coming, okay?

375
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,030
<i>Do you...
Do you hate me for going through with it?</i>

376
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:35,200
I don't know you, so...
I don't hate you, do I? I mean...

377
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
I don't know you, so...

378
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:42,666
Look, do what they tell you to do.
I have a lot of calls to make.

379
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,627
The traffic is fine so it'll be okay.

380
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,964
- Please be <i>quick.</i>
- Yes, but there's a speed limit.

381
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,615
<i>- Hello, Gareth.
- Yeah, look.</i>

382
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,911
<i>Chicago is having a predictable meltdown.</i>

383
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,455
Is it? Okay.

384
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,959
<i>Yeah, I gave them...
I gave them the whole 10-year thing</i>

385
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,296
<i>about your 10 years working for Park
without a foot wrong.</i>

386
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,131
Nine years. I've been with you nine years.

387
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,467
<i>- What?</i>
- Nine <i>years.</i>

388
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,763
<i>Yeah, the whole thing, Ivan.
He said he goes on emotion.</i>

389
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,641
<i>He said the stuff about
the biggest pour in Europe.</i>

390
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,769
Outside the nuclear and military,
I know, I know.

391
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:50,109
<i>Well, I'll tell you what, Ivan...
You're fired, is what it is.</i>

392
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:54,988
<i>They said they had no choice.
I said... I told them about the 10 years.</i>

393
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,782
- Nine <i>years.
- But they said they had no choice.</i>

394
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,034
<i>Yeah. Nine, 10, whatever.</i>

395
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,705
So it's okay. It's okay.

396
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,878
<i>- I never do this on the phone, Ivan.
- It's okay. It's okay.</i>

397
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,924
I will still make sure
the pour is all right.

398
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,303
<i>No, Ivan, it's...
It's not a matter for negotiation.</i>

399
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,598
<i>They've decided you're fired, completely,
as of right this second.</i>

400
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,560
I know, I heard you,
and I don't blame them, okay?

401
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,437
But I'm not trying to keep my job.
I just...

402
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,065
I just want the pour to go okay tomorrow.

403
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,192
- Ivan...
- Listen to me. You listen to me.

404
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,279
I want the pour to go okay,
not because of the money.

405
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,323
I want it to go right for myself
and for the building.

406
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,242
Right? And for the concrete.

407
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,619
I won't let it be pumped
into the wrong place. Do you understand?

408
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,455
Tonight and tomorrow,
I will stay on this and stay on this

409
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,499
and make sure
the concrete gets poured right.

410
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,460
<i>Ivan, listen, I told
them about the 10 years.</i>

411
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,004
<i>- Fuck your 10 years.
- They weren't having any of it.</i>

412
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,714
Listen to me, Gareth... Listen, Gareth.

413
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,301
The concrete will come
and I will take care of it, okay?

414
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,345
I know I don't have a job anymore,
but I will do this anyway

415
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,725
as a favor to the building
and to the concrete.

416
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,023
<i>- Ivan, you sound different.
- I am the same.</i>

417
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,528
<i>Why didn't you just say you were sick?</i>

418
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,657
Because I'm not sick,
and I'll make sure the pour is okay.

419
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,995
<i>Yeah, but I've already handed it over
to another construction director.</i>

420
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,748
<i>Ivan, he's gonna pick it up from...</i>

421
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,638
Katrina?

422
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,641
<i>That didn't happen. I'm not believing it.</i>

423
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,814
Katrina, I want to move
to a practical next step.

424
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,527
<i>I'm here in the dark in our bedroom and...
Oh, God, nothing looks the same.</i>

425
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,824
<i>Ivan?</i>

426
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,120
I can't... I can't speak very well. I...

427
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,335
I have felt scraped-out for months.

428
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,383
She phoned and said
that she was having a baby

429
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,763
and keeping it because
it was her last chance to be happy.

430
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,017
And then tonight she phoned and said
the waters broke and it's two months early.

431
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,397
I was... I was going to tell you before,
but the waters broke early,

432
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,441
so I have to do this now in the car.

433
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,114
- Every night I was going to tell you.
<i>- God,</i> I can't...

434
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,574
<i>I can't really breathe.</i>

435
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,288
Katrina, listen. You know
what happened with my dad, right?

436
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,248
And how that bastard wasn't around for me.

437
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,625
- Didn't even give me a fucking name.
- No, no, you're confused.

438
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,461
<i>Ivan, it's you that's the bastard.</i>

439
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,255
<i>It's the baby that's the bastard.</i>

440
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,840
<i>For God's sake, Ivan,
at least get the word right.</i>

441
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:00,966
Katrina, listen.

442
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,554
No, I will give the baby my name
and it will see my face.

443
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,807
It will know and
it won't spend its life thinking...

444
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,211
You know, thinking that nobody...

445
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:15,022
<i>I've closed the door and I'm in the dark,
and I'm almost sure this isn't you.</i>

446
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,815
<i>Please don't be you.</i>

447
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,192
I know, I should have said all this
a long time ago.

448
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm so...

449
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,363
I have behaved not at all like myself.

450
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,242
<i>- I suppose I gotta get up.
- Katrina, please, don't go.</i>

451
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,411
<i>- I have to throw up again.
- Please, don't...</i>

452
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,475
<i>- Donal?
- Okay. Ivan?</i>

453
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,895
<i>This isn't a question.
This isn't a question, okay?</i>

454
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,231
<i>But I just got off the phone
with the plant in Stafford,</i>

455
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,567
<i>and they said they know that it's a C6 mix,</i>

456
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,570
<i>but how far towards C5 can it go?</i>

457
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,783
<i>In other words, if one truck had some C5,</i>

458
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,285
<i>how bad would that be taken?</i>

459
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,083
<i>Are you still there?</i>

460
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,922
Donal, what does it say on the whiteboard?

461
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,217
<i>On the... It says C6.</i>

462
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,220
What does it say on every piece of
paperwork and on every sign-off sheet?

463
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,764
<i>- It says C6.
- It says C6.</i>

464
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,517
And you know why?

465
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:39,106
Because, eventually, when my building
is complete, it will be 55 floors high.

466
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:43,944
It will weigh 2,223,000 metric tons.

467
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,114
Okay? My building will alter the
water table and squeeze granite.

468
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,409
It will be visible from 20 miles away.

469
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,453
At sunset, it will cast a shadow
probably a mile long.

470
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,458
Now, if the concrete
at the base of my building is not right,

471
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,629
if it slips half an inch, cracks appear.

472
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,133
Right? If cracks appear,
then they will grow and grow, won't they?

473
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,468
- And the whole thing will collapse.
<i>- Ivan, look...</i>

474
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,722
You make one mistake, Donal,
one little fucking mistake,

475
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,933
and the whole world
comes crashing down around you.

476
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,563
Do you understand?
So you tell Stafford, C6.

477
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,606
- C6 <i>it</i> is.
- Thank you.

478
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,285
- Kat, please, listen.
- Hey, <i>Dad.</i>

479
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,953
<i>- What?
- Yeah, we're 1-nil down.</i>

480
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,247
Is your mother there?

481
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,498
<i>Damn.</i>

482
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,000
<i>Mum.</i>

483
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,002
<i>- Sean, will you go and get Mum?
- I'm watching the match.</i>

484
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,129
<i>Stupid penalty.
Are you listening on the radio?</i>

485
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,839
<i>- Is that Dad?
- No. No.</i>

486
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,090
<i>Tell him they've scored.</i>

487
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,634
<i>Dad, she's on the toilet, I think.</i>

488
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,764
<i>- Eddie...
- Yeah?</i>

489
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,686
<i>- What?</i>
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

490
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,773
It's fine. Listen, <i>I'll</i> talk to you
when it all settles down, okay?

491
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,858
<i>- All right.
- Okay.</i>

492
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,527
<i>- Cool.</i> Bye, <i>Dad.</i>
- Bye, Eddie. Bye-bye.

493
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,058
Ivan Locke.

494
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,562
<i>Hello, this is Sister Margaret
from St. Mary's maternity unit.</i>

495
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,147
Is everything okay?

496
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>I'm with Bethan Maguire.
Is it your partner?</i>

497
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,986
I am the father.

498
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,613
<i>She's quite distressed,</i>

499
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,574
<i>and we were wondering if someone
was gonna be with her for the birth.</i>

500
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,661
<i>She said she doesn't have anyone else.</i>

501
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,914
Yes. I'm an hour away, I think,
if the traffic's okay.

502
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,374
Is she all right?

503
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,669
<i>- Well, there's</i> a <i>complication.
- What</i> is <i>the complication?</i>

504
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,338
<i>It's a complication with
the umbilical cord,</i>

505
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:13,385
<i>and it means there will be a procedure,
and it would help if Dad was around.</i>

506
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,428
<i>- You are Dad?
- Yes, yes,</i> I <i>am.</i>

507
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,391
I'm driving. I'm doing 90.

508
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,687
<i>Well, please don't
drive dangerously or anything.</i>

509
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,732
I won't. Listen, I will
be there very shortly.

510
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,403
<i>Good. Okay, well, she's with the consultant
at the moment.</i>

511
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,780
<i>I just wanted to make sure
someone was coming.</i>

512
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,116
Yes, Well, I will, I'll be there.

513
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,620
<i>Good. So what you need to do
is use the emergency entrance</i>

514
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,124
<i>- and ask for Bailey Ward.
- Bailey? Okay, I will do.</i>

515
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,501
<i>She's very emotional.</i>

516
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,546
Well, she isn't used
to being emotional, I think.

517
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,797
I think she's normally a very quiet person.

518
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,468
<i>- You are her partner?
- I am the father.</i>

519
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,930
I don't...

520
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,476
I don't know her too well,
if you want the truth. But I'm coming.

521
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,647
<i>- She's very afraid.
- I understand that.</i>

522
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,983
I'm driving.

523
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,499
Yes, Donal.

524
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,003
<i>Right, I've checked all the 12 pumps myself
and they're all pissing it out.</i>

525
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,007
- Good. You are testing with C6?
- Yes, yeah, <i>I see only</i> C6.

526
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,968
<i>- And you</i> called all <i>the plants?
- Yeah, I called all the plants.</i>

527
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,572
<i>And just so you know,
they all gave me dog's abuse for checking.</i>

528
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,848
Excellent, and they have the
trucks lined up and the mix is in?

529
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:46,936
<i>Yes, yeah, yeah. I ticked off each response
after all the fuck-yous and piss-offs,</i>

530
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:53,443
<i>- and it came to 6,500 cubic meters.
- Okay. What about the retardant?</i>

531
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,029
<i>The retardant's on site already,
ready to go into the trucks.</i>

532
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,532
<i>- Good. Now, do you have a pen'?
- I have a pencil.</i>

533
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,369
Well, get a pen.

534
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,329
<i>Okay, I have a pen.</i>

535
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,707
Good. Now, in the top right-hand drawer

536
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,960
above the blow-heater,
you'll find my folder.

537
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,339
Get it. It's going to
be your bible tonight.

538
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,965
<i>Okay-</i>

539
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,678
<i>- I don't</i> see <i>any folder.</i>
- Yes, <i>no, it's there. It's there.</i>

540
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,203
Okay? It's got everything
that you're going to need in there.

541
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,849
Right? All the numbers,
the sign-offs, the road closures

542
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,476
that you have to confirm with the police.

543
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,895
Now, it's in the drawer
above the blow-heater.

544
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,690
<i>Well, the blow-heater was taken
by the fucking Hungarians.</i>

545
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,316
<i>You'd think they'd be used to the cold,
wouldn't you?</i>

546
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,568
Donal, you do know
which drawer that I mean, right?

547
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,237
<i>It's not here. I've
checked all the drawers.</i>

548
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,571
Well, it is...

549
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,949
Fuck.

550
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,868
<i>What? What?</i>

551
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,496
- Fuck <i>off.
- What? Me?</i>

552
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,915
No, not you. I have it here. Shit!

553
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,128
All the things you are going to need,
and I have it fucking here in my car.

554
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,925
<i>Well, I've never...</i>

555
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,885
<i>You know, Ivan,
in all the 10 years I've known you,</i>

556
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,097
<i>I've never...
I've never known you to fuck up like this.</i>

557
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,765
<i>What the fuck's going on?</i>

558
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,434
Okay, Donal...

559
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,603
Will you just give me some time to think?

560
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,606
Fuck!

561
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,087
Are you okay?

562
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,173
<i>Okay? Okay?</i>

563
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,049
Kat, please. Just hear
what I want to say...

564
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,886
<i>Of all the things in the world,
I never thought of you doing this!</i>

565
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,805
<i>- Katrina, don't let the boys hear.
- You fucked some girl.</i>

566
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,683
<i>- Quietly, quietly.
- You fucked her and then me.</i>

567
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,208
<i>I looked at my diary and I checked.</i>

568
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,145
<i>I remember when you got home
from Croydon that weekend,</i>

569
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,105
<i>and you had a big stupid grin on your face.</i>

570
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,709
The block was in. I was happy with it.

571
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,985
<i>- And I sit in the dark.
- It was</i> once.

572
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,403
<i>Once!</i>

573
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,156
<i>The difference between once and never
is the whole world.</i>

574
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,993
<i>The difference between never and once
is the difference between good and bad.</i>

575
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,621
<i>- I</i> know <i>that.
- You don't know.</i>

576
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,331
- I know.
<i>- No, you don't know anything.</i>

577
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,832
I know.

578
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,668
<i>Yeah, yeah, no.
You had a big stupid grin that night.</i>

579
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,463
It was work. The block was down.

580
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,508
<i>- You fucked someone.
- It was an odd night.</i>

581
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,344
There wasn't really a bad thought
in anybody's head.

582
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,847
<i>- You had a big fucking grin.
- That</i> isn't <i>it.</i>

583
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,724
<i>Yeah, like you'd won something.</i>

584
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,477
<i>I remember you smiling
and putting your coat on the stairs.</i>

585
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,354
<i>I thought you'd won something.</i>

586
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,856
I was trying to be normal.

587
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,860
I can't remember. Look, the block was in.

588
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,489
<i>And that stuff about the baby.
You think she's having a baby?</i>

589
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,117
Yes, she's having the baby tonight.

590
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,202
<i>Is she?</i>

591
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,415
<i>Forget that. You're a clown.</i>

592
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,211
<i>Forget that. You're a stupid clown.</i>

593
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,629
<i>You think it's yours?</i>

594
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,881
<i>Why would it be yours
if she fucks everybody?</i>

595
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,383
She doesn't.

596
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,969
<i>If she fucks you, she fucks everybody.</i>

597
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,639
She isn't like that.
She had given up on having anything.

598
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,980
<i>I can't believe it's me and you
and we're talking about somebody else.</i>

599
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,193
<i>Like somebody broke into the house.
I just...</i>

600
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,448
<i>I can't...</i>

601
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,785
I want to talk about a practical next step.

602
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,416
<i>Did you say she's not like that?</i>

603
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,585
<i>You were with her one night
and you know her?</i>

604
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,545
<i>You have a call waiting.</i>

605
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,257
She doesn't do that. She hadn't for years.

606
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,593
Okay? Afterwards she was sad.

607
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,513
<i>Did you say sad?</i>

608
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,943
<i>- Yes'?
- I think we got cut off.</i>

609
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,113
Shit. Okay, yes. I have the file here.

610
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,284
Hang on a second.

611
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,414
Okay, I have the file here.

612
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,874
- Right.
- I'm going to have to give you

613
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,293
some information over the phone,

614
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,921
and you're going
to have to write it down, okay?

615
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,672
<i>Okay-</i>

616
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,800
Donal, are you drinking something?
What are you drinking?

617
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,013
<i>A nice bottle of fizzy pop.</i>

618
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,436
Okay, I need you to call the duty officer
at Belmount Police Station

619
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,065
and confirm some road closures
for the morning, okay?

620
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,275
Do you still have the pen?

621
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,612
- Yeah.
- Right, okay.

622
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,782
Here are the roads
we agreed with the council

623
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,869
that need to be closed to traffic
for the duration of the pour,

624
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,373
which is from 5:25 a.m. to midday.

625
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,667
<i>Yeah, okay, go.</i>

626
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:05,838
Crescent Road between Arch Green
and Claremount.

627
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,590
<i>Crescent Road between Arch Green
and Claremount.</i>

628
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:12,345
<i>- Planetree</i> Road <i>at the south end only.
- Planetree Road at the south end only, yeah.</i>

629
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,182
The Vale up to Parklands Farm Road.

630
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,851
<i>- Okay,</i> yeah.
- But with the stop-go operated by us.

631
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,019
<i>Yeah, got that.</i>

632
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,022
You'll need to quote
the license number 750...

633
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,818
- 750.
- ...slash DV. Okay?

634
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,278
<i>Slash DV. Cool. Okay. Got it.</i>

635
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:33,199
Good. Donal?
It is fizzy pop that you're drinking, yes?

636
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,867
<i>It is. It is.</i>

637
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:39,038
Because if you are on the fucking cider
and I find out,

638
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,874
I will cut your legs off
with a fucking pavement saw.

639
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,044
<i>Will you? Right.
Now, Ivan... Ivan, listen to me.</i>

640
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,331
<i>There's no need
for you to talk to me like that, okay?</i>

641
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,133
<i>Because I've got six calls here
that I'm looking at</i>

642
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,802
<i>stacked up on this phone from Gareth,
and I'm guessing what they are</i>

643
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,554
<i>and what he's saying to me
on the phone calls.</i>

644
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,806
<i>But I agreed that I'm not gonna take
those phone calls from Gareth</i>

645
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,685
<i>because I'm fucking shitting my pants here,
you know, about tomorrow going pear,</i>

646
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,688
<i>and I don't want him to give me
some fucking college kid on the phone</i>

647
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,398
<i>trying to talk me through
this from scratch.</i>

648
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,151
<i>So, as far as I'm concerned,
until the sun comes up,</i>

649
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,028
<i>yours is the only voice
I'm gonna listen to.</i>

650
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,864
<i>But hear this, don't fucking threaten me!</i>

651
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,948
<i>- Okay?
- You have a call waiting.</i>

652
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,909
<i>You have no official position now
to threaten me from,</i>

653
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,412
<i>so don't fucking threaten me!</i>

654
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,374
So it is cider that you're drinking?

655
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,254
<i>One can of cider, yeah! So fucking what?</i>

656
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,256
Eat something.

657
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,886
<i>Do you know what?
I'm not actually that hungry at the moment.</i>

658
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,892
<i>Okay, now let me get these calls
to these fucking Coppers</i>

659
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,018
<i>and confirm the road closures,</i>

660
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,936
<i>and then I'll call you back
for further instructions.</i>

661
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,855
<i>Over and fucking out.</i>

662
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,489
Fuck!

663
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,456
Right.

664
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,291
Ivan Locke.

665
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,960
<i>They say there's a twist.</i>

666
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,213
A what?

667
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,425
<i>It's round the baby's neck like a noose.</i>

668
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:18,429
Well, you're in the best place. Honestly,
you are. You're in the best place.

669
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,641
<i>They let me use my phone for one minute.</i>

670
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>- When will you get here?
- About 45 minutes.</i>

671
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:35,613
I'm outside Northampton.
The traffic is okay.

672
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,991
<i>It's like waiting for God, or...</i>
Waiting <i>for Godot.</i>

673
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,746
<i>Sorry, you're not a theater man.</i>

674
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,916
<i>And not a reader of books and not a talker.</i>

675
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,335
<i>A builder. Funny, isn't it?</i>

676
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,298
<i>It's funny it was someone like you,
someone so opposite to me.</i>

677
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,927
<i>All the things I love
mean absolutely zero to you.</i>

678
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,014
The important thing is to get the baby out.

679
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,686
<i>Well, the news is,
they're resorting to knives.</i>

680
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,190
Well, by the sound of you,
they're giving you gas, are they?

681
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,111
<i>Yeah, they think
they might have to cut me open</i>

682
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,697
<i>because I'm too old to push.</i>

683
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,492
That's okay, that's okay.
They do that as a routine. It's okay.

684
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,744
It's better, in fact.

685
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,080
<i>"In fact"? Is that so?</i>

686
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,000
Yes. The traffic is okay.

687
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,544
<i>They're taking blood.</i>

688
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,129
Well, just do what they say.

689
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,549
<i>And someone keeps opening the window.</i>

690
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,551
Tell them you're cold.

691
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:43,306
<i>They talk around me.
I need someone here to speak for me.</i>

692
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,101
<i>They said the umbilical
cord is like a noose.</i>

693
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,397
<i>A lifeline and a noose at the same time.
It's funny, isn't it?</i>

694
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,608
Bethan... Bethan...

695
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,195
Bethan?

696
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,406
Jesus.

697
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,421
You think this is all fate, don't you, Dad?

698
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,249
Your dirty fucking
fingerprints all over me.

699
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,545
You thought it was bound to happen because
of the little seeds that you planted.

700
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,422
Okay, well, let me educate you.

701
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,928
Even no matter what the situation is,
you can make it good,

702
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,264
like with plaster and brick.

703
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,603
You never knew that because you never
lifted a finger, you fucking lazy cunt.

704
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,450
But you know what?
You can take a situation

705
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,273
and you can draw a circle around it

706
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,442
and find a way to work something out.

707
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,778
You don't just drive away from it.

708
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,740
No. Or sit in the corner of some
greasy little fucking pub somewhere

709
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,952
like you're the fucking
happy little maverick.

710
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,121
<i>I could come for you
with a pick and a shovel, I really could,</i>

711
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,250
<i>and dig you up
and it would be a happy day in hell</i>

712
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,294
<i>because they would be rid of you for a bit.</i>

713
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,672
<i>You know what?
I could just drive around the M25</i>

714
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,478
<i>and head to Dover or some-fucking-where
and not face it, couldn't I?</i>

715
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,929
<i>Just earn good money, cash in hand,
working on the Crossrail.</i>

716
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,974
<i>They make 500 a day just shoveling shit,</i>

717
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,976
<i>shoveling shit about like you.</i>

718
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:15,273
No, I'm going to drive
straight to the worst place for me,

719
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:20,861
the worst place on earth for me to be,
even though this woman is like...

720
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:27,201
She's, like, sad and lonely,
hardly bothered with life at all.

721
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,454
I felt sorry for her, you know?

722
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,581
I felt sorry for her.

723
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,295
So, how can that be the difference
between good and bad?

724
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
<i>Yeah!</i>

725
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,025
<i>Yeah, that was wicked!
Dad, are you listening to this?</i>

726
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,527
<i>2-1 to us. Two goals in three minutes.</i>

727
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,696
<i>Dad, seriously, you gotta put it
on the radio. It's brilliant.</i>

728
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:07,742
<i>- ls your mother there?
- No, she's upstairs on the toilet.</i>

729
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,160
<i>She's been in there ages.</i>

730
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,163
<i>She's wearing the shirt,
but she won't come down.</i>

731
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,284
<i>Do you want me to call her?</i>

732
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,461
No, no, just leave her. It's okay.

733
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,254
Go on, you enjoy the game.

734
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,716
<i>2-1. We're winning.
Dad, why aren't you going mad?</i>

735
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,347
I am, Eddie, I'm going mad inside.

736
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,891
But I'm driving and I'm...

737
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:57,917
Come on.

738
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,424
Please.

739
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,721
Answer the phone. Please, please, please.

740
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,933
<i>- Duty desk.</i>
- Hello. PC Davids?

741
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,226
<i>- Speaking.
- Yes.</i>

742
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,770
It's Ivan Locke from the Park project.

743
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,774
I was wondering if anyone had
called you about road closures.

744
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,319
<i>Yeah, we had some Irish guy.
Said he was standing in.</i>

745
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,698
Good, yes. I'm just double-checking
the closures are all confirmed, yes?

746
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,784
<i>One minute.</i>

747
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,746
<i>No, there's... There's a problem</i>

748
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,498
<i>- with the Vale stop and go.
- What?</i>

749
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,875
<i>There's a problem with
the Vale stop and go.</i>

750
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:40,960
Shit!

751
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,254
<i>The council, they've questioned
the license at the last minute.</i>

752
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,713
<i>- Shit.
- So...</i>

753
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,465
<i>I was gonna call them in the morning.</i>

754
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,135
- Well, it's too late.
- I'm sorry?

755
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,139
We have to control the road to get
the trucks in and out of the south gate.

756
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,099
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Locke.</i>

757
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,226
<i>You'll have to take that
up with the council.</i>

758
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,478
- But it's 9:00.
- Yeah.

759
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,981
Well, the council offices
are closed, aren't they?

760
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:07,361
<i>That's right, but I can't ratify until
the council sign off on the stop and go.</i>

761
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,488
Okay, no, I understand. Okay, I understand.

762
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,323
You'll get a call.
How long are you on duty for?

763
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,491
<i>You have a call waiting.</i>

764
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,660
<i>Well, you've got another 25 minutes.</i>

765
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,247
Okay, look, you'll get a call, okay?
You'll get a call.

766
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:25,004
<i>Ivan, we have a problem
with the stop and go.</i>

767
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,809
I know, I just heard. I'm dealing with it.

768
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,967
In the meantime, I need you
to go and check the shuttering

769
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,385
and get it signed off.

770
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,596
<i>No, the shuttering boys have all gone home.</i>

771
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,807
Even so, you still have to go
and check the rebars, don't you?

772
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,310
Go and do it now. Take a shovel

773
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,021
and a pressure meter and a torch
and get into the holes.

774
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,981
<i>- Jesus. Jesus.
- I mean it.</i>

775
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,402
<i>Okay, but if this is just to stop me
drinking, you can fuck right off.</i>

776
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,031
Listen, I'm hoping
your conscience will stop you drinking.

777
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:56,202
The shuttering has to be checked.
Go... Go and do it. Go.

778
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,255
<i>- Hello?
- Sean, it's Dad.</i>

779
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,051
<i>Dad, I can't believe you're not here.
It's amazing. 2-1.</i>

780
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,220
I know, I know. Sean...

781
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,972
Sorry.

782
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,807
Sean, I need you to do me a favor.

783
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,393
<i>- There's...
- You have a call waiting.</i>

784
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,729
There's been a cock-up at work
and I need to speak to someone.

785
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,358
In my blue coat in the kitchen, yes?
There's a notebook.

786
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,652
There's a phone number in the notebook
of somebody called Cassidy

787
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,405
who works for the council clerk of works.
I need the number.

788
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,242
<i>- Why don't you ask Mum?
- Please... Sean, please.</i>

789
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,910
Just get the number. Text it to me.

790
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,205
Cassidy. It's under It's very urgent.

791
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,831
<i>Dad, is Mum all right?</i>

792
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,086
<i>She hasn't come down. It's half-time.</i>

793
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:54,301
Sean, in the morning
I will talk to you about everything, okay?

794
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,889
Now, you just get me
the number of Cassidy, please.

795
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,735
<i>- Hello. Can I speak to Ivan Locke?</i>
- This <i>is Ivan Locke.</i>

796
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,281
<i>I'm Dr. Halil Gullu. I'm the senior
obstetrician at St. Mary's Hospital.</i>

797
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,283
<i>- You have a call waiting.
- We have a Bethan Maguire here</i>

798
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,244
<i>who's given us this number
as the number of her next of kin.</i>

799
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,621
<i>- Are you her next of kin?
- What's happening?</i>

800
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,582
<i>I'm sorry. Are you the next of kin?</i>

801
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:27,459
<i>- I am the father.
- Excuse me. Hang on.</i>

802
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,338
<i>I'll deal with that.</i>

803
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,300
<i>Mr. Locke, I'm sorry,
we have a situation here</i>

804
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,025
<i>where the baby's umbilical cord
is wrapped around the baby's neck.</i>

805
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,513
<i>- Yes,</i> I know. <i>Yes.
- And the baby is very distressed.</i>

806
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,473
And you're going to carry out a cesarean.

807
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>Yes, that's right, but Miss Maguire says
she wants to wait until you are here.</i>

808
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,897
Well, she's distressed.
She's quite an odd person, I think.

809
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:52,026
<i>Look, if we're gonna get her to cooperate,
I really need you to speak to her.</i>

810
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,486
Of course you do, absolutely.
Go on, put her on.

811
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,156
<i>Thank you very much. Please hold the line.</i>

812
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,410
<i>- Bethan.
- They want to do it now.</i>

813
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,538
Right, well, let them do it.
I've said let them do it.

814
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,750
It doesn't matter if I'm not there
for the moment of the birth

815
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,169
because I will still be
there in the morning,

816
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,838
before morning, in fact,
and it will still be the same day.

817
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,548
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm on the motorway.</i>

818
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,677
Luton. Now, you let them do it
and don't be silly.

819
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,138
<i>Fuck you!</i>

820
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,851
<i>Ivan, you know I told
them it was one night.</i>

821
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:29,146
<i>I told them about the room
and feeling so sad after.</i>

822
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,522
<i>- Yes.
- But the nurse said,</i>

823
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,859
<i>"If he's coming all this way down,
he must feel something."</i>

824
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,944
<i>- If it was just once and I get pregnant...
- You're distressed.</i>

825
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,029
<i>...it's fate.</i>

826
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,658
<i>I told them I love you,
even if it was just once.</i>

827
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,534
Well, there's no need to say that.

828
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,828
<i>- And it'll be ours.
- Yes.</i>

829
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,165
<i>How far away are you?</i>

830
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,376
Bethan.

831
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,587
Now, a baby is something
that cannot be stopped.

832
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,049
You have to take
all the practical steps to prepare.

833
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,679
<i>- You want me to let them cut me open.
- Yes.</i> I <i>mean,</i> it <i>is the best thing.</i>

834
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,016
<i>Okay. I'll do it because I love you.</i>

835
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,602
Okay, then.

836
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,731
<i>Can you not say it back, even once?</i>

837
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,901
No, I can't. Look... I can't.

838
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,906
But I can be there
as fast as the traffic will allow.

839
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,760
<i>Ivan, I just found Sean
looking through your pockets.</i>

840
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:45,097
<i>- He said you asked him for a phone number.
- Yes.</i>

841
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,642
<i>Now, at this moment,
you need a phone number?</i>

842
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:53,605
I know how it looks, but I need to...
I need to confirm a stop and go.

843
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,444
Tomorrow there's a pour.
It's a big... It is historical.

844
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,614
- It is the biggest pour in Europe.
- Can you hear yourself, <i>Ivan?</i>

845
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,077
<i>I'm falling apart at home
and you're closing roads?</i>

846
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,370
It's not a closure, it's a stop and go.

847
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:12,040
<i>The woman is giving birth
and you're closing roads.</i>

848
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,879
<i>Since you've told me about this woman,</i>

849
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:21,133
<i>you have been getting
further and further away from who I know.</i>

850
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,136
<i>No, actually, it might be that I do know.</i>

851
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,474
<i>In the... In the kitchen,
your footprints, they go hard</i>

852
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,309
<i>and I have to chip them away.</i>

853
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,395
<i>You leave concrete behind you everywhere.</i>

854
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,106
Katrina, I love you.

855
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,317
Okay? I made one mistake.

856
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,486
I don't feel anything for this woman,

857
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,821
and I'm trying to do the
right thing tonight,

858
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,617
because she is on her own
and the baby is my fault.

859
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:51,705
And I know how it feels
to be coming out into the world like this.

860
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:58,086
There is someone being brought
into the world and it's my fault.

861
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,298
- So I have to fix it, somehow.
- Oh, <i>my</i> God.

862
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:08,222
I would really like it if you would say
that you will wait and I can come back

863
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,767
and we can talk... We can talk about it

864
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,187
and that we can fix something up.

865
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:21,026
I really want to know
that tomorrow I can drive home

866
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,738
and talk to the boys
and be at home as normal,

867
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:31,036
and we can go out or something
and have a drink and talk about it.

868
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,040
I want to know
that I am not driving in one direction...

869
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:42,714
I want to know that I will be driving back
when the sun comes up.

870
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,926
<i>Ivan, let me ask you a question.</i>

871
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:52,558
<i>Do you still want me to give you the
phone number so you can close the road?</i>

872
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,894
Yes.

873
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,105
<i>Right, well, goodbye, Ivan.</i>

874
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,790
Yes.

875
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,044
<i>I think I've just done something
on my own initiative.</i>

876
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,128
You did?

877
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:07,424
<i>I found the mobile number for
the council guy who signs off the closures.</i>

878
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,470
<i>- Cassidy?
- Yeah, Cassidy. That's him.</i>

879
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,138
You found his number?

880
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,343
<i>Yeah, I have his mobile number.
I knew you'd need it.</i>

881
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,976
<i>You took it over Christmas in case,
and I found it.</i>

882
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,853
- Donal, you did that?
- Yeah!

883
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,649
<i>And that's on two cans of fucking cider.
Do you want it?</i>

884
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,152
Okay, right. Well, give me the number.

885
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,613
<i>Okay, okay, okay-.</i>

886
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:33,325
- 07700-900...
- 077... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

887
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,494
07700...

888
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:41,291
- 900957.
- 07700-900.

889
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,834
- 077...
<i>- 957.</i>

890
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,962
<i>- 00...
- Okay, yeah.</i>

891
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:49,841
<i>- 900557.
- No, no, no. 957.</i>

892
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,470
900957.

893
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,075
<i>- 957. Did you write it down?
- No, it's</i> in my head. Thank <i>you.</i>

894
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,521
957.

895
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,193
Jesus.

896
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,489
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

897
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,700
Pick up the phone.

898
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,704
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Cassidy?</i>

899
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,707
It's Ivan Locke from the Park project.

900
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:22,874
<i>Who?</i>

901
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:27,129
I'm running the site at Claremount.
We've some road closures agreed.

902
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,881
<i>- How did you get this number?
- You gave</i> it <i>to me.</i>

903
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,009
You gave it to me
in case anything came up over Christmas.

904
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,554
<i>- Yeah, well, it's not Christmas.
- Yes, but</i> I <i>need</i> a <i>sign-off.</i>

905
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,391
<i>- I'm in an Indian restaurant.
- Yes, but</i> I <i>need</i> a <i>sign-off.</i>

906
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,686
<i>- Seriously,</i> I <i>need it.
- I told you, I'm in an Indian restaurant.</i>

907
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:46,815
Okay, if I give you the number of the duty
officer at the Belmount Police Station...

908
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,318
<i>- This'll have to wait. Sorry.
- No, please. Shit.</i>

909
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,070
- No, please, please, please.
- No.

910
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,322
<i>- Please. Please... No.
- This will have to wait.</i>

911
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,700
Without this... It can't wait.

912
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,369
- Concrete is coming tomorrow.
- I'm <i>in</i> a bloody <i>Indian</i> restaurant!

913
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,038
Yes, I know and I'm really sorry.

914
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:05,250
Please. I just need you, please,
to call the duty officer.

915
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,548
<i>- You're Ivan Locke?
- Yes.</i>

916
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,094
<i>I remember you. You ran a tight ship.</i>

917
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,262
Yes.

918
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,266
<i>The only construction director
who gave us paperwork ahead of time.</i>

919
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,603
Yes, yes, but tonight, I'm sorry,
things have just...

920
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,189
They've happened beyond my control.

921
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,775
<i>Okay, okay, okay-.</i>

922
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,194
<i>- Give me the bloody number.
- Thank you.</i>

923
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:37,407
Okay. 07957-452...

924
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:50,420
You know, I could have easily
let the concrete go to hell,

925
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,130
but I didn't.

926
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,634
You know, Dad, when you came
creeping back, saying you were sorry,

927
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,220
it was even worse than staying away.

928
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,347
Yes, I'm serious.

929
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:04,643
I could have broken
your fucking back for that, but I didn't.

930
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:08,772
And the fact that I could have done it
was worse than anything, you know?

931
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:11,441
Because you were so fucking weak.

932
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:15,487
That was the first thing I noticed.
So weak.

933
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:22,410
All the things I fucking despise
inside one fucking stupid green shirt.

934
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,955
<i>You looked pathetic.</i>

935
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,583
<i>My fucking dad in...
What were they? They were trainers.</i>

936
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:33,672
<i>They were some sort of fucking trainers
that teenagers wear.</i>

937
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,882
<i>And your hair was all over the place.</i>

938
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,803
You don't drink anymore
and you don't fucking smoke dope.

939
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:43,932
We're all supposed to celebrate, is
that it? Celebrate what, exactly?

940
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,725
I was 23 years old

941
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:49,104
and this old cunt
comes from the fucking blue sky.

942
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,691
He says, "Guess what, everybody. I've..."

943
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,818
<i>- What'?
- Ivan.</i>

944
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,028
<i>- What?
- Ivan, it's all going to hell.</i>

945
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,530
What?

946
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:03,577
<i>The rebars in the shuttering in pit six,
they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fart.</i>

947
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,997
<i>It's those mavericks from up north
we put in there at the last minute.</i>

948
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,791
- What tension did they hold?
- They hold nothing!

949
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,085
<i>They hold nothing at all.
It came away with a push.</i>

950
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,587
Is there anybody there?

951
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:16,506
<i>No, shutterers all went home ages ago.
They're not in till 6:00.</i>

952
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,679
<i>- Right, call the</i> Albanian.
<i>- No, I've tried the Albanian.</i>

953
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,806
<i>He's not answering.
Nobody's answering. Nobody's answering.</i>

954
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,893
<i>There's some fucking football game on!</i>

955
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,064
<i>- Could you call</i> in <i>your</i> sons?
<i>- No, they're in Germany.</i>

956
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,860
<i>- They're digging out missile silos.
- Okay, okay, Donal. Here's what you do.</i>

957
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,239
You drive down to the ring road
near the fire station, okay?

958
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,575
And you'll see a road gang laying lines.

959
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,620
You ask for a guy called Stefan.
He's Polish.

960
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:51,208
Tell him there's 500 pounds for him
and two of his best diggers

961
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,627
if they can get down and
fix up some rebars.

962
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,045
<i>A road gang?</i>

963
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,130
Yes, I know. But I know them. I know them.

964
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,926
They're slumming it for the cash.
Stefan is the best concrete farmer I know.

965
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,762
Now, you mention my name. He owes me.

966
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,852
<i>So, do I have to drive down there?
Can I not just ring them?</i>

967
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,940
Donal, how many ciders have you had?

968
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,484
Donal?

969
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,529
Donal, I don't have Stefan's number.
You'll need to drive down there.

970
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,783
They'll be knocking off
and going home in, like, half an hour.

971
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,285
<i>Okay, Ivan, I'm gonna be straight with you.</i>

972
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,079
<i>I'm not drunk.</i>

973
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,625
<i>I'm not drunk, okay, but
I've had too much to get behind a wheel.</i>

974
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,294
<i>If I get stopped again, I go inside.</i>

975
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,547
<i>And I can't do that.</i>

976
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,427
Okay, then you run.

977
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,680
<i>- I run?
- Yeah.</i>

978
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:51,476
Stefan and his men will knock off
in half an hour due to council regulations

979
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,062
because they can't burn
bitumen lights after 10:00.

980
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,314
So if you run, you'll get there
before they get in their van.

981
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,191
<i>What do you mean, run?
I'm not gonna fucking run.</i>

982
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,110
You will fucking run, Donal.

983
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,821
- I haven't... I'm not...
- You will fucking run now.

984
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:05,156
Go, or my building won't get built.

985
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:08,451
<i>- Are you mad?
- Yes.</i>

986
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,078
<i>- Run? I'm not...
- Yes, I'm mad.</i>

987
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:14,499
Tonight I've gone mad
and I will have to get used to being mad.

988
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,501
<i>- You have a call waiting.
- And Donal...</i>

989
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,672
- I can hear in your voice when you're drunk.
- I'm not.

990
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,133
No, but when you're drunk,
you can run faster, can't you?

991
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,677
For a while at least.
You can run like a fucking kid.

992
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,263
You can run like the fucking wind.

993
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,349
<i>So I'm gonna get out of my boots
and put on my trainers?</i>

994
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,852
<i>- My run-fast trainers?
- Yes, yes.</i> Then <i>you</i> run.

995
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:37,188
<i>So you want me to run?
Run for those fucking bastards in Chicago</i>

996
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,115
<i>who don't give a shit
if I live or if I die?</i>

997
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:44,029
No, you do it for the piece of sky
we are stealing with our building.

998
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,364
You do it for the air
that will be displaced,

999
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,200
and most of all
you do it for the fucking concrete.

1000
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,036
Because it is delicate as blood.

1001
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,621
<i>You really have gone fucking mad, right?</i>

1002
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,374
Well, that would be a fair assessment, yes.

1003
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,835
<i>All right.</i>

1004
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,715
<i>- Right, Ivan, here I go!
- You're</i> a <i>good man, Donal.</i>

1005
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,885
You are, you're a good man.
Go on now, run. Run!

1006
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:10,680
It will work out. I will make sure of it.

1007
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,390
You'll see. You'll see.

1008
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,976
You see, you take things in your own hands,

1009
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,897
and you push against it
and you push against it until it's upright.

1010
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,775
And you stick to the plan.

1011
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,081
<i>Hi. This is Bethan.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

1012
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,415
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1013
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,418
Bethan, it's me.

1014
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,090
I know they're operating on you right now,
but I just wanted to say good luck.

1015
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,761
Good luck, Bethan.
This baby is a good thing.

1016
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,055
And you deserve to be happy.

1017
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,437
You see? Life.

1018
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,109
Yes, life sentence.

1019
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,111
So what?

1020
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:11,908
I will do what needs to be done,
even if they hate me or love me.

1021
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,953
You have to be solid

1022
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,122
so that it makes no difference
what they think.

1023
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,792
You know,
if I were to bury you tonight, again,

1024
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,919
before I threw dirt on your face,

1025
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,463
I would say, "Look.

1026
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,758
"Look and fucking learn."

1027
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,636
I drove in this direction

1028
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,722
and there will be a new person
when I get there.

1029
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,142
Yes, because of that night.

1030
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,981
Constructed out of two bottles of wine
and somebody feeling lonely.

1031
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:47,110
How could you ever beat that
for a construction?

1032
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,080
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Sean.</i>

1033
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,000
- We won.
- What was the score?

1034
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,211
<i>- 3-1.</i>
- Good. Good.

1035
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,841
Good.

1036
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:14,179
<i>Caldwell, Robinson and Caldwell again.</i>

1037
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,680
Good.

1038
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,683
Is everything okay?

1039
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,768
<i>Yeah.</i>

1040
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,688
<i>No.</i>

1041
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,401
<i>Mum looks like she's seen a ghost.
She broke some plates.</i>

1042
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,196
Yes, well, something's happened.

1043
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,990
<i>I'll</i> explain when I'm not driving.

1044
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,541
<i>She's upstairs.</i>

1045
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,877
Yes, <i>I'll</i> explain when I'm not driving

1046
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,546
and when I'm with you
and Eddie together, you know?

1047
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,173
I...

1048
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,469
I've only just explained it to myself.

1049
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,222
<i>She said you're not coming home ever.</i>

1050
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,682
Well, she's distressed.

1051
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,061
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

1052
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,648
Where else would I go?

1053
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,900
<i>So I'll tell Eddie that
you are coming home?</i>

1054
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,568
<i>He's been crying.</i>

1055
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,406
Look, when I get to the
other end, I'll call.

1056
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,454
Sean, you tell Eddie that it's okay,

1057
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,374
that I'll make it okay, okay?

1058
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,211
<i>Doesn't feel like it's okay.</i>

1059
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,422
<i>Felt different after half-time.</i>

1060
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,759
I'll fix it and it'll
all go back to normal.

1061
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,223
- Now, you should go to bed.
- Yeah.

1062
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,894
<i>- Third goal was amazing.
- Caldwell?</i>

1063
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:49,065
<i>- Took it round the keeper.
- Good God. Caldwell's</i> a <i>donkey.</i>

1064
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,443
<i>Normally he's a donkey,
but tonight he was brilliant.</i>

1065
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,613
It's a miracle. What a miracle!

1066
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,451
Right, that's it. Go on, good night.

1067
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:04,706
<i>- Night,</i> Dad. See you tomorrow.
- Yes, absolutely, hopefully.

1068
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,625
We'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.

1069
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,852
<i>You know, I nearly got fucking run down
by a taxi there, running.</i>

1070
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,979
- Did you find Stefan?
- Jesus Christ.

1071
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,897
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

1072
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,442
<i>Right, I can see the flames.
They're burning.</i>

1073
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,652
<i>Oh, my God. They're burning the road.</i>

1074
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,822
<i>- I can smell...
- You have a call waiting.</i>

1075
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:42,160
<i>- The bitumen, it's getting in my throat.
- His name</i> is <i>Stefan, Donal.</i>

1076
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,495
Give them 500 each.

1077
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,166
<i>Oh, man, Ivan, I'm fucking... I'm fucked!</i>

1078
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,500
You sound sober.

1079
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:53,838
Now, listen, you tell Stefan
to bring two men and a jack.

1080
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,340
500 apiece.

1081
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,717
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1082
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,970
<i>Yeah, I'll call you
when I've got the Poles in my... Fuck!</i>

1083
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,805
<i>In my grasp, okay?</i>

1084
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,682
<i>Jesus, my heart's coming out...</i>

1085
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,020
Stefan is a good man.

1086
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,691
He will fix the pit and check the others.
All 12 pumps will work.

1087
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,986
The stop-go will run.

1088
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:22,408
The north, south, east and west gates
will all take their quarter of concrete.

1089
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,869
The baby will be born.

1090
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,246
And Katrina will be okay.

1091
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,333
In the morning she will be okay.

1092
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,712
That is how it can be. That is my prayer.

1093
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,882
<i>And when the baby is born,</i>

1094
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:41,052
<i>when he's seven or when she's seven,</i>

1095
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,220
<i>it'll say it's okay.</i>

1096
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:46,224
<i>And the name will be Locke.
Locke is okay. We do okay.</i>

1097
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,769
<i>Because...
Because I straightened the name out.</i>

1098
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:57,360
The Lockes were a long line of shit,
but I straightened the name out.

1099
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,240
You know what, you old bastard?
You know what? I know now.

1100
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,742
I know now why you ran away.

1101
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,913
Yeah?

1102
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,750
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
I'm in a van with three Poles</i>

1103
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:16,754
<i>who smell like fucking burning rooftops.</i>

1104
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,425
<i>And they said 600, right,
so I guess you're gonna say yeah?</i>

1105
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,927
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah, good, okay.</i>

1106
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,887
<i>This guy Stefan,
he doesn't say much, does he?</i>

1107
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,932
<i>- well, no, but he's a good</i> man.
<i>- You want a word with him?</i>

1108
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,352
No. Stefan knows what to do.
You'll be okay now, Donal.

1109
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,271
- Yeah, yeah.
- You fix up the rebars

1110
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,314
and start preparing the gates.

1111
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,984
<i>- Okay.</i>
- It will be along night.

1112
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,611
<i>Jesus, I'm stone-cold sober now.</i>

1113
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,697
I know. I know. It all worked out.

1114
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:44,949
<i>- What?
- I said...</i>

1115
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,369
<i>Wait, wait, wait...
Stefan just said, ”Say hello.</i> ”

1116
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:51,080
<i>He said, ”Say hello to Ivan Locke.</i> ”

1117
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,915
<i>What? Right.</i>

1118
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,295
<i>He says to say
you're the best man in England.</i>

1119
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,266
<i>- Ivan?
- Yes.</i>

1120
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,809
<i>I've decided.</i>

1121
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,645
Kat, you know what?
We can work this out. I know we can.

1122
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:18,483
<i>No, no, no. I've spoken to my
sister and my half-sister.</i>

1123
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:22,487
<i>And the difference between
once and never is everything.</i>

1124
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:26,324
<i>So, that's it. And it never is once anyway.</i>

1125
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:29,786
<i>- Katrina,</i> listen...
<i>- I don't want you to come back, Ivan.</i>

1126
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,039
<i>This is not your home anymore
and I want you to stay away.</i>

1127
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,749
Katrina, please, listen.

1128
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,835
<i>We will make arrangements
for seeing the boys.</i>

1129
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,922
<i>But, look, I... I don't
want you coming here.</i>

1130
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,511
<i>You were always more in love
with your buildings anyway.</i>

1131
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,317
<i>Why don't you go and live in one of them?</i>

1132
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,931
<i>I mean, right at the top
where you like to look out</i>

1133
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,266
<i>and feel so pleased with yourself.</i>

1134
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,355
<i>Hey, I'm gonna wash everything here,</i>

1135
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,192
<i>wash it all out 10 times
to get the dust of you out of it.</i>

1136
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,822
<i>I won't have to deal with your footprints</i>

1137
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,366
<i>turning to stone
on the kitchen floor anymore.</i>

1138
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,330
<i>It's finished. This isn't your home.</i>

1139
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,647
Ivan Locke.

1140
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,815
<i>Ivan, I've put
a construction director onto this.</i>

1141
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:08,402
<i>He's tried to reach Donal 100 times,
but Donal isn't picking up.</i>

1142
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,281
<i>Are you there, Ivan?</i>

1143
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,908
Yes.

1144
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:18,996
<i>Look, can you reach Donal and tell him
he's got to pick up his phone immediately?</i>

1145
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,208
<i>Ivan?</i>

1146
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,671
Tell your construction director
there's no need to speak to Donal.

1147
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,714
Everything's already taken care of.

1148
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,633
<i>Ivan, for fuck's sake, I can't do this.</i>

1149
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:35,680
Everything is taken care of
and everything is ready for 5:25.

1150
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:38,349
<i>- There</i> will be no <i>mistakes.
- You have a call waiting.</i>

1151
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:42,144
I have made sure of everything
and I've made sure everything is in place.

1152
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:45,439
You can go to sleep now, Gareth.
Good night.

1153
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,194
<i>You know, I actually threw up earlier.</i>

1154
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,488
<i>- Yeah'?
- Fucking yeah.</i>

1155
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,700
Well, hear this, Gareth.

1156
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:59,578
When I left the site
just over two hours ago,

1157
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:04,208
I had a job, a wife, a home.

1158
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:08,671
And now I have none of those things.
I have none of those things left.

1159
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,632
I just have myself and the car that I'm in.

1160
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,010
And I'm just driving and that's it.

1161
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,892
<i>Ivan, you fucked up your life,
that's your business,</i>

1162
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,395
<i>but Chicago is going insane.</i>

1163
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,859
Two words I learned tonight.

1164
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,069
Fuck Chicago.

1165
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,136
<i>This is Ivan Locke. Please leave a message.</i>

1166
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,391
<i>Hey, Dad. It's Eddie.</i>

1167
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,936
<i>I'm on my mobile. I'm under the duvet.</i>

1168
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,274
<i>I... I just wanted to
tell you about the goal.</i>

1169
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,905
<i>Caldwell got it in
and he controlled it, you know?</i>

1170
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:20,326
<i>You know how you shout at him
because it always flies off into the crowd?</i>

1171
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:24,038
<i>Yeah, he controlled it
and he got it down on the ground,</i>

1172
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:27,917
<i>and you know how you say
he just lumps it forward all the time?</i>

1173
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,710
<i>Well, he got it down on the ground.</i>

1174
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,962
<i>This is Caldwell, Dad, and he just...</i>

1175
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,132
<i>He just started running
and running and running.</i>

1176
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,592
<i>And...</i>

1177
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,804
<i>And these defenders
were just bouncing off him.</i>

1178
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,264
<i>And he went round one and then the other.</i>

1179
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,109
<i>And me and Sean were standing up
and shouting at him to pass the ball.</i>

1180
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,769
<i>”Pass the ball!</i> ”

1181
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,064
<i>You say you've got to square it.</i>

1182
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,941
<i>He wouldn't square it. He wouldn't pass.</i>

1183
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,735
<i>He just... He just kept running.</i>

1184
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,155
<i>He was...
He looked like a horse or something.</i>

1185
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,866
<i>And then the goalie's coming forward</i>

1186
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,869
<i>and we think he's gonna
boot it over the bar.</i>

1187
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:08,541
<i>Remember against...
Anyway, whoever it was.</i>

1188
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,546
<i>And we thought he was gonna boot it
over the bar again, but he didn't.</i>

1189
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:18,008
<i>This is Caldwell, Dad,
the one you say is always a donkey.</i>

1190
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,763
<i>He went round the goalie and put it in.</i>

1191
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,228
<i>Mum was crying, so she didn't even see it.</i>

1192
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:36,026
<i>But we recorded it for you, so you have to
come home and watch it, okay?</i>

1193
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,989
<i>You have to come home,
and I have an idea, okay?</i>

1194
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:43,659
<i>So, we'll pretend we don't know the score</i>

1195
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:47,788
<i>and pretend it's happening then,
pretend it's live.</i>

1196
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:51,208
<i>And me and Sean will go mad all the same,
and you can have your beer</i>

1197
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,170
<i>and Mum can make the sausages, so...</i>

1198
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,881
<i>So, that's what we'll do.</i>

1199
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,217
<i>Good night, Dad.</i>

1200
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,468
<i>Ivan?</i>

1201
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,098
Is everything okay?

1202
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,270
<i>Listen.</i>

1203
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,785
<i>Ivan, will you come?</i>

1204
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,914
Yes.
