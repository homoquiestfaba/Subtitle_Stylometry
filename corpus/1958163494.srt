1
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,368
You know.

2
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,637
My name is Rick Klingman.

3
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,472
I am an attorney and a
political consultant.

4
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,511
Some people might say, oh,
that guy is a con artist

5
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:22,815
or a fraud or a dirty trickster

6
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,720
or he can't name all three
branches of the government.

7
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,821
And they're wrong.

8
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,627
I am simply a truth provider.

9
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,795
This morning on
behalf of my client,

10
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:39,164
I filed a lawsuit with the
Tomkins County Courthouse

11
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,868
to stop production of the
new play, "Freeing Lincoln."

12
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,706
In this play,
producer, Seth Rogen,

13
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,274
alleges that Abraham Lincoln,

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,243
a great American and one
of our greatest presidents

15
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,347
was, in fact, a gay man.

16
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,518
I have asked Judge Ennington
for an immediate injunction

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,420
and I am awaiting her ruling.

18
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,489
Every once in a while,
someone will hire me

19
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,525
to get their truth out there

20
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,528
and when I hear
what they're about,

21
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,368
I think I don't know,
maybe that's not good.

22
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,571
But the more I think about it

23
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:22,541
and talk about it, I
start to believe it.

24
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,242
I start to believe their truth

25
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,648
and then it becomes the truth.

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,348
I see Jessica from "The Daily
Beast," hello, how are you?

27
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,618
- Hi, Rick, doing well.

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,687
Who are these people behind you?

29
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:35,888
Are they with you?

30
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,556
- Yes, yes.

31
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,327
I mean, this gentleman's sign
says Lincoln was straight.

32
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,896
That's what we're alleging.

33
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,598
- What about her?

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,236
- Yeah, no, I asked her
not to stand here with us,

35
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,804
but she won't leave.

36
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,972
She said no way.

37
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,607
But that's her right.

38
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,307
This is American,
First Amendment.

39
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,878
The man was shot
in the head, okay.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,746
He's not here to defend himself.

41
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:01,681
I'm sorry, I don't
think it's right

42
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:04,583
that a Canadian based
in Hollywood gets

43
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,754
to tear down another
American idol.

44
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,623
- Fuck Rick Klingman.

45
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,490
This guys a fuckin'
piece of shit.

46
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,260
I check Twitter every
day hoping he's gonna die

47
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,929
and when he does finally die,

48
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,364
I'm going to find out
where they buried him,

49
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,834
I'm gonna take a week
and I'm gonna eat nothing

50
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,903
but Taco Bell burritos
and P.F. Chang's.

51
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,771
And then I'm gonna
go to his grave

52
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,306
and I'm gonna spray
the worst diarrhea

53
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,443
anyone's ever had all
over his headstone.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,953
- I see you.

55
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,788
Bossman.

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,456
Bossman.

57
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,291
It's good to see you.

58
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,960
I am an airport expert

59
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:51,664
and my best piece of
advice, take the shuttle.

60
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,465
Here he is right now, look.

61
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,967
Here comes our guy.

62
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,504
I've been waiting less than
10 minutes, here he is.

63
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,506
How are you, brother?

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,776
That's the wrong one.

65
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,011
I thought New York
was a huge success.

66
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,881
The judge threw out the
lawsuit, which we expected,

67
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:13,018
but I proved my point
and my clients are happy

68
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,486
and I think I'm gonna get a lot

69
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,421
of buzz out of this one, so.

70
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,958
Check the Twitter machine.

71
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,728
Let's see what folks are saying.

72
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,996
Rick Klingman is a pathetic worm

73
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,899
who should crawl back into
whatever sewer he came from.

74
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,834
What's up with Rick
Klingman's weird body?

75
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,003
Why does on suit fit him?

76
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,805
I got to give Rick
Klingman credit.

77
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,541
He actually has done
some impressive things

78
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:39,512
in his life considering the fact

79
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,680
that his brain is
made of monkey cum.

80
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:45,084
I think the nature of
what I do lends itself

81
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:47,686
to haters and trolls.

82
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,523
There's this one guy
named Sledge Whopper,

83
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,759
not his real name, and he
goes after me all the time,

84
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,529
man, and he, he
is telling people

85
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,431
I pranked this idiot
and I owned him.

86
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,736
No one owns Rick Klingman,

87
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,638
except City Second
National Bank,

88
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,743
which owns most
of my condominium.

89
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,378
Home sweet home.

90
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,947
I love coming home
after a long flight.

91
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,851
I like to relax, get a little-
- Hello.

92
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:19,718
- Oh, my God.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,788
- What are you, why.

94
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,960
Excuse me, guys, one second.

95
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,496
What the hell was that?

96
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,932
- I told you, I don't
want cameras in the house.

97
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,099
- Here's the deal.

98
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,534
A, you live in my condo.

99
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,070
B, I am your boss.

100
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,739
So, as your boss, I am
ordering you to be cool.

101
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,407
Can you be cool?

102
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,879
Welcome to Casa Del
Klingman and Marco,

103
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,881
who not only is my
executive assistant,

104
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,918
he's also my roommate.
- Mm-hmm, hello.

105
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,152
- Been working together

106
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,521
for about three years now.
- Four years.

107
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:58,157
- He makes the greatest dish.

108
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,560
It's the uh, the chicken
and the rice one.

109
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,162
- Yeah, arroz con pollo.

110
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:03,898
It's very good.

111
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,497
- Is that what it's called?

112
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,601
The one, it's got like
the yellowish sauce?

113
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,636
- Yellow sauce on top
of rice and chicken?

114
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,171
It's arroz on pollo.

115
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,607
- Let me know if I have any
phone calls I need to roll.

116
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,542
- Absolutely, I will
let you know anything

117
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,545
that I have to tell you.

118
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,813
- So, this is it.

119
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,616
This is the humble abode.

120
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,918
I love Asia and I did some work

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,687
with some gentlemen
from Hong Kong,

122
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,923
who had a startup.

123
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,793
They were trying to, uh,

124
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,630
get canned dolphin exported

125
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,198
and people were furious,

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,036
but the reality is, is
dolphins are incredibly healthy

127
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,538
to eat and there really
are a lot of them.

128
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,742
Welcome to central command.

129
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,441
I miss my guys.

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,111
Miss my platoon.

131
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,915
- Oh, I
didn't realize you served.

132
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,815
- Well, I wanted to.

133
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:00,886
I wanted to serve,
but, unfortunately,

134
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:05,660
my left leg is about a quarter
of a millimeter shorter

135
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,060
than my right leg.

136
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,495
This is my friend Neil's
40th birthday, paintball.

137
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,164
This is, this is kind
of the central hub

138
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,199
of my office right here.

139
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,836
I was an onboard advisor
for Enchanted Cruise Lines,

140
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,838
I don't know if you guys
know them. Oh, my God.

141
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,507
They called me the Fet Boy,

142
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,575
'cause I was always the
first in line at the buffet.

143
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,044
Look at that crab.

144
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:26,845
Look how big that
frickin' crab is.

145
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,850
I worked for Enchanted
for six years

146
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,519
until I got real sick.

147
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:37,089
I ate some buffet
queso, we think.

148
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:39,091
It could've been
a lot of things.

149
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,827
But, uh, whatever it
was, it was tapeworm

150
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,095
and it gave me the tapeworm

151
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,998
and so I lost ton of weight.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,467
All my chest hair fell out.

153
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,568
I was real sick.

154
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,870
I ended up suing the cruise line

155
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,106
and I settled out of
court, which was great.

156
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,710
And I, unfortunately,
ended up gaining

157
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,979
a lot of weight
back right there.

158
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,716
That's me at about 309, 310
right there, real unhealthy,

159
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,719
so I decided I was
going to sign up

160
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,921
with a oh, let's just call it

161
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,957
a certain famous
weight loss company.

162
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,593
That worked so well
that I ended up

163
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,129
with kidney failure.

164
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,965
Lost too much weight too fast.

165
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,805
So, I sued that weight
loss company and I won

166
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,907
and that is kind of what
really put me on the map.

167
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,748
And I learned that I
was put on this earth

168
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,048
to make a difference

169
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,821
and I can make money
making that difference.

170
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,323
So, I, uh, yeah, I started

171
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:47,762
my own consulting
firm, Maximum Truth.

172
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,666
That's for you, take it.

173
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,902
I got like two left.

174
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,139
- Who hires you?

175
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,773
- All kinds of people.

176
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:05,179
I mean, titans of
industry, CEOs.

177
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,848
Do you remember Tonya Harding?

178
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,783
Her brother.

179
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:13,085
So, I got a phone call

180
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,021
from my friend,
Mary Jo Nackerson,

181
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,823
who is a big activist

182
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,725
with some pretty deep pockets

183
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,826
and she wants to talk,

184
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,164
so we're going to Beverly Hills.

185
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:25,798
Don't even have to lock it.

186
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,268
Not in this neighborhood.

187
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,741
- There he is, Mr. Handsome.

188
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,375
- Where? Where?

189
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:38,911
- Ah, oh.
- You okay?

190
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,279
- Oh, the pain.
- What happened?

191
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,981
- Oh, honey, I just
got new choppers

192
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,817
and they're still
finding their grit, see.

193
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:45,984
Look good, though, huh?

194
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:46,819
- Oh, look at that.
- Look, look.

195
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,220
- Look at those,
they're beautiful.

196
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,021
- Yeah, I paid a lot
of money for them

197
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:49,822
I'll tell you that much.

198
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:50,689
- I got these on sale.

199
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,359
- Oh, come on in, come on in.

200
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,928
I'm fine, I'm fine, really.

201
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,363
My husband, Wilbur and I spent

202
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,966
a lot of time working on
this house, tiny details.

203
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,969
Oh, and there he is now.

204
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,672
Wilbur, my sweet Wilbur.
- Yes.

205
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,340
- Just a wonderful man.

206
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,712
Wilbur was a big shell
guy, natural gas, so.

207
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,847
- You mean fracking?

208
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,183
- Uh, I wouldn't
call it fracking.

209
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:23,023
- No, it's fracking and Wilbur
practically invented it.

210
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,191
- It's fracking. Wilbur
invented it and I love it.

211
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,761
- Let me ask, Rick,
what do you really want?

212
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,430
- I would love to
expand my operation

213
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,232
and maybe open up a
little office, you know,

214
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:37,002
Washington, DC, be bi-coastal.

215
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,837
- Rick, I had a job for you

216
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,206
and if you do it right,

217
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,210
all of that is possible.

218
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,244
- I'm listening.

219
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,178
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,884
Antonio Kelly-Zhang.

221
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,117
You know him?

222
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,719
- Yeah, I think I do.

223
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,887
Was he on "Below Deck?"

224
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,788
- He is running for Congress

225
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,157
right here in Los Angeles.

226
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,426
- Oh, yes, no, no,
I do know this guy.

227
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,130
He's very young and
very photogenic, hello.

228
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,065
- He is a disaster
for people like us

229
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,403
and I have evidence
that he may be a demon.

230
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,072
- Well, I think that is
definitely worth investigating.

231
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,107
It might be hard to prove.

232
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,909
If it's true, that's a big deal

233
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,477
and he's kind of in trouble,

234
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,315
but I think, yeah,
you can maybe, uh,

235
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,084
I think we can do a little
digging on this guy.

236
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,386
- Well, that's what
I want you to do.

237
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:31,290
If you can find something
to knock him out,

238
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,093
this is just the beginning.

239
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,397
- Mary Jo.
- Yes.

240
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:39,998
- I'm in.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,135
- Oh, fantastic,
that's fantastic.

242
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,870
- My pleasure.

243
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,106
- Ah, oh, God, oh.
- That's a big one.

244
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,141
- Will you go up to my room

245
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:52,044
and just get those pain pills.

246
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,412
They're on the nightstand table.

247
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,780
- Pain pills on the
nightstand table.

248
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,114
- Pills on the
nightstand table, oh.

249
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,050
- Got it, I'll be right back.

250
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:01,521
Mary Jo, just hang tight.

251
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,889
So, when Mary Jo
reached out yesterday,

252
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,424
I thought three words.

253
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,125
I need Simon.

254
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,828
How would I describe
Simon Tarnum?

255
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,896
One word.

256
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,533
LeBron James.

257
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,934
He led the boycott
of the Apple store

258
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,170
for not selling his app.

259
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,273
He led the boycott of Chipotle

260
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,809
when they started
serving soy riso.

261
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,314
This is a young man who
is just an up and comer

262
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,918
and did I mention
he's easy on the eyes?

263
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,819
I mean, if I was a woman,

264
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,221
he would be my boyfriend.

265
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,056
He said to meet him
in the backyard,

266
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,993
so, I think I can
guess what he's doing.

267
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,995
I was right.
- Yo, man.

268
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,162
- There he is.
- There he is.

269
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,464
- Come on.
- Oh.

270
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,365
- Look at that.

271
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,333
- Got the camera crew, huh?

272
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,835
I'm gonna try that.

273
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,370
- Hah!

274
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,572
Hah!

275
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,039
Hah!

276
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,007
- You don't have
to do the grunts.

277
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,043
I just got 20 more seconds.

278
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,177
- Whoo!
- Get this.

279
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,013
- Yeah, burn it out.

280
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,115
- Get there, Simon.
- That's good.

281
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,050
- It works a lot of
different muscle groups.

282
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,256
- Come on, you fuckin' pussy.
- Yeah.

283
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,393
- I had a very fun
lunch yesterday

284
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,928
with Mary Jo Nackerson

285
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,031
and she has a job for me

286
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:22,036
and I thought maybe it
could be a job for us.

287
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,203
- I'm listening.
- Okay.

288
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,939
- She wants us to
do a little dig

289
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,143
on one Antonio Kelly-Zhang.
- Creepy.

290
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,177
- Yeah, you know this guy?

291
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,845
- Hate his face.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,147
- Hate his face.

293
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,349
- Do you know who he is?
- Yeah.

294
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,218
- Yeah.

295
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,252
Who is he again?

296
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,453
- He's running for Congress.
- Okay.

297
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,121
- In LA.
- That's what it is.

298
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,056
- That's why I know him.
- On the east side.

299
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,457
- Oh, you know what it is?

300
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,225
I saw him on Natalie
Portman's Instagram one time

301
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,294
before she blocked
me, the coward.

302
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,631
- All we gotta do
is just kind of do

303
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,066
a little background
check on this guy.

304
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,368
You know, find out
where's he been,

305
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,469
what's his story.

306
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:00,372
Is he hiding anything.
- I see.

307
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,574
- You know?
- I see.

308
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:02,974
- You wanna get down
and dirty with it.

309
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,309
- Yeah, I mean,
that's the business.

310
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,977
This is all totally legal.
- Yep.

311
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,649
- You know, but it comes down
to me needing you, Simon.

312
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,150
I mean, this guy, he's
young, he's viral.

313
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,052
You're young, you're viral.

314
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,088
I need your expertise

315
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,490
and we've been looking to
do a collab for a while

316
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:22,260
and this kind of seems like
it's the perfect thing.

317
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:26,033
So, I'm here to ask
you, what do you think?

318
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,266
- What do I think?

319
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,302
Oh, God, it's gonna be tough.

320
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,436
Might need to sleep
on it, you know.

321
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,171
- No, that's fine.

322
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,073
- I might need a couple days.

323
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,208
You know?
- No, I get it.

324
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,577
- I get it and it was, you know,

325
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,144
we're all working on things,

326
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,412
but I thought, this
could be just kind of-

327
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,582
- I'm kidding. I'm in.

328
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,415
Do a little zoom.

329
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,052
Daddy's in.

330
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,086
Come on.
- Come on, now.

331
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,622
- Come on, now.

332
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:58,163
- I, I thought you
were going, I'm sorry,

333
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,331
I thought you were
going for a fist bump

334
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,067
and I went way too long.

335
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,035
- Listen, I gotta,
I gotta ship out

336
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,103
some supplements, but-
- Oh.

337
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,238
- Instead of taking off,

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,172
why don't you come and check out

339
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,340
what I got working over here.

340
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,107
- You wanna see this
little mogul right here?

341
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:09,809
- In the garage.

342
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,176
I just got Wahlberg to cut in.

343
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,110
- You got Mark Wahlberg?

344
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,246
- Donnie. Donnie.

345
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,480
- Shut up.
- "Bluebloods."

346
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,982
- I met him and Jenny
McCarthy one time

347
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,216
and I took a picture with them.

348
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,485
- Whoa, welcome to the factory.

349
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,688
We got, oh, what
have we got here?

350
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,022
- Whoo!

351
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,157
- Oh, is that, is that the, uh,

352
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,291
highest quality
weightlifting supplement

353
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,292
on the market right now?

354
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,059
I think it is.
- Look at that.

355
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,127
- Check that out.

356
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,730
Shredded and you can get

357
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:34,268
this beautiful product
at shredded.net.

358
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:36,736
You just pop that right there

359
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,470
when I did that with the finger.

360
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,705
- We're
not doing that.

361
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,373
- You could pop a
link right there.

362
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,708
- It's all right, it's
all right, doesn't matter.

363
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,677
- And I love that you
guys only used one D.

364
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,411
It's kind of like skewing
a little bit, you know.

365
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,647
This ain't, this ain't

366
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,214
your daddy's chocolate
protein powder.

367
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,551
- Missed two Ds, one two.

368
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:52,652
- Oh, no, no, I
meant like, you know,

369
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:54,520
two Ds next to each other.

370
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,721
- That would be shre-ded.

371
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,524
I'm not gonna do that.

372
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:01,561
- No, no, no, look, normally
it would be two, that's good,

373
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,662
it's good.
- Shredded.

374
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,298
It's gotta be
shredded, get shredded.

375
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,333
- You have an opponent,
you find their weakness.

376
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,769
- Yeah.

377
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,773
- You investigate, you
expose, you exploit, IEE.

378
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:15,541
What about policies?

379
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:16,742
Because this guy
is pretty radical.

380
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,043
- You know, I think
we should just

381
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,478
avoid policy
altogether, you know.

382
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,048
It's not what the young
people are into, it's boring.

383
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,417
- Yeah, we think it's
boring, that's true.

384
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,652
- Doesn't make any sense.
- That's true, I get it.

385
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,120
- You know what, we'll pull
that off the board, policy.

386
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,256
- Yeah, yeah, make
space, former jobs.

387
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,357
What'd he do before this?

388
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,561
- Former jobs.

389
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,094
Command center activate.

390
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,633
- Oh, I'm feeling some
momentum now, baby, oh, yeah.

391
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,234
- Okay, well, he worked at
a community outreach program

392
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,168
for homeless folks.

393
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,369
- Mm, community outreach?

394
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,071
What does that even mean?

395
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,507
That's gotta be a front for
something, dive into that.

396
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,407
What'd he do before?
- I'm gonna mark that one.

397
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,276
Before that he-
- Give it to me.

398
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,713
- Oh, he worked at a
Lavashe, it's a restaurant.

399
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,615
I, I, I've been there.
- Beautiful.

400
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,650
- Put it on, put it
on an index card.

401
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,084
- What card? What color?

402
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,420
- Mm, green, get it green, yeah.

403
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,624
- Lavashe.
- But it looks like, uh,

404
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,325
looks like we might
have a first stop, huh?

405
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,195
- Yeah.

406
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,428
On the board baby.

407
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,599
- Put it on the board!

408
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,433
- Hello.

409
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,568
Welcome to Lavashe.

410
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,737
We're actually not
open for dinner yet.

411
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,104
- Uh, what is your name?

412
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:19,805
- Shannon.

413
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,206
- Shannon, up, there we go.

414
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,508
Rick Klingman, this
is Simon Tarnum.

415
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,743
- Hola, Shannon.

416
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:25,377
- Shannon, we're
making a documentary

417
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,480
about, uh, Antonio Kelly-Zhang

418
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,850
and we were wondering
if maybe you worked

419
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,317
with him and you could give us

420
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,520
a little information about him?

421
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,221
- I didn't, unfortunately.

422
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,791
- Uh, well, hold on, is
there anyone working now

423
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,527
who worked with Antonio
when he was here perhaps?

424
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,328
- Yeah, Gabriel's our manager.

425
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,463
- He worked with him, yeah.
- Gabriel?

426
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,431
- Let's, is he here right now?

427
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,601
- Mm-hmm, let me go
see if he's available.

428
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,168
- Oh, Shannon,
thank you so much.

429
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,136
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

430
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,073
- What am I looking at here?

431
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,243
$42 for a steak.

432
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:00,580
I could buy a steak, I could
buy three bottles of wine,

433
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,314
potatoes, make it at home for
that price, this is insane.

434
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,415
- Bienvenue a Lavashe.

435
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,150
I'm Gabriel, the manager.

436
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,484
- We're actually making
a little documentary

437
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,154
and we wanted to know, you know,

438
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:12,357
just basically what kind
of employee Antonio was,

439
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,225
just kind of see what
he was all about.

440
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,128
- You're looking
for dirt on Antonio?

441
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,330
- Si.

442
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:19,199
- Is there any?

443
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:23,435
- Well, I worked
here with Antonio

444
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,507
for a couple of years
and I can tell you this.

445
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:30,676
He was employee de la semaine
four semaines in a row,

446
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,243
that's a month.
- What does that mean?

447
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,512
- He was a perfect employee.

448
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,347
Everyone loved him
and we all support

449
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,281
what he's doing now.

450
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,183
- Perhaps there were some folks

451
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,919
who worked here
while he was here

452
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,353
who might not think he was-

453
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,487
- How about I give
you 10 seconds

454
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,421
to turn off your cameras

455
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,489
and get out of my restaurant.

456
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,490
- Gabe.

457
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,324
- It's Gabriel.
- Gabriel.

458
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,727
- Gabey, Gabey.

459
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:48,728
- Now, why don't
you get out of here

460
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,663
or I will drag you out
of here by your balls.

461
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,364
- Ah, fuckin' threat,
that's a threat.

462
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,799
Say that one more time.

463
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:54,500
- It absolutely is,
now get the fuck out.

464
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,401
Take your grandfather with you.

465
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:57,903
- Wow.
- Grandfather.

466
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:58,671
- Keep going, keep going,
this is all good stuff.

467
00:18:58,673 --> 00:18:59,872
- Grandfather?

468
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,774
- Isn't he late for
Little League practice?

469
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,676
- He hasn't played Little
League in five years

470
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:07,412
and I'm only 12
years older tops.

471
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,614
You know what? It's fine.

472
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,882
I want you to know
something, my friend.

473
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,316
I am an attorney and I
can still practice law

474
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,953
in Nevada, in New
Mexico, in Arizona

475
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,387
and parts of Florida.

476
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,354
You blew it.
- Successful.

477
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,823
- You blew it.

478
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:18,891
- We gotta listen to the
back of that recording,

479
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,325
'cause we could have something.

480
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,292
- See, I don't think
there is anything.

481
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,460
- None of it?
- Excuse me.

482
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,729
- Because he didn't
say anything.

483
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,429
- He said it absolutely is.
- Excuse me.

484
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,296
- Excuse me, hi.

485
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,700
You dropped this.

486
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,434
- I don't think I did.

487
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,537
- No, I saw you drop
it a couple of times.

488
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,738
- No, I'm sorry.
- You did.

489
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,706
- You're thinking
of someone else.

490
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,406
- You're very careless, now.

491
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,575
- Didn't bring any napkins, so.

492
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:37,810
- What are-
- Don't be so careless.

493
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,248
- What is that?

494
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,249
- Get in the car.
- Yeah.

495
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:44,884
- Get in the car.

496
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,284
- What's going on?

497
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,488
- Get in the car,
get in the car.

498
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:56,294
- I did not drop this.
- Right.

499
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,530
- He wanted me to
have it, call me.

500
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,598
- Yeah, he wants to
go on a date with you.

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,001
- No, no, he, he wants,
he knows something.

502
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:02,968
He knows something.
- About Antonio?

503
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,637
- Yes.
- Jesus fuckin' Christ.

504
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,673
- Come on.
- Whoo! This is huge.

505
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:08,908
- Okay, this is actually-
- I mean.

506
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,009
- Almond.

507
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,677
- Hello, hello, hi.

508
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,678
No, no, I'm sorry, this isn't a,

509
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,013
this isn't a ride share.
- Sorry.

510
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:14,749
- Sorry.

511
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,651
Get a big black car,
everyone thinks it's an Uber.

512
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,654
I have this very strange ability

513
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,490
where people who have a secret,

514
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,692
they can smell me or something.

515
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,961
They, they, they,
they smell me coming

516
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:31,296
and they're like this
is a guy I can trust.

517
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,665
- If they smell you,

518
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,634
it seems like they
have the ability.

519
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,403
- But, no, but it's,
I give off the smell.

520
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,607
It's like, who has more talent,

521
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:42,810
a person or a skunk?

522
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:44,810
A skunk.

523
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:46,812
He's the one making the smell.

524
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,483
Otherwise he's just
a, what is he? A cat.

525
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,485
Uh, can I get you
something to drink,

526
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,854
some OJ or coffee, maybe?

527
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,657
- Uh, I'll have a Jack and Coke.

528
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,491
- Sure. Have a seat.

529
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,893
Simon Tarnum, my associate.

530
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,695
This is Fred Zurtz.
- Hi.

531
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:03,963
- Yeah.
- How are you?

532
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,396
- It's good to see
you. All right.

533
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,966
- Have a seat there, Fred.

534
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:07,869
Let me get this.

535
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,301
That's for you.

536
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:10,972
- Oh.

537
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,440
- I got mixers handy.

538
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,844
- Not too much Coke.
- Okay, gotcha.

539
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,046
- This cinnamon
bread's really good.

540
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,583
Is it European?

541
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,652
- That is actually from
Vaughn's right down the street,

542
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,053
but it, it's really good.

543
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,556
They make a great roll.

544
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,625
Now, we didn't get
into it too much over

545
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,760
the phone, but you
said that you used

546
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:37,696
to work with
Antonio Kelly-Zhang?

547
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,898
- Yeah, for like three months.

548
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,100
- So, what, what was
your experience working

549
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:43,903
with Antonio from
your perspective?

550
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,370
- He was just always
making fun of me.

551
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:46,806
- That's your ass, man.

552
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:49,608
- Let me ask you a
question, and I apologize.

553
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,413
Was the harassment
ever sexual in nature?

554
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,347
- Yeah, it was.

555
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,017
- Jesus Christ.

556
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,885
- This is a safe space.

557
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:02,922
I need you to be as
specific as you can

558
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:05,560
about the nature of
the sexual harassment.

559
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,427
- Man, at first
it was just talk,

560
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,868
like, "Hey, Fred, you ever
think about doing your sister?

561
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,036
Admit it Fred, you
wanna do your sister.

562
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,138
You wanna do her and
you want me to watch.

563
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,740
That's what you
like, don't you?"

564
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:24,076
- And he was talking
about your sister?

565
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,477
- I mean, he was
obsessed with it

566
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,113
and I hated it
because I do not want

567
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:32,017
to have sex with my
sister, not at all.

568
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,822
- Did Antonio ever cross the
line with you physically?

569
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:40,793
- Well, when I was
marrying the ketchups

570
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:43,762
and Antonio walked out, up to me

571
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,601
and he grabbed my dick
and snapped it back.

572
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:49,604
- What?

573
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,470
- Um.

574
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,607
- How, uh, describe the-

575
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:55,943
- Yeah, describe-
- How that went.

576
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:58,844
- Well, he grabbed my dick

577
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,646
and I said, "What the fuck?"

578
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:03,515
And then he snapped it back.

579
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,618
- Just so I can
have like a picture,

580
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,720
were you like nude at work?

581
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:09,156
- No, it was under the pants.

582
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,826
- Were you wearing
like sweat pants?

583
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,094
Like the elastic-
- What?

584
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:15,861
- I'm trying to
think how does he-

585
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,029
- It doesn't matter.

586
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,631
This is a harassment.
- It is, it is.

587
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,199
- This is total harassment.
- Oh, no, no, no.

588
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,567
- Don't eat off the floor.
- Don't worry about that.

589
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,635
- Don't eat
off the floor, oh.

590
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,536
Okay, okay, it's
fine, it's fine.

591
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,840
- You were harassed, okay.

592
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:30,075
I want you to know that.
- Okay.

593
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,176
- That's unacceptable
what happened to you.

594
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:32,113
You get that, right?

595
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:36,615
- This is, these are kind
of tearing through me now.

596
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,183
I, can I use your john?

597
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,752
- Yeah, of course, yeah, no, no,

598
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,486
it's right over
there on the, uh,

599
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:42,957
right in that door.

600
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,028
Yeah, yeah, sure,
it's right over there.

601
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:49,728
Got soap and stuff,
whatever you need.

602
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,165
Take your time.
- Okay.

603
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:54,068
- Smoking gun.

604
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,735
- When he leaves, we make calls.

605
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,603
- Absolutely.
- All right.

606
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:59,071
- Are you familiar with

607
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:02,141
the congressional candidate,
Antonio Kelly-Zhang?

608
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:04,076
- Are you a journalist or
are you not a journalist?

609
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:04,910
Well, I'm telling you, bro,

610
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:05,878
this is the real deal.

611
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,146
The real hizzy, baby.

612
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:11,517
- This press conference
will be, I think, viral.

613
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,018
- Of course we have evidence.

614
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Why wouldn't we, why would
we call a press conference

615
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,255
and not have evidence.

616
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:17,990
I thought George
was the last name?

617
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,860
Then I don't know
who I'm calling.

618
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,831
- Yes, yes, I want
to get, I want to see

619
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,535
if you want.

620
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,869
- What happened, you
reached for the water?

621
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,472
Yeah, no, sorry,
that was my dog.

622
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,607
- You have a
journalistic obligation-

623
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,076
- I'll jump through
this fuckin' phone

624
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:39,545
and I'll knock you the
fuck out right now, pal.

625
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,047
- The press needs
me and I need them,

626
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:45,985
so it's a Cibian relationship.

627
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,553
Talk to me, buddy,
what do we got?

628
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:50,022
- All right, just got off
with "DC Insider" man.

629
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,523
- Okay, he's good.
- Not just that, though.

630
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:52,891
- Yeah.

631
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:55,294
- Elliott Pegsley.
- Oh, yeah.

632
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,963
- Marie Hootzahausen is
the correct pronunciation.

633
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,231
- I don't know her.
- Yeah.

634
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,867
- I got us Jessica Hall
from "The Daily Beast."

635
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,802
- Ooh, no, ew, fake news bitch.

636
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:07,673
- Well, that bitch can
be a man or a woman.

637
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:11,043
Men call me bitch, men call
women bitches, doesn't matter.

638
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,846
But she does have reach.

639
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,080
She has a lot of reach.
- Yeah, all right.

640
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:15,948
- I'm trying to broad
the operation a little.

641
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,782
- Yep.

642
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,050
- So.
- Cool.

643
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:18,951
- It's out there,
we are looking good.

644
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,719
Oh, here he is, hey, Marco.

645
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,588
You remember Simon.

646
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,288
- What up Marco.

647
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,691
- What's in the bags?

648
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,595
- Groceries for me.

649
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:33,067
- Take your time,
take your time.

650
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,169
- What's going on with Marco?

651
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:38,937
- He's fine, don't
worry about him.

652
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,973
What we need to worry
about is something else

653
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:43,342
because we have a problem.
- Why?

654
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:46,278
- Where the heck we're gonna
celebrate tonight, baby,

655
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,747
'cause I'm thinking
BJ's Brewhouse.

656
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:49,782
- I love BJ's.

657
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:50,649
Why are we celebrating?

658
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,884
What are we doing?

659
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,052
- 'Cause we booked
a press conference.

660
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,186
This is happening.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,055
- It's in the water, come
on, man, we're doing it.

662
00:25:56,057 --> 00:26:00,027
Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you
make a little more noise?

663
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:01,860
- Are you asking me to
make some more noise?

664
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:02,861
- I know, that-

665
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,029
- Am I being irritating?

666
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:04,997
- I was being facetious
because you were,

667
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:08,200
it was like a construction
site over there.

668
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:12,371
So, uh, BJ's was a disaster
I think was the right word.

669
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:15,974
They told me it would
be a two-hour wait,

670
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:18,977
which is insane
because I'm there, oh,

671
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,346
200 times a year.

672
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,982
I've spent every birthday
there for six years.

673
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:24,950
But there was a new hostess

674
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,652
and she was feeling herself

675
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:30,722
and she said, "Sir, it's
not gonna happen tonight,"

676
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:34,128
and I said, "Wait till I call
Carl, who is your manager."

677
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,362
Agh, doesn't matter,
doesn't matter.

678
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:40,234
We're home, we brought
the party home style.

679
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,305
I think that's the caviar.

680
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,175
Hope you guys are hungry.

681
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,144
- There we go.

682
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,015
What do we got?

683
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,017
Mischa, can I get you
some Ranch or something?

684
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,720
- It's Misa and, yeah, duh.

685
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:02,955
- Yeah, Misa.

686
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,389
That's a beautiful name,
is that, uh, perhaps,

687
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,791
you're from Europe, maybe?

688
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,894
- It's from Tampa Bay
is where I'm from.

689
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:11,797
- Top three cities in America,
Tampa Bay, number two.

690
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,366
Love it, great BJ's Brewhouse
there by the airport.

691
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,439
I'm gonna run over there.

692
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,192
Hello? Yeah.

693
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:39,426
Oh my gosh.

694
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:42,094
Wait, you're here?

695
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,797
You're here right now?

696
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:48,369
Oh, okay, I'm coming down.

697
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,837
So, he's not going to jail?

698
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,838
- Well, I filed a report

699
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,306
and there will be a fine,

700
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:57,309
but no, we're releasing him
on his own recognizance.

701
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:59,144
- But why did
you bring him here?

702
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,245
- Because he gave
us this address

703
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,281
and said you were a friend.

704
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:04,483
- No, I met him for the
first time yesterday.

705
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:05,417
I don't know this man.

706
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,386
- Well, that's your problem.

707
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:10,289
- No, officer, officer,
officer, officer.

708
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,924
I backed the blue.

709
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:13,827
- Have a nice night.
Thanks for your donation.

710
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,329
- I wanna know why
you were masturbating

711
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:20,933
in your car in front
of the Salvation Army.

712
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:24,970
- Well, that's not
actually accurate.

713
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,441
I mean, I was with
a lady friend.

714
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:31,210
- Uh-huh and where is she?

715
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,845
I mean, did she get
arrested, as well?

716
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,115
- No, she had to go shopping.

717
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:39,985
- That's bonkers.
Absolutely bonkers.

718
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:41,355
No one will believe that story.

719
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:46,124
Fred, you couldn't have waited?

720
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,426
You couldn't have
waited until we did

721
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,827
what we're trying
to do, you know?

722
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,796
This is bigger than you, man.

723
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,335
- Can we, uh, can we
stop at Chick-Fil-A?

724
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,470
- I want you to
answer me right now.

725
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:03,075
Did Antonio Kelly-Zhang
sexually harass you or not?

726
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:07,515
- Yeah, you know, I can't
actually remember if it was him.

727
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,383
It could've been
an array of people.

728
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,353
I just have that kind of thing

729
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:17,889
that people wanna,
you know, do that to.

730
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:20,394
But someone did snap my dick.

731
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:22,928
- Hey.
- Hey, morning.

732
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,998
- What the fuck is
going on? It's leg day.

733
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,399
- Yeah, no, I know,
I did my legs, too.

734
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:32,239
Um, I don't think we can
go with the Fred angle.

735
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:35,040
- What are you talking
about? Why? Why not?

736
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,441
- I don't know, man.

737
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,177
I think he, himself,
might be a sex criminal

738
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,913
and the minute they Google him,

739
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,950
this is all over.

740
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,220
- Fuck, okay, so, we can't
use like any of the story or?

741
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:50,222
- Maybe as like
a backup, backup.

742
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,857
If we find nothing else.
- Yeah.

743
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,526
- Which we will.
- Absolutely.

744
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,193
- I mean, we have merely
scratched the surface.

745
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:57,129
- Just gotta reset, recharge.

746
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,164
- He's hiding something
and we're gonna find it.

747
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:04,269
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. How?

748
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,572
- Maybe it's time we
let him know that?

749
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,874
- I feel like you're getting
that idea face, I love it.

750
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:12,545
- We're gonna go to his house
and let him know we know.

751
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:15,881
- Let just our eyes and our
presence bring it out in him.

752
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,383
- Once he sees us there
and let him know, hey, bud,

753
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,918
we know what's going on,
he's gonna go oh, shit.

754
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,554
- Yeah.
- And he's gonna freak out.

755
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:23,523
- Just fuckin' stare
at him, beautiful.

756
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:27,426
- There's only one
problem. It's too perfect.

757
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:30,295
In this business, you
have to become an expert

758
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:34,168
and special ops,
recon, stakeouts.

759
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,537
I one time sat in my car

760
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,473
in front of Ed Begley
Jr.'s house for three days.

761
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,308
So the other camera's
ready to go right there?

762
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,277
- He will come
out when we get out of the car.

763
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,912
- It's like a proper ambush.

764
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,581
- Official, wow.
- Yeah.

765
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,415
- You know, this is all
totally legally, by the way.

766
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,118
You're allowed to, you know,

767
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,954
park in front of
someone's house and yeah,

768
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,155
this his all legal.

769
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,457
- Not doing anything right now.

770
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,258
- Oh, my God, there
they are, they're there.

771
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,426
Go, go, go, move,
move, you're clear.

772
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,295
Here we go, we're live.

773
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:05,030
Here we go.

774
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:06,932
Gentlemen, good morning.

775
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:07,933
Mr. Kelly-Zhang.

776
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,301
- Oh!

777
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:10,570
- Mr. Kelly-Zhang, hello, hello.

778
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,170
- Hey, guys, good to
see you, how are you?

779
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,171
- Hey.
- Good morning.

780
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,373
- How are you?

781
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:15,240
- I got to get my
daughter to school, so.

782
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:16,408
- You know who we are.

783
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,211
- If we can just keep it light.

784
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,680
- How can we help you guys?

785
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,481
- Uh, well, we just wanted
to let you guys know,

786
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,617
very simply, we know.

787
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,485
- Okay, we're not interested in-

788
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,186
- We know?
- Whatever stunt.

789
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,020
- What do we know?
- Yeah.

790
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,355
- What do we know, Kev?

791
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,023
- I think you know what we know.

792
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,593
I think you know what we know.

793
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:34,527
- I don't know.

794
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,027
- Okay, I'm gonna handle this,

795
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:36,662
so why don't you
just get in the car.

796
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:38,397
- Okay.

797
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,632
I will, uh, I'll leave you
and Kevin's capable hands,

798
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,266
but thank you for coming
out and appreciate it.

799
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:42,668
- Thank you.

800
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,468
- We appreciate you.
- Thank you, appreciate it.

801
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,670
- Thank you so much.

802
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,171
- Appreciate
the political politics,

803
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,408
politics talking.
- We know.

804
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,177
- Um, yeah, you guys are idiots.

805
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,613
- Oh, I'm sorry, did
you just call me,

806
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:55,213
did you just call me an idiot?

807
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,181
I have that on camera.

808
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:57,315
- Yes, you are one of two.

809
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,316
- What is it that you do, sir,

810
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,018
if you don't mind me asking?

811
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,021
- I am Kevin Soo, I am Mr.
Kelly-Zhang's press secretary.

812
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,657
- You're a secretary?
- I am.

813
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:05,490
- Cock.

814
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,025
- Okay, okay, okay.

815
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:07,959
- Uh.
- Mr. Soo.

816
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,361
- That's great.

817
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:11,631
- Very simply, I want
you to know we know

818
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,498
and we wanna give you a
chance to comment on this

819
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,637
before everybody knows,
'cause it's out there.

820
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,069
- Kev?
- Yeah.

821
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,237
- Let's go.
- Two seconds.

822
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,472
- So, we're gonna go.

823
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:21,707
Have a good day, gentlemen,

824
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:22,642
I hope that you find
something to do today

825
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,109
because this is really stupid.

826
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,711
- This is stupid,
we actually have to go,

827
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,179
we have to go to the 7th Street-

828
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,346
- Yeah, we
got big plans today.

829
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:29,181
- Soup Kitchen, we're
heading there now,

830
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,683
so we have to go.

831
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:31,651
- We should probably
get running, the traffic.

832
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:32,350
- You're going to the
7th Street Soup Kitchen.

833
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,018
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

834
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
- That's where we're going.

835
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,221
- I heard that,
thank you for making

836
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:37,523
your campaign schedule public.

837
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:38,691
- What?

838
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:40,125
- 'Cause we're
gonna see you there.

839
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,193
And then we're gonna see
you at the next place.

840
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,027
- I'm gonna handle it.

841
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:42,728
- And the next place.

842
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,663
We're gonna be up in your grill.

843
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,363
- Yeah, we're outta here.

844
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,998
Um, I will just have my
office reach out on Monday

845
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,266
- Fantastic.

846
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:49,201
- To let you guys know that, um,

847
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,536
you're total fuckin' losers.

848
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,671
- Oh, we're total
fuckin' losers.

849
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:53,371
- Yeah, have your
office tell us.

850
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:54,507
We need your office to tell us.

851
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,141
- Like that hasn't been
said to me a million times.

852
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,043
- We're gonna see you
guys in a little bit.

853
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,545
Don't hit anyone.

854
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:00,748
- You need help backing out?

855
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:03,549
You need help reversing,

856
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,182
reversing's top.
- See you at the soup kitchen.

857
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:04,851
- Good luck.
- We know.

858
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:07,219
- Hey, we know.
- USA, USA.

859
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,554
- We should go, we should go.

860
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:09,722
Keep movin', movin'.

861
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:14,527
- You gotta open
my side, it's locked.

862
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,695
- No, no, no, no, no.

863
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,530
I locked my keys in the car.
- What?

864
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:19,431
- How,
how, how, how, why?

865
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:22,400
- I was distracted
and then I think,

866
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,603
I think I hit the lock button.

867
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:24,436
- But I don't even
think that's possible,

868
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:26,071
like manufacturers
stop doing that.

869
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,172
- No, no, no, no,
no, you can play

870
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,174
with it in the
settings and change it.

871
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,810
- Why would you change
it, though, 'cause we-

872
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,077
- That doesn't matter.

873
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,345
They're on the road.

874
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,580
- Let's call a car,
let's call an Uber.

875
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:35,413
Let's call an Uber.

876
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,248
- How does that work?

877
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,117
- I don't know.

878
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,318
I gotta get it in the app store.

879
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,287
- App store, app store?
- Yeah.

880
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,823
- You must connect to wifi

881
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:44,690
or a cellular data network-
- I don't have any cellular.

882
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,292
- To access the store.
- Yeah, okay.

883
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:50,462
- Uh, so today was not the best.

884
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,330
By the time we got
to the soup kitchen,

885
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:55,300
we found out that they had
gone to another location,

886
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,669
so we took another Uber
to where we thought

887
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,738
they were, but they
just ended up shuffling

888
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,673
their schedule around
and with the cost

889
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:03,141
of all the Ubers and the guy

890
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,477
who had to come and
break my windows

891
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,846
so that I could
get my car keys out

892
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,446
and the parking ticket I got

893
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:09,649
because of the street cleaning,

894
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:14,319
I am down roughly
500 bucks on the day.

895
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:15,355
So, that's not great.

896
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:20,191
But, I am, uh, not gonna
let it ruin the night.

897
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,528
It is someone's birthday

898
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,599
and I'm making their favorite
dish, coconut shrimps.

899
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,133
- It's my birthday.

900
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,135
- This recipe
is Chef Ted Allen.

901
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:31,571
- Yeah.

902
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,838
- Who you might
know from "Chopped."

903
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,806
- Yo, yo, yo!

904
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,774
- Who is it?

905
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,174
- It's Simon.
- Oh, hey.

906
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,243
- What the fuck?
- Wow, what a surprise.

907
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,177
- I've been texting you.

908
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,412
- Oh, God, sorry, you know,

909
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,548
my phone charger,
the tape on it broke

910
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,785
and what's up?

911
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,152
- I just got a signal hit.

912
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,654
About an hour ago.
- Okay.

913
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,556
- From a source who's
got some dirt on our guy.

914
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,290
- Are you serious?
Okay, here we go.

915
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,759
Talk to me.

916
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,261
- There's apparently a
bachelor party video,

917
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,633
clear as day, Antonio
doing lines of cocaine.

918
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,368
- God bless cocaine.

919
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:04,135
Oh, my gosh, have
you seen the tape?

920
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:05,705
- I haven't, no.

921
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,672
- Okay.
- But it's there, it's real.

922
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,173
- You know, I got a
message from the guy.

923
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:09,575
He wants to Skype
with us tonight.

924
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:10,643
- He's gonna Skype
with us tonight?

925
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,877
- Yeah, he wants
to Skype with us.

926
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,712
- Is this really happening?

927
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:13,646
- It's really happening.

928
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm just waiting on a text now.

929
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:16,416
- My man did it.
- Come on.

930
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:19,250
- Hit me.

931
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,686
- Oh, God, I think you
just broke my hand.

932
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,486
- Yeah, so a mid workout,
mid workout, right.

933
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,655
- Jesus, wow.

934
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:24,657
- Also, I got something planned.

935
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,692
Can I, can I crashed
here for a few days,

936
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,695
just 'cause I got in kind
of a fight with my mom.

937
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:30,696
- Oh, oh, yeah, oh, you
can crash here, oh, yeah.

938
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:31,864
- For five, that's cool.

939
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,199
- No, no, no,
yeah, yeah, I mean,

940
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,602
we're gonna be working on
this around the clock, so.

941
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:37,837
It makes sense if
you're just here.

942
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,705
Uh, great, yeah,
no, no, no, for sure

943
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,674
and, uh, yeah, that's awesome.

944
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,842
- I'm sorry, hello.

945
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:44,476
Are you even turning the shrimp?

946
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,444
- Nobody survives being caught

947
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:49,582
on tape doing hard drugs.

948
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,249
- No.
- You're done.

949
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,450
- If anybody ever
offered me cocaine,

950
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,285
I'd say no, thank you, you know.

951
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:55,688
- Yeah, same here.
- Nope.

952
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,889
- Yeah, it's not good.

953
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,490
- You're saying you've
never done cocaine?

954
00:35:58,492 --> 00:35:59,424
Is that what you're saying?

955
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,394
- Marco, please, what are you,

956
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:03,663
what are you doing?

957
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:05,296
- We were supposed to
have dinner together.

958
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,866
It's my birthday dinner

959
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:10,402
and all I had were three
little shit shrimps.

960
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:11,637
- It's your birthday?

961
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,471
- Look, you, here
have some more rice.

962
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,406
- I don't want-
- Try-

963
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:15,373
- Marco, shut the fuck up.

964
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,374
- What?

965
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:17,710
- It's him, he texted.

966
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:18,944
- What'd he say, what'd he say?

967
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:19,912
- He said he'll
send a Skype link,

968
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,479
but only for using the computer

969
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:22,615
and an internet cafe.

970
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:24,416
- And internet cafe.

971
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,519
It's like where you go when-

972
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,320
- Okay, he says we gotta go now.

973
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:30,255
- There's one on Walnut Street.

974
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,489
Go, go, go, go.

975
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:32,424
- Looks like we're mobile.

976
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,893
- Looks like we're mobile.

977
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:37,763
- Hello? I haven't
even had my cake yet.

978
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:41,499
- Okay, we're logging on.
- We're logged, there he is.

979
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,467
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

980
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,803
- Hello.
- Hello.

981
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:44,672
- Are you alone?

982
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,908
- Yes, pretty much.

983
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,308
- Do you have the tape?

984
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,945
- Yes, and I will
show it to you now.

985
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,647
But you should know,
this tape is just

986
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,782
the tip of the iceberg.

987
00:36:56,784 --> 00:36:58,786
Are you ready to
open Pandora's Box?

988
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,453
- Yes, we are.

989
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,955
Thank you so much.

990
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,690
- I will now who you the first
10 seconds of this video.

991
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,691
- All right, all right.

992
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:07,526
- This is it.
- Give it to us.

993
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:13,632
- Um, okay, Source, we're
seeing tortoises having sex,

994
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,600
so I don't think-
- It's a prank.

995
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:15,668
- It's a prank, it's a prank.

996
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,936
It's a prank.
- This is not-

997
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,571
- Is that you, is that
you Sludge Whopper?

998
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:19,739
- Yes, it is. Suck it, Klingman.

999
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:22,508
- Rat shit, shit.
- Great job.

1000
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,779
- So how long did this take you
to set up, this little scam?

1001
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,713
- I don't know,
like eight minutes

1002
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:30,348
and I made you drive
to an internet cafe.

1003
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,217
- Wasn't even that far, it
was like around the corner.

1004
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,151
- Four-minute drive,
so jokes on you.

1005
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:34,486
- Eat my ass,
you fuckin' clown.

1006
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,288
- You want to eat your ass, oh,
I'll eat it. I'll eat it up.

1007
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,559
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
chill out. Go on, he got us.

1008
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,262
I knew that little
rat was gonna,

1009
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,830
I knew he was gonna get me.

1010
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,665
- Yeah, sometimes someone
who approaches you

1011
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:50,536
with information turns
out to be a bust.

1012
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,337
What are you gonna do?

1013
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:55,841
Are you just gonna cry into
your bowl of ice cream?

1014
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,844
Yes, but you keep going.

1015
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,546
You don't stop.

1016
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:03,751
Stasis is death.

1017
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:08,888
But, uh, I checked
in with Mary Jo.

1018
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,856
She's, she's very excited

1019
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:14,627
and we have our presser
on Friday, so, yeah,

1020
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:16,063
we've moving in the
right direction.

1021
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:20,566
- Why don't you
cancel the press conference?

1022
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:23,536
- No, you never, ever
cancel the presser.

1023
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:26,005
Okay, once you do that,
the mainstream media,

1024
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,438
they smell blood in the water

1025
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,542
and that's when they
really go after you

1026
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:32,611
and they say that you're
just a loser scam artist

1027
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:33,948
who doesn't have anything.

1028
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:36,782
- But you
don't have anything.

1029
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:39,552
- Well, not yet, but we have
plenty of time for discovery.

1030
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,853
You know, we're hitting it,

1031
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,555
the pavement pretty
hard right now

1032
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:44,557
and we have the
fundraiser tonight,

1033
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,560
which is gonna be pretty
enlightening, I think,

1034
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:48,727
and we are definitely

1035
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:53,464
in the all guns
pointing forward mode,

1036
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:58,039
so we're feeling good,
feeling good, right?

1037
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:05,476
I think that we need
to take a bigger look

1038
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:06,113
at the big C.

1039
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:08,948
- Ooh, cancer, I don't know,

1040
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,482
that helps him, I
think, if we do that,

1041
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:13,018
if he has cancer.

1042
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,622
- No, college, I don't know
why I phrased it like that.

1043
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:18,593
I wanna know more about
Antonio in college.

1044
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,894
Should've probably done
this when we first started.

1045
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,762
Antonio Kelly-Zhang.

1046
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:25,598
- What kind of
college boy was he?

1047
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,599
- Let's figure that out.

1048
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:27,935
- Let's ask Google.

1049
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:33,806
- Boom. UCLA class of 2008.
- I knew he was a UCLA brat.

1050
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:37,176
- Okay, okay, how many
people do you think were

1051
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:40,548
in his class at UCLA?

1052
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:44,449
- Seven, eight.

1053
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,785
- No, I mean,
in like his that year?

1054
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:49,822
- Oh, oh, hundreds of thousands.

1055
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:50,789
- Not that many, but a lot.
- A lot.

1056
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:51,790
- A lot.

1057
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,926
And my point is every single one

1058
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:56,662
of those people
might have a story

1059
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:58,797
to tell about Antonio.
- Right.

1060
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:02,970
- So, I think it's time
we got the worms in.

1061
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:07,472
- And you know what? I
think I have a little idea

1062
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,708
on how to track some
of these guys down.

1063
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,810
Facebook alt accounts.

1064
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:12,845
Get on there, reach
out to anybody

1065
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:17,683
who graduated '08, UCLA,
see if we get anything.

1066
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:18,517
- Do you know how to do that?

1067
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,419
- Yeah, it's easy.

1068
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:21,956
- Friggin' Jason
Bourne over here.

1069
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:25,860
Whoo!

1070
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,600
Look at that, so fast.

1071
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,772
Oh, here we go, whoo!

1072
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:41,842
Back in the Benz, early hills.

1073
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,210
Oh, my Lord, that
was a long one.

1074
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,679
- Long time in the car.

1075
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:48,514
- What's
tonight all about?

1076
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:50,516
- The Benjis.

1077
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:51,517
- Benjamins.

1078
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,785
It's about money.

1079
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,153
We're having a little
bit of a fundraiser

1080
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:56,088
because what we're doing
requires money, you know,

1081
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,691
it adds up and Mary
Jo was kind enough

1082
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:01,827
to offer up her beautiful home

1083
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:02,928
as long as we were out by eight

1084
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,663
and she would not buy the food,

1085
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:06,565
so we picked up the food.

1086
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,767
- Yeah, fuckin' had to go
to Arcadia for the catering.

1087
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:09,601
- The money we saved, though.
- Disgusting place.

1088
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:10,536
- It will make up-

1089
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,176
- No, no, no, no, no.

1090
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:18,744
- Uh, pick it up, pick
it up, pick it up.

1091
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:22,014
Pick it up, it's fine, five
second rule, five second rule.

1092
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:25,150
- You're not, are you
still gonna serve these?

1093
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,119
- We're still gonna serve 'em,
we're gonna dust them off,

1094
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,120
we're gonna dust them all off.

1095
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,225
You gotta stop, stop it, you
got a good onion in my eye.

1096
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:34,293
Thumbs up to camera.

1097
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:35,029
Let's do it.

1098
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:37,932
You guys want a hamburger?

1099
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,067
- Okay, how's this angle for you

1100
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:43,235
because this isn't
working for me.

1101
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:45,070
- Yeah, I just need to get
the rifle in a little more.

1102
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,238
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1103
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,206
- Yeah.

1104
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:47,940
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

1105
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:49,208
- Let's go.

1106
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,209
- That's what I'm
saying, big guy.

1107
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,910
It might be too late for you,

1108
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:54,780
but this guy, we could really
turn his life around, huh?

1109
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,248
- Listen, if I get
you on a podcast,

1110
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,316
I could show you some statistics

1111
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:58,617
that's really back all this up.

1112
00:41:58,619 --> 00:41:59,985
- Yeah, I wanna, let me,

1113
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:00,552
I wanna look into that
a little bit more.

1114
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,154
- Sure, I understand.

1115
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:03,288
- Before I can, you
know, it's a hot topic.

1116
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,757
- Of course, of course.

1117
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,825
You know what, give me
your email and I will-

1118
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:07,561
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Okay, I will.

1119
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:10,629
- Mary Jo, hi.

1120
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,231
- Ricky, hey.

1121
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:13,599
- How are you?

1122
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:14,933
- What are you doing here?

1123
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,235
Oh, your party.
- It's going on right now.

1124
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:17,703
I'm gonna get you upstairs.

1125
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:18,670
- Have you got some money?

1126
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,141
- We are working on it.

1127
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:24,243
Take your time, take
your time, my love.

1128
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:25,778
- Whoa!

1129
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,847
Here we go, I got you.
- There you go.

1130
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,115
- Ooh, I squatted,
did you see that?

1131
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,620
- You got down, I saw.
- I got a squat.

1132
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,124
- Uh, Mary Jo's great.

1133
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,360
I think she took one
too many pain pills,

1134
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:43,195
so she's having a nap.

1135
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:46,765
And I see Amy Klort.

1136
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,267
Hey.

1137
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,201
- Hey, Rick.

1138
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,836
Thank, thanks for having me.

1139
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,738
- Thank you for coming here.

1140
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,806
YouTube queen.

1141
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:54,973
- Oh, and the podcast.

1142
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,809
- And the podcast,
podcast, YouTube queen.

1143
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,777
Go to my Facebook page and
there's a little donate link,

1144
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,345
button, you can hit that

1145
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:02,881
and it's usually the fourth
or fifth Rick Klingman

1146
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:03,882
that comes up in the Facebook,

1147
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:05,350
so look for this face.

1148
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,820
Ah, Hartlynn, can I just
thank you for coming tonight

1149
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:09,154
and supporting us.
- Oh, my God, of course.

1150
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,656
- Look, this Antonio
guy is the worst.

1151
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,357
- Yes.

1152
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,326
- If it were up to him,
I wouldn't be doing this.

1153
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:17,029
- Piece of shit.
- He's the bad guy, yeah.

1154
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,698
- And I gotta tell you,
this is quite the piece.

1155
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,033
- You like it? Yeah.

1156
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:21,600
- Yeah, what are we
working with here?

1157
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:23,202
- No, this is an MK-46.

1158
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:23,902
- MK-46, I thought
it was something-

1159
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,537
- Troops in Afghanistan use this

1160
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:26,138
to take out supply tracks.

1161
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,273
- Ooh, that's, hey,
support our troops.

1162
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,843
- Yeah, and my dad got it
for me for my 18th birthday.

1163
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:31,977
- Oh.
- So, sweet.

1164
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:33,011
- Your parents are awesome.

1165
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,012
- They really are.

1166
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,247
- My dad's a dick.

1167
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:37,015
- What a magnificent piece of-
- Artillery.

1168
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,684
- Death machine.
- Death.

1169
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:41,153
- Yeah, that's good.

1170
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,855
- Do you wanna hold it?
- Whoa.

1171
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:45,324
- Yes, I do and I want you
to take a picture of me.

1172
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:46,959
- I'm on my way there.

1173
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:48,794
- Post is on Facebook.
- Let's do it, here we go.

1174
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:50,395
- It is really heavy, I
don't know if you're strong.

1175
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:51,332
- Ah! I am.

1176
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:54,933
- He's got it.
- Whoo!

1177
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,168
- He's got it.

1178
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,070
- Yeah. If we can get
real just for a second,

1179
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,239
the most important thing
when you're dealing

1180
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,040
with guns is safety

1181
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,443
and the first thing you
gotta do is check the safety.

1182
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,081
- Oh, no!
- What are you doing?

1183
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,717
- It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, I'm so sorry.

1184
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,052
- What the-
- I was checking the safety.

1185
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,187
- I was checking the safety.

1186
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,922
- By pulling the trigger?

1187
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,123
What is wrong with you?

1188
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,291
- I thought you
had the safety on.

1189
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:20,826
- Dude.
- That is my bad, guys.

1190
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:24,463
I'm 95% sure that Mary
Jo did not get hit,

1191
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:25,831
but I wanna go check.

1192
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,032
- Give it a check,
give it a little check.

1193
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,735
So, hey, why don't we-

1194
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:31,203
- Fundraising is key.

1195
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:34,008
Cash, check, credit
card, bitcoin.

1196
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,476
Once got paid in Czechenzachers.

1197
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:38,844
Good luck finding
a currency exchange

1198
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,281
that will take that, by the way.

1199
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,048
Literally looks
like Monopoly money.

1200
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,783
- What a great
group of patriots,

1201
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:47,286
all assembly for a
righteous cause, am I right?

1202
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,389
- That's right, that is
right.

1203
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:53,392
- Oh, man, I also just
wanna say I have taken it

1204
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:56,094
upon myself to get you all in

1205
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:58,130
on the ground floor
exclusive opportunity

1206
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:00,332
to make some real money, huh?

1207
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:03,001
Everyone one in this room
has been pre-approved

1208
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:04,770
to be a regional sales executive

1209
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,171
for Shredded Muscle Supplements.

1210
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,840
That's right,
clipboard's right there.

1211
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:10,108
There's a few pens.

1212
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,944
I'm gonna need you all
when you have time,

1213
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:13,879
just full name, date of birth,

1214
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:14,813
Social Security,
that's important-

1215
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,315
- And I can tell you guys,

1216
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:17,849
and I can tell you guys, and
I can tell you guys firsthand

1217
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,985
how great Shredded is

1218
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,287
and we're gonna talk
about that later on,

1219
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,356
but right now I would
be a little remiss

1220
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:26,191
if we didn't talk
about why we're here.

1221
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:30,162
We're all here because
we love this country.

1222
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:31,863
- Amen.

1223
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:34,466
- And when we see someone
like Antonio Kelly-Zhang

1224
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:37,135
attacking it from the
inside, what happens?

1225
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:37,970
What do we do?

1226
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,137
- Get a rope.

1227
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,105
- Hang that fuckin' traitor.

1228
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,140
- No, no, we're not gonna hang,

1229
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:43,909
we're not gonna hang anyone.

1230
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,944
But what we do is
we work together

1231
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:48,447
and we identify our enemy

1232
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,481
and then we take 'em out.

1233
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:50,916
- With violence.

1234
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:51,950
- Not with violence,
not with violence,

1235
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,885
I didn't mean that.

1236
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,822
What I'm saying
is, is our weapon,

1237
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:58,890
it's not a gun, it's not a knife

1238
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:01,527
or a rope, it's the truth

1239
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,195
and the truth is we need money

1240
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,297
because if you wanna
fix the country,

1241
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,866
that ain't cheap,
it all adds up,

1242
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:10,168
the research, the
hotel, the man hours,

1243
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,205
those little tiny corn dogs.

1244
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,575
We need you guys' money.
- Yeah.

1245
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,342
- And there's all different
ways you can donate.

1246
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:18,578
You can go on my Facebook page,

1247
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,245
you can check him
out on social media.

1248
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,313
- Take cash.
- We have a little form.

1249
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:22,314
- We have different-
- Venmo.

1250
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:23,549
- Donor levels.
- Yeah.

1251
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:27,286
- Okay, we have bald
eagle, Uncle Sam,

1252
00:46:27,288 --> 00:46:30,188
Lady Liberty and little
stars and stripes.

1253
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,056
- We named them to make it fun.

1254
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:34,192
- And little stars
and stripes is $2.

1255
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:38,063
And you get a fun little
pencil in the mail

1256
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,098
and you think in $2, what are

1257
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,569
these guys gonna do with $2?

1258
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,237
A lot. So, what do you
say, can you help us out?

1259
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,972
Can you help us out
and get some money?

1260
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,410
- Get the energy back, whoo!

1261
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,210
Well-

1262
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:55,947
You all are wonderful
and I have to take this.

1263
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,883
Uh, I want you to
enjoy yourself.

1264
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:59,084
There's a couple of cupcakes

1265
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,053
and maybe half a
bottle of wine left.

1266
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,988
- Yep.
- So, have some fun.

1267
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,258
- We gotta be outta here in
about five minutes or so,

1268
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,959
so thank you guys, we love you

1269
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,262
and we will see you on Friday.

1270
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:12,598
It's Jessica from
"The Daily Beast."

1271
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,132
Jessica, so sorry about
that, how are you?

1272
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,168
- I saw
that you still have

1273
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,903
the press conference
booked for Friday

1274
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,572
and I just wanted
to see if you wanted

1275
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:20,573
to give me the exclusive?

1276
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,407
- I can't do that, Jessica?

1277
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,544
- Rick, can
I be honest with you?

1278
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:26,411
- I don't know, you're
a journalist, can you?

1279
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,380
- I think
you're flailing.

1280
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,415
You got owned yesterday
by Sludge Whopper

1281
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,084
and I don't think
you have anything

1282
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:33,318
and you're freaking out.

1283
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,387
- No, no, you're
absolutely wrong.

1284
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,122
I am in the hills of Beverly

1285
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,624
with some of the most powerful

1286
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:41,661
and influential people west
of the Mason Dixon line.

1287
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:45,063
- Rick, look, we've
known each other a minute.

1288
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,666
Don't do this.

1289
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:48,266
You've got nothing and you're
just gonna end up having

1290
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,469
a bunch of people
laugh at you again.

1291
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:52,304
- Jessica, I'm gonna let you go

1292
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:53,506
because we have things to do,

1293
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:55,207
but I'm gonna see you on Friday

1294
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:59,111
and you're gonna be shocked at
how explosive this is, okay?

1295
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:00,312
- Rick, I'm-

1296
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:01,148
- Salivating.

1297
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,181
You saw that, she
wanted the exclusive.

1298
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:04,950
I was like no way.

1299
00:48:04,952 --> 00:48:06,118
How's it going out there?

1300
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,619
- Uh, no one's
donating anything.

1301
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:08,120
- Okay.
- Yep.

1302
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:09,354
- I think they're all broke.
- Yes.

1303
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:10,623
- So, we should
just get outta here.

1304
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,124
Let's pack up the
catering supplies

1305
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,092
because if we get them
back to Arcadia by 10,

1306
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,360
full deposit back.

1307
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,496
Oh, God.
- I like that.

1308
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:18,964
- Hi, how are you?

1309
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,099
- I'm good, man, I'm real good.

1310
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,134
- Enjoying your night?

1311
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:23,603
- Yeah, big time.

1312
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:26,037
It's an event.
- Yes.

1313
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,207
- I don't judge people.

1314
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,610
I won't do it, 'cause
you never know.

1315
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:32,043
You don't know.

1316
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:34,413
Someone might be coming
to you with information

1317
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:37,416
and, yes, they might
smell really bad

1318
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:42,256
or, or have just like a,
like a crazy looking face

1319
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:46,158
and I don't say get
outta here, you freak.

1320
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,359
I say, "Tell me what you know."

1321
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,529
I don't think we've
met, I'm Rick Klingman.

1322
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:52,998
- Original Patriot.
- Original Patriot.

1323
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,232
- You reposted some
of my YouTube videos.

1324
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,668
- I knew I knew
you from somewhere.

1325
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,572
I, I, I, I, think you did
one about may family court.

1326
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:01,039
- That's right.
- Yeah, it was good.

1327
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,974
- That's right.

1328
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:03,876
- I don't even have kids and
that judge sounds nuts, so.

1329
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:06,011
- What I'd like to
do is introduce you

1330
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:07,414
to my cousin.

1331
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,584
- Who's your cousin?

1332
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:14,019
- Arliss.
- Okay, but-

1333
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,659
- No, I think he's saying why
should we meet your cousin?

1334
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:22,662
- Well, because I saw
that the cocaine tape

1335
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,396
was some bullshit.

1336
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:26,031
- Now, does he have photos
of Antonio doing cocaine?

1337
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,533
Because that is really-
- That'd be great.

1338
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,433
- What we would,
what we would love.

1339
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:31,369
- If you just come
out, it's your card.

1340
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:32,239
- Call him.

1341
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:37,142
- It has been an
insane 12 hours.

1342
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:38,544
We returned all the
catering equipment

1343
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:41,647
and got our full
deposit back, nice.

1344
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:45,116
Much more importantly,
we spoke to one Arliss.

1345
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:46,786
- Yes.

1346
00:49:46,788 --> 00:49:49,522
- And he does not have a
tape of Antonio doing drugs.

1347
00:49:49,524 --> 00:49:51,524
- Big bummer, big bummer.

1348
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:52,525
- He's got a sex tape.
- Even better.

1349
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,226
- We got a sex tape.

1350
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:56,094
- If this tape is real-
- Sex tape.

1351
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,597
- Which is what we're gonna
go find out right now.

1352
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,064
- Gotta go confirm-
- Confirm information.

1353
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,633
- Make sure the
information is good.

1354
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:02,434
- Is solid, concrete.

1355
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:07,405
Anywhere from just being
passable to pretty wonderful.

1356
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:09,575
- If it's real-
- It's game over.

1357
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:11,644
- That's it, it's game,
it's swish, swish.

1358
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:14,747
He's a little nervous about
maybe showing his face,

1359
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:17,082
so I made sure
that we would agree

1360
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,551
to blur his face out.

1361
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:20,820
- Rick, I
said I wouldn't do that.

1362
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:22,755
- If it comes up, go to the
bathroom or something, dude.

1363
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:24,289
- You
do background checks

1364
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,490
on all your sources, right?

1365
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:26,626
- Background check,
you're gonna do

1366
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:29,394
a background check on every
single person you meet?

1367
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,229
Did you do a
background check on me?

1368
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,565
- We did.

1369
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:33,467
- Did you really?

1370
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,370
So, we're meeting our
contact at Chang Du,

1371
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,672
but we're a little bit early,

1372
00:50:39,674 --> 00:50:41,541
so we're gonna grab a juice.
- Juice it up.

1373
00:50:41,543 --> 00:50:43,277
- What is better
than a mini mall?

1374
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:45,678
- A bigger mall, definitely.

1375
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,580
- Oh, no, see a bigger
mall is too big.

1376
00:50:47,582 --> 00:50:49,214
It's got too much stuff.

1377
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,283
Like what more do you
need than like a salon,

1378
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:55,220
a Chinese place, there's
a vape shop, I think.

1379
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,188
It's perfect.
- Anything else would be good.

1380
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,823
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1381
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:58,660
- I know you guys.

1382
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:01,459
- Oh, really.

1383
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,695
- Yeah, you were protesting
that Seth Rogen play, right?

1384
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:04,362
- That was us, it was
mostly me, though.

1385
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,098
- Eat shit, you fuckin' hogs.

1386
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,133
Huh!

1387
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,635
Huh!

1388
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:11,269
- It's in my eye,
hey, it's in my eye.

1389
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,705
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1390
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:13,639
- Oh, it's so cold, it's
so cold, it's so cold.

1391
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,373
- Let's, hey, hey,
hey, be cool, be cool.

1392
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,176
I think someone
might be filming.

1393
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:18,878
Someone might be filming.
- We gotta cancel the meeting.

1394
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,779
- We gotta cancel the meeting.

1395
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:20,646
- No, no, no, no.
- Nope, I'm going home.

1396
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:21,514
- Hey-

1397
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:22,648
- I'm not doing
meetings like this.

1398
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,883
I'm going home.
- Stop, stop.

1399
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:24,584
- Always keep an
extra suit handy.

1400
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:25,350
- No.

1401
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,086
- A-K-E-S.
- No.

1402
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:28,286
- H, hey, you gotta do it.

1403
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:29,522
- It's never gonna fit me.

1404
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:30,523
That is never gonna fit me.

1405
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:32,190
- Okay.
- I'm too lean.

1406
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:33,526
- It's the only option.
- No.

1407
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:34,794
- Listen to me, listen to me.

1408
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,194
- I'll look like an idiot.

1409
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:37,530
- Take it off, I have a
shirt, I have a shirt.

1410
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:38,898
You take it off.

1411
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,166
We can't go home, he's
waiting, he's probably waiting-

1412
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,233
- Fine, fine, fine.
- Do it.

1413
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:43,468
- And this is a great suit.

1414
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,737
This is Burmese.

1415
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:47,472
Burmese rayon, oh,
you're wasting-

1416
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:48,808
Hi, how are you?
Good to see you.

1417
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,176
We're, uh-
- Fuckin' zoot suit, right?

1418
00:51:51,178 --> 00:51:52,477
- Just, chill, just-
- Okay.

1419
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:54,179
- He's right there.
- Don't-

1420
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:56,549
- He's right there, that's him.
That's him right over there.

1421
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:57,850
- All right, let's
go, get ready.

1422
00:51:57,852 --> 00:52:01,188
- We're gonna speak to
those guys, all business.

1423
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:05,560
You are the gentleman we're
looking for, I believe?

1424
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:07,860
- They're gonna
blur my face, right?

1425
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,294
- The two cameras,
they're gonna both blur

1426
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:12,898
your face out, so
you can relax, okay?

1427
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,835
- Shall we.

1428
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:18,704
- Not my suit, by the way,

1429
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:20,539
so just wanted to, uh-
- Looks great.

1430
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,240
- Before we even get started,

1431
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:24,209
why don't you go ahead and
order whatever you want

1432
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:25,377
on the menu on us.

1433
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:26,579
- Get a couple menus.

1434
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,781
- No, no, I already ate, yeah.

1435
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:29,882
- Okay.

1436
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:31,617
- Been here like an hour.

1437
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:32,785
Got here early.

1438
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:34,386
- We apologize.

1439
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:36,756
We had an incident
outside, might be ANTIFA,

1440
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:38,456
we don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

1441
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,895
- I think you know
why we're here.

1442
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:43,698
We need to see the tape.

1443
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,766
- And I wanna show it to you.
- Great.

1444
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,934
- I wanna show it to you, but-
- That's great.

1445
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:50,738
- We need to talk.

1446
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:53,506
Compensation.
- Absolutely.

1447
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:55,508
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

1448
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,276
- Tell us what you had in mind?

1449
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,979
- $10,000.

1450
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:01,580
- That's what you want?

1451
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:03,248
From us?

1452
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,317
- I mean, I'm putting
myself out on the line here.

1453
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,421
- Honest, I don't have
$10,000 in assets.

1454
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:10,823
- What do you mean you
don't have $10,000.

1455
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:12,357
- You should look
at that, seriously.

1456
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,793
- Here's the deal.

1457
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:15,728
You show me the tape,
there's an ATM right there.

1458
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,464
I will walk out,
withdraw 60 bucks,

1459
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,000
that's my limit, we
wait a few hours,

1460
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,702
I'll get the next 40.

1461
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,772
You're home by five with
100 bucks in your pocket.

1462
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,607
- All right, all
right, all right.

1463
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:29,775
- That's how it's
done on Wall Street.

1464
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:32,611
- Yeah, no, it's
actually really massive.

1465
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:35,614
- I have so many questions
as to how you got this,

1466
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:36,849
but I'm not gonna ask because-

1467
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:39,852
- All right, check
out this fuck fest.

1468
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:43,354
- Yeah, gives us
the fucky, fucky, fucky.

1469
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:44,926
- Yeah, look at that.

1470
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:47,660
Look at that naughty boy.

1471
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:49,028
That's your guy, right?

1472
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,495
- Is this it?
- That's it, that's it.

1473
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:53,298
- That's not it, that's not him.

1474
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,466
- That's him, that's his face.

1475
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:55,668
- That is his face.

1476
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,869
That's the guy you're looking-

1477
00:53:56,871 --> 00:53:58,303
- It's it face, but it's like-

1478
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,505
- He's floating around on-

1479
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:00,706
- It's like in South Park-
- Yes.

1480
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:01,507
- With Saddam Hussein
where he's ah, ah.

1481
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:02,508
- Right, yes, yeah.

1482
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,441
Fuck me Satan.
- Yeah, that-

1483
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:04,977
- It's a weird angle.

1484
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:05,878
Guys, this is loaded.

1485
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,812
- A weird angle?

1486
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:08,581
- It's what, it's low budget.

1487
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,549
This is a Gonzo style
porno, this will pass.

1488
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,986
- I can't believe you wanted
$10,000 for this crap.

1489
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:14,954
Are you insane?

1490
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:15,788
- Shoot for the stars.

1491
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,422
- Are you insane?

1492
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,859
- Hey, can you calm down, now.

1493
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,827
- We're almost done, Sunil,
give me a second, you owe me.

1494
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,062
- No, no, no.

1495
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,329
Get out of here.

1496
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,531
- Get out of here?

1497
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:26,732
- Come on, get,
I don't want you here.

1498
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:27,967
Come on, get out.

1499
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,400
- Why
don't we pause it.

1500
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:30,335
- Okay, if I get out,
I'm never coming back.

1501
00:54:30,337 --> 00:54:31,469
I won't be here Thursday,

1502
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:32,838
I won't be here Sunday.

1503
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,472
I won't be here
Christmas Eve with you.

1504
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:36,075
- Come on.

1505
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,042
- All right, you know, actually
he's right, this sucks.

1506
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,744
We're outta here.

1507
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:39,578
- Excuse me, excuse me,
you just broke my laptop.

1508
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,881
- Uh-huh, okay, sue me.

1509
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:43,348
I'm a lawyer, I'll
see you in court.

1510
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,950
- I will be billing you.

1511
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,619
- What a waste of time,
what a waste of time.

1512
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,021
Sunil, are placing
a to go order.

1513
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:51,824
- It will pass.

1514
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:53,360
- I am a little stressed.

1515
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:56,729
I have a press
conference in 36 hours,

1516
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,031
I have no idea
what I'm gonna say

1517
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,366
and I have Mary Jo calling
every 10 minutes saying,

1518
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:04,003
the election's soon, when's
the update, what's happening?

1519
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:05,604
And I don't know
what to tell her,

1520
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:09,844
so I'm feeling the pressure,
but got a sugar boost.

1521
00:55:11,378 --> 00:55:12,377
Got my man on the
keys right there.

1522
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,846
He's-
- No, no, no.

1523
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:16,849
- I am not doing his laundry.

1524
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:18,717
- Okay, Marco, can
you just relax?

1525
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,418
It's all in the same basket.

1526
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,587
- How about I relax like this.

1527
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:25,024
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, Marco, Marco.

1528
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:26,457
Are you serious?

1529
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:27,593
- I'm serious. I'm done
dealing with this shit.

1530
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:28,861
Just eat your ice cream.

1531
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:29,895
- Come back here right now.

1532
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,031
- English!

1533
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,902
- English, English.

1534
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:36,871
Fired.

1535
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:39,905
He's probably fire after
throwing something at me.

1536
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,876
He can't do that.
He can't do that!

1537
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:44,409
- I got it?

1538
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:45,746
- Got what?

1539
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:48,446
- I fuckin' got it!

1540
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,749
- This is a legitimate
hail Mary situation.

1541
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:54,019
Okay, this genius, his
Facebook plan worked.

1542
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,588
- Yep.

1543
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,089
Heard from one of
Antonio's old classmates

1544
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:59,525
from UCLA who, guess
what, hates the guy.

1545
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,426
- No, no, no, no,
doesn't just hate him,

1546
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:03,829
says she has
career-ending evidence,

1547
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:04,797
those are the words she used.

1548
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,998
- Yep, vice versa.

1549
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,632
- We're gonna go talk
to her right now.

1550
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:07,600
You are gonna get kissed.

1551
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:08,433
Not by me.

1552
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:09,500
- Don't touch me.

1553
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:11,971
- Hi!
- How are you?

1554
00:56:11,973 --> 00:56:13,172
- Can I help you?

1555
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:15,641
- Yes, we are looking
for Carol Weiston.

1556
00:56:15,643 --> 00:56:17,509
- Wishspoon, wishpoon.

1557
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:18,544
- No, Ouistablufin.

1558
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:19,912
- Yes. That's the one.

1559
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:20,913
Hey, Carol's my wife.

1560
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,815
- I wanna get to why we're here.

1561
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:25,885
Now, Carol, you were classmates

1562
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:28,087
with Antonio at
UCLA, is that right?

1563
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:28,988
- Yes.

1564
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,025
We were in the same dorm.

1565
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,726
- And what was your, uh,

1566
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:35,162
what was your
impression of Antonio?

1567
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,097
- Well, he was Mister Popular

1568
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,199
and everybody loved him.

1569
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:41,800
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

1570
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:45,571
- But, to me, he was
just, I don't know,

1571
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:49,742
he was like an
attention seeking phony.

1572
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:50,676
- I hate that type.
- Hate it.

1573
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,678
- Hate 'em all.
- The worst.

1574
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,913
- I didn't really mind it,

1575
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:58,183
but well, see, we
had this professor,

1576
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:01,020
Professor Allen Silverstein,

1577
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,855
but this one night a bunch

1578
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:06,558
of the students were
drinking in the dorms

1579
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,695
and Antonio just went
off on Mr. Silverstein,

1580
00:57:09,697 --> 00:57:11,697
just called him all
sorts of names, you know,

1581
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:12,965
'cause he's Jewish.

1582
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:16,502
And I said,
"Antonio, stop that."

1583
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:20,007
He just kept saying such
hurtful, mean racist things.

1584
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:23,142
Jews are a race, right?

1585
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:24,243
- Yes.

1586
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:25,644
- Technically a
religion, but yes, yes.

1587
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:26,879
It's all good.

1588
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:29,081
- It's just not right, you know.

1589
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,849
- No, it's not.

1590
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,618
It's not, it's okay.
- It's wrong is what it is.

1591
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,053
- You didn't do anything wrong.

1592
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:36,991
Here, this is clean.

1593
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:41,860
- I'm sorry to get
emotional, it's just-

1594
00:57:41,862 --> 00:57:43,062
- No, no, don't you apologize.

1595
00:57:43,064 --> 00:57:46,131
- Fucked up is what it is.

1596
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,534
- This has been in my
pocket, but it's clean.

1597
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:54,206
- Take your time.

1598
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,076
- Hey, hey, hey.

1599
00:57:56,243 --> 00:57:58,644
You are a hero-
- But-

1600
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:00,612
- There's one more
thing I need you to do.

1601
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:02,081
Carol, if there's a way

1602
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:05,217
for you to say exactly
what you said to us,

1603
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:08,122
just right now at our
press conference tomorrow,

1604
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,094
forget about it.

1605
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:16,195
- I bet people are gonna
say really mean things

1606
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:18,864
about me in the press and
on Facebook and stuff.

1607
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,199
- Can I be real with you?

1608
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:21,533
Can I get real
with you right now?

1609
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:23,002
They will.

1610
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:25,738
All I can promise you is
that we will stand next

1611
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,578
to you and behind you
and also in front of you

1612
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:32,113
with everything we got.

1613
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,783
- Okay, I'll do it.

1614
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,752
- My hands are a little
sweaty, I apologize.

1615
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:42,254
- All right, is
everything okay in here.

1616
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:45,791
- It was until
about three seconds ago.

1617
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:46,792
- She saw your face.

1618
00:58:46,794 --> 00:58:47,826
- She got upset.

1619
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,061
- No, no, it wasn't that.

1620
00:58:49,063 --> 00:58:51,730
Here, Carol, do you
need a glass of wine.

1621
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:52,831
- Goldmine, goldmine.

1622
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:53,832
- This is happening.

1623
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,601
- He's fucked.
- Bye-bye.

1624
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:56,602
- He's fucked.

1625
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,070
You can't say anything
about the Jewish people.

1626
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:59,338
- No.
- That is a no go.

1627
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,672
- Nor should you.

1628
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:01,907
I got cat dander on me.
- Yeah, you do.

1629
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:02,843
- Worth it.

1630
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:05,813
Oh, what is?

1631
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:10,783
Hey, I'm sorry, Marco, what
is, are you moving out?

1632
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,885
- This is all your shit.

1633
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:16,188
I'm doing sharing
this space with you.

1634
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,289
- What the fuck?

1635
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,357
Your assistant's
kicking you out.

1636
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:19,291
- No, no, no.

1637
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:20,726
- Assistant.

1638
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:21,860
- Hey, I wanna talk
to you over there.

1639
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:22,694
Come with me.

1640
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:23,729
- Oh, my God, no.

1641
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,032
- I'm not chasing you.

1642
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:28,734
Hey.

1643
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:29,968
- Just gonna work
it out really quick.

1644
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:30,903
- You can't
do this, Marco.

1645
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,237
- I am sick of this.

1646
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,373
I'm sick of the cameras,
I'm sick of that boy.

1647
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,808
I'm sick of all of that.

1648
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,076
- No, no,
no, I don't care.

1649
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:38,977
You literally cannot do
this, this is my condo.

1650
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:42,714
- You cannot
sleep here tonight.

1651
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:46,718
- Oh, here we are, hotel style

1652
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,654
where the presser's
is gonna be tomorrow,

1653
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:50,155
just a few floors downstairs,

1654
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:52,357
but we're here, we're
maxin' and relaxin'.

1655
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:55,060
- Two kings just
resting before battle.

1656
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:58,363
- Thank God I did not cancel
that press conference.

1657
00:59:58,365 --> 01:00:00,666
They wanted me to
cancel it and I said no

1658
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:02,167
and this is why.

1659
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:05,304
You and I, my friend, are
gonna be in high demand.

1660
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:07,206
They're gonna want
us on all the shows.

1661
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,140
- Oh, yeah.

1662
01:00:08,142 --> 01:00:09,777
- This is time to kind of chill.

1663
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:24,423
- Should I wake him?

1664
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:26,925
He sounds like
he's fuckin' dyin'.

1665
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:28,360
What do we do?

1666
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:29,728
- Yeah, I
don't think he's breathing.

1667
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,996
- I should probably wake him.
- Yeah.

1668
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:33,065
- Yo, yo, yo.

1669
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:34,902
- Oh, oh, hey, hey, I'm here.

1670
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:38,272
Did I fall asleep?

1671
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,276
Sorry about that.

1672
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:48,347
Oh, it's all about
the press conference.

1673
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:52,351
Yeah, that's the coupe de gras,

1674
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,354
where it's me in my element.

1675
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:58,323
I'm up there, I am
controlling the room.

1676
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:02,761
I am playing them all
like a little fiddle.

1677
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:06,999
So, here's what
we're looking at.

1678
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:07,866
Breakfast is on the way.
- Break it down.

1679
01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:10,936
- It's 9:11 right now.

1680
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:13,438
Carol's gonna be here at 10.

1681
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,973
Bring her up here, we'll
prep her for a little bit.

1682
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,108
- Yeah.

1683
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,075
- Secure us the late checkout.

1684
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,377
We'll meet in the lobby at 1:45.

1685
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:20,078
Presser starts at 2 o'clock.

1686
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,813
Loud buzz online.
- Oh, yeah.

1687
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:22,447
- I don't know if you've
been seeing what's happening.

1688
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,916
- Oh, I saw, I saw.

1689
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:25,851
They think it's a sex
tape, bunch of perverts.

1690
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,386
- They're gonna be floored

1691
01:01:27,388 --> 01:01:29,924
when they find out
it's about the Jews.

1692
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:33,358
Oh, God, sounds harsh.

1693
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,828
Jewish, Jewish folks,
our Jewish friends.

1694
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,131
When they find out it's
about our Jewish friends.

1695
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:40,832
My friend, Juan,
come on in, buddy.

1696
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,334
- You scared me.

1697
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,102
- Come on in, yeah, we're
making a little documentary.

1698
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,237
You weren't here last
night, they weren't here.

1699
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:49,942
He served us a delicious
hot fudge sundae last night,

1700
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:52,110
wonderful man right
here, wonderful man.

1701
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:54,146
- Hope y'all had a nice night.

1702
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:56,114
- I slept like a log, my friend.

1703
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:58,317
- Yeah, I slept like
shit next to this log,

1704
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,851
'cause he snores.

1705
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:01,119
- I forgot my CPAP machine

1706
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:02,955
and he has not let
me forget about it.

1707
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:04,790
- Right.
- I almost died, by the way.

1708
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:06,091
- I slept like, I look terrible,

1709
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,359
I got bags under my eyes.

1710
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:08,427
- Yeah, well, I couldn't breathe

1711
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:09,363
for an hour and a half.

1712
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,965
- So, what
time is it right now?

1713
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:17,336
- Uh, 10, three-four, so
Carol's a little bit late.

1714
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:18,504
Not a big deal.

1715
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:19,972
Traffic, LA, yeah.

1716
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:22,307
- Yeah, no
biggie whatsoever.

1717
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:24,343
- She's in or out as we say.

1718
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:27,012
- It's the standard,
standard LA time,

1719
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:28,313
everyone runs late.

1720
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:30,384
You're not cool if you
ain't late, you know.

1721
01:02:31,452 --> 01:02:33,187
That's what they say, so.

1722
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:37,322
Maybe we should call her.

1723
01:02:37,324 --> 01:02:39,992
- I'm gonna call her
just because, you know,

1724
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:43,862
maybe, hi, Carol, Rick
Klingman here with Simon.

1725
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:48,166
10:35, just wondering,
you know, where you're at.

1726
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:51,370
Um, we're here and we'll
see you in a few hopefully.

1727
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,173
Thanks, Carol, bye.

1728
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,842
- How did it go?
What did she say?

1729
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:58,477
- Oh, it was a voicemail.

1730
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:00,946
Carol, it's Rick. It's 11:33.

1731
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:03,882
What Antonio said was despicable

1732
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:06,852
and you have an obligation
to tell people what happened

1733
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:07,853
and we're here to help you.

1734
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,288
And I promise you-

1735
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,222
- If
you are satisfied

1736
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:12,190
with your message, press one.

1737
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:13,492
- Son of a gun.
- What'd she say?

1738
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:15,027
- It was a voicemail.

1739
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:18,332
Okay, um, I'm
officially worried.

1740
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,034
- Should we, do we need to
go get her or something, huh?

1741
01:03:22,036 --> 01:03:23,435
- Well, no, she's
90 minutes away,

1742
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:25,203
we won't make it back in time.

1743
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:27,339
- We need to put some new
kind of plan into action.

1744
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,340
- Yeah.

1745
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:29,544
I think the move here-
- Yeah.

1746
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:32,512
- Is wait.

1747
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:36,250
He worked out again.

1748
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,219
- The press
conference is in 30 minutes.

1749
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,090
What's going through
your mind right now?

1750
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:45,290
- What's going through
my mind right now is

1751
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:47,492
that Carol is
nowhere to be seen,

1752
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,995
which means I think she
bailed on this whole thing

1753
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:52,898
and I can't believe that,

1754
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,101
so I'm trying to come up
with an alternative plan.

1755
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:56,968
Right, now here's the deal.

1756
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,270
I want her to sit here.

1757
01:03:58,272 --> 01:03:59,572
Look at me, I want you-

1758
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,173
Coming.

1759
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:03,075
I want you to sit,
like stand right here.

1760
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:04,142
- Stand over, okay.

1761
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,143
- Here we go, all right?
- Like a lamp.

1762
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,480
- I got this.

1763
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:09,915
- Hey, Rick.
- How are you?

1764
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:11,316
- Doing well.
- Good to see you.

1765
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:12,317
- You remember our little crew?

1766
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,052
- Yep, hi, guys.

1767
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:15,454
- From New York.

1768
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:17,155
If you wanna grab a seat
right there, you know-

1769
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,156
- Oh, yes, thank you.

1770
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:19,224
- Simon, of course.

1771
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:20,392
- Ooh, Jessica, yes, hey.

1772
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:21,495
- Hey, Simon.

1773
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,998
- Thank you for coming
here and joining us.

1774
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:28,266
- Can you not stand there?
- Yeah, I don't need to.

1775
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:29,501
- It's insane.

1776
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:30,235
- Yeah, yeah. You can
just go over there.

1777
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:31,136
- Sit over here.

1778
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:32,039
- Yeah, he doesn't need to.

1779
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:34,674
Oh, can I get you
something from the minibar?

1780
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:36,108
You want a little-

1781
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:36,942
- Oh,
I'm good, thanks.

1782
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:37,943
- You sure?

1783
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:39,579
You okay?
- Yeah.

1784
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:40,447
- Okay.

1785
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:42,414
All right.

1786
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,683
- So?
- So-

1787
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:45,117
- What's going on?

1788
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,985
- What's going on?

1789
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:49,589
We're like what's not going on.

1790
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:50,525
Here's what's going on.

1791
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,659
We wanna give you the exclusive.

1792
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:55,961
We talked about it and we think

1793
01:04:55,963 --> 01:05:00,602
that you are kind of
the only person we trust

1794
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:03,101
to tell you this story
to put it out there

1795
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:04,037
to the world.

1796
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,371
- Get posting, get typing.

1797
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:08,708
- Are you serious?
- You're welcome.

1798
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:11,977
- The press conference
is in 10 minutes.

1799
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:13,713
How is that an exclusive?

1800
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:15,548
- I mean, because you would have

1801
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:19,151
the story 10 minutes
before everyone else.

1802
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:21,019
- Well, I don't
think my colleagues

1803
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:23,155
that are waiting for
the press conference

1804
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:26,158
you promised them would
appreciate that very much.

1805
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,260
- This is earth shattering stuff

1806
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,397
and we're giving it
all to you, all to you.

1807
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:33,000
No one else.

1808
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:35,500
What do you say?

1809
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:37,703
- I have always been up
front with you, Rick,

1810
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:38,640
and you, Simon.

1811
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:45,110
I think that you
guys are con artists,

1812
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:48,415
but I write about you because
I find it entertaining

1813
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,419
and frankly I have the duty
to expose your bullshit,

1814
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,588
but if you're gonna
call a presser

1815
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,523
and have a bunch of
reporters come all

1816
01:05:57,525 --> 01:06:00,494
the way over here and
then not talk to them,

1817
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:04,465
then I'm done with you for real.

1818
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,401
And so is everyone else.

1819
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:19,779
Rick, Rick, you don't
have to keep doing

1820
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:21,749
this stuff, you know.

1821
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,219
There are other ways
to make a living.

1822
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:31,624
It's not about the money, okay,

1823
01:06:31,626 --> 01:06:33,595
it's not why I do what I do.

1824
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:38,163
I want people to know the truth

1825
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:42,267
and I just, I feel good
when I'm standing up there

1826
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,102
and I'm telling them this.

1827
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:47,172
It makes me feel good,
it gives me purpose.

1828
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,475
And I just, it gets
harder and harder to do

1829
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:53,813
with people just,
they go after you

1830
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:55,413
and they just make fun of you

1831
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:59,217
and I'm tired of it and
I don't know, I just,

1832
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,720
maybe you're right,

1833
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:01,821
you know-
- Yeah.

1834
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:02,622
- Maybe I need to not-

1835
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:03,723
- Holy shit.

1836
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:05,123
- Go towards the real-

1837
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:06,424
- Carol's here,
she's downstairs.

1838
01:07:06,426 --> 01:07:08,293
- Shut, shut up, shut up.
- Go time.

1839
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:09,564
- Whoo!
- Go time.

1840
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,464
- Fuckin' blew it, Jessica.

1841
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:13,333
- Move, move.

1842
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:15,433
- This way?
- Yep.

1843
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:16,669
- Left or right, left or right?

1844
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:17,572
- Left.
- Yep.

1845
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,139
- Right, right,
right, right, right.

1846
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:22,474
No, no, step only, step
only, come on, come on.

1847
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:25,076
Here we go and no, no, no, no.

1848
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:26,478
- What, what?

1849
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,413
- It's the pool, it's
the pool, the pool.

1850
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:30,348
- Jesus Christ.

1851
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:32,852
- Thank you for coming.

1852
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:34,854
You are four hours late.
- I know.

1853
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,822
- Man.
- I'm sorry.

1854
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:38,323
- We thought you had
some kind of change

1855
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,759
of heart or something and-

1856
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:42,664
- No, I, I wanna tell the truth.

1857
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:45,598
- Angels.

1858
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,832
- You're an angel.

1859
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:47,702
- All right.

1860
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:49,769
- Okay.

1861
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,303
- You been drinking?

1862
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:53,773
- No, just a glass of
wine to calm my nerves.

1863
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:54,707
- Okay, that's fine,
that's good, no, it's fine

1864
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:56,141
to have a glass.

1865
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:57,342
They say one glass
a day's healthy.

1866
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,844
All right, you start
live streaming.

1867
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:00,312
- We're live, baby.

1868
01:08:00,314 --> 01:08:02,249
- Everyone settle,
we're going live.

1869
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:05,150
You go first, you come with me,

1870
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:06,819
you're the caboose.

1871
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:07,655
There we go.

1872
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,626
Hello, everyone, right in here.

1873
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:14,660
You guys can go ahead, Carol,

1874
01:08:14,662 --> 01:08:15,861
we got seats for you

1875
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:17,429
and you can take
the one that's kind

1876
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:19,497
of further towards the window.

1877
01:08:19,499 --> 01:08:21,166
What is, when did
you put up this?

1878
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,300
- It's nice, right?

1879
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:23,536
I put it up this morning.

1880
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:24,537
- Yeah, I think it's great.

1881
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:26,171
I think we should take it down.

1882
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:28,273
- No can do, no can do,
it's free publicity.

1883
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:29,809
- No, but I want you
to hear me right now.

1884
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:31,376
This is the most important
moment of my life.

1885
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:32,645
- Our life.
- Our life.

1886
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:36,214
- And I want this
taken down right now.

1887
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:37,351
- Changes.

1888
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:43,522
Don't tear it, don't tear it.

1889
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:44,391
- Yep, yep, yep.

1890
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:49,764
- I'm just gonna let-

1891
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,836
- You can fold
that up over there.

1892
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:02,273
Good afternoon.

1893
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:04,209
My name is Rick Klingman.

1894
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,713
This, of course,
is Simon Tarnum.

1895
01:09:07,381 --> 01:09:10,916
We are here today to talk
about Antonio Kelly-Zhang,

1896
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:13,284
who is running for
Congress right here

1897
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:15,621
in California's 40th district.

1898
01:09:15,623 --> 01:09:16,889
And I, I wanna be clear.

1899
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:21,727
When Simon and I began
this investigation,

1900
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:24,164
we, uh, we went into
it with an open mind

1901
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:28,770
and we were not prepared

1902
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:31,639
to find out what we did.

1903
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,406
Now, without any further ado,

1904
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:37,342
I'm gonna introduce
Carol Ouistablufen

1905
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:39,312
and she has a story
to tell, Carol.

1906
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:42,581
- Thank you, thank you.

1907
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,254
- Hi.

1908
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:51,289
I'm Carol, um-

1909
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,892
- Speak up, speak up.

1910
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:53,761
- Sorry.

1911
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:58,898
From 2005 to 2008,
I was classmates

1912
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,767
with Antonio Kelly-Zhang.

1913
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:04,804
One night in our dorm,

1914
01:10:04,806 --> 01:10:07,873
there were some
antisemitic references made

1915
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:11,779
in regard to humanities
professor, Allen Silverstein.

1916
01:10:13,614 --> 01:10:16,649
They were hateful
and deeply insulting

1917
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:21,488
to Professor Silverstein,
his religion and his culture.

1918
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:28,930
These antisemitic
comments were made by me.

1919
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:40,474
Yeah, I did them.

1920
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:46,480
I said the words that
were anti the Jews.

1921
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:52,518
I think I'm not a happy person.

1922
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,388
I have a, I have a little
bit of a drinking problem.

1923
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:01,426
I spend 16 hours
a day on Facebook

1924
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:06,266
and just sit around
all day glugging wine

1925
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:07,769
and talking shit.

1926
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:14,339
I think I'm just angry about
how my life turned out.

1927
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:18,980
I want to apologize to all
of you, especially Antonio.

1928
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,987
That felt good, thanks.

1929
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:31,690
Where's my phone, I
should check Facebook.

1930
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:32,658
- You guys are
just gonna leave now?

1931
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,893
Yeah, go ahead.
- We are.

1932
01:11:33,895 --> 01:11:36,461
- Thank you guys.
- Thanks for having us.

1933
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,532
- Thank you so much.

1934
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:44,537
At this point, we would like

1935
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:47,907
to open it up to any
questions you might have.

1936
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:51,043
- Yeah, yeah, what was that?

1937
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:55,681
Because it seems like Mr.
Kelly-Zhang hasn't done

1938
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:57,482
anything bad at all

1939
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,952
and you all are just, in
fact, desperate for attention.

1940
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:00,653
- I mean, look, look, you
know what the thing is,

1941
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:03,022
this is not even the only thing.

1942
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,857
There was, this is,
it's part of a mosaic.

1943
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:06,391
- One of a hundred
we got for you today.

1944
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:07,593
- Yeah, this guy-

1945
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:09,061
- Just scratchin'
the surface, people.

1946
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:11,096
- Yeah, what are the other ones?

1947
01:12:11,098 --> 01:12:15,937
- We have heard that allegedly
he molested a co-worker.

1948
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:18,737
- Okay, who's
accusing him of this?

1949
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:19,738
- His name is Fred Zurtz.

1950
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,607
- Don't say his last name.

1951
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:25,144
- He said that he, he got
his penis snapped back.

1952
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:26,779
- What does that mean?

1953
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:28,413
- By Antonio, he said exactly-

1954
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,582
- Here's, here's-
- Let me clarify.

1955
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:30,749
- Why was he naked at work?

1956
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:31,884
- He wasn't naked.
- He wasn't.

1957
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:32,818
- He wasn't.
- He was not naked.

1958
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,153
- We asked the same thing.

1959
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,788
- He was wearing sweatpants.
- Good question.

1960
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,689
- He worked at Lavashe
Restaurant in Beverly Hills.

1961
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:37,388
- So he had to go
under the waistband.

1962
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,757
- He was wearing sweats at work

1963
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:40,458
and he alleges that Antonio-

1964
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,161
- Pulled the, pulled the
dick and snapped it back.

1965
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:43,796
- There's no way that happened.

1966
01:12:43,798 --> 01:12:45,463
- He pulled the dick and
snapped it back, that's what-

1967
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:46,699
- Is this the same Fred Zurtz,

1968
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:49,434
who was picked up
for masturbating

1969
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:50,603
in Hollywood on Tuesday?

1970
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:53,172
- It is a, it is
a, it was actually-

1971
01:12:53,174 --> 01:12:54,807
- I do not believe so, no.

1972
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:56,508
- That is a different-
- What a waste of our time.

1973
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,110
- It's not a waste of your time.

1974
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,179
- That's number two, we've got
plenty, just wait, buckle up.

1975
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:02,948
- There was a sex tape.

1976
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:03,983
- Oh, my gosh.

1977
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:04,984
- We don't have-

1978
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:06,151
- Show it to us.

1979
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:07,452
- We do not have-

1980
01:13:07,454 --> 01:13:08,187
- You wanna see it?
- We, we-

1981
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:09,121
- Who else wants to see it?

1982
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,823
- We don't have a sex tape.

1983
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,491
- So, now you're accusing
someone of making a sex tape

1984
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:14,593
and saying you have
it in your possession.

1985
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:15,961
- No.
- Show it to us.

1986
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,196
- Okay.

1987
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:18,631
- Whoa, that's a
little loud, okay.

1988
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:19,565
- He's gonna play it,
he's gonna play it.

1989
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:20,833
- That's insane.

1990
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:21,834
- Dude, that's not
even a deep fake,

1991
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:22,668
it's just a fake.

1992
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,036
- It's a deep real.

1993
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:25,104
- You guys are clowns.
- We're clowns.

1994
01:13:25,106 --> 01:13:26,739
- You're a clown,
you're a clown.

1995
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:27,740
- You're a fucking clown.
- You're a clown, don't swear.

1996
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:28,574
- You're a fucking clown.

1997
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:30,042
- You're a clown.

1998
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:30,743
- Those glasses, you look
like a fuckin' clown.

1999
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:31,442
What's everybody laughing at.

2000
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:32,344
No, you're all fuckin' clowns.

2001
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:34,213
Because we're doing
your job up here.

2002
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:35,648
You think this is fun for us?

2003
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,049
You think we like
doing this? No.

2004
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:38,751
- What you're doing is wrong.

2005
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:39,718
- But you know what what
you do is wrong, Jessica.

2006
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,886
Every time I fucking see you-

2007
01:13:40,888 --> 01:13:41,887
- Get out of my face.

2008
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:44,523
- Jesus, come on, Jess.
- Oh!

2009
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:45,557
- Are you okay?

2010
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,959
Are you okay?

2011
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:47,960
Are you okay?

2012
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,729
- Yes, I'm okay.
- It doesn't matter.

2013
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:51,897
- You.
- Come on, guys.

2014
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,668
- Didn't even hurt.

2015
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,568
And I have to go to the
bathroom, and that's,

2016
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,670
and it didn't hurt.

2017
01:13:57,672 --> 01:13:59,772
- Simon, Simon, wait.

2018
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,840
This press conference
is over, Simon.

2019
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:04,475
Simon, Simon, wait.
- No!

2020
01:14:04,477 --> 01:14:05,544
- Simon.

2021
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,680
Simon, We're fine.

2022
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:08,681
Simon, listen to me.

2023
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:10,182
- You know what,

2024
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,050
we're fuckin' losers.
- No, don't say that.

2025
01:14:11,052 --> 01:14:13,054
- No, no, no, no, oh, God.

2026
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:26,600
- I'm sorry,
I need my mom.

2027
01:14:29,003 --> 01:14:30,202
- Simon.

2028
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:31,203
Simon.

2029
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:32,073
Agh!

2030
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,044
Enough of the fuckin' movie.

2031
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:43,882
I know you, I know you.

2032
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:47,186
Yeah, Antonio
Kelly-Zhang won by a lot.

2033
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:49,922
Did I enjoy watching
him do a little skit

2034
01:14:49,924 --> 01:14:51,924
at the Oscars with
Jeremy Rinner,

2035
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,026
my favorite Avenger, no.

2036
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:56,061
I've been doing
so much reflection

2037
01:14:56,063 --> 01:14:59,832
and, and working
on myself so much

2038
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:01,800
and trying to figure out
how I can still deliver

2039
01:15:01,802 --> 01:15:04,803
the truth to people and
luckily I figured out

2040
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:06,140
the perfect way.

2041
01:15:07,942 --> 01:15:09,243
Podcast, I started
my own podcast.

2042
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:14,613
- Welcome back to
"Maximum Truth Cast,"

2043
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:16,048
the only podcast
where we discuss

2044
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,817
what's actually going
on in our country.

2045
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:21,754
We are streaming audio,
we are streaming video

2046
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:24,656
and I'm going to beg
you to please subscribe

2047
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:26,325
to my channel.

2048
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:30,295
Okay, every time I put out
one of these videos, ah, shit.

2049
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:31,663
- What happened?

2050
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:34,600
- Damn power cord
finally gave out on me.

2051
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:37,336
Does anyone feel like
going to Radio Shack?

2052
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:40,239
Marco and I are actually not
working together anymore,

2053
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:43,709
which is, uh, yeah,
sad to be honest.

2054
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:46,879
He was a really great employee.

2055
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:49,715
I mean, I still see him nonstop.

2056
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:52,351
Literally refused to
move out, he squatted.

2057
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:54,620
And financially we both realized

2058
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:56,955
it made more sense to
stay roommates, you know.

2059
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:58,959
And I gotta say,
Andre's a nice guy.

2060
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:02,094
Have Simon and I been talking?

2061
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:05,964
We have spoken, we have
texted, we've emailed, DMs,

2062
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:10,002
but we have not seen each
other since the hotel,

2063
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:13,074
since, uh, the incident.

2064
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,845
When I, when I got
pushed on the stairs.

2065
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:22,583
We are in Ontario Valley
minimum security prison.

2066
01:16:24,218 --> 01:16:27,152
I've spent a lot of times
in prisons, unfortunately.

2067
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:29,755
'Cause of clients
and some friends

2068
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:32,658
and, uh, one family member.

2069
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,126
- So, basically what
happened was these guys

2070
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:35,327
that I partnered up
with on Shredded,

2071
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,863
put something in
one of the batches,

2072
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:39,331
some kind of additive,

2073
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,834
I think it was consistent
with methamphetamine,

2074
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:43,202
I don't really know, but, uh,

2075
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,736
yeah, a bunch of people got sick

2076
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:46,905
and guess who got charged?

2077
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:49,376
This guy. Seven months.

2078
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,911
- There he is, my man.
- Hey.

2079
01:16:52,913 --> 01:16:54,847
- Come on, give me a hug.

2080
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:56,081
- I'm not allowed to go
past the yellow line,

2081
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,316
you gotta come here.

2082
01:16:57,318 --> 01:16:58,984
- Oh, oh, yeah,
okay, no problem.

2083
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:00,752
Come on.

2084
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:01,920
- What's going on, Rick.

2085
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:02,988
- No touching.

2086
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:03,822
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

2087
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:05,057
- Sorry about that.

2088
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:06,258
- Sit down.

2089
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,861
- Welcome.
- Huh?

2090
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:10,429
- You look incredible.
- I know.

2091
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:12,297
- Maybe I should go to prison.

2092
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:14,066
- Hey, prison looks
good on some people.

2093
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:15,367
- It does.

2094
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:17,002
- You bring what I asked for?

2095
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:18,036
- I did.

2096
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:19,271
So, here's the deal.
- Yeah.

2097
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:20,439
- It's in my left
sock and I think

2098
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:22,207
you should start
sneezing or something

2099
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:24,943
and then I can, when that
guard walks past us again

2100
01:17:24,945 --> 01:17:26,145
I'm gonna just do
a little hand off.

2101
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:27,079
- Oh, there's literally
no need to do that.

2102
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:29,281
It's a minimum security,
a detention center,

2103
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:31,016
you can just pass it to me.

2104
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:32,151
- Oh-

2105
01:17:32,153 --> 01:17:32,951
- You're allowed to
get stuff, right.

2106
01:17:32,953 --> 01:17:34,753
- Here we go.

2107
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:35,888
This was unnecessary.

2108
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,789
- Yeah, you wear your big socks.

2109
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,458
- Big socks to bring
you chicken breasts

2110
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,226
as requested right there.

2111
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:43,795
- Those are, uh, those are
raw, those are pretty raw.

2112
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:44,830
- Yeah.

2113
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:46,231
- You didn't cook them?

2114
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:47,466
- Did you want me to?

2115
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:48,901
- Yeah, I can't
cook them in here.

2116
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:51,803
What do you think I have
like a fuckin' stove?

2117
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:52,437
- Oh, my God.
- Olive oil.

2118
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,072
- I am so sorry.

2119
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:56,074
Okay, here's the deal. I'm
gonna put them back in my sock.

2120
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:57,075
- No, no, no.
- I'll bring them back.

2121
01:17:57,077 --> 01:17:58,777
- Honestly, it's not worth it

2122
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,779
and I'm kind of desperate. I'll,
I can put it in the toilet,

2123
01:18:00,781 --> 01:18:02,147
it might be cold
enough, they might keep.

2124
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:04,483
Fine, I'll figure
it out, you know.

2125
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:06,118
I actually wanna talk
to you about something

2126
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,754
that I didn't really
wanna say over the phone,

2127
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:11,089
but-
- I'm listening.

2128
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,125
- Yeah, yeah, it's just
kind of too important.

2129
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,294
- Yeah, go for it.

2130
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:16,997
- So, I been doing
some thinking.

2131
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:20,299
I met this guy in
here named Uri.

2132
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:24,169
Used to be special
forces in Belarus, okay?

2133
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,004
- Oh, Belarus.

2134
01:18:26,006 --> 01:18:28,207
- His brother-in-law,
this guy named Ivan

2135
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:30,177
runs a bunch of tire
centers in the valley.

2136
01:18:31,145 --> 01:18:32,311
So, we're talking deep pockets.

2137
01:18:32,313 --> 01:18:34,213
- Oh, yeah, he's got tire money.

2138
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:35,948
- Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking
he makes the perfect bank

2139
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:36,815
when we set up our new shop.

2140
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:39,351
- Oh, yeah.

2141
01:18:39,353 --> 01:18:40,986
- You know what I'm saying?

2142
01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:43,424
Dude, the day I get outta here,

2143
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:46,258
we start our new outfit,

2144
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,126
full scale
intelligence operation.

2145
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:50,530
I'm talking like, like
a whole nother level.

2146
01:18:50,532 --> 01:18:52,164
These fucks are never gonna
know what hit 'em, huh?

2147
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,432
- Yes.

2148
01:18:53,434 --> 01:18:55,434
- We're gonna take
those dudes down.

2149
01:18:55,436 --> 01:18:56,902
Those fucks who
fuckin' embarrassed us.

2150
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,136
- No, no, no, no, hey, listen.

2151
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:00,372
This sounds amazing.
- Revenge mission.

2152
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:02,508
- You're doing a lot
of planning, huh?

2153
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,543
- Yeah, dude.

2154
01:19:03,545 --> 01:19:06,812
- Well, I'm, I'm down.
- Yeah?

2155
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:08,013
- Of course, man.

2156
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:09,381
We get to get the
team back together,

2157
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:10,816
get the band back together.

2158
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,050
- Get that band,
yeah, rock and roll.

2159
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:13,318
- Not the team, the
band back together.

2160
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,319
- All right, well,
listen, I got, uh,

2161
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:15,887
I got pottery in about
five minutes, but, um-

2162
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:16,955
- Oh, wow, pottery.

2163
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,156
Sounds good.

2164
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:19,024
- It was good to
see you, though.

2165
01:19:19,026 --> 01:19:22,396
Come on, come on,
give me a goodbye.

2166
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,298
- Whoo!
- Why not.

2167
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,466
- No touching.

2168
01:19:27,468 --> 01:19:28,400
- Sorry.
- All right.

2169
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:29,537
- That was our first good one.

2170
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:32,838
- Be good.

2171
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,405
- I miss you, don't
forget your chicken.

2172
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:34,574
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2173
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:35,841
- Are you sure you
don't want me to cook it

2174
01:19:35,843 --> 01:19:36,475
and bring it back?

2175
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:37,309
- No, this is better.

2176
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:38,143
This'll be better.

2177
01:19:38,145 --> 01:19:39,845
- Okay.
- Yeah.

2178
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:41,113
- If one thing, I think raw,
it might be more protein.

2179
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:42,848
I think cooking it
burns off the protein.

2180
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,182
Let's try it.

2181
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:45,219
- Cook that chicken.

2182
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:53,060
- How
was it seeing Simon?

2183
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:54,928
- It was fine.

2184
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:58,930
I just don't think
Simon's learned anything.

2185
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:03,037
You know, I ,
I hope he's okay.

2186
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:06,104
It's a tough world out there

2187
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:07,274
and he's just a kid.

2188
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:10,377
I wish him the best.

2189
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:14,246
- So, you're not
gonna work with him again?

2190
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:17,049
- Oh, no, for sure I am, yeah.

2191
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:18,317
No, I mean, you gotta
stay in the game.

2192
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:19,987
You know, when you
stay in the game,

2193
01:20:21,221 --> 01:20:21,853
I'm working with great people

2194
01:20:21,855 --> 01:20:24,389
and you just keep talking

2195
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:26,260
and if you talk long enough,

2196
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,429
your message will get out.

2197
01:20:30,397 --> 01:20:31,365
- What
is your message?

2198
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:34,935
- Whatever I'm
paid to say it is.

2199
01:20:36,538 --> 01:20:37,938
And I'll say it with pride.

2200
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:43,609
Oh, uh-oh.

2201
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:46,411
I got a little pickup.

2202
01:20:46,413 --> 01:20:48,080
- How you you
been driving for Uber?

2203
01:20:48,082 --> 01:20:50,550
- Uh, three months.

2204
01:20:50,552 --> 01:20:51,450
I love it.

2205
01:20:51,452 --> 01:20:52,652
Love it, great company.

2206
01:20:52,654 --> 01:20:54,421
Only company I
will ever work for.

2207
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,925
Where the hell am I?
