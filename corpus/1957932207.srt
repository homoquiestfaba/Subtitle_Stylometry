0
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:28,022
Hey.

1
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,238
Hey.

2
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,317
Palace, hi.

3
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:55,402
Hey Anselm.

4
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:01,357
Rose. Y'all ain't gotta be
in the doorway like that.

5
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,526
Come sit down.

6
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:06,835
Mmm, orange wine.

7
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,486
Mm, it's good.

8
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:13,914
It's not that good.

9
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:14,997
Want some food?

10
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:15,897
No, I'm good.

11
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,052
Hi Palace.

12
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,732
Hey. Hey Hans.

13
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,317
- What's up, M?
- Hey.

14
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,255
How you feeling?

15
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,090
I'm nervous.

16
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,257
There's no reason to be nervous.

17
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:28,592
This is for you.

18
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,452
This is typically uneventful,
you know, unless.

19
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:34,053
Ha.

20
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,982
You have nothing to worry about.

21
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,960
Let's get started.

22
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,014
It's been interesting having you

23
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,814
in the sculpture department.

24
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:45,734
Your ticket really came up, didn't it?

25
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:50,020
So Palace, we're here to
obviously talk about you,

26
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,338
your work, accomplishments and struggles.

27
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,849
I think also how we've seen you change

28
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,776
over the last three summers
and also in your project.

29
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,915
'Kay, cool.

30
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,952
Yeah? Okay, great.

31
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,993
Well I'm gonna give a little introduction.

32
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:06,617
I actually wrote
something about your work,

33
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:09,036
so I'm gonna read this first.

34
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,791
"In Palace's work, the
impossible trajectory of hope

35
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,157
becomes the ground where irony
and advice dance together

36
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,239
in frightening hallways alive
with languor and vitality.

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,555
Screenland is the underground and overlay

38
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,851
for consciousness in Palace's work

39
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,309
with consciousness understood

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,424
as being made of multiple entry

41
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,773
and exit points filled with
voices and their shapes,

42
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:42,492
exerting and relieving
pressure on that question

43
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:47,356
of how to live in all kinds
of amazing and fucked up ways.

44
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:51,572
Palace's materials are
whatever she needs them to be,

45
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,548
ultimately being themselves

46
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,340
and part of the whole at
the same time and fluidly."

47
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,592
So.

48
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:01,594
Thank you.

49
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,603
There's a pedagogical
impulse in your work, Palace,

50
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,619
that's blocked by your compulsion.

51
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,929
Sometimes it manifests as
attraction, sometimes aversion.

52
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,360
You're afraid of your own appetite.

53
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:12,945
I see it, you know?

54
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,188
It's all a bit polite, isn't it?

55
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,476
That's actually a question.

56
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,478
Oh, um.

57
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:27,223
I don't know.

58
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,152
You're always trying to
prove you've done the homework.

59
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:31,763
You know, fuck the homework.

60
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:34,855
I love the way Fred Moten
talks about impropriety.

61
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,258
There's a richness, you know?

62
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,278
And a kind of creativity in your longing.

63
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,697
You know, you have to own it.

64
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,777
It's fucking amazing what you've done

65
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:48,938
the past three years.

66
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,332
You work hard.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,300
You work harder than anyone I've ever met

68
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,775
and you make it look fun.

69
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,340
Mmh. Thank you, Hans.

70
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:59,748
Well don't misunderstand me, Palace.

71
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:03,016
I think it has to be about
the recovery of your appetite,

72
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:06,557
you know? And the need
not to know yourself.

73
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,154
"The need not to know yourself."

74
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,412
Yeah, like Glissant.

75
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:12,808
You know, "The need not to know yourself."

76
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:13,810
Uh, okay.

77
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,840
You know, I think everyone here

78
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,496
goes a little too easy on you.

79
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,690
Mm-mmm, that's not what's happening.

80
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,191
No.

81
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:26,610
From my vantage point, there
are a lot of female artists

82
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,687
your age, your generation, your race

83
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,376
that are making a lot
of sculpture like this.

84
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:35,361
Hunter/gather sculpture here,

85
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:37,291
found materials there,

86
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,051
appropriated photography.

87
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:43,763
How are you going to
differentiate yourself?

88
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:45,261
I don't know yet.

89
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,741
I'm thinking of your long-term career

90
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,800
and where are you gonna go with this?

91
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,635
Wherever I wanna go.

92
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,880
Let's talk about the thesis, yeah?

93
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:56,882
'Kay.

94
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:59,092
"The Testimony of a Dead
Daughter", what is that?

95
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,846
I'd actually never heard of the author.

96
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:01,848
Oh.

97
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,036
That's Colette Thomas.

98
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:08,121
She was a actress for Artaud, Artood.

99
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,315
- Artaud.
- Artaud, yeah.

100
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,765
Artaud, yeah.

101
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:12,735
She was a actress.

102
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:15,245
She would like recite his poems and stuff

103
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:18,434
and then they had like a crazy falling out

104
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:21,019
and she wrote like a manifesto.

105
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,017
Yeah, I'ma just read
you a part real quick.

106
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,102
Lemme get up.

107
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,809
Gimme like one second.

108
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,768
Think I wanna read that to y'all.

109
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,020
Oh, this is it.

110
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,666
"Science in the sky are emptying.

111
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,662
Theater is conceived.

112
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:43,664
Drama is the representation of
the world at its stop point."

113
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:46,811
Yeah.

114
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:48,570
Yeah, yeah. No, that's it.

115
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:50,550
I mean we artists you know,

116
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,224
we're all just part of one conversation.

117
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:55,816
Big one. You know, what is reality

118
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:59,354
and how do we contribute to it, right?

119
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,773
What's truth or what's a lie?

120
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,623
Better than that, what's truth

121
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,653
and what's memory and the archive

122
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,131
and what's the difference
between them, right?

123
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:13,153
Like I think what
matters and what's unique

124
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:17,238
is your contribution to
how to render that truth.

125
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,654
Well there's something very frightening

126
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,492
about one's own appetite.

127
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:29,396
You know, this is what Glissant offers:

128
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,893
a way to witness the unseeable.

129
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:33,314
You know, ultimately you know,

130
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,934
you can change the future and the past.

131
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,497
So what is your project?

132
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,082
I don't know yet.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,065
Infinite possibilities.

134
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,499
That's why I'm here, right?

135
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,844
- But where do you wanna go?
- To figure it out.

136
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,594
You know, you can do whatever
you want whenever you want.

137
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:50,552
Like you know, there's
no one to stop you now.

138
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,122
But it seems like you want me to know

139
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,442
that's not what Glissant says.

140
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:59,727
He says to accept the unknown
in others and in myself.

141
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,262
I just wanna take a
second to acknowledge

142
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:05,989
how much Palace has accomplished
over the last three years.

143
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,589
Okay.

144
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,793
What if there were actually
no people in the work?

145
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:12,795
You mean.

146
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,372
You mean Black people.

147
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:16,901
No, no. I don't mean that.

148
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,820
I mean it's all just so figurative.

149
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,403
It's just a family, right?

150
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,544
Like this is a family.

151
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,844
It's your family.

152
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,179
It's just about your family.

153
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:31,379
Okay.

154
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,012
I'm a dead daughter
because I lost my mother.

155
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,684
Haven't you read Saidiya Hartman?

156
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,623
Of course I'm responding
to the African desperate.

157
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,958
Staking my claim to opacity.

158
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,241
Where'd you grow up?

159
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,420
West Side, Chicago?

160
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,089
Rose, you just being
racist at this point.

161
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,085
No, people like that.

162
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,478
Okay.

163
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:05,434
Let's talk about the work and
y'all stop making me the work.

164
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,353
'Cause this is work.

165
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,396
Hey, does everybody
have enough fucking wine?

166
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:13,231
This is getting heavy.

167
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,383
You bought this hair?

168
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,575
Rose, you know I bought that hair.

169
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,577
I didn't make it myself.

170
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:24,279
But you found this.

171
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,114
I found it.

172
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,009
Yeah, I did find it.

173
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,773
Palace.

174
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,035
Well congrats, Palace.

175
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,525
You're a master of fine arts.

176
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,551
That's it?

177
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,422
That's it.

178
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,423
You're free.

179
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,043
Cheers.

180
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,926
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

181
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:40,928
Cheers.

182
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,158
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

183
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,382
Good luck with everything, Palace.

184
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:49,567
Really great to work with you.

185
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:53,015
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other around.

186
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,017
Take care.

187
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,146
Congratulations, Palace.

188
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,148
Great job.

189
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:01,461
One more time.

190
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,799
- One more time.
- You made it.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,551
Now it's all over.

192
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:05,900
Rose is like-

193
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:06,734
Yes.

194
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:07,708
- No, I know.
- You saw.

195
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,829
- You saw that.
- Yeah, I saw that.

196
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,408
Okay.

197
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,457
Just making sure I'm not crazy.

198
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,292
No, no.

199
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,273
- All right.
- It's a thing.

200
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,128
Okay then.

201
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,552
Well I'll see you later?

202
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,387
I'll see you later.

203
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay.

204
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,369
Palace. Palace.

205
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,110
Hey, what's up?

206
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,324
Did you have your review?

207
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,465
Yeah, it just ended.

208
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,634
How'd it go?

209
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,346
They passed me.

210
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,655
Fern, what do you want?

211
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,081
Well where are you going?

212
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,274
I was gonna find something
nice to do for myself.

213
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:01,444
Right now?

214
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:02,643
Yeah.

215
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,478
I guess you need it.

216
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:06,992
What do you want?

217
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,089
I mean can I come with?

218
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,882
No, I wanna be alone.

219
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,247
I guess I understand.

220
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,137
Oh wait, Palace.

221
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:16,637
I forget, are you allergic
to tree nuts or peanuts?

222
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:17,576
Girl, what?

223
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:18,823
Well you're going to the party later.

224
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,168
Let's hang.

225
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,972
I'm not going to the party.

226
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:22,807
Why?

227
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,780
I thought like when are you leaving?

228
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,365
Fern, I'll talk to you later.

229
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,230
Hey. Thank god it's you.

230
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,410
Are you crying?

231
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,412
No. No.

232
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,404
I'm just done.

233
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,366
Aw.

234
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,615
I'm done.

235
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,152
Let's go to the lake.

236
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,660
Hannah, I gotta pack.

237
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,495
Ah, the lake first.

238
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:50,546
It's more important. We need it.

239
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:53,123
Okay. After the
lake it's a wrap for me.

240
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:10,970
But jealousy is a disease

241
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:15,872
and I hope that bitch gets well
soon 'cause that was crazy.

242
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:16,874
I said

243
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,760
not a goddamn thing.

244
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,590
Oh, the kombucha store.

245
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,990
You know, I saw this yesterday.

246
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,228
I wanted to go there.

247
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,471
Hannah, you said you
was gonna go with me

248
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,578
to the kombucha store

249
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,619
and now all of a sudden you
about to go by yourself?

250
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,171
Okay, I see where your loyalty lies.

251
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,391
Is it really his house?

252
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,407
Girl, you know Liam
got quiet people money.

253
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:38,242
I don't know.

254
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,449
That might just be his straight-up house

255
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,117
'cause Liam buying like property and shit.

256
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:43,954
You brought food?

257
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,152
Yeah, in Mason jars.

258
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,367
Oh period.

259
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,289
We love a Mason jar queen.

260
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:03,518
Yes, but with
the peaches it's good.

261
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,196
How's your mom doing?

262
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,386
Not good. I gotta go home.

263
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,029
It's hard being eldest daughter.

264
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,719
My brother is in Missouri.

265
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,048
He could easily go up there. But nope.

266
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,488
That's your job.

267
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,309
Yeah, that shit on
the phone the other day

268
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,598
like pissed me off

269
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,805
talking 'bout we need to talk about mom.

270
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,407
Like shut your ass up, Jordan.

271
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,659
Doesn't he know we're dead daughters?

272
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,980
Says something about that.

273
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,885
"Let the mothers speak
about their suffering

274
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:56,585
to those who are whores and aborted

275
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,853
and completely sterilized.

276
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,872
Let the holy virgin veil
her face and withdraw

277
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:04,645
she who hasn't been
prostituted then glorified

278
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:08,053
but respected then made
pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

279
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:11,372
For the women of our era
not elected but condemned."

280
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:15,124
Whore.

281
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,054
I'm tired though 'cause
she's not getting any better.

282
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,854
What is lupus exactly?

283
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,505
It's like your body doesn't
know what's good for it

284
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,475
or what's bad for it

285
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:31,366
so it can mistake a good
thing for a bad thing

286
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,286
and the body attacks itself.

287
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:37,260
It can make your hair fall
out, your skin color change.

288
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:38,294
Aw.

289
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,575
It can give you arthritis.

290
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:42,335
My mom can't really walk that well.

291
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,447
I'm sure it's so hard
being away from her.

292
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,616
That's life.

293
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,144
I can deal with life.

294
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:51,896
I'm used to chaotic-ass
stressful situations,

295
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,772
but out here you just
like can't deal with it.

296
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,866
It's like everyone's in
your fucking business.

297
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,035
It's 20 fucking questions.

298
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,661
It's very "Cruel Intentions".

299
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,456
The drama.

300
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,458
Oh.

301
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,080
Said this earlier.

302
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,938
"Drama is the representation of the world

303
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,523
at its stop point."

304
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,497
I mean people out here
really want me to get mad

305
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,813
and it's like I don't wanna fight you.

306
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:26,180
Some things are worth fighting for.

307
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,648
I'll beat that ass.

308
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,955
But I think there's some things in life

309
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,096
that are bigger than art.

310
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:35,136
It's like out here people
are like, "This is it.

311
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,547
This is your life."

312
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,976
And I'm like, "This isn't it.

313
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,561
This isn't my life.

314
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,116
And if you think it's my life,

315
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:45,200
I really don't know what to tell you."

316
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:48,168
I think the art itself is important too.

317
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,032
It comes to represent those
relationships and connections

318
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,408
to each other but also to life.

319
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,547
I'm a believer in art, a true believer.

320
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,318
You're supposed to be here.

321
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,467
I'm glad I know you.

322
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:01,636
Aww, Hannah.

323
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,429
But I'm not gonna play you, Hannah.

324
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,799
I fucking hate it here.

325
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,801
It sucks.

326
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:10,314
I'm gonna get in.

327
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:11,720
Do you wanna come?

328
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,184
No, the way you go in is scary.

329
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,822
I just like to float.

330
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,115
There could be like a
alligator up in there.

331
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,938
There are no alligators here.

332
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,804
You don't know that.

333
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,333
I actually do.

334
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,135
You seen Lake Placid?

335
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:27,313
There's like a mythical creature in there.

336
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,401
- Loch Ness.
- Yeah.

337
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,886
And it's gonna like snatch me up.

338
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,103
I'll get in in a minute.

339
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,056
What time are you going
to the party tonight?

340
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,179
Nope.

341
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,635
Mm-mmm.

342
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,105
I'm not going to the party.

343
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,816
I'm on the train first
thing tomorrow morning

344
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:10,614
back to the city.

345
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,147
So soon?

346
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,399
Hannah, I gotta get home.

347
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,563
Yeah, but we could go for like an hour.

348
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,138
We have to celebrate being art masters.

349
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,218
Shit, art dommes.

350
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,660
Where are our subs?

351
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,569
Need some help.

352
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,676
Maybe it'll fall from the sky.

353
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,428
Yeah, I'ma be like,

354
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,419
"Clean this house.

355
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,958
Wash these clothes."

356
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:42,400
Aren't you DJing tonight?

357
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,152
I'm supposed to be.

358
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Oh shit.

359
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,158
Hey boo.

360
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,270
Hey angel.

361
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,361
How did it go?

362
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:06,280
Wait, lemme put my headphones in.

363
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,027
Fuck it. You on speaker.

364
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:11,908
How did it go?

365
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:12,965
Eh.

366
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,235
- You?
- Rose said something like,

367
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,965
"You're asking me to care
about your feelings."

368
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,509
She asked me why I
have people in my work.

369
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,669
She's very French.

370
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,464
Ain't she from San Diego?

371
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,503
You know what I mean.

372
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,343
"What do you think of Bataille?

373
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,996
Have you not read him?"

374
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:34,588
I need some sugar run.

375
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:35,682
I gotta pack.

376
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,589
Please, please, please!

377
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,424
I need you!

378
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:40,621
Girl, calm down.

379
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:41,988
I need you!

380
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,558
Okay?

381
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,679
Seriously, come.

382
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,006
We can get ready for the party together.

383
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,886
I'm not going to the party.

384
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,053
What?

385
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:54,119
We can talk about this on the way there.

386
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,788
Don't take too long.

387
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,139
Hey Palace.

388
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,387
Hey, what's up?

389
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:01,381
Not too much.

390
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:02,703
What you reading?

391
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,398
Fred Moten "Undercommons".

392
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,389
You read this?

393
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,873
Yeah, I read it like last year.

394
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,175
I read it last year.

395
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:10,256
You liking it so far?

396
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:12,752
Yeah, it's good. It's good.

397
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,707
Oh, all right.

398
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,025
What you up to?

399
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,277
I'm about to go see
what crazy Aidan up to.

400
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,120
- Okay.
- That's what I'm up to.

401
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,109
I'll talk to you later.

402
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,276
Talk to you.

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Aidan!

404
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:30,936
Aidan.

405
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,075
Bonjour, coeur couer.

406
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,002
Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour.

407
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,804
- Bonjour.
- What's this?

408
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,054
What's what?

409
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,211
You putting that in the car

410
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,128
or you putting it in the trunk?

411
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,773
I'm putting it in the back seat.

412
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:44,608
All right.

413
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:45,838
Yay.

414
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,840
Yes.

415
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,062
It's time.

416
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,647
All right, let's go.

417
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:59,229
So why aren't you going to this party?

418
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,256
Don't roll your eyes at me.

419
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:02,446
Wait, watch me again.

420
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,697
I spent all summer with these fools.

421
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:06,818
I'm done. Not another night.

422
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,703

423
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,453

426
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,684
I know you don't wanna miss

427
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,919
the most maj, maj bash of the summer.

428
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,579
No 'cause that's what you
said about wedding

429
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,027
which I found beaucoup underwhelming.

430
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,742
I said what I said. Purr.

431
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,637

Anyway, don't blame the lesbians

435
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,506
for the faulty upstate supply chain.

436
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:47,093
Attempting a
raw bar for over 300 people

437
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:50,136
when you clearly don't have
two pennies to rub together,

438
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,358
like what? Why though?

439
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,097
Our inheritance is utopia.

440
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:56,364
I'm done going to events

441
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:59,783
that don't cater to my basic human needs.

442
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,278
It was kinda maj though.

443
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,280
The drama.

444
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:08,651
Just come tonight.

445
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:11,959
What if somebody unexpected
comes out of the woodwork?

446
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,120
Girl, he had all summer.

447
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,122
Nothing.

448
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:20,094
Why can't he just be cute though?

449
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,596
It can be, mama.

450
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:24,810
Why are you giving me these?

451
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,260
Because I'm gonna party tonight.

452
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,938
Yeah, I'm gonna suck one dick.

453
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,703
I'm gonna tweak four nipples

454
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:35,327
and snort multiple lines of
pharmaceutical-grade ecstasy.

455
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,486
Uh-uh.

456
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,905
Aidan, you nasty.

457
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,466
I love you, boo.

458
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:41,515
I'll see you later.

459
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:44,767
Love you too. See you later.

460
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,932
- Punishment?
- Yeah.

461
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,783
Yeah, so they like drop like this person

462
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,950
in the middle of I don't
know like the Arctic.

463
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,692
Which person? Is
what I still don't know.

464
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,347
Like an outdoors person.

465
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:01,512
Who is it?

466
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:04,804
Palace.

467
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,765
Yo.

468
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:06,645
Congrats.

469
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:08,603
Can we come in?

470
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,594
Yeah, c'mon.

471
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:11,596
Oh my god.

472
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,637
What's good?

473
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,589
Hi HotJake.

474
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,818
Hi Akin.

475
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,711
So you coming to this party later?

476
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:21,796
Mm-mmm. No.

477
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:25,033
Can I hit that?

478
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:26,606
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

479
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:27,441
Here.

480
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,287
I heard the first years
went all out on decorations.

481
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:32,169
Oh, word. That's what you heard?

482
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,473
- Word.
- That's what you heard.

483
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:36,092
Actually got some small
batch mezcal in here.

484
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:37,599
- Lemme see.
- If you're down.

485
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,434
Yeah, I'm down.

486
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:39,617
- Yeah?
- Yeah, fuck it.

487
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:40,816
That's have some.

488
00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:41,650
Ooh.

489
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,512
Let's see.

490
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:43,638
- Okay.
- HotJake.

491
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,140
Sick titties hat.

492
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,051
Okay, HotJake.

493
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,520
It's a nice color.

494
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,048
All right well, to us.

495
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,383
To us.

496
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,759
Cheers.

497
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:03,481
Ooh.

498
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:05,885
Hot.

499
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:07,941
I would maybe be a zebra.

500
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,664
I'd definitely be a koala

501
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:10,653
'cause apparently they're like

502
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,342
the dumbest animals in the kingdom.

503
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:14,236
Oh my god, this conversation is dumb.

504
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:16,910
But is it like a
nickname you gave yourself?

505
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,034
I gave HotJake that nickname.

506
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,674
No, Jake. Stop lying.

507
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,986
You're HotJake because I
gave you that nickname.

508
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:24,574
When did you
give him that nickname?

509
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,035
Like a few summers ago.

510
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:28,036
Huh.

511
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah. Cool.

512
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:14,381
I like how you're thinking of
the framing of commodity here.

513
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:18,792
Kinda reminds me of "Mushroom
at the End of the World".

514
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:23,369
I was thinking about the
hierarchies of sentience.

515
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,999
Your window displays, they
do the same thing I think.

516
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,967
But I mean my work is
more about hyperobjects

517
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,837
than the dominance of capitalism.

518
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:36,917
But you could count
industrialism as a hyperobject

519
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:41,381
if you think of it as the
dawn of the anthropocene.

520
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:44,966
Have you heard of Sylvia Wynter?

521
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:46,979
No.

522
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,896
S-Y-L-V-I-A

523
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:52,534
space.

524
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:56,646
W-Y-N-T-E-R.

525
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,192
Check her out.

526
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,862
Is she a Black woman?

527
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:02,864
Yeah. Why?

528
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,608
Oh, speaking of mushrooms.

529
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:14,312
Anyone want some?

530
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,089
- Yes.
- Yes.

531
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,985
Bit for you.

532
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:19,885
- Thank you.
- Want some?

533
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,359
Wait, how you do it?

534
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,028
You just put a little bit here.

535
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,356
Bit much.

536
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:35,082
What're you gonna wear tonight, Palace?

537
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,410
I'm not going to the party.

538
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,426
Oh whoa, wait.

539
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,471
I have the most amazing dress.

540
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:42,804
Wanna borrow it?

541
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,451
I'll borrow a dress from HotJake.

542
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,275
Yeah. C'mon, you're gonna borrow it.

543
00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:47,574
Got a dress.

544
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:49,555
He's got one for you.

545
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,986
I'm gonna put some music on, huh?

546
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:55,187
If you don't go to the
party, what are you gonna do?

547
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:57,498
Oh, I'm gonna go to Liam's.

548
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,677
Quiet, little quiet night or whatever.

549
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:03,309
You know, tuck up, drink
some wine, smoke some weed.

550
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,893
And then you're gonna go
to the party after that.

551
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:06,013
And I'm not gonna go to the party.

552
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,902
And I'll see you at the party.

553
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:12,096
Drink some wine, smoke some
weed, dance a little bit.

554
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,940
Aidan, I'ma just talk to you later.

555
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,859
I'ma talk to you later.

556
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,570
Where you at?

557
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:20,572
Come over.

558
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,334
Here it is.

559
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,598
Check this thing out, Palace.

560
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,046
Huh?

561
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,397
You're gonna look so fire in this.

562
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:30,537
What the fuck is this?

563
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:31,448
Try it on.

564
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:33,668
- I'm not about to try it on.
- Come on, try it on.

565
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,897
- No.
- Try it on.

566
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:40,563
Try it on. Try it on.

567
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,408
Try it on. Try it on.

568
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:46,203
Try it on. Try it on.

569
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:49,025
Try it on. Try it on.

570
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:53,923
Try it on. Try it on.

571
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,253
Shut up!

572
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,420
Shut up.

573
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,255
I'm not gonna try it on right here.

574
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:01,661
Okay.

575
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:36,431
Liam, where are you?

576
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:39,809
Oh, I snuck through your window.

577
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,311
I'm with Kieran.

578
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:44,355
Ew, girl.

579
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:45,823
He is not gonna fuck you.

580
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:46,942
We don't know that.

581
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,412
But we do though.

582
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,589
Just yesterday he was telling me

583
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,029
about his homosexual fantasies.

584
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,747
Enough with your homosocial agenda.

585
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:56,444
I gotta do my laundry.

586
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:58,710
Shut up. You like fuck
boys just as much as I do.

587
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:02,387
I'm attracted to fuck boys
because I am a fuck boy.

588
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,864
It's like I'm compulsively drawn

589
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,245
to that which disgusts me in myself.

590
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:12,199
Or you just think he's
hot and you wanna fuck.

591
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,127
Week eight. Are you gonna
let Ezra eat your pussy?

592
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,212
Ew, stop talking nasty.

593
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:18,887
He's into threesomes.

594
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:21,705
You know that people who're
into threesomes fuck good.

595
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:22,777
Stop.

596
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,283
And I saw his dick in the bathroom.

597
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,338
- It's thick.
- I'ma hang up on you.

598
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,405
Bodega candle thick.

599
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:31,199
I'm serious.

600
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,501
Anyway, there's a face mask.

601
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,856
I left some food in the fridge.

602
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,245
It's all there for you.
Make yourself at home.

603
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:37,525
Thank you.

604
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,324
And there's some nice wine.

605
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,453
You can have that too.

606
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:41,775
Love you. Bye.

607
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:04,046
Her semi-nude
body was discovered

608
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:08,976
along a secluded footpath
known locally as the Black Pad.

609
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:29,942
Shut the up.

610
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:58,347
Wee.

611
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,654
Hi, welcome to the Palace Channel

612
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,187
and today I'm gonna be
showing you a night look.

613
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:21,408
So what I did was I
already washed my face,

614
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:24,903
I did my jade roll, put my lip balm on.

615
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:27,672
Of course, can't go
anywhere without sunscreen.

616
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:28,773
It is a must.

617
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:30,572
So then once I did all that,

618
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,619
what we're gonna do is we're
gonna start on the eyes.

619
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,011
Into the waterline.

620
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,128
Don't be afraid to get in there.

621
00:35:36,129 --> 00:35:38,312
But I'm not like most girls,

622
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:43,314
so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna mix that with some gray

623
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:46,108
and just don't be afraid, you know?

624
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,587
Makeup should be fun.

625
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:52,922
I like having fun. Look
how pretty this is.

626
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:54,516
So pretty.

627
00:35:54,517 --> 00:35:55,849
That's so pretty.

628
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,838
Wow.

629
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,449
That's the mistake that I
see a lotta people making

630
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,118
is they don't put on eye shadow
when their eyes are open.

631
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:10,036
It's just something I notice.

632
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,670
It's not something you gotta change.

633
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,847
What I'm really gonna focus on

634
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:16,016
since I don't wear that much makeup is

635
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,211
get in there just a little.

636
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:23,104
And then I know a lotta
people like to use a sponge.

637
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:24,569
I don't do that.

638
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,534
Some people would think
this color's too dark.

639
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,498
But I know it's looking crazy right now,

640
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,784
but I'll show you in a
minute how I make it work.

641
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:32,785
Oh shit.

642
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,971
Just if you fuck up, like don't
be afraid to make mistakes.

643
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:44,179
It's all about making
mistakes with makeup.

644
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,639
That's how you learn what you like.

645
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,109
A wiggle, wiggle.

646
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,278
Not everybody has, umm.

647
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,042
I've been told I have nice lips.

648
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:53,958
It is what it is.

649
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:58,025
You can't get here unless
you know how to work this.

650
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:00,586
Lemme stop talking and get this together.

651
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,192
Yo, I'm here. Where are you?

652
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,512
What?

653
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,310
You're supposed to be DJing right now.

654
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,881
Yeah, I'm on my way.

655
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:09,716
No, you're not.

656
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:11,868
I'm walking over right now.

657
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,089
Okay. Bye.

658
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,091
Bye.

659
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:18,365
And as the French would say, "Voila."

660
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:23,367
Take your hair down and just
really embrace who you are

661
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,757
which is not me.

662
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:28,286
Hello?

663
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,538
Hello.

664
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:32,278
Hey, what's up?

665
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,926
Do you know who this is?

666
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,813
No, I don't. Who is this?

667
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:43,445
I thought you saved my number.

668
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:44,614
Who is this?

669
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,516
You sound busy.

670
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:49,853
Who is this?

671
00:37:51,044 --> 00:37:52,363
Oh.

672
00:37:52,364 --> 00:37:53,266
Hi.

673
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:57,359
I thought we were gonna
hang out this evening.

674
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,818
You never told me that.

675
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,903
Well are we gonna hang out tonight?

676
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:04,136
I don't know.

677
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:08,347
I thought you were DJing the party.

678
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,244
I got an email about it.

679
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:13,754
Yeah, I'm like five minutes away.

680
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:14,975
- Damn.
- Okay, cool.

681
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,477
I'll see you soon.

682
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,518
Bye.

683
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,797
"On this day, I have imbibed
wines the color of grapefruit,

684
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:30,433
tasted the finest cheeses of all the land,

685
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,660
sweets and spices you can't imagine.

686
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,738
Thank you for hospitality

687
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,214
and care, my man.

688
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:45,582
I emerge from your home

689
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:49,270
with clean garments and cleaner privates.

690
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:53,605
I return to the kingdom of
Illinois tomorrow's eve.

691
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,908
It has been a pleasure and an honor.

692
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:00,243
Until we meet again.

693
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,245
Love,

694
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Palace."

695
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:51,659
Hey Palace.

696
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,881
Hey.

697
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:53,883
Palace.

698
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:55,802
Hey Portia.

699
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:58,105
I thought you weren't coming.

700
00:40:58,106 --> 00:40:59,207
I'm here now.

701
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,783
Okay, well this party
needs a little help.

702
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:02,964
Come here.

703
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:15,924
Yo Palace, you wore it.

704
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:17,872
Yeah.

705
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:19,184
You look amazing.

706
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,493
Thanks, boo.

707
00:41:21,494 --> 00:41:23,955
Aren't you supposed to be DJing?

708
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:25,745
Yeah, you wanna
hear something better?

709
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:26,997
Yeah. Please.

710
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,240

00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:42,051
Let me log into my playlist real quick.

How're you gonna play
this with no channel?

713
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:46,658
I'ma figure it out. I got it.

714
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,828

Dude, I got all his early stuff.

He was a fucking legend.

722
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,760
It must've been so wild
growing up with such a legend

723
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:20,285
What was it like though, I mean?

724

732
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,242
So do you.

733
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:38,696
♪ Then they change their minds ♪

734
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:42,247
♪ They both go their separate ways ♪

735
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:46,423

♪ And that's the way love is ♪

740
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,391
Wanna get a drink?

741
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:14,393
Sure.

742
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,067
Opa.

743
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:20,402
- To us.
- To us.

744
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:24,543
Wait, how is it?

745
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:25,544
Is it okay?

746
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:27,896
It's decent.

747
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:29,689
There's a little bit
of everything in there,

748
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,524
but I had to make do.

749
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:34,611
It matches your dress perfectly though.

750
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:36,017
Oh yeah. It does match my dress.

751
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:37,897
It's bright red.

752
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:38,948
Wait, that reminds me.

753
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:41,603
We never did a studio visit.

754
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,493
Okay?

755
00:44:42,494 --> 00:44:44,969
Let's do a studio visit now.

756
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,268
You wanna do a studio visit right now.

757
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,327
Yeah. Come with me.

758
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:50,161
Let's go.

759
00:44:50,162 --> 00:44:51,162
Okay.

760
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:12,546
Oh, don't touch me right there.

761
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:13,662
Should we get outta here?

762
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:16,135
I thought we were
gonna do a studio visit.

763
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:17,736
Do you need a ride home?

764
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:18,884
Um.

765
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:20,886
Well I have Aidan's keys

766
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,015
because I have her car.

767
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:27,091
Right.

768
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:29,912
And I could go back with Hannah

769
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:31,973
because me and Hannah live together

770
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:34,737
or I could go back with Fern

771
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:37,290
because Fern and Aidan live together.

772
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,487
Right.

773
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:39,975
Why? What're you gonna do?

774
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:42,356
Well I'm thinking of taking off.

775
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:44,059
Do you wanna stay here now?

776
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,623
You tired?

777
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:46,457
A little bit.

778
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,458
Oh.

779
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:51,002
Well thanks for the drink.

780
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:52,004
Sure.

781
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:54,054
Okay.

782
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:57,079
So you just wanna stay?

783
00:45:57,984 --> 00:45:59,317
Yeah. Why not?

784
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:01,861
Okay.

785
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,733
I saw that.

786
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,927
What are you still doing
here? What happened?

787
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,268
I'm shy. I'm nervous.

788
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:23,531
I'm so ugly when I got crush on somebody.

789
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:26,543
Making like the stupidest faces.

790
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:28,691
Why don't you just tell him
you wanna have sex with him?

791
00:46:28,692 --> 00:46:30,794
Oh no. I don't know.

792
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:32,712
Well I thought you were
gonna be a sex guy tonight.

793
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:34,925
I thought you was gonna
be a sex guy tonight.

794
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,168
- Where's Kieran?
- Shh!

795
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,302
Girl, calm down.

796
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:39,387
- Kieran!
- Shh!

797
00:46:40,669 --> 00:46:42,798
Where is his Jordan
Cat a la no head-ass?

798
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,108
Oh. You don't want
me to talk about Ezra.

799
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:46,594
That fucking guy.

800
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,959
Don't start this conversation.

801
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,599
But can that nigga read for real?

802
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,857
You could tell me, Hannah.

803
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,481
'Cause I've had sex with men

804
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:54,618
who like straight up be
reading with their fingers.

805
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,248
Yes, he can read.

806
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:58,540
Okay 'cause he mentioned.

807
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,163
"To Kill a Mockingbird" for his thesis?

808
00:47:01,164 --> 00:47:02,629
It's a classic American tale.

809
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,057
Hannah, I'm no scholar but
that's a children's book.

810
00:47:06,058 --> 00:47:07,059
Okay.

811
00:47:07,752 --> 00:47:10,007
So wait, what happened
with Ezra, that big dumb dog?

812
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:13,048
Either I choked, he choked.

813
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:14,387
Somebody choked.

814
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:15,747
Stay, stay.

815
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:16,851
Good boy. Good boy.

816
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:17,894
Come get your treat.

817
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:22,125
Okay, Hannah.

818
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:23,126
Hey.

819
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:24,305
Hi.

820
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,369
Looking good, baby.

821
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,549
It's so good to see you here.

822
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,821
You're fabulous.

823
00:47:30,822 --> 00:47:32,066
So glad you came.

824
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:33,550
Looking like a goddamn snack.

825
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,969
I'ma bite the shit outta you.

826
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,262
Have you seen Hannah?

827
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:41,181
I was literally just with Palace.

828
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:44,539
It's so dark in here I can't see nobody.

829
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,746
I need to find her.

830
00:47:46,747 --> 00:47:47,835
We're leaving together.

831
00:47:47,836 --> 00:47:49,214
Bitch!

832
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:51,043
Found her. Found her.

833
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:24,458
Oh and you're Venus Taurus.

834
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:27,322
So there is sort of this
combination that happens

835
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:29,563
when I'm with you guys of
sort of lightness and darkness.

836
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:31,206
Portia

837
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,706
and I'm sort of holding
the space in between.

838
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:34,686
Portia.

839
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:35,938
Yes, my love?

840
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:39,934
Do you have an Android charger?

841
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,613
Android, no.

842
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:44,172
Sorry, babe.

843
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,567
- But you know what?
- All good.

844
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:49,838
I think we can ask that
guy Akin or whatever

845
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,174
if he's in the studio next door.

846
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:53,176
Yeah.

847
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:56,355
Hannah, these are beautiful.

848
00:48:56,356 --> 00:48:58,274
These are so beautiful.

849
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,158
Taryn, aren't these gorgeous?

850
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:01,993
Look.

851
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:03,420
Thank you.

852
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:04,422
Bring me

853
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:07,242
the friendship

854
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:10,265
between solving and dissolving.

855
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:11,885
I'm so glad you like them.

856
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,497
They're just from Blythewood.

857
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:16,507
My thanks for picking up that
spray foam for me last week.

858
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:17,342
Oh.

859
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:18,553
Look, Hannah.

860
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:21,726
I would literally jump
off a bridge for you.

861
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:22,728
I love you.

862
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:26,333
I pick them every night after crits.

863
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:28,302
Wildflowers, black-eyed Susans.

864
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:29,809
You are so grounded.

865
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,650
Are you a Taurus?

866
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:34,513
- No.
- No. Weird.

867
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,935
Do you want some?

868
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:36,869
No, it's okay.

869
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,044
Palace?

870
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:39,229
What's up?

871
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,448
Do you want some?

872
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,950
It is really fucking good ket.

873
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:46,332
Have I done K before?

874
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:49,054
No, you haven't and you
shouldn't start tonight.

875
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,361
Okay.

876
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,318
That's impossible.

877
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,251
I'm sure you've done Ketamine
at this point in history.

878
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:59,041
But if you haven't, you should
try it 'cause you'd love it.

879
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:00,411
- Okay.
- Okay.

880
00:50:00,412 --> 00:50:01,565
How much should I take though?

881
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,331
Well how much have you had to drink?

882
00:50:03,332 --> 00:50:04,166
Like?

883
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,259
Oh no, no, no. It's fine.

884
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,542
You just can't be like drunk.

885
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:09,540
This is how I do it.

886
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:13,439
I take my finger and I put it in the bag

887
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,441
and then I put it on my
tongue like this.

888
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,170
Okay.

889
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:25,733
Like that and then like...

890
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,810
But Portia for real,

891
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:30,830
I'ma need you to gimme a phone charger.

892
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:34,214
Uh-huh. Palace, let's just breathe.

893
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:35,356
Okay.

894
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,972
Oh my god.

895
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,149
- What's up?
- Palace.

896
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:53,002
You look like an angel.

897
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:53,960
Oh, thank you.

898
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,471
Don't you have
to get up early tomorrow?

899
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:57,722
I'm good.

900
00:50:57,723 --> 00:51:01,978
Portia, I'm so happy we spent
time together this summer.

901
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:03,482
I really enjoyed it.

902
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:08,401
Oh, I am so glad to know you.

903
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:15,698
You know what?

904
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:18,200
This is really reminding me of

905
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:21,224
my Nicaraguan family

906
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:24,467
that I'm currently financially supporting.

907
00:51:24,468 --> 00:51:25,869
Oh yeah. You told me about them.

908
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,371
Yes, I met them

909
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:30,316
in Gillette Square

910
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:34,494
after I was visiting my grandmother

911
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:37,920
that I don't love talking about

912
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:40,907
- because of inherited trauma.
- Shh, don't talk about her.

913
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:42,742
But I was in this park

914
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:46,861
and I saw this gorgeous little girl

915
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:50,904
and she was just so beautiful
and she was by herself.

916
00:51:50,905 --> 00:51:55,239
And I said, "How can that
girl ever be alone again?"

917
00:51:56,557 --> 00:51:58,640
No one should be alone.

918
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,608
Let's go to Liam's.

919
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:02,589
Oh.

920
00:52:02,589 --> 00:52:03,423
It was nice to meet you.

921
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:04,564
Yeah, we're gonna go.

922
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,543
Okay, loves. You stay here.

923
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:08,154
Goodnight.

924
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:10,271
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

925
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:11,273
Bye.

926
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:19,466
Once again, I'm the bad guy.

927
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:22,594
And then again, just
sort of it is what it is.

928
00:52:22,595 --> 00:52:24,586
You know, I don't know.

929
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:26,111
I mean

930
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:27,814
that's true.

931
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:31,112
And you know, I do
honestly kinda like him.

932
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:33,136
But the reality is I don't really wanna

933
00:52:33,137 --> 00:52:35,521
- you know, relate to him.
- Hey.

934
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,552
What were you guys doing?

935
00:52:41,553 --> 00:52:45,788
I have presents for us.

936
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:47,042
Oh my god.

937
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:48,493
Shit.

938
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:51,191
Do you know that in rehab?

939
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:52,924
- No.
- You mean now?

940
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:54,676
Yes, out-patient.

941
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,183
That's a rough one.

942
00:52:57,184 --> 00:53:01,363
T, M and Brent broke up.

943
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,097
- No.
- Yes, they did.

944
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,424
Nine years.

945
00:53:04,425 --> 00:53:08,046
And they were so unhappy
for like the last half of it.

946
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:09,529
So sad.

947
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,894
I mean but you have to
stay true to your feelings

948
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:15,396
because Muva does not speak to everyone.

949
00:53:16,873 --> 00:53:18,753
- But when she speaks though.
- But when she does.

950
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:20,172
We must listen.

951
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:24,320
I mean I know one Hans
has been fucking

952
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,587
Since the first year.

953
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:26,976
No, no.

954
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:27,810
No, no, no, no.

955
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:28,811
Not my Hans.

956
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,810
She's not from Belarus.

957
00:53:31,811 --> 00:53:33,373
She's from Las Vegas.

958
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:35,523
East Las Vegas. East Las Vegas.

959
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:36,856
- Aww.
- She's not that cute.

960
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:38,068
She's not that cute.

961
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,903
She's just a white girl.

962
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:43,094
A mousey little white girl
who talks in a baby voice.

963
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,339
I'd never be a burden to you.

964
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,344
Hannah.

965
00:53:46,345 --> 00:53:48,398
Pass me that mini cupcake.

966
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,717
She's not that interesting.

967
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:50,784
Hannah.

968
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,304
White women voted for Trump.

969
00:53:52,305 --> 00:53:53,139
That's all I'm saying.

970
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,289
I hate white women.

971
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,753
- Girl, go for it.
- Portia.

972
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,335
Tell us what you think.

973
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,587
I am Jewish. I am Italian.

974
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,243
- Of course.
- That's the truth.

975
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,662
She's not a liar.

976
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,535
When are you going to Venice?

977
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,420
Oh, I don't know.

978
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,476
I gotta go home.

979
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:14,229
Okay, but you're in the Venice Biennale

980
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,122
and you don't know when you're
going or might not even go?

981
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:20,646
It be's that way sometimes.

982
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:24,129
Well you have to go by November.

983
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,519
If you don't go by November,

984
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,713
it could quite possibly be underwater

985
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:30,077
and fucking global warming,

986
00:54:30,078 --> 00:54:31,898
I think or something.

987
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:33,271
Well what are you doing?

988
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:36,276
I mean no shows, thank god.

989
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:38,035
Seth and I are going to Maine

990
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:40,593
for a couple weeks with his
parents which will be whatever.

991
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:42,978
But then after that, we're going to Greece

992
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,135
and that's what I'm stoked on.

993
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:48,970
Because Greece end of season
just is like fucking perfect.

994
00:54:50,523 --> 00:54:52,189
Fucking perfect.

995
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,170
Sounds nice.

996
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:54,687
I've been meaning to ask

997
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:56,298
do you have a gallery in New York yet?

998
00:54:56,299 --> 00:54:57,133
Mm-hmm.

999
00:54:57,134 --> 00:54:58,862
'Kay, because I was trying to tell you

1000
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:02,270
that I think that you should
be showing with.

1001
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:05,179
If you need to connect, I've
been working with.

1002
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,098
She's kinda phenomenal.

1003
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:09,564
Doesn't she do?

1004
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:12,374
Don't she do at night?

1005
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,545
Yeah, she does at night.

1006
00:55:13,546 --> 00:55:15,347
Yes, she does at night,

1007
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:17,289
but she's worked really hard.

1008
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,660
It wasn't easy for her

1009
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:23,027
and you know that she's like
really good and just go for it.

1010
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,551
- Speaking of
- at night, look at this.

1011
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:28,737
Pass it around. Pass it around.

1012
00:55:28,738 --> 00:55:30,447
Wait, don't you have a phone charger?

1013
00:55:30,448 --> 00:55:32,205
No, I don't have a phone charger.

1014
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:33,948
It's an Android, absolutely not.

1015
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:34,783
Get an iPhone.

1016
00:55:34,784 --> 00:55:36,549
Show me. It's my turn.

1017
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,574
Wait, I was gonna ask-

1018
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:40,326
Fern, I don't
even want to show you.

1019
00:55:41,863 --> 00:55:43,816
Are you an S corp on LLC?

1020
00:55:43,817 --> 00:55:44,674
What's an S corp?

1021
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,888
Okay, so S corp, LLC. Don't be an LLC.

1022
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:50,393
S corp's gonna give
you way better savings.

1023
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:52,108
I'm gonna introduce you to my accountant.

1024
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,380
She's gonna take care of everything.

1025
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:55,615
Let me do it with you.

1026
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:56,959
Oh okay.

1027
00:56:01,196 --> 00:56:02,343
Calvin Klein.

1028
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:03,345
First coke.

1029
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:06,128
Save it.

1030
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,433
Don't give Palace anymore.

1031
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:10,107
Hannah.

1032
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:11,531
Palace.

1033
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:13,200
Hannah, seriously.

1034
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,818
Hannah about to go, y'all.

1035
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:16,945
- Oh.
- All right, goodbye.

1036
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:19,081
Hi Kieran.

1037
00:56:19,082 --> 00:56:20,547
Oh, Hannah wanna stay now?

1038
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,756
Hannah wanna stay.

1039
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,302
Hannah wants to stay.

1040
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:29,519
Don't touch that please.

1041
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,455
Dude, chill.

1042
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:31,353
It was my dad's.

1043
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:32,187
C'mon.

1044
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,699
You so goofy.

1045
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,067
I'm goofy?

1046
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:36,165
Yeah.

1047
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,985
We were doing fine 'til
the straight man showed up.

1048
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:40,570
I'm not straight.

1049
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,720
Okay.

1050
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,537
I'm queer.

1051
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:45,539
Shut up.

1052
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,218
Is that coke?

1053
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:52,671
Yeah, it's just so hot.

1054
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:53,940
Lemme get the a/c on.

1055
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:54,942
No. It's K.

1056
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,635
Are you okay?

1057
00:58:28,082 --> 00:58:30,665
You did all this this summer?

1058
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:32,822
Damn.

1059
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:33,824
Okay.

1060
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,090
Go off, Kieran.

1061
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,208
I see you.

1062
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:40,907
I'm not gonna play.

1063
00:58:41,764 --> 00:58:43,826
Looking kinda reckless up in here.

1064
00:58:43,827 --> 00:58:47,730
I didn't know you was
into Ruff Ryder shit.

1065
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:49,108
See this?

1066
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,610
It's disingenuous.

1067
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:53,368
No.

1068
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:54,414
Palace?

1069
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,416
Thank you.

1070
00:58:57,296 --> 00:58:58,821
How so?

1071
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:00,823
The yellow's bullshit.

1072
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:03,257
I don't buy it.

1073
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:05,007
There are no stakes.

1074
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,637
You're not even in the work.

1075
00:59:07,638 --> 00:59:10,543
So obvious you're holding back.

1076
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,933
What are you afraid of?

1077
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:16,411
Well right now I'm feeling
very vulnerable about the work.

1078
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:18,750
That's how you're supposed to feel.

1079
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:20,334
That's your job.

1080
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:23,296
It's gotta come from your gut.

1081
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:26,048
Have you read Isabella Graw?

1082
00:59:27,181 --> 00:59:29,098
Kieran, you can read?

1083
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,383
I forget the name of the text,

1084
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:35,338
but I like what she says about
populism and exchange value.

1085
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,050
I wanna redistribute wealth

1086
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:40,503
by questioning how and what we value.

1087
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:42,590
That's what I like about crypto.

1088
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:47,224
It's best compared to patents,
but it's completely new.

1089
00:59:47,225 --> 00:59:48,226
It's ours.

1090
00:59:48,903 --> 00:59:50,849
And by participating in communities,

1091
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,114
we create real value: capital.

1092
00:59:54,115 --> 00:59:55,074
This?

1093
00:59:55,075 --> 00:59:57,667
This is anti-painting painting

1094
00:59:57,668 --> 01:00:00,151
disrupting the flow of capital.

1095
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:02,086
With painting?

1096
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:05,082
Kieran, these are beautiful.

1097
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:08,620
I'm so mad I never seen your work before.

1098
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:10,872
You be hiding shit like me.

1099
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:13,835
It's abstract.

1100
01:00:19,737 --> 01:00:20,584
You're full of shit.

1101
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:24,972
You're so full of shit.

1102
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,369
I'ma get a drink.

1103
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:51,235
Dillon, you got a light?

1104
01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:54,070
No, man. You know I don't smoke.

1105
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,386
You guys know what I mean

1106
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:05,463
when I'm talking about like liberalism.

1107
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:07,219
It's dead, dude.

1108
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,106
Like it's just like not even-

1109
01:01:10,107 --> 01:01:12,441
Um, you got a light, dude?

1110
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,937
No.

1111
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:17,189
You got a light?

1112
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,294
Palace, what's good?

1113
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:40,233
Hey HotJake.

1114
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:43,654
What?

1115
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:47,771
How come we never hung out this summer?

1116
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:50,131
I don't know. We hanging
out right now though.

1117
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:52,300
Yeah, but like hang out.

1118
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,134
I'm gonna get some water.

1119
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:12,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:13,797
Don't drink too much of that.

1121
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:15,006
Stop.

1122
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:16,008
What?

1123
01:02:16,922 --> 01:02:19,095
That was molly water.

1124
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:20,097
Whoa!

1125
01:02:20,919 --> 01:02:23,297
I'm gonna kill you.

1126
01:02:23,298 --> 01:02:25,561
Palace, you have some anger issues.

1127
01:02:25,562 --> 01:02:26,503
Portia.

1128
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:28,836
I'ma be sick. I'ma throw up.

1129
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:30,892
Baby, here.

1130
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:39,086
Palace, you're gonna be so high.

1131
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,683
Okay.

1132
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:45,107
Just move through it.

1133
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:47,506
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a gift.

1134
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:49,376
Let's go to the waterfall.

1135
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:57,696
Okay, perfect.

1136
01:02:59,398 --> 01:03:00,890
Portia.

1137
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,954
Do you have a phone charger?

1138
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:07,179
Oh babe, you have asked me
that like a hundred times.

1139
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,906
Literally, I don't.

1140
01:03:08,907 --> 01:03:12,199
Please don't ask me again.

1141
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,022
You're right. You're right.

1142
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:15,929
Okay, come in.

1143
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,456
I'm not getting wet alone.

1144
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:20,291
Is it cold?

1145
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:24,994
It feels amazing.

1146
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,136
You have to come in.

1147
01:03:39,018 --> 01:03:40,435
Come in. Come on.

1148
01:03:47,426 --> 01:03:48,926
- Portia?
- Mm-hmm.

1149
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:51,307
You see that?

1150
01:03:51,308 --> 01:03:52,142
What?

1151
01:03:52,143 --> 01:03:53,969
The beautiful colors.

1152
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,138
Oh.

1153
01:03:56,462 --> 01:03:58,407
What was that?

1154
01:03:58,408 --> 01:04:00,068
- What?
- That noise.

1155
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,780
- Oh my god. Oh my god.
- What?

1156
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:03,666
Portia, what?

1157
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,355
Oh my god, it was a beast.

1158
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:07,840
Don't play.

1159
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:09,259
That's not funny.

1160
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:16,018
Wait, no. But for real, do you hear that?

1161
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,020
What?

1162
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:19,602
Oh my god.

1163
01:04:19,603 --> 01:04:21,202
- Girl.
- Oh my god.

1164
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:22,036
What?

1165
01:04:22,036 --> 01:04:22,922
Oh my god.

1166
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:24,008
- Oh shit.
- Oh my god.

1167
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,778
I know your husband!

1168
01:04:30,544 --> 01:04:31,875
No, Portia. Come on.

1169
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:32,876
Let's go.

1170
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:36,451
Go, go, go.

1171
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:40,126
Water's so heavy.

1172
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,232
I know. It's so heavy.

1173
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:42,667
I like can't get out.

1174
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:44,606
Oh my god. Look, I'm like a beech.

1175
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:46,015
Like I'm like oh my god.

1176
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:49,222
Have you ever seen like "The Blue Lagoon"?

1177
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:52,073
- Like I'm like Brooke Shields.
- Is that a reality show?

1178
01:04:52,074 --> 01:04:56,542
No, it's this fucked
up movie from the '80s.

1179
01:04:56,543 --> 01:04:57,544
Whoa.

1180
01:05:10,392 --> 01:05:11,392
Oh my god.

1181
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:27,036
Hey.

1182
01:06:27,037 --> 01:06:30,325
I heard you on WNYC the other day.

1183
01:06:30,326 --> 01:06:32,160
Yeah, that was cool.

1184
01:06:33,443 --> 01:06:35,226
Do you listen to popular music?

1185
01:06:35,227 --> 01:06:36,061
Huh?

1186
01:06:36,062 --> 01:06:39,811
Have you ever
heard of Lil Uzi Vert?

1187
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:41,700
Yeah.

1188
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:42,848
I'm familiar.

1189
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:45,720
You know, he's a really
intelligent young man.

1190
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:48,122
I was listening to this
very compelling interview

1191
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:52,060
between Uzi and Terry Gross
on "Fresh Air" the other day.

1192
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:53,788
What an interesting life he's had.

1193
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:55,540
What's "Fresh Air"?

1194
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,227
Hunter.

1195
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:06,491
Hunter.

1196
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:07,964
Yeah, what's up?

1197
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:09,466
You got a light?

1198
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:15,345
No, I don't think it's a problem.

1199
01:07:15,346 --> 01:07:16,213
Hold on one sec.

1200
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:17,963
Yo, can I get a hit?

1201
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:23,548
Cheers.

1202
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,582
Hey bitch.

1203
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,611
It's like the motherfuckin' Palace Show.

1204
01:08:00,612 --> 01:08:01,446
Tune in.

1205
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:03,814
Bitch, how are you
always trying to fight me?

1206
01:08:03,815 --> 01:08:05,837
Guess what, I went to Venice.

1207
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:07,129
It sucked.

1208
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:10,098
I wanted to like it, but
I know you phoned it in.

1209
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:11,925
Fern, you're touched.

1210
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:14,164
This is why I don't fuck with you anymore.

1211
01:08:14,165 --> 01:08:16,205
Don't send me any more text messages

1212
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:18,246
talking about the sky is falling.

1213
01:08:18,247 --> 01:08:19,564
You used me.

1214
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:22,090
Hit me, bitch. I wish you would.

1215
01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:24,068
I'm not playing with you, Fern.

1216
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:26,655
Who cares what they have, Palace?

1217
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:28,772
They all want you dead anyways.

1218
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:30,205
You know what, Fern?

1219
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,855
You showed your ass in Chile.

1220
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:35,370
'Cause who the fuck plans
an international trip

1221
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:36,575
and then not show up?

1222
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:38,862
Hurt my goddamn feelings
with that one, bitch.

1223
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:40,080
It's all about you.

1224
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:42,636
It's no one else's responsibility.

1225
01:08:42,637 --> 01:08:44,099
You want these hands?

1226
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,463
You get these hands, okay?

1227
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:48,061
I do this shit for sport.

1228
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:50,383
Just like this annoying-ass person

1229
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:52,197
that I cannot stand no more.

1230
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:55,280
Skinny, stupid, scrawny-ass bitch.

1231
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,532
Fuck you, Fern.

1232
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:02,859
Hey.

1233
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,927
You good?

1234
01:09:03,928 --> 01:09:04,929
I was.

1235
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,837
Yeah, I'm decent.

1236
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:08,752
Yeah, I was wondering where you went.

1237
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:12,196
I was looking for you, handsome.

1238
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:14,458
You wanna go for a
ride in my convertible?

1239
01:09:14,459 --> 01:09:15,946
You have a convertible?

1240
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:19,128
No, but I wanna take you for a ride.

1241
01:09:19,129 --> 01:09:20,183
Oh, I can't.

1242
01:09:20,184 --> 01:09:21,614
I leave tomorrow.

1243
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,485
Come and we can go
to Twin Lakes tomorrow.

1244
01:09:24,486 --> 01:09:26,540
No, I leave tomorrow.

1245
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,528
So this is it?

1246
01:09:44,462 --> 01:09:46,379
Are you okay, Palace?

1247
01:09:48,797 --> 01:09:50,210
Decisions.

1248
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:51,212
Bad.

1249
01:09:53,587 --> 01:09:55,049
Do you want me to take you home?

1250
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,413
Mm-mmm.

1251
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:59,787
Stay.

1252
01:09:59,788 --> 01:10:01,622
No, no. Stay.

1253
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:03,189
It's whatever, man.

1254
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,227
I don't feel safe leaving you like this.

1255
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:07,437
Stay.

1256
01:10:32,237 --> 01:10:33,237
Shit.

1257
01:10:57,053 --> 01:11:01,220
Had to get out.

1258
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:05,847
That set was just a fucking mess.

1259
01:11:05,848 --> 01:11:08,178
I wish I could go back and just-

1260
01:11:08,179 --> 01:11:09,607
Akin.

1261
01:11:09,608 --> 01:11:10,441
Rearrange the playlist.

1262
01:11:10,441 --> 01:11:11,379
I didn't play any of the right songs.

1263
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,096
No one liked.

1264
01:11:13,097 --> 01:11:14,098
It's fine.

1265
01:11:14,778 --> 01:11:18,417
- Akin.
- Gotta get outta the woods.

1266
01:11:18,418 --> 01:11:22,289
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

1267
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:25,606
- Just please. God, Jesus.
- Akin.

1268
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:26,516
He's not even that hot.

1269
01:11:26,517 --> 01:11:28,418
He's just white.

1270
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:30,344
Such fucking bullshit.

1271
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:32,004
So annoying.

1272
01:11:32,005 --> 01:11:34,339
- So ready to done.
- Wow, boy.

1273
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:36,254
Maybe I should.

1274
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:38,797
These nails are kinda long.

1275
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:39,697
I like this ring though.

1276
01:11:39,698 --> 01:11:42,548
It looks nice.

1277
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:55,261
Fuck.

1278
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:01,954
Boop.

1279
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:05,442
Angel.

1280
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:29,345
Good morning.

1281
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:34,602
Good morning, Ezra.

1282
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,437
How are you feeling?

1283
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:39,184
What do you want?

1284
01:14:39,185 --> 01:14:41,353
You were out last night.

1285
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,451
Okay.

1286
01:14:44,452 --> 01:14:45,619
I put you in the car.

1287
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,621
You were passed out on the pavement.

1288
01:14:50,164 --> 01:14:53,359
Thank you for putting
me in the car, sure.

1289
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,221
But why are you in the car?

1290
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:58,583
I wanted to just wake up together.

1291
01:14:58,584 --> 01:15:01,004
Nigga, you don't know me.

1292
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:03,936
What do you mean wake up together?

1293
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:06,855
I don't know you, but I like you.

1294
01:15:08,391 --> 01:15:09,780
Well.

1295
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:10,861
Well?

1296
01:15:10,862 --> 01:15:11,863
Last day.

1297
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:14,487
Yeah, it is the last day.

1298
01:15:14,488 --> 01:15:18,811
So why would you wait 'til the
last day to like make a move?

1299
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:20,137
Like what you thought this was?

1300
01:15:20,138 --> 01:15:21,570
I made a move last night,

1301
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:24,365
but you didn't seem like you were into it.

1302
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:25,322
When?

1303
01:15:25,322 --> 01:15:26,156
You don't remember?

1304
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:31,100
When we were making out in
the hallway, I pulled you in.

1305
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:32,778
You got ticklish.

1306
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,751
We had a laugh.

1307
01:15:34,752 --> 01:15:37,503
That weak-ass make out session.

1308
01:15:39,178 --> 01:15:41,124
That's some eighth-grade shit.

1309
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,357
I like you, Palace.

1310
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:44,538
Don't fucking touch me.

1311
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:45,744
Did you ask?

1312
01:15:45,745 --> 01:15:47,858
Did you say, "Can I touch you?"

1313
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:48,860
No.

1314
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:52,396
Wait, what?

1315
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:58,493
Ezra.

1316
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:00,973
I'ma be real with you.

1317
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:03,125
You been pissing me off all summer

1318
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,112
'cause you do that wave and shit.

1319
01:16:05,113 --> 01:16:06,450
You don't do anything.

1320
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:07,452
Just hi.

1321
01:16:08,223 --> 01:16:09,627
You just wave.

1322
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:13,296
And now I'm supposed
to be like, "Oh my god.

1323
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:16,129
He stared at me all night.

1324
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,033
He picked me up."

1325
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:18,530
Like bro, I'm Palace Bryant.

1326
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:19,906
I'ma be good.

1327
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:21,651
You could a left me there.

1328
01:16:21,652 --> 01:16:26,083
I'm fine. I would've woken
up and drove my ass home.

1329
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:28,417
I didn't want you to
be alone when you woke up

1330
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,194
not knowing where or how you got here.

1331
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:35,692
Okay 'cause you just such
a fucking nice guy, right?

1332
01:16:35,693 --> 01:16:37,369
I'm not saying that.

1333
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,621
I thought it was the right thing to do.

1334
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:44,003
You're a bitch.

1335
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:45,358
So that's all you're gonna say?

1336
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:46,438
"You're a bitch, this.

1337
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:47,951
Why'd you wait 'til the end?"

1338
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:48,932
All of that.

1339
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:52,155
Yes, Ezra. 'Cause ain't nobody
asking you those questions.

1340
01:16:52,156 --> 01:16:54,149
You think you a fucking catch.

1341
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:57,578
You're not and you're not special.

1342
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,021
I'm special.

1343
01:16:59,022 --> 01:17:01,039
- No one's-
- What movie are you in?

1344
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,109
I don't know. Missed connections, huh?

1345
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,194
What? What?

1346
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:07,711
Oh my god.

1347
01:17:07,712 --> 01:17:09,639
Fuck me or get out the car.

1348
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,888
What?

1349
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:11,890
"What?"

1350
01:17:12,876 --> 01:17:13,709
Fuck me or get out the car.

1351
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,572
You're just gonna
mock me the whole time?

1352
01:17:15,573 --> 01:17:17,017
You think that's gonna turn me on?

1353
01:17:17,018 --> 01:17:17,852
- Yup.
- Yeah.

1354
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:19,559
And away we go.

1355
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,811
Fuck me or you're racist.

1356
01:17:31,284 --> 01:17:32,367
Are you okay?

1357
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,160
'Cause you're kissing a Black girl,

1358
01:17:36,161 --> 01:17:38,393
you think you're not racist?

1359
01:17:38,394 --> 01:17:41,494
What does that have to do with anything?

1360
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:42,934
You just gagged me.

1361
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:43,936
Do it again.

1362
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:47,875
Harder.

1363
01:17:55,981 --> 01:17:57,363
Okay again.

1364
01:17:57,364 --> 01:17:58,365
Three.

1365
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,383
This is three.

1366
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:01,474
Mm-hmm, I can count.

1367
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:02,726
- Four.
- Three.

1368
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:05,219
Oh, this? Hi.

1369
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:18,241
Can you do that?

1370
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:21,284
That weak-ass bark.

1371
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:23,142
You don't know how to play.

1372
01:18:23,143 --> 01:18:24,214
Maybe I don't.

1373
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:25,215
You don't.

1374
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:58,168
Where you going?

1375
01:18:58,169 --> 01:18:59,003
Ezra?

1376
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:00,328
What?

1377
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:01,605
Get the fuck out.

1378
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:02,976
That's it?

1379
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:03,916
Yeah, that's it.

1380
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:04,917
Get out.

1381
01:19:05,736 --> 01:19:06,736
Come on.

1382
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:28,239
"Dear Kulu and Grayling,

1383
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,416
I hope you have been enjoying
your summer in Europe.

1384
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:33,216
It is important for a young lad

1385
01:20:33,217 --> 01:20:36,681
to travel and expand his or her mind.

1386
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:39,356
Yes, you can be a lad and a her.

1387
01:20:39,357 --> 01:20:40,449
Learn about it.

1388
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:45,354
Anyway, enclosed in this dusty
drawer are the house keys.

1389
01:20:45,355 --> 01:20:49,137
Please pay me the security
deposit when you get them.

1390
01:20:49,138 --> 01:20:52,207
I will also email you
about this next week.

1391
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:55,949
When I'm settled back
in Chicago, Illinois.

1392
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:58,134
Thank you for letting
me sleep in your bed.

1393
01:20:58,135 --> 01:21:02,072
I too am a fan of the Green Bay Packers.

1394
01:21:02,073 --> 01:21:03,657
Sincerely, Palace."

1395
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:42,187
Get up.

1396
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:00,514
Drink.

1397
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,616
Poor baby.

1398
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:34,899
Good morning.

1399
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:35,847
I got you a croissant.

1400
01:22:35,848 --> 01:22:37,406
How are you feeling?

1401
01:22:37,407 --> 01:22:38,881
Like shit.

1402
01:22:38,882 --> 01:22:40,277
Yeah.

1403
01:22:40,278 --> 01:22:44,099
Where were you when I needed you, whore?

1404
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,723
I spent the night with Kieran.

1405
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:48,892
Oh, you were being a sex guy.

1406
01:22:48,893 --> 01:22:51,299
I'm proud of you, sex guy.

1407
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,134
Yeah.

1408
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:53,683
How was it?

1409
01:22:53,684 --> 01:22:56,384
Yeah, he can do some things.

1410
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:58,886
Did anything happen with Ezra?

1411
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:04,234
I was like.

1412
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,137
And then I was like.

1413
01:23:10,696 --> 01:23:13,051
Whore, what happened?

1414
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:14,631
Bodega candle.

1415
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:16,216
Sex guy.

1416
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:22,714
I died last night.

1417
01:23:24,098 --> 01:23:25,767
I might still be dead.

1418
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:27,252
How would you know?

1419
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:28,337
I wouldn't.

1420
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:34,131
You did a lot of drugs.

1421
01:23:39,526 --> 01:23:40,828
It's okay. We've all been there.

1422
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:41,755
How can I help?

1423
01:23:41,756 --> 01:23:43,532
No, I don't need help.

1424
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:45,578
I called before we left last night.

1425
01:23:45,579 --> 01:23:48,194
Mmh, my phone died.

1426
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,504
Time is your train?

1427
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:51,730
9:52.

1428
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:54,723
Why didn't you just fly out of Albany?

1429
01:23:54,724 --> 01:23:56,533
Girl, don't start.

1430
01:23:56,534 --> 01:23:57,945
It's just so much easier.

1431
01:23:57,946 --> 01:24:00,863
Did you get the fellowship?

1432
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:02,351
I'll know in a week or two.

1433
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:03,999
I don't know.

1434
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,696
Well, they better give it to you.

1435
01:24:05,697 --> 01:24:07,198
I need to sleep.

1436
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:12,412
No.

1437
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,751
No.

1438
01:24:14,752 --> 01:24:16,472
Don't be weird.

1439
01:24:16,473 --> 01:24:20,391
I don't know when I'm
gonna see your ass again.

1440
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,792
I'm gonna miss you.

1441
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,388
I probably won't call.

1442
01:24:26,389 --> 01:24:27,654
Oh, I know.

1443
01:24:27,655 --> 01:24:29,173
Doesn't mean I don't want to.

1444
01:24:29,174 --> 01:24:31,010
Same, bitch.

1445
01:24:31,011 --> 01:24:33,627
Can I help you with those boxes?

1446
01:24:33,628 --> 01:24:34,590
Yes.

1447
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:38,890
I left the keys for Kulu
and Grayling in the drawer.

1448
01:24:38,891 --> 01:24:41,151
I'll return your studio keys?

1449
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:42,169
Yes, please.

1450
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:44,269
Of course.

1451
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:10,619
Aidan!

1452
01:25:12,502 --> 01:25:13,502
Aidan!

1453
01:25:16,768 --> 01:25:18,016
- Aidan!
- Girl.

1454
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:19,568
Shush.

1455
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:21,249
I can see you.

1456
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,539
I can't miss my train.

1457
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,898
Aidan, can you drive?

1458
01:25:26,899 --> 01:25:30,190
No, that's not
what we talked about.

1459
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,414
