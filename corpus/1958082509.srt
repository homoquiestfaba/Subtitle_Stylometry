[Dr. Yates] <i>You disappeared
on me. We had an appointment.</i>

00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,744
The mountains called.

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,705
[Dr. Yates] <i>Sadie, it's normal
to be affected by what happened.</i>

5
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,875
<i>Death, anyone's, can
fill us with urgency.</i>

6
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,752
This is not about what happened.

7
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,880
I didn't really know her,
but... [inhales sharply]

8
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,007
[stammers, sighs] She
was the same as me.

9
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,927
Same age, same job.

10
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,596
The one time I was in her house,
it was the same as mine. [chuckles]

11
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,015
Nice, but cold.

12
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:43,855
Empty, except for one sad houseplant,
which is more than I have.

13
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,815
She died alone.

14
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,196
[Dr. Yates] <i>Sadie, stay present.
No big moves, no big changes.</i>

15
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,616
So don't marry the
rafting guide I just met?

16
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,910
[chuckles] <i>Maybe start
with a houseplant.</i>

17
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,620
I'd probably eat it.

18
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,539
My cold, empty house has
a cold, empty fridge.

19
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm gonna stop for groceries.

20
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,753
- [Dr. Yates] <i>Let's check in tomorrow.</i>
- Yeah.

21

["Feel It Still" playing]

22
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,594
No pesticides, more nutrients.
It just tastes better, you know.

23
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:17,931
Out of 20.

24
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,687
Sorry, guys.

25
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,901
[phone chimes]

26
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,159
Five, six, seven.
Have a good one.

27
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,580
[coworker] You know you're gonna
need to buy stock in those trackers.

28
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,749
You'd lose your butt if
it wasn't attached to you.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,380
Well, you lost your hair,
and that was attached.

30
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,712
I walked into that one.

31
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:52,090
Hey, Cole. Are you okay?

32
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:55,552
Yeah, heard you got
dumped. Tough break, man.

33
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:00,347
- Edna.
- I gossip when I'm bored.

34
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,391
- For your information, it was mutual.
- Mmm.

35
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,268
That's what everyone says
after getting dumped.

36
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,436
- That's true.
- Hmm.

37
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,563
Maybe try being a little
less needy, you know?

38
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,064
Girls don't really like that.

39
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,275
I'm not needy.

40
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,028
We just grew apart. [sighs]

41
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,072
And I really just don't
wanna talk about it.

42
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,493
You wanna go get high?

43
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:23,914
I got a edible in the truck.

44
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,999
No, thanks.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,377
Okay. Well, watch my booth.
I'm gonna go get high.

46
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,130
Enjoy.

47
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,841
- [dog owner] Come on. Here.
- [customer] Uh, just that one.

48
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:39,387
- [customer 2] Just this one.
- [customer 3] I'll take one too.

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,394
Salmon. Halibut. It's all fresh.

[song continues]

51
00:03:58,198 --> 00:03:59,532
[Cole] Can I help you?

52
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:05,497
Uh, yes, thank you.
I'm gonna get that one.

53
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,166
Begonia. Nice choice.

54
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,378
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,547
It is pretty.

56
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,632
Yeah.

57
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:23,265
Don't let any pets eat the leaves.
They can be slightly toxic.

58
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,601
[chuckles] Pretty
and slightly toxic.

59
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,687
What is it with
me and roommates?

60
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,855
Didn't realize you roomed
with all of my exes.

61
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,233
[chuckles]

62
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,487
[chuckling] Mmm.

63
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,614
How much watering does it need?

64
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:44,578
Uh, every other day or so.
Begonias need a little bit of love.

65
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,246
Uh... [sighs]

66
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,417
I... [stutters] I'm actually
gone a lot for work.

67
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,501
Okay.

68
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,087
Okay, got it. Um, less love.

69
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,465
- [chuckles]
- Um, what about a snake plant?

70
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,051
They only need watering
every two weeks.

71
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:06,057
Sometimes I'm gone longer,
like a month or two.

72
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,768
Okay. Mmm.

73
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:12,146
Sorry, then why do you want
a plant if you're never home?

74
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,232
I'm not never home. I just...

75
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,070
How about if you find me
something a little less needy?

76
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,075
Right. Um, why not just
get a plastic plant?

77
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,327
That's sad.

78
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,954
Well, not as sad
as killing a plant.

79
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,458
And some of the new ones,
they look totally real.

80
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,876
No amount of neglect
will kill them.

81
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,378
Neglect?

82
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:38,380
You know what, I'm...
I'm gonna get this one.

83
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:41,009
- Yep.
- Thank you.

84
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,725
Sorry, I... I can't
sell you this plant.

85
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,144
I can't sell it to you
in good conscience.

86
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,981
Good conscience? What are you,
the patron saint of plants?

87
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:58,442
I just don't feel comfortable
selling a plant to someone

88
00:05:58,443 --> 00:05:59,610
that can be so indifferent

89
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,028
- towards a living thing.
- Indifferent?

90
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,030
Is this how you speak
to all your customers?

91
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,157
'Cause if you do, I'm shocked
that you sell anything at all.

92
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,201
No, as a matter of fact,
this isn't even my stall.

93
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:08,619
I just don't wanna
be an accomplice...

94
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,746
You're refusing to sell me a
plant that you don't even own?

95
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:11,956
- That's right.
- [Edna] Hey, Cole.

96
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,999
- What's going on?
- Hi.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,960
- Are these your plants?
- Yes.

98
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,462
Awesome. 'Cause Farmer Clown
here won't sell me one.

99
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,090
- [chuckles] Farmer Clown. That's funny.
- The plant is $10, honey.

100
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:22,883
Edna, sh...

101
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,429
All right, you know what? Hey,
want a plant? Here. Cactus.

102
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,181
Requires the bare minimum
love a human can give,

103
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:31,017
- so you'll totally kill it.
- [Edna sighs]

104
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,064
You should fire him.

105
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,066
- She's just gonna...
- Have a good one.

106
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,569
RIP, little guy.

107
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,571
- Can you believe that?
- No.

108
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:46,156
I thought for sure you two
were gonna exchange numbers.

109
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,866
- What?
- Yes.

110
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,619
I thought, under all that stupid
fighting, you were flirting.

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,913
- Wait, we were flirting?
- Are you kidding me?

112
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:57,127
Are you high? [chuckles] The
sexual tension was off the charts.

113
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:02,716
Edna, watch my stall.

114
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,426
- Hey, hey, hey, sorr... [stammers]
- [car horn honks]

115
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,929
- [Cole] Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- Shit.

116
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:13,934
Hi. Hi. Yep...
[sighs] ...it's me.

117
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,562
Sorry. Just, uh...

118
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,982
- Are you here to rescue the plant?
- [chuckles]

119
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,318
No. No, I'm not. That's funny.

120
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,195
Um, no, I was just...

121
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,449
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to, um,

122
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,201
you know, go out sometime.

123
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,914
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:35,749
Yeah, I mean, I...

125
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,668
I mean, I know we
were kind of...

126
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,336
- arguing back there...
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,839
But I thought that, uh,
underneath it, there was, uh...

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,885
um... something.

129
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,678
Something?

130
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,556
- Yeah.
- [scoffs]

131
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,392
I'm wrong, aren't I?

132
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,772
Well, this is
embarrassing. Um...

133
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:04,653
- Sorry, sorry. I misread it.
- Hmm.

134
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,662
[car horn honks]

135
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,249
I can use a coffee.

136
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,419
A coffee? You want to
get a... Yeah. Like, now?

137
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,548
[chuckles] Yes, now.

138
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,466
[chuckles] Get in.

139
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,636
Yeah, well... Yeah.
[chuckles] Yeah.

140
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,390
[grunts]

141
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,392
- I'm Cole, by the way.
- Mm-hmm. Seat belt.

142
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:38,227
Yep, yep, yep. [grunts] Sorry.

143
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:41,939
[sighs] I'll just hang on.

144
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,067
[chuckles] Okay.

145

["Love Is Everywhere
(Beware)" playing]

146
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:59,874
[Sadie] I like the canal.
It reminds me of Amsterdam.

147
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,668
[Cole] So, art
curators travel a lot?

148
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:06,756
Oh, yeah. All over
the world. [slurps]

149
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,966
I love it.

150
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,219
Just jumping on a
plane, moment's notice,

151
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,724
and then, you know, stepping
out into a new place.

152
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,268
Wow.

153
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,229
Oh, gosh, don't tell me
you're one of those big,

154
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,940
tough guys who's afraid
to leave the country.

155
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,610
Okay, first of all, thank you
for calling me big and tough.

156
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:31,114
Let's keep that going. And
I travel. I travel a lot.

157
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:33,992
- Really?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,285
Yeah, I think the trips
that you plan the least

159
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:38,038
are the ones that
give you the most.

160
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,500
I agree.

161
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,880
[Cole] <i>Lincoln got shot just across the
street, and he died right next door.</i>

162
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,925
Sounds like you're a
big fan of Lincoln.

163
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,260
Well, history in general.

164
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:55,054
I majored in agriculture,
but I minored in history.

165
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:56,973
- That's my real passion.
- Huh.

166
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:58,683
You know, I'm writing a book.

167
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,353
- You are?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,397
History of farming?

169
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,359
No, it's about the rise and
fall of different empires

170
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,570
and the critical role
that agriculture...

171
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:12,571
Yeah, it's about farming.

172
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:15,532
[laughs] So how's it going?

173
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,994
[inhales sharply] Well...
[sighs] ...it's on pause for now.

174
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:22,706
My dad got hurt a few years ago, so I
came back to help him with the farm.

175
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,917
So not a lot of
time for writing.

176
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,253
Hmm. I'm sorry.

177
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,631
Oh, it's okay. I'll finish it.

178
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,552
[Cole] You've never seen <i>The
Exorcist</i>? It's a classic.

179
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:38,430
It's one of the scariest movies ever
made, and they filmed it right here.

180
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,307
I don't know. I don't
get scared by movies.

181
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,977
Yeah, because you haven't
seen <i>The Exorcist</i>.

182
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:45,480
No, 'cause you can
choose not being scared.

183
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:49,109
Okay. Little bet.
Race me to the top.

184
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,529
And if I beat you, you gotta
tell me what scares you.

185
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,950
- I love this.
- All right. I like the confidence.

186
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,786
Hang on, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Let me just... Hang on.

187
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,290
Oh, come on. Put
all that in here.

188
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,211
Are you gonna carry all my
stuff? Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

189
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:11,005
- [inhales sharply]
- You looking for pity?

190
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:13,091
[sighs] That's exactly
what I'm looking for.

191
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,135
Oh, my friend.

192
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:18,929
- You ready?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,056
And go!

Oh, my God. I love Monet.

[Cole] So you can just
choose not to be scared, huh?

203
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:16,987
When I was six,

204
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,866
my mom and I fled our country...

205
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,452
on a raft.

206
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,537
Oh, my God. That
must have been...

207
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,290
Worse than you can imagine.

208
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:33,964
The sun, the waves, sharks,
people screaming, crying.

209
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,674
I was terrified. Everyone was.

210
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:41,221
They wanted to go back, but...
[scoffs] ...my mom was so strong.

211
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,976
She kept us all
going for five days,

212
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,020
until we made it. [chuckles]

213
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:54,067
And I still remember how they
looked at her on the beach.

214
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:59,405
I just, you know,
wanted to be like her,

215
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,575
strong and brave.

216
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:07,414
So that's the day I decided I was
never going to be afraid ever again.

217
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,750
And I'm not.

218
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,673
I believe you.

219
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,427
But it is very cute that you're scared
of this movie with the little girl.

220
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:24,722
- Oh, my God. This is my own fault.
- That's... What's the name again?

221
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,348
- It's <i>The Exorcist</i>.
- I have to watch it now.

222
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:29,351
One of the scariest movies of all time.
You're gonna have nightmares for a month.

223
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,438
- Wow. [chuckles]
- Just watch.

224
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,901
This has just been incredible.

225
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:39,111
It was great. [sighs]

226
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,946
And not to be too forward,

227
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:44,366
but if you ever felt like
getting a drink sometime...

228
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,452
How about now?

229
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:48,079
Okay.

230
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:50,372

- What happened?

- No, no, no, no, no, n... No, no.
- I might have put your name down.

- Come on, Cole.
- Sadie. Sadie.

243
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:32,081
Sadie, I get nervous
singing in the shower.

244
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,582
- Just give it a go.
- I'm not a performer.

- Cole Turner.

- Where is Cole Turner?
- Please.

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,506
I can't.

248

Just call someone else.

people. It's quite a life.

just died. A coworker.

things you want in life...

hard to find someone who...

Right. Exactly.

- Just living their own lives.
- Yeah.

like, nourishing them.

Yeah, stuff like this. The stupid
gifts, the constant texting.

00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,375
[animals bleating]

344
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,960
Any word?

345
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,588
[grunts]

346
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:18,714
Maybe your phone's broken.

347
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:20,382
Yeah, maybe you should
do a hard reset.

348
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:22,760
[sighs] There's nothing
wrong with my phone.

349
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:24,970
Oh, no, no, no, I
meant with your life.

350
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,598
You know, grow a pair, move
out of your parents' house.

351
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,725
Guesthouse.

352
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,353
Well, I'm sure there's
a logical reason for it.

353
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:33,729
There is.

354
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,107
He came off way too
strong, so she ghosted him.

355
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:38,192
Ghosted?

356
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,736
Yeah. It's when someone
breaks off all contact.

357
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,822
For example, let's just say a
young lady makes a horrible,

358
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:45,241
horrible mistake one night,

359
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:48,827
and then the guy just keeps
on texting her with emojis,

360
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:50,537
over and over.

361
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,582
She did not ghost me, okay?

362
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,751
- Mmm. She did.
- You wanna pick this up?

363
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:56,961
- [breathes heavily]
- No.

364
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,757
Hey, pal, you're huffing and puffing.
Why don't you take a hit off your scuba?

365
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:03,635
Come on, hey. Let's go.

366
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:09,640
Oh, my God. [breathes deeply]

367
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:13,727
[chuckles] Sorry. You did the
leave-behind with your inhaler?

368
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:16,438
Come on. Isn't your
asthma sad enough already?

369
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,691
It wasn't a leave-behind.
I forgot it in her purse.

370
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:22,737
And it has one of those, uh, tiles on
it. Those tracking things that I use.

371
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:26,699
All right. Drumroll, please.

372
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,243
The woman of my dreams is in...

373
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,412
[signal pings]

374
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,413
- London.
- England?

375
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:35,541
- Oh, London, the Lady in the Mist.
- No one calls it that.

376
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,043
- The Gray Lady.
- No, that's <i>New York Times</i>.

377
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,296
- Are ya sure?
- Yes.

378
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:41,797
She does travel a lot for work.

379
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:43,632
Well, there you go.
That makes sense.

380
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,635
She probably got called away last minute
on this job and had to rush over there.

381
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:49,430
You know, international
calling plans and whatnot.

382
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,390
I bet she hasn't
even seen your texts.

383
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:53,726
Yeah, yeah, that
makes sense. Okay.

384
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,728
- Exactly.
- Okay, so this is fine?

385
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,229
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

386
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,232
Cole, you should go over there.

387
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:03,360
- What?
- Yeah, show up and surprise her.

388
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:06,572
It'd be a romantic gesture, something
we can tell our grandchildren.

389
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:10,075
Mom, you can't be serious.
Cole, going to London? No.

390
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:12,328
Why not? This is a
perfect opportunity

391
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:16,040
to get out there and
grab life by the horns.

392
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,321
She's gonna think you're psycho.

393
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:20,502
Or she'll think that
I'm the kind of guy

394
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:22,588
that's willing to jump on a
plane at a moment's notice.

395
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:25,174
Wait, but you're not that kind of
guy. You do not travel anywhere.

396
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:27,259
- You haven't even left the country.
- That's not true.

397
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,928
He was conceived in Ontario.

398
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,471
Cole, you can do this.

399
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:32,306
Yeah, but what about the
farm? There's so much to do.

400
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:35,476
- I can't just leave you here.
- Coleslaw, don't worry about the farm.

401
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:37,978
- [Mom] Yeah.
- By the horns. Come on.

402
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,272
Yeah, go to her.

403
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,358
Oh, you know what I have?

404
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,069
You remember that spring break
where I was supposed to go to Spain

405
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,862
and I gave up my seat
and I got a voucher?

406
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,739
That is my point exactly, Cole.

407
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,326
You missed spring break
to get a stupid voucher,

408
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:54,453
which you never used.

409
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:56,705
I mean, that is the
type of guy you are.

410
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:57,831
Not today.

411
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:01,418
- Oh, you still have... [laughs]
- Oh, I've got goose bumps.

412
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,045
Oh, thanks for the warning.

413
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:04,631
I'm going to London.

414
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:17,601
So it's not like a weird stalker thing.
It's just a grand romantic gesture.

415
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:20,980
Yeah, that is amazing, mate. I
mean, I admire your confidence.

416
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,900
5,000 miles to surprise a
girl who you've only met once.

417
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,860
I mean, that is the
epitome of romance, mate.

418
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,612
Yeah, exactly. See, you get it.

419
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:30,906
Especially if she's the
one who ghosted you.

420
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:33,617
I was... Wait, what? No,
no, she didn't ghost me.

421
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:35,661
She just doesn't have an
international calling plan.

422
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:37,454
Oh, right.

423
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:41,458
An international art curator, doesn't
have an overseas calling plan.

424
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,668
That's very unusual.

425
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,629
[stammers] Talking
of romantic gestures,

426
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,506
what's that you got
in the back then, hey?

427
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:49,550
- Is it a little cactus, is it?
- Oh, yeah.

428
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:53,470
Yeah, this is a little
inside joke between us.

429
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:56,600
Little cactus. I'm sure she'll
split her sides laughing.

430
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:04,691
Right, we are nearly
here. Tower Bridge.

431
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,240
That'll be 137 quid, please.

432
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,368
- That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's outrageous.

433
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,121
You never get a cab from the
airport to the center of London.

434
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,709
It'll cost you a small fortune,
mate. Yeah. Toodle-pip.

435
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,802
[crowd chattering]

436
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:36,223
[bar employee] Take care,
now. Thanks very much.

437
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:41,561
Have a good evening.
Have a good night.

438
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:09,839
[signal pings]

439
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,311
[signal pinging]

440
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:34,739
[signal pings]

441
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:54,676
[grunts]

442
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,728
[grunts]

443
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:12,861
[henchman] Let me tell you how this
will be. One for you, 19 for me.

444
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:16,072
'Cause I'm the taxman.

445
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:17,907
Listen to me.

446
00:28:17,908 --> 00:28:21,535
I can't believe I'm quoting
"The Taxman" to you.

447
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:25,748
So lame. I really am
turning into my dad.

448
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:27,249
It's true what they say.

449
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,421
When you meet a celebrity,
your IQ drops 50 points.

450
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:34,840
- Where am I?
- It's just... You're a living legend.

451
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:37,551
Stopping our shipment in Turkey,

452
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,304
the assassination in Berlin

453
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,932
and now this thing with
Elena and the passcode.

454
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:47,937
The boss talks about you all the time.
You've become an obsession for him.

455
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:52,066
"The Taxman killed Elena.
The Taxman has the passcode.

456
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:55,861
Oh, how I want to find
and murder the Taxman."

457
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:57,780
And now here you are.

458
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,407
No, no, I'm... I'm not
a taxman. I'm a farmer.

459
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:05,454
I came to London to surprise a girl,
and these guys, they jumped me.

460
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:06,830
Textbook evasion.

461
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:10,543
Frankly, a little disappointing,
but the performance?

462
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:11,752
Sublime.

463
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:13,921
It's like you truly
believe what you're saying.

464
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,297
Because I'm telling the truth.

465
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:17,508
You have the wrong guy.
My name is Cole Turner.

466
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:19,802
My passport's right over there
in the bag, in the front flap.

467
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:24,557
Sublime. It truly is an
honor to torture you today.

468
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,143
Whoa. Okay, just...
just wait. Wait.

469
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:30,646
Normally, I begin
with the punching.

470
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:32,940
Wait a minute. [groaning]

471
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:36,402
You see, it causes
me a little pain too.

472
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:39,655
- I'm all about sharing the experience.
- [panting]

473
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:42,241
My therapist says
that I'm an empath,

474
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:46,079
which means that I'm deeply
attuned to others' feelings.

475
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:52,585
But alas, the boss is in a
real tizzy about the passcode.

476
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,336
[panting]

477
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:58,507
Are you familiar with the
Schmidt sting pain index?

478
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:01,135
Wait, the what? Wait a minute.

479
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:06,558
It's a rating system for the pain caused
by the bites and stings of insects.

480
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,603
From the simple ouch
of the western honeybee

481
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:15,317
to the spray-and-pray of the
Latin American bullet ant

482
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:19,613
that you can see primed and
ready in that box on the table.

483
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,241
Spray-and-pray is short
for "spray in your pants

484
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:27,202
and pray for the merciful
release of death."

485
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:28,496
Excuse me, sir,

486
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,290
will you just grab that
bag for me quickly?

487
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,417
I promise, this is just
a big misunderstanding...

488
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:37,755
Normally, we like to start
slow and build our way up.

489
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:40,425
But you are special,

490
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:46,639
so we begin with
the murder hornet.

491
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,643
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

492
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:54,271
Unless, of course, you want
to reveal the passcode.

493
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,066
I don't know any passcode! I'm
telling you, you have the wrong guy.

494
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:58,192
My name is Cole Turner.

495
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,110
Just look at the passport.
It's right there in the bag.

496
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,698
That's just great. This
is going to be fun.

497
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:07,201
For me, not for you.

498
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:09,954
[pants] Holy shit. Holy
shit. Wait, wait... [blows]

499
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:14,417
Oh, God. Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! [screams]

500
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:17,087
- [gunfire]
- [grunts]

501
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,046
[grunting]

502
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:22,342
- You.
- [exhales sharply]

503
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:28,889
Can you walk?

504
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,517
- What?
- [sighs] Can you walk, Cole?

505
00:31:31,518 --> 00:31:33,979
[breathes heavily] Sadie.

506
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,314
[grunts]

507
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:41,986
Head down, mouth closed. Follow
me before anyone sounds the alarm.

- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But...

510
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:52,830
Shoot anyone who's not me.
Stay on my six. Let's go.

[exhales sharply]

512
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:59,337
Sadie. Geez. [grunts]

513
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,423
Sadie, what the hell is going
on? Who are these people?

514
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,174
Bad guys.

515
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:06,927
They set a trap for one of our
agents, and you fell into it.

516
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:09,346
Agents. Art agents?

517
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:11,140

- Down!

519
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:16,270
Not an art agent. Got it.

520
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:21,650
[grunts] Sorry, there's a lot going
on. Plus those guys drugged me.

521
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:24,737
- [shouts] Who are you?
- [pants]

522
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:28,283
CIA. At least, until they
find out about this fiasco.

523
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,619
Keep moving.

524
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:34,831
My God, you're a spy!

525
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,835

527

00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:58,188
No, it's... it's the most
amazing thing I've e...

532
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,942
[pants] I'm so confused. They
kept asking me about the Taxman.

533
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:06,445
- They asked you about the Taxman?
- No, they think I am a Taxman.

534
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,572
They think you're the Taxman?

535
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:10,908
That the Taxman would actually
fall for that lazy trap?

536
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:13,827
- They caught the Taxman, and it's you?

Art curator, my ass.

557
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:17,266
I thought you were different
too. Sweet, fun, low-maintenance.

558
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,853
I can't believe I was gonna
call you when I got back.

559
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,899
Cover me.

560
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,955

Were you really gonna
call me when you got back?

[pants] Yes, until you texted
me 11 times in two days.

565
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:56,431
- Seven. Emoji stuff doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

Have you done this before?

- [Cole] What?

00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:55,526
You stalkered your way
across the ocean to find me.

That is not cactus behavior!

Is that what you tell yourself?

You're a liar.

659

I'm not the liar here.

I told you things I've
never told anyone.

up too, didn't I?

Especially that sob story
about your coworker that died.

That was actually true.
Her name was Elena.

- It's not lies and more lies.

- Hey.

Fine, I lied about my job.

681
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,488
But you lied about who you are.

fudging a few details

Ugh, please.

685
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:24,665
Who apparently kills coworkers.

686
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:27,752
Oh, my God! She killed
innocent people, Cole!

687
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:32,007
Do you know what?
I am done with you.

688
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:35,468
Head down, shut your
mouth and follow my lead.

689
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:39,221
The sooner I get rid of you, the
sooner I get back to the mission.

690
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:40,389
Fine. You know what?

691
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,809
I just want to get away from you
and out of here as fast as possible.

692
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,728
You should.

693
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:48,397
'Cause I've tangled with these
guys before, and they are ruthless.

694
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:52,652
And now they think you're me, so
they're looking for you, Taxman.

695
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:06,041
I'll speak with Utami.
Buy us some time.

696
00:45:12,047 --> 00:45:13,048
[chuckles]

697
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:17,426
And the passcode?

698
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:20,179
Looks like Borislov
was too slow.

699
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,264
As usual.

700
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:25,434
But I finally know what
the Taxman looks like,

701
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:26,518
so I'll find him.

702
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,230
[person straining]

703
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:30,732
What is this?

704
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:33,860
[boss] He doesn't know anything.

705
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:42,077
We cannot afford
this kind of failure.

706
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:49,501
The game we play,
it's like no other.

707
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,299
If we succeed,

708
00:45:57,342 --> 00:46:00,303
we have wealth, power.

709
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:05,516
And if we fail, we die.

710
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:07,893
And that is only if
we're lucky. [chuckles]

711
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,020
No, please.

712
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,108
- Please... Please help me. [crying]
- No more mistakes.

713
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,361
No. [screams]

714
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:18,572
[groaning]

715
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:27,831
Get that photo to every bounty
hunter on the continent.

716
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,374
One million dollars. Alive.

717
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,751
He is our only
access to that code.

718
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:37,465
Anyone kills the Taxman, that
bounty moves onto their head.

719
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:45,015
[crowd chattering]

720
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:12,500
Be right back.

721
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:27,599
[chattering]

722
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:36,733
[camel grunting]

723
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:48,245
[horn honking]

724
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:57,837
Just like your farmers' market.

725
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:00,423
Come on.

726
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:05,470
Where are you taking me?

727
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:08,807
Back to your farm,
unless you screw this up.

728
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,060
Stay close.

729
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:27,242
Be cool.

730
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:30,412
[dance music playing]

731
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:39,170
[speaks Urdu]

732
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:41,631
[sighs]

733
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,430
- How you doing?
- [slide rack clicks]

734
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:52,392
What? Friendly isn't cool?

735
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:56,562
Well, well... [chuckling]
well, Sadie sunflower.

736
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:58,523
- Marco.
- Look at you.

737
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:00,567
[Sadie] Mmm.

738
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:05,322
Who's your friend?

739
00:49:06,031 --> 00:49:09,200
- I'm, uh...
- He's a civilian I just recovered.

740
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,286
Ah.

741
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,996
You look ravenous, mate.

742
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:16,916
Let me put something inside you.

743
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,585
Come on. Mmm.

744
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:21,170
[friend exclaims, speaks Urdu]

745
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:22,797
Sit down, sit down.
Come on, sit down.

746
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,968
Aye. The scrap out at the caves.
I should have known that was you.

747
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:30,764
It was the same people
that stole Aztec.

748
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:33,807
- What's Aztec?
- A biochemical weapon.

749
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:37,686
Very nasty. Deadly enough to
wipe out the Eastern Seaboard.

750
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:38,605
That's classified.

751
00:49:38,606 --> 00:49:39,940
They're going to sell it.

752
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,608
Thank you for filling me in.

753
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:45,653
And they're using those caves
with highly paid protection.

754
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:47,947
There's only one man
that can pull this off.

755
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,824
Leveque. Disgraced
French intelligence.

756
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:53,369
Played in this sandbox for
most of the war... [sighs]

757
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,998
and then he went into business for
himself. Arms deals, assassinations.

758
00:49:57,582 --> 00:50:00,252
If he's your target, be
careful. He's a dangerous man.

759
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:03,796
Anyway, mate, best
chaat in town.

760
00:50:03,797 --> 00:50:05,130
- Enjoy it.
- [Cole] Hmm.

761
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:09,177
This is yours, sunflower. Extra
spicy. Just how you like it.

762
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:11,096
[clears throat]

763
00:50:13,265 --> 00:50:17,810
So, are you two, um,
you know, a couple?

764
00:50:17,811 --> 00:50:19,103
- Yeah.
- No.

765
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:20,729
- [friend] Yes. Yeah.
- [Sadie] No.

766
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,857
- It was like five months.
- A long time.

767
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,151
You know, we had a lot in
common. You know, work. Not work.

768
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:27,444
Hey, Mahmoud. [laughs]

769
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:28,863
Got it. Subtle.

770
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,533
[Sadie chuckles] It's not that.

771
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:35,578
It's just that sometimes it's easier
to date someone in the same profession.

772
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:36,579
Always.

773
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:39,456
Although I wouldn't
call what we did dating.

774
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:40,791
Oh, please. Can we focus?

775
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:42,209
Well, that's
charming. Very cool.

776
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,753
- Okay.
- Very cool.

777
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:45,380
I need to find Aztec.

778
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,341
And I need your guys to get
Cole back safely to America.

779
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:52,387
- Who is he really?
- Nobody.

780
00:50:53,346 --> 00:50:54,389
He's a mistake.

781
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,432
I... You're the mistake.

782
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,058
She said she was an art curator.

783
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:00,395
- [laughs] Wait a second.
- [mouthing] Oh, my God.

784
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:02,354
You said... What?

785
00:51:02,355 --> 00:51:04,815
Is he your boyfriend? [laughs]

786
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:05,734
He's very funny.

787
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:07,192
Oh, you poor bastard.

788
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:09,737
You thought you met a hottie,
right? Not a Mata Hari.

789
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:12,156
But, hey, at least the no
pants dance was worth it.

790
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:14,450
- Oh, God.
- No, it wasn't.

791
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:15,576
Oh, come on. It wa...

792
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,494
Oh, come on. It
was. It was for me.

793
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:18,747
And I lost a hand.

794
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:20,247
Lost it.

795
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,042
- Wait. You lo...
- Yeah, gone. It's fake.

796
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:24,460
- Touch it.
- That's because of Sadie?

797
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:27,504
- Yeah. You can touch it.
- No. I... I'm... I'm okay. How?

798
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:28,881
When Sadie and I were together,

799
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:31,342
we took a little romantic
getaway to Myanmar.

800
00:51:31,343 --> 00:51:33,302
Uh, no. It was a mission.

801
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:34,762
There were many positions.

802
00:51:34,763 --> 00:51:37,556
Don't know if you remember,
but anyway. Things went south.

803
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:40,601
I got captured, and, uh,
Sadie took right off.

804
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:43,938
Turns out that's exactly what
the secret police did to me.

805
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:46,398
- Oh, my God.
- [Marco] Yeah, don't worry about it, man.

806
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:48,902
You got two hands,
right, but only one life.

807
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:53,657
You know what I miss
most, mate? Guess.

808
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,373
- Yeah.
- [Marco] I used to do that all the time.

809
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:03,750
Can't do it anymore, can I?

810
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:07,711
Sorry. You left your boyfriend
to get his hand cut off.

811
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:09,756
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

812
00:52:10,465 --> 00:52:12,800
I'd have done the
same. Mission over man.

813
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,343
Right, sunflower?

814
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:17,221
Surrounded by lunatics.
Wait a minute.

815
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:20,015
Did you come back to
save me or get Aztec?

816
00:52:20,016 --> 00:52:21,141
Ooh.

817
00:52:21,142 --> 00:52:22,935
You were a secondary objective.

818
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:26,564
- Oh, my God.
- High-priority secondary, I'm sure.

819
00:52:26,565 --> 00:52:28,691
And look at you now,
brother. Thriving.

820
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:31,026
Every word you're saying
is making it worse.

821
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:33,195
- Every word. I know you're trying. Just...
- Marco.

822
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:34,780
- This guy.
- Hey.

823
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:37,866
Are you gonna take
him back home or not?

824
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:38,785
Oh.

825
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:39,827
Please say yes.

826
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:43,999
I'd really hate it if one of my limbs
comes between Sadie and a clean exit.

827
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:48,961
Sure. Sadie survivors have to
look after each other, right?

828
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,045
[Sadie] Thank you.

829
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:51,547
Honestly, thank you so much.

830
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:52,715
You're welcome, babe. Kiss?

831
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:53,800
No.

832
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:56,093
No.

833
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:57,345
Goodbye, Cole.

834
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:01,850
I'm glad that you survived.

835
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:09,189
Um, I just wanna be very clear.

836
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,067
Do not ever contact me again.

837
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:14,821
- Okay?
- With pleasure.

838
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:17,489
- I've already forgotten your name.
- [laughs]

839
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,659
Which I'm sure by the
way is fake anyway, so...

840
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:24,121
[scoffs]

841
00:53:24,122 --> 00:53:26,374
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

842
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:30,002
She went for a normie, but
that's just lying to herself.

843
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:31,462
- Yeah.
- Anyway, cheer up, mate.

844
00:53:31,463 --> 00:53:34,506
Stop staring at her. Stop
crying. You're safe now. Come on.

845
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,383
We got a cheeky
bottle-o in the back.

846
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:38,928
On the piss, you and me
get drunk, get smashed.

847
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:40,054
Alcohol in your mouth.

848
00:53:40,055 --> 00:53:42,598
This is my town. Nothing happens here
that I don't see coming a mile away.

849
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,059
- [gunshot]
- [people clamoring]

850
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,978
Everything but that I guess.

851
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:54,110
Walk. Both of you.

852
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,074
- Sorry about Marco.
- Stop talking before you get us killed.

853
00:54:00,075 --> 00:54:02,159
[bounty hunter] Don't
worry. They want him alive.

854
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,204
I don't know what your deal is, but
I'm sure they'll pay for you too.

855
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:08,458
- Oh, they definitely will.
- Cole, shut up. Just...

856
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:10,501
- I'm trying to keep you alive.
- [scoffs]

857
00:54:10,502 --> 00:54:12,211
Would you rather I say
they wouldn't pay for you?

858
00:54:12,212 --> 00:54:14,046
This is so cute. Get a room.

859
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:16,550
If it means anything,
he's not the Taxman.

860
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:20,010
Yeah, and I'm not
the Grandson of Sam.

861
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:23,723
Huh? Like the Son of Sam, the
serial killer, but next gen.

862
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:25,933
I'm the best bounty
hunter alive.

863
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,017
- [grunts]
- Ooh.

864
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:28,394
[gunshots]

865
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:30,188
- Ooh.
- [people clamoring]

866
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:32,399
Second best.

867
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:34,359
That was very impressive.

868
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:40,073
- Shall we?
- Yep, yep. Yep.

869
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:43,951
You disappointed me,
Taxman. That was too easy.

870
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:46,120
Now your lady friend's
gonna die 'cause of you.

871
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,789
That's funny. Usually
the other way around.

872
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,291
It was you who
followed me to Europe.

873
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:51,917
Lured by your lying.

874
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:53,711
God, you two need to get a room.

875
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:56,130
We did. That's what
got us into this mess.

876
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:57,507
Okay, get in the car.

877
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,929
Lady drives. Taxman,
you're riding middle.

878
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:07,475
Scooch, scooch.

879
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:11,228
Well, Taxman it up.

880
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:12,856
Don't use Taxman as a verb.

881
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:16,568
You mind telling us who you are?

882
00:55:17,986 --> 00:55:20,195
- They call me the Leopard.
- [groans]

883
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,322
- [neck cracks]
- [gasps] Oh!

884
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:22,865
Oh, my God.

885
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:24,450
[bounty hunter 3]
Called him the Leopard.

886
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,786
But even leopards
get killed by lions,

887
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:30,331
hyenas, lightning.

888
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:31,749
[breathing heavily]

889
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,792
Get him out.

890
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:37,047
[straining]

891
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,757
And drive.

892
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:41,051
[door closes]

893
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:46,306
[Cole] And who are you?

894
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:51,770
God. The Bounty Hunter.

895
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:55,731
Wow. You guys have really
good names in your world.

896
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:59,236
It's like the WWE, but scarier.

897
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:07,118
One twist of this ring will send
50,000 volts through your sorry ass.

898
00:56:08,411 --> 00:56:11,372
- Make you wish you were dead. [chuckles]
- Too late.

899
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:13,999
This is great.
Thank you for this.

900
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,293
- Huh?
- No, I was just thinking how happy I am

901
00:56:16,294 --> 00:56:18,837
to have an electrified hockey
puck stuck to my neck with what,

902
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:21,006
- 50,000 volts ready to go into...
- [Sadie] I can't take this.

903
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,675
- Volts into my...
- You really need to shut up.

904
00:56:22,676 --> 00:56:23,593
- Wow.
- [Cole sighs]

905
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:25,554
You two should get a room.

906
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,889
[God] You know what? Stop.

907
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,140
Pull over here.

908
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:31,268
My car is better.

909
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,820
Look, I don't mean to
shake your confidence, God,

910
00:56:42,821 --> 00:56:44,446
but the last two
guys didn't make it.

911
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:45,949
My confidence doesn't shake.

912
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:50,120
I spent years conditioning
myself to attuning my sense...

913
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,914
[people screaming, clamoring]

914
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:55,583
[groans]

915
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:59,087
Got you, suckers. [grunts]

916
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:03,925
[groaning]

917
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:10,765
[grunting]

918
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:15,520
If you're collecting the bounty,
where are they taking delivery?

919
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:18,189
[groans]

920
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:27,448
Listen, I'll stash
you someplace safe.

921
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:30,826
If I don't come back for
you, an extraction team will.

922
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:34,455
So you're really gonna raid a plane
full of armed goons by yourself?

923
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:37,834
I have to find Aztec.
It's my only play.

924
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:39,878
Wow. [sighs]

925
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:49,762
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Marco.

926
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:51,389
Ugh. God. Seriously?

927
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:55,559
You know, I'm trying to connect
about a person that just died.

928
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,269
Someone you knew well.

929
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,563
Are you capable of that, or
is that only on first dates?

930
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:03,359
The rest of the time, it's just
chemical weapons and passcodes

931
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,860
and bullets and death.

932
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,655
Wait, what passcodes? W-What
do you mean about passcodes?

933
00:58:07,656 --> 00:58:12,451
The bug guy in the cave kept
asking me about passcodes.

934
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:14,537
- [brakes screeching]
- Jesus!

935
00:58:16,164 --> 00:58:18,540
- He thinks I have the passcode?
- Yeah.

936
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,209
And you're telling me this now?

937
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:21,502
Oh, I'm sorry.

938
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:24,088
I was slightly drugged
and kidnapped at the time.

939
00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:25,006
Unbelievable.

940
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:27,716
Also, in case you
forgot, I'm a farmer.

941
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:29,468
I'm not a super spy.

942
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:33,013
Why didn't you just ask me what the
torturer was torturing me about?

943
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:34,390
You are unbelievable!

944
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:36,183
- What? What?
- [breathes deeply]

945
00:58:36,184 --> 00:58:37,977
What are the passcodes?

946
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:40,897
The least you could do is tell
me what I almost died for.

947
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:48,612
Aztec is inside a high-security case
that cannot be opened without a passcode.

948
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:51,031
Elena figured out
the DNA encryption.

949
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:52,408
What do you mean,
DNA encryption?

950
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,995
The passcode is the entire genetic
sequence of a living organism.

951
00:58:55,996 --> 00:58:58,747
- Insanely long and unique.
- Wow.

952
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:01,333
I got to Elena before she
could upload it to Leveque.

953
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,085
So they think you
have the passcode?

954
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:06,047
But I don't because
she destroyed it.

955
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:10,217
But if Leveque is trying
to get it from me,

956
00:59:10,218 --> 00:59:12,178
that means he doesn't
have it either.

957
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:15,180
Which means he can't hand the
weapon over to his buyers.

958
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:17,683
- Which means...
- He still has Aztec.

959
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,060
Which means change of plans.

960
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,395
Do you trust me?

961
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,231
Is that a fucking joke?

962
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:25,316
Thank you for your honesty.

And then suddenly,
I got clarity.

986
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,247
I had given them everything

987
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:05,709

01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:15,338
[imitates explosion]

1030
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:18,591
everyone on board dies.

1031
01:03:18,592 --> 01:03:19,843
No pressure.

1032
01:03:21,303 --> 01:03:22,304
Yes, sir.

1033
01:03:37,402 --> 01:03:39,738
We're looking for
a genetic sequence.

1034
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,240
Do you know what
"genetic" means?

1035
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:47,370
[shouts, groans]

1036
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:52,459
That's a cactus.

1037
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:56,796
Thirsty?

1038
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:09,808
- [softly] Be smart.
- [softly] Sociopath.

1039
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:11,518
I'm not a sociopath.

1040
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,855
You know who says that
a lot? Sociopaths.

1041
01:04:19,444 --> 01:04:23,447
I have dated some crazies in my
day, but you are certifiable.

1042
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:25,783
This is bigger than you and me.

1043
01:04:25,784 --> 01:04:28,078
- [sighs]
- And my plan worked.

1044
01:04:28,787 --> 01:04:29,787
Better than I imagined.

1045
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:30,872
Oh, really?

1046
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:33,415
Did you imagine I'd make
it out of this alive?

1047
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,876
We found Aztec.

1048
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:36,920
[sighs]

1049
01:04:39,256 --> 01:04:41,800
As soon as we land, we'll
take these guys down.

1050
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:43,634
We'll be safe.

1051
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:45,929
The world will be
safe. Everybody wins.

1052

[Cole grunts]

1053
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:55,354
What's all this?

1054
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:56,439
What's...

1055
01:04:58,358 --> 01:04:59,359
all this?

1056
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:01,903
Hmm?

1057
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:08,660
I would expect more discretion

1058
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:11,204
from the Taxman.

1059
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:13,248
So would I.

1060
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,418
[boss] So what are you really?

1061
01:05:17,377 --> 01:05:18,753
Hired help?

1062
01:05:19,921 --> 01:05:20,755
Or just the girlfriend?

1063
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:23,048
Oh, believe me, she's
not girlfriend material.

1064
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:24,175
You know, I don't care.

1065
01:05:25,385 --> 01:05:27,012
[smacks lips] You
die either way.

1066
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:29,890
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait. Wait.

1067
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:32,683
Who's the idiot now? Hmm?

1068
01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:34,102
I have the passcode.

1069
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:36,479
[chuckles] Bullshit.

1070
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:38,940
He doesn't have it.

1071
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:40,525
I do.

1072
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:43,028
Oh, really?

1073
01:05:43,862 --> 01:05:44,946
So we can kill him.

1074
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:48,949
Hey! Wait. Okay. Wait.

1075
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,869
The passcode. Now!

1076
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,456
Sure. It's in my pocket.

1077
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,085
[boss] We're good.

1078
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:06,842
Really?

1079
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:07,928
Open it.

1080
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,102
[boss sighs]

[Sadie, henchmen grunting]

1084
01:06:45,382 --> 01:06:48,050
I can't believe you took a picture
of me while I was sleeping!

1085
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:49,510
Not of you, of us!

1086
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:50,971
I knew you were a creep!

1087

[all grunting]

1088
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:56,267
[pants] I'm not a creep!

1089

- You know who says that a lot? Creeps!

- [groans]
- Whoa. Let me see.

1100

- Let me see. Let me see.
- [groans]

1101
01:08:09,925 --> 01:08:11,175
Oh, my God.

1102
01:08:11,176 --> 01:08:14,553
Take the case and go.
[breathing heavily]

1103
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:17,097
- There is a parachute. [breathing heavily]
- What about you?

1104
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:18,849
Mission over man.

1105
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:22,102
No. No. I gotta stop this bleeding
first. You're losing a lot of blood.

1106
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:23,229
- Just go, Cole.
- I gotta find...

1107
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,064
- Cole, go! Go!
- Sadie, I'm telling you right...

01:08:25,065 --> 01:08:26,941
[Sadie breathes heavily]

1109
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:28,067
Get out of here.

1110
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:36,243
Hey!

[boss] Get out of
the way, you idiot.

1114

- [pants, exhales heavily]
- What are you doing?

1115
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:50,673
I have no idea.

1123
01:09:28,545 --> 01:09:29,713

1125
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:33,674
I did.

1126
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:35,552
I just took you with me.

1127
01:09:36,136 --> 01:09:37,261
How long was I out?

1128
01:09:37,262 --> 01:09:39,306
A while. [sighs]

1129
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:42,601
[Sadie] Looks like you got
creative with the parachute.

1130
01:09:44,477 --> 01:09:45,686
I had a lot of nervous energy.

1131
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:46,771
[Sadie sighs]

1132
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:49,732
[sighs]

1133
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:54,279
You got it.

1134
01:09:54,946 --> 01:09:56,031
Yeah. Yeah.

1135
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:57,781
You got it.

1136
01:09:57,782 --> 01:09:59,783
- You got Aztec.
- Yeah.

1137
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:01,410
[breathing heavily]

1138
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:03,162
- Wait. Take it easy.
- I mean, do you have a...

1139
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,705
You lost a lot of blood.

[breathes deeply]

1141
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:08,209
It was really gross.

[breathes deeply]

1143
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:12,088
I'm sorry. I... I... I
don't know what to say.

1144
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:14,799
Thank you.

1145
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,551
You're welcome.

01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,822
Pardon me. Excuse
me. [clears throat]

01:10:38,823 --> 01:10:40,283
Pardon. [clears throat]

1152
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:42,243
Hello?

1153
01:10:42,244 --> 01:10:44,120
[boss] <i>Leveque, things
didn't go as planned.</i>

1154

The girl sprung the Taxman.

1155
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:49,833
How many times can
you lose one man? Hmm?

1156
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:51,252
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

1157
01:10:51,253 --> 01:10:54,421
If we do not deliver an
operational weapon in 48 hours,

1158
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:55,924
our buyers will kill us all.

1159
01:10:56,716 --> 01:10:58,343
Now, you find the Taxman,

1160
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:03,390
or they will not have the chance
because I will kill you myself.

1161
01:11:07,102 --> 01:11:09,396
[henchman] Boss. We have a
sighting of the parachute.

1162
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:12,399
Good.

1163
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:14,858
[device beeps]

1164
01:11:16,987 --> 01:11:18,989
[device chimes, beeping]

1165
01:11:22,576 --> 01:11:25,370
[Cole] You know, I think,
depending on your strength,

1166
01:11:26,204 --> 01:11:28,415
we should consider maybe
hiking out of here tomorrow.

1167
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:31,792
- Depending on your strength.
- [chuckles]

1168
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:32,961
[Sadie chuckles]

1169
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:37,298
You have to tell me. What
is this gunk? [laughs]

1170
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:39,717
It's periwinkle and gavilana.

1171
01:11:39,718 --> 01:11:42,303
I found it up the beach, smashed
it up and put it in there

1172
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:44,806
to stop the bleeding
and fight the infection.

1173
01:11:45,473 --> 01:11:48,101
- How did you know how to do that?
- I read about it.

1174
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:52,772
Throughout history, every culture has
their own knowledge of the crops they grow

1175
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:55,775
for food or clothing, medicine.

1176
01:11:57,444 --> 01:12:00,572
I just don't get why you
never left the country.

1177
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:03,073
- Here we go.
- What? I'm serious.

1178
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:05,159
You're clearly
interested in the world.

1179
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,247
I wanted to travel. I really did. I
thought I was gonna after I graduated.

1180
01:12:10,248 --> 01:12:12,667
You know, research the book.
Then my dad got hurt...

1181
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:16,796
just went home.

1182
01:12:18,632 --> 01:12:19,925
He never recovered?

1183
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:22,384
No, he did. He's good now.

1184
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:24,762
But you know, he's getting old.

1185
01:12:24,763 --> 01:12:27,890
And you know, we got to keep
production high to compete,

1186
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:29,808
and business is changing.

1187
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:30,894
Anyway...

1188
01:12:32,562 --> 01:12:33,605
They need me there.

1189
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:35,690
Do they?

1190
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:42,696
What about you? Your
mom must be proud.

1191
01:12:42,697 --> 01:12:45,533
Daughter's a CIA agent. Right?

1192
01:12:47,994 --> 01:12:49,371
I'd like to think she'd be.

1193
01:12:52,707 --> 01:12:54,625
My mom died when
I was very young.

1194
01:12:54,626 --> 01:12:58,212
- [groans] God, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's okay.

1195
01:12:58,213 --> 01:13:01,341
I promise it's... It
happened so long ago.

1196
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:06,054
You know, and then after she died
I... I found the... the army.

1197
01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:10,433
You know, somewhere where
I could put my focus.

1198
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:14,688
And then the agency,
they gave me purpose.

1199
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:21,319
Our struggles make us
stronger. [chuckles] Right?

1200
01:13:23,446 --> 01:13:24,614
Any other family?

1201
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:29,452
In my line of work,
it's better being alone.

1202
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:31,830
Is it?

1203
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:40,797
For what it's worth, I think that
any parent would be very proud...

1204
01:13:42,215 --> 01:13:43,383
of you.

1205
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,596
[Sadie] You know what?

1206
01:13:48,597 --> 01:13:52,641
I just can't believe that that little
shit is still in one piece. [chuckles]

1207
01:13:52,642 --> 01:13:55,770
[chuckles] Maybe you can keep
a cactus alive after all.

1208
01:13:57,022 --> 01:13:58,023
Maybe.

1209
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:10,785
I'm sorry about the selfie.

1210
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:13,120
I'm sorry about the gag.

1211
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:14,580
Call it even?

1212
01:14:14,581 --> 01:14:15,665
Deal.

1213
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,540
[vehicles approaching]

1214
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:00,752
Run!

1215
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:06,883
Get me the Taxman alive, kill
the girl, and I'll get Aztec.

1216
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:12,514
[gunfire]

1217
01:15:18,645 --> 01:15:19,771
[henchman] Move! Move!

1218
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:22,856
[boss] There she is.

1219
01:15:22,857 --> 01:15:25,026
[henchmen shouting]

1220
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:31,115
- [henchman grunts]
- [mechanical whirring]

1221
01:15:31,116 --> 01:15:32,116
[pants]

1222
01:15:32,117 --> 01:15:34,785
[marine 1] <i>Attention. This
is the United States Marines.</i>

1223
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:38,248
<i>Safety your weapons and
drop them on the ground.</i>

1224
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:41,709
[groans]

1225
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:43,420
[boss grunts]

1226
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:50,593
[grunts]

1227
01:15:50,594 --> 01:15:51,594
[Sadie pants]

1228
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:55,682
Damn it.

1229
01:16:06,902 --> 01:16:08,987
[mechanical whirring]

1230
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:14,993
[twig snaps]

1231
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:21,333
[all grunting, groaning]

1232
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,334
- [neck cracks]
- [thudding]

1233
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:26,004
- [Sadie panting]
- Where's the case? [pants]

1234
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,970
Agent Rhodes. It's
time to go home.

1235
01:16:35,722 --> 01:16:37,641
We're fine. Thanks.

1236
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:40,352
Let's go.

1237
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:51,487
- That's not too tight on you now, is it?
- [Cole] No.

1238
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:53,322
Okay. Just wanna make sure.

1239
01:16:53,323 --> 01:16:55,075
- Mmm. Yeah, that's good.
- [door closes]

1240
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,494
[Sadie] A polygraph, Jackson?

1241
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,289
Are you really this desperate
to jump ahead of me?

1242
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,917
I'm just doing my job, Rhodes.

1243
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:08,379
No, if you were doing your job,
you'd be out there looking for Aztec.

1244
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,422
If you had done yours, we
never would have lost it.

1245
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:13,510
Well, it wasn't her fault. She
was just trying to save me.

1246
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:17,430
Of course.

1247
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,933
The boyfriend, accidentally
along for the ride.

1248
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:23,477
Didn't it ever occur to you that
he could be a foreign asset,

1249
01:17:23,478 --> 01:17:24,838
trying to compromise
your mission?

1250
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:31,151
Oh, yeah. Six-foot honeypot sent to kiss
and nibble the secrets right out of you.

1251
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:33,654
Patti, just watch
the machine, please.

1252
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:35,489
Right. Sorry.

1253
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:40,202
We both know you checked him out.
He's a civilian, and he's clean.

1254
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:41,287
[machine beeps]

1255
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:42,788
[Jackson] Some civilian.

1256
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:47,626
Because you chose his life over
thousands, if Aztec is ever deployed.

1257
01:17:47,627 --> 01:17:50,088
I let my emotions
cloud my judgment.

1258
01:17:51,631 --> 01:17:52,924
[smacks lips] Wait a minute.

1259
01:17:55,886 --> 01:18:00,098
Are you saying you think it
was a mistake to save my life?

1260
01:18:02,976 --> 01:18:04,351
- Yes.
- [gasps]

1261
01:18:04,352 --> 01:18:05,520
[erratic scraping, beep]

1262
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:10,025
[sighs]

1263
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:11,776
That's great.

1264
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:14,279
That's great.

1265
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:18,824
Cole, I'm sorry, but they're right.
One life compared to thousands.

1266
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:21,577
Yeah, no, I get it. Mission
over man justifies everything.

1267
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:23,996
Marco's hand, using me
as bait at the airstrip.

1268
01:18:23,997 --> 01:18:25,623
- I get it.
- You used him as bait?

1269
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:26,541
- Yes.
- No.

1270
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,000
- Well...
- [mixed electronic tones]

1271
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,753
Marco was right about you. You
should date someone just like him.

1272
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:33,297
Completely cut off from
emotional connection

1273
01:18:33,298 --> 01:18:34,858
- and not afraid to lose a limb.
- What?

1274
01:18:35,383 --> 01:18:37,802
You know what? Marco was
right, but not about that.

1275
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:42,348
We only have one life, and
you are too afraid to live it.

1276
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:43,641
Says the one-handed dead guy.

1277
01:18:43,642 --> 01:18:44,767
- What's happening?
- [shushes]

1278
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:46,936
Cole, you went to your
parents' house to help them.

1279
01:18:46,937 --> 01:18:48,938
But I don't think
they need you anymore.

1280
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,023
I think they're just an
excuse to avoid life.

1281
01:18:51,024 --> 01:18:52,233
Look who's talking.

1282
01:18:52,234 --> 01:18:56,904
Your job, the duty, the sacrifice,
that's your excuse to keep people out.

1283
01:18:56,905 --> 01:18:58,614
I think you're afraid
to get close to people.

1284
01:18:58,615 --> 01:18:59,990
'Cause if you do,
you might lose them.

1285
01:18:59,991 --> 01:19:01,551
- Just like you lost your mother.
- Hey!

1286
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,871
You don't talk about her!

1287
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:06,456
[sighs]

1288
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:10,794
And I'm not afraid of anything.

1289
01:19:13,255 --> 01:19:16,173
- You two need to get a room.
- [Sadie] Ugh.

1290
01:19:16,174 --> 01:19:17,424
- Oh, my God.
- Patti,

1291
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:18,842
he's not even hooked
up to the machine.

1292
01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:22,680
I'm sorry. But, you guys, the sexual
tension in the room is just...

1293
01:19:22,681 --> 01:19:24,015
The boss wants to see you.

1294
01:19:31,856 --> 01:19:33,817
So much for starting
with a houseplant.

1295
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,863
[Jackson] I know she
pulled you into this...

1296
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:42,241
but...

1297
01:19:44,995 --> 01:19:46,246
you're still in deep shit.

1298
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:48,455
You're facing prosecution.

1299
01:19:48,456 --> 01:19:51,041
For what? Visiting
a girl in London?

1300
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,376
Why are you protecting her?

1301
01:19:52,377 --> 01:19:56,005
I know this looks
bad. I can fix it.

1302
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:57,464
We can still get Leveque.

1303
01:19:57,465 --> 01:20:00,342
You were always my
favorite, Sadie.

1304
01:20:00,343 --> 01:20:03,430
But you going rogue,
there's nothing I can do.

1305
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:04,931
What do you mean?

1306
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:07,433
- She didn't lose Aztec, did she?
- [chuckles]

1307
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:09,852
No, no, no, no, no.
She's working an angle.

1308
01:20:09,853 --> 01:20:11,646
- No. No.
- Looking to cash in.

1309
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:14,983
Sadie would never do that.

1310
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,487
[Dr. Yates] You let Aztec get
into the hands of a known threat.

1311
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:22,823
You're suspended, pending
a full investigation,

1312
01:20:22,824 --> 01:20:24,742
but you know how
these things go.

1313
01:20:24,743 --> 01:20:27,954
You'll be lucky to have a
job at all when it's done.

1314
01:20:29,205 --> 01:20:30,206
[Sadie exhales sharply]

1315
01:20:30,707 --> 01:20:32,458
Look at what she does.

1316
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:34,293
And this is just
the last six months.

1317
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:36,630
She's a liar and a killer, Cole.

1318
01:20:37,464 --> 01:20:38,965
Is that someone you
want to protect?

1319
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:40,592
Hmm?

1320
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:42,844
Take home to Mom?

1321
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:50,018
Oh, my God.

1322
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:56,690
[Dr. Yates] What am I
looking at? A houseplant?

1323
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:59,902
Well, it's not a houseplant.
That's an amaranth. A crop.

1324
01:20:59,903 --> 01:21:01,862
[electronic beeping]

1325
01:21:01,863 --> 01:21:05,115
Farmed in the Americas for
thousands of years, mostly for food,

1326
01:21:05,116 --> 01:21:08,495
but often used in
rituals by the Aztecs.

1327
01:21:09,663 --> 01:21:14,583
Oh, my God. The plant wasn't hers. She
took it from Horvath, the scientist.

1328
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:17,671
He was obsessed with the
Aztecs' use of human sacrifice.

1329
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:21,590
The genetic sequence of that
amaranth is the passcode.

1330
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:23,133
[clicks tongue] I'll be damned.

1331
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:26,304
I want that plant retrieved
from Elena's apartment now.

1332
01:21:27,138 --> 01:21:30,808
You know, we can use this to lure
in Leveque. We get a message to him.

1333
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:33,769
"The Taxman is ready
to sell the passcode."

1334
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:34,895
He'll never go for it.

1335
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:36,940
Unless we bait the hook.

1336
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:40,693
The passcode is divided
into four segments.

1337
01:21:40,694 --> 01:21:42,111
Send Leveque the first.

1338
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:45,614
What? Give him part of
the key? That's insane.

1339
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:48,702
Exactly. The agency
would never allow it.

1340
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:53,873
So if the Taxman is doing it, that means
he went rogue and the offer is real.

1341
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,502
Leveque is desperate.
He'll bite.

1342
01:22:00,213 --> 01:22:03,717
That means we're
gonna need the Taxman.

1343
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:11,307
Me? [chuckles] No, no, no way.

1344
01:22:11,308 --> 01:22:13,642
It's only for appearances.
He won't even get near you.

1345
01:22:13,643 --> 01:22:17,354
Well, then what do you need me for?
Use a dummy. Put Jackson in a disguise.

1346
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:18,606
That's a great idea.

1347
01:22:18,607 --> 01:22:22,568
Mr. Turner, I know you don't want to
do this, but I also know that you will.

1348
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,988
As long as Leveque thinks you're
the Taxman, you're in danger.

1349
01:22:25,989 --> 01:22:29,825
Well, then put me in protective custody.
Hide me just until you find the guy.

1350
01:22:29,826 --> 01:22:31,244
What about your family?

1351
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:36,416
- What about my family?
- Guys like Leveque, they never stop.

1352
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,543
The only way to guarantee
your family's safety

1353
01:22:39,544 --> 01:22:41,171
is to take him off the board.

1354
01:22:43,048 --> 01:22:44,048
[Cole sighs]

1355
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:45,675
No, no, no.

1356
01:22:46,259 --> 01:22:50,597
Hey, Cole. Cole,
it's too dangerous.

1357
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:53,058
They're using you.

1358
01:22:53,725 --> 01:22:56,602
Well, that's funny because he just
said the same thing about you.

1359
01:22:56,603 --> 01:22:59,563
Remind me, which one of you
can't stop risking my life?

1360
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:02,901
I know you're angry,
but this is a mistake.

1361
01:23:04,152 --> 01:23:06,529
Protecting the people you
love is never a mistake.

1362
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:11,034
Maybe one day you'll care enough
about someone to understand that.

1363
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:14,871
Rhodes.

1364
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,459
[Sadie sighs]

1365
01:23:23,255 --> 01:23:25,215
Come on, you have
to let me run this.

1366
01:23:25,799 --> 01:23:27,883
I know more about Leveque's
operation than anyone.

1367
01:23:27,884 --> 01:23:30,720
Go home, Sadie. And stay there.

1368
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:37,852

1370
01:23:49,197 --> 01:23:50,197
[boss] What do you think?

1371
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:52,533
What do I think? I
think it is a trap.

1372
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,326
[classical music playing]

1373
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:55,412
Test it.

1374
01:24:09,426 --> 01:24:10,593
[electronic tone]

1375
01:24:10,594 --> 01:24:11,678
It's genuine.

1376
01:24:13,388 --> 01:24:14,513
Maybe it's not a trap.

1377
01:24:14,514 --> 01:24:19,436
Or maybe it is just a very good one.
Either way, what choice do we have?

1378
01:24:20,228 --> 01:24:21,229
[henchman] Boss.

1379
01:24:25,609 --> 01:24:29,028
Mr. Utami. Pleasure
to see you again.

1380
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:31,447
Funny. When you accepted
my first payment,

1381
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:33,991
you neglected to mention that
you didn't have the passcode.

1382
01:24:33,992 --> 01:24:38,121
We will have it soon. Aztec
will be yours as promised.

1383
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:45,712
[clears throat]

1384
01:24:47,172 --> 01:24:48,298
Mine, I believe.

1385
01:24:50,258 --> 01:24:51,551
You're meeting the Taxman?

1386
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,137
- Uh...
- We'll go together.

1387
01:24:55,847 --> 01:25:01,645
If he has the passcode, we conclude our
business. If he doesn't, I kill you.

1388
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:12,864
Uh, Mr. Utami, one condition.

1389
01:25:13,865 --> 01:25:16,493
Whatever happens,
the Taxman dies.

1390
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:18,578
So be it.

1391
01:25:58,702 --> 01:26:00,744
[Jackson] <i>Turner, get in
there and make it look good.</i>

1392

out in 20 minutes.</i>

[radio static]

1394
01:26:07,711 --> 01:26:10,963
Stop messing with your collar. Sounds
like a goddamn thunderstorm in here.

1395
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:13,842
Sorry, I hate suits.

1396
01:26:26,021 --> 01:26:27,564
[exhales heavily]

1397
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:31,693
- How many guys do you have?
- Including me? Three.

1398
01:26:32,944 --> 01:26:36,113
Three? What do you... What do you
mean? Three... Three guys total?

1399
01:26:36,114 --> 01:26:38,324
You have three guys total? You
can't do this with three guys.

1400
01:26:38,325 --> 01:26:41,869
The CIA can't operate on US
soil. We had to travel light.

1401
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:46,081
Travel light? What are you,
backpacking through Europe?

1402
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:49,376
You're the CIA. What does
that even mean? Travel light?

1403
01:26:49,377 --> 01:26:52,671
[Jackson] <i>Calm down. Leveque's
men just need to see you in there.</i>

1404
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,423
<i>We'll arrest him as
soon as he shows.</i>

1405
01:26:54,424 --> 01:26:55,841
You got to play the part.

1406
01:26:55,842 --> 01:27:00,429
<i>You're not a farmer anymore. Remember?
You're the Taxman. Now, get in there.</i>

1408
01:27:12,984 --> 01:27:14,318
Hi, welcome in.

1409
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:15,903
[Cole] Table for Mr. Taxman.

1410
01:27:15,904 --> 01:27:17,280
Yes, right this way.

1411
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,995
[diners chattering]

1412
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:35,799
[all] Cheers!

1413
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,109
[Jackson] <i>Everything will be fine.
We've got it all under control,</i>

1414
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:57,027
and the bad guys will
never get near you.

1415
01:27:57,028 --> 01:28:00,407
Three guys. [sighs]

1416
01:28:14,129 --> 01:28:15,672
[electronic beeps]

1417
01:28:16,715 --> 01:28:18,008
They're here.

1418
01:28:28,685 --> 01:28:31,563
[Jackson] <i>We got eyes on the
target. He has the weapon.</i>

1419
01:28:32,731 --> 01:28:33,982
Let's get ready to move.

[gunfire, clatter

1422
01:28:40,947 --> 01:28:42,448
Jackson. What was that?

1423
01:28:42,449 --> 01:28:43,824
[transmission static]

1424
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:45,910
- [Jackson] <i>Cole.</i>
- What?

1425
01:28:45,911 --> 01:28:47,119
Get out of there.

1426
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,956
Go now? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1427
01:28:50,957 --> 01:28:52,792
<i>Does this mean we lose Leveque?</i>

1428
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:55,377
Jackson, what happens to my
family if you lose Leveque?

1429
01:28:55,378 --> 01:28:57,672
[transmission static]

1430
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:00,425
[breathing deeply]

1431
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:05,889
I'm staying.

1432
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:18,818
She's coming.

1433
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,321
I know it.

1434
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,865
[chattering]

1435

[sighs]

1436
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:49,558
Well, well, well, what a romantic
spot for our first official date.

1437
01:29:52,018 --> 01:29:53,353
Mmm.

1438
01:30:03,989 --> 01:30:05,155
[Leveque] Uh...

1439
01:30:05,156 --> 01:30:09,202
I brought a little something
special for us to open up.

1440
01:30:10,245 --> 01:30:11,246
Mmm?

1441
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:16,209
And, uh, some chaperone.
Hope you don't mind.

1442
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:22,382
I apologize. Yours
are no longer with us.

1443
01:30:23,383 --> 01:30:25,218
It is more intimate
this way, no?

1444
01:30:26,636 --> 01:30:28,263
Are you all right, Taxman?

1445
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:32,934
I hate to think something
might ruin our night.

1446
01:30:37,898 --> 01:30:40,774
- Thank you.
- For what?

1447
01:30:40,775 --> 01:30:43,153
For helping me
with my chaperones.

1448
01:30:43,987 --> 01:30:46,990
Saves me the hassle of
having to kill them myself.

1449
01:30:48,283 --> 01:30:50,076
It was my pleasure.

1450
01:30:52,537 --> 01:30:54,456
But somehow I don't believe you.

1451
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,334
Well, I don't care
what you believe.

1452
01:30:58,335 --> 01:31:02,588
My intention is to walk out of
here a very rich man and disappear.

1453
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:06,843
Oh, the great Taxman
betraying his country.

1454
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:11,723
[clicks tongue] No.
Why would you do that?

1455
01:31:13,683 --> 01:31:17,729
What you said to me about
wasting my life. Made me think.

1456
01:31:20,815 --> 01:31:23,568
Let's not delay this
new beginning. Hmm?

1457
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:25,695
The passcode.

1458
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:32,910
Money first.

1459
01:31:34,496 --> 01:31:38,249
And... my price doubled.

1460
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,544
Negotiations are over.

1461
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:48,008
Well, um, negotiations
are never over anytime.

1462
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:49,760
You know, it... [chuckles]

1463
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:52,973
actually reminds me of this one
time I was, um... [clears throat]

1464
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:56,308
I was selling missiles
to a arms dealer,

1465
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:59,395
and, uh, he was haggling
and haggling, wouldn't stop.

1466
01:31:59,396 --> 01:32:02,440
Finally, he, uh... he bought
the missiles and, um...

1467
01:32:03,817 --> 01:32:05,776
And he comes back an hour
later, and he says, uh,

1468
01:32:05,777 --> 01:32:08,362
"I paid too much for these missiles.
I want a better price," you know.

1469
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:10,948
And I said, "That's not how this
works. You can't haggle now."

1470
01:32:10,949 --> 01:32:14,243
He says, "I want a full refund. I
don't even want the missiles anymore."

1471
01:32:14,244 --> 01:32:17,079
I said to him, "Look, I can't...
I can't take these missiles back.

1472
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,249
- You've had them for an hour."
- Enough!

1473
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:23,168
- The passcode now!
- [Leveque] Hmm.

1474
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:24,796
Or you both die.

1475
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:26,964
[Leveque] Hmm.

1476
01:32:26,965 --> 01:32:28,466
He gets very upset.

1477
01:32:29,926 --> 01:32:31,887
Do you have the passcode, hmm?

1478
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:35,140
Do you have the passcode or not?

1479
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,101
'Cause it is going to be very
painful for both of us if you do not.

I'm sorry I'm late.

1483
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:19,976
Glad you could make it.

1484
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,064
Well, what can I say? You
might be growing on me.

1485
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:26,858
What is this?

1486
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:30,277
An opportunity for me to
check out all the players.

1487
01:33:30,278 --> 01:33:33,365
Mr. Utami, since you're the one
with the money, I'll address you.

1488
01:33:33,865 --> 01:33:36,952
The price of the passcode is
exactly half of Leveque's fee.

1489
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:43,333
Wire it to this account
after that case opens.

1490
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,669
You are the Taxman.

1491
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:47,587
Here to collect.

1492
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:51,258
[whispers indistinctly]

1493
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:55,803
In that case, then who are you?

1494
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:56,930
My boyfriend.

1495
01:33:59,015 --> 01:34:00,100
Damn straight.

1496
01:34:01,017 --> 01:34:03,352
If you have the passcode,
I accept your terms.

1497
01:34:03,353 --> 01:34:05,355
- Mr. Utami...
- Open it.

1498
01:34:08,233 --> 01:34:09,817
You have the passcode?

1499
01:34:09,818 --> 01:34:11,736
I still have friends
at the agency.

1500
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:14,488
Wait a minute. You
can't open that.

It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

[Leveque] Yes,
thank you very much.

1513
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:13,881
However, my business is not
yet finished, but you are.

1514
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:18,344
What makes you think I will let
you two out of here alive? Hmm?

1515
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:22,182
The ten-million-dollar bounty
I put on your head might help.

1516
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:26,810
I don't know how many
bounty hunters are here...

[cell phones chiming]

1518

definitely know about you.

1519
01:35:32,692 --> 01:35:34,194
Know what's funny?

1520
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:38,948
Like you, I didn't actually
have the money until just now,

1521
01:35:38,949 --> 01:35:41,158
but the bounty hunters
didn't need to know that.

1522
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:42,660
They just needed to
know where you were.

1523
01:35:42,661 --> 01:35:45,162
Okay, Leveque. You're
worth a lot of money.

1524
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:48,124
- I'll take that from you.
- Gun!

1525
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:51,920
- [bounty hunter 2] Nobody move!
- [diners screaming, clamoring]

1526
01:35:53,922 --> 01:35:56,173
You are so dead, my friend.

1527

Tell your guys not to
do anything stupid.

[screaming, clamoring continues]

1529
01:36:23,285 --> 01:36:26,079
And what is the plan, huh?
Now what are you going to do?

1530
01:36:26,955 --> 01:36:28,831
Do nothing. You're
coming with me.

1531
01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:30,833
How can I do nothing
and come with you?

1532
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:33,460
You idiot, how are you
going to get out of here?

1533
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:39,092
I'll give you 20 million to shoot
this one. To kill her right now. Hmm?

1534
01:36:48,935 --> 01:36:51,854
[sighing] Are you ready?

1535
