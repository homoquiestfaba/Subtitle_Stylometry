1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,219

2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,340
You are a Calamity of Disgrace!
You got no professional attachment...

3
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,819
and you can't give your big nose out of other people's business!

4
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,620
As an Intergalactic Observer, you stink .

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,660
Did anybody else see those big letters flying by?

6
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,459
You're hopeless, Kazoo!

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,620
Actually it's Ga- zoo .

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,700
Ga. . Let's all say it together .

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,779
Silence!

10
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,900
We are sending you to a planet with virtually 
no civilization for you to mock up .

11
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,540
Please, no! Anything but...

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
Earth!

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,819
You are to document the Earthlings bizarre mating ritual of love and marriage

14
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,820
Why can't they reproduce like we do ?

15
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,260
It's a boy!

16
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,100
Oh! And So green and slimey .

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,100
Quit sucking up!

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,499
Wait .

19
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,019
Surely there must be others more qualified than I .

20
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,419
Of Course . But why risk loosing one of them ?

21
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,340
Just do not land!

22
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,419
They haven't even invented pants yet!

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,419
Have you seen my legs ?

24
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:31,219
Imagine the moron, who was going to stuck with kazoo!

25
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,260

all the information just gonna fall right out of the heads .

33
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,780
And me, i'm way ahead of everybody .

34
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,579
I'm not gonna study tonight.
I'm gonna get a good night's rest, get up extra early...

A Vacuum Cleaner . Thank you very much .

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,500
Where's Wilma ?

70
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,979
That girl is a death to me .

71
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,060
Wilma Slaghoople!
Staring at the top at BedRock again!

72
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,500
There is nothing down there, had a bunch of
flat-footed flat-headed Neanderthals,

73
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,860
clubbing each other and grunting .

74
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,659
Hey, you know i heard they are still afraid of the fire .

75
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,779
I think they are exactly like you and me .

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,500
This is all my fault .

77
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,620
I should've never let you played with the
suburbs Children .

78
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,620
Darling, Please .

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,060
Come downstairs and atleast pretend to be having 
a good time, like everyone else .

00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,300
Come .

81
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,659
Look, Oven mitts!

82
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,260
Is that all the presents ?

83
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,620
What do we do now ?

84
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,700
Ladies,

85
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,060
I have an idea .

86
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,779
What do you say we go for a drive ?

87
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,180
To the club ?

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,019
Actually i was thinking about going someplace 

89
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,459
a little different for a change...someplace new .

90
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,700
Like going into BedRock...

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,899
and going bowling .

92
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,019
Isn't she the best ?

93
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,260
Oh, Yes she is .

94
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,300
My Wilma

95
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,779
Beautiful and witty . A prize for any man .

96
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,700
Hello Chip . What are you doing here ?

97
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,620
I just came by to discuss some business
with Colonel Slaghoople .

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,659
There is a certain girl, i'm thinking 
of investing here .

99
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,380
Hello, Ladies .

100
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,420
Well, I guess the next Bridal Shower will be Wilma's .

101
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,579
Ah no, ladies don't start chiseling those invitations just yet .

102
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,779
Wilma, you have done a real amen.

103
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:43,420
If i got i had a shot at Chip i'll club my
Eugene and leave him for the raptors.

104
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,260
Wilma , get real .

105
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,260
Chip Rockefeller was first in 
his class at Princestone!

106
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,539
Yes, i know . He owns half of Rock Vegas.

107
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,219
Colonel .

108
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,979
Wilma, You and Chip are perfect for each other.

109
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,700
Think of kinds like he can buy you .

110
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,219
we get to spend everyday together shopping...

111
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,579
- playing tennis...
- getting facials...

112
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,459
brow breathing our husbands!
We will be just like our mothers .

113
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,300
Where you've been ? I've been looking all over for you .

114
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,140
I didn't feel like much celebrating .

115
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,700
Are you kidding ?

116
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,619
we get to spend the rest of our lives working in a rock quarry!

117
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,859
Who says dreams don't come true ?

118
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,900
I know I should be happy , but...

119
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,459
I guess I was always figured by this point in my life..
that i have somebody special to share my successes .

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,700
Well you always got me, Fred.

121
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,379
Thanks, Barn.
but that's not what i'm really talking about .

122
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,579
Yeah,

123
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,579
I know.

124
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,420
- what are you talking about ?
- A girl, Barn!

125
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,420
Oh Yeah right . What should i thought .

126
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,700
But i wouldn't worry about it Fred . I mean, You'll meet somebody .

127
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,219
Its like they always say, " It'll happen when you least expect it ."

128
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,140
Now see that's the way you're wrong, Barn .

129
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,660
I believe you create your own oppurtunites in life .

130
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,859
You gotta go out there and make things happen .

131
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,619
I mean it's not like something's just gonna drop out of the sky,

132
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,499
land in front of you, and change your whole life .

133
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,660
What was that ?

134
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,780
Help! Is there anybody out there?

135
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,259
Klaatu barada nikto!

136
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,579
Fred, I think there is somebody in there .

137
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,900
Come on Barn, let's try it to open it up .

138
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,660
I'm right behind you, pal .

139
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:43,300
I don't know , Barn . I think that thing's empty .

140
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,300
Would you mind not holding head by the antenna ?

141
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,339
It's not an ordinary pleasant and say...

142
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,259
- Get me out of here, Come on pal .
- Get me out! Get over!

143
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,060
- What are you?
- I am the Great Gazoo .

144
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,259
The Great Kazoo ?

145
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,060
Ga- zoo.

146
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,099
I come from a planet too far for you to fathom

147
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,379
and a civilization too advanced ,
for you to comprehend.

148
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,499
Wait a minute , Fred.
I hope we get wishes!

149
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:22,700
Pardon ?

150
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,579
Ya we let you out of the fancy bottle,
and now we get wishes right!

151
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,900
Yeah, Barney's right . Let's get this started .
What do we have to rapt ?

152
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,300
Naa an Nokia , I'm not some sort of friendly cartoon Genie .

153
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,180
And that is not a bottle, it is a spacecraft .

154
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,219
I'm of a highly evolved alien species .

155
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,820
I don't do funny voices ,
I don't sing catchy songs...

156
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,140
and i do not posess a magic carpet for your big bloated behinds to float upon!

157
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,979
I'm here to observe your species mating rituals. Ok Dum-Dums ?

158
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,379
Dum-Dums ?

159
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,099
Hey, was that an insult ?

160
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,900
Well if the shoe fits...

161
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,339
What's a shoe ?

162
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,020
Yes, it was an insult .

163
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:00,739
That's what i thought .

164
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,060
Ya here do observe .

165
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,619
Well get ready to observe your teeth leaving your head .

166
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,739
There he is, Fred .

167
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,060
Violent natives!
That could've downfront tourism .

168
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,060
Perhaps you can satisfy my intelluctual curiosity ?

169
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,900
Fine, and you ?

170
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,020
Oh Dear .

171
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,219

What i'm having ?

175
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,259
How much is a glass of water ?

176
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,820
Water ? Free .

177

Then You could just go home

No, that's impossible . I can't .

183

I did it!

300
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,059
Look I know I ran off with Betty ,

301
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,739
but , you know , Wilma's kind of my date .

302
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,299

whether it wouldn't be too much trouble if...

303
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,900
well if...

304
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,660
What are you trying to say, Barn ?

305
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,459
Would you mind , if i left with Betty ?

306

I do not know what we gonna do until then ,
but you know i can't turn down on a good meal .

309

Chilly ? Are you kidding ?
The Earth's still colding around here .

I am a happy guy .

329
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,259

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,660
You know , Wilma ,
you really should wear your hair up .

352
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,019
Uh, I got need more height!

353
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,340
Look .

354
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:34,940
It really brings out your smile .

355
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,860
Well I guess I just have a whole 
lot more to smile about these days .

356
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,380
And I owe it all to you , Betty .

357
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,019
You're the First real friend I ever had .

358
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,420
You had a tough life . 
You deserve a few breaks , Wilma .

359
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,340
Actually Betty it hasn't been all that tough .

360
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,459
You see, there is something that 
I've been meaning to tell you

361
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,019
but i'm real scared , but I think now is the time...

362
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,539
Ooh Pizza's here .

363
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,420
Good evening . I'm looking for...

364
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,779
Mother ?

365
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,259
Wilma ? Is that you ?

366
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:18,900
What is this place ?

367
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,940
This is an apartment . It's how a lot of people live .

368
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,219
Well , that doesn't make it right .

369
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,819
And who are you ? A Cleaning Women ?
Well obviously you're doing a terrible job . You're fired .

370
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,059
Go on! Shoo!

371
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:36,420
Mother! This is my new
best friend , Betty .

372
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,580
She's been very good to me .

373
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,219
And I've been the regular germ cruel fish .

374
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,739
Wilma , I am going to take my bath now .

375
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,580
Good Luck .

376
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,499
Mother .

377
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,660
How did you find me ?

378
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:55,340
I did what any concerned parent would do . 
Hire a detective .

379
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,140
You what ?

380
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,259
We will discuss everything on the way home .

381
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,819
I'm home , Mom.

382
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,620
I am happier than i have ever been in my life .

383
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,219
And you can throw me in a sack and drag me home ,
but I'll just run away again .

384
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,259
Fine , Wilma , Fine .

385
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,979
Now you have broken my heart.

386
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,260
But I wil not allow you to do the same thing
to your deared faithful father.

387
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,379
Darling , he misses you so much .

388
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:25,540
And if you are not home on Sunday to
celebrate his birthday ,

389
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,459
Well, I just do not know how many more 
birthdays he's going to be run...

390
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,379
to celebrate .

391
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:46,340
I wonder why Wilma gave us these suits
to wear for the party .

392
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,379
May be it's a costume party , Fred .

393
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,079
STAY!

394
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,520
Dino ,

395
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,399
Stay .

396
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,480
C'mon Barn lets pick up the girls .

397
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,879
So Barn, What do you think ?

398
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,440
Oh Fred , you shouldn't have .

399
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,359
It's not for you, nitwit .
It's for Wilma!

400
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,079
I'm gonna ask her to marry me .

401
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,240
Oh Dum-Dum , there appears to be a 
tiny flake of something...

402
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,440
stucked your ring . Look, just there .

403
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,119
That's the stone , Gazoo .

404
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,720
Oops .

405
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,399
It's all i could afford .

406
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,599
Sorry.

407
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,000
Well I am sure she will be very impressed by your...

408
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
Frugality .

409
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,720
See that's the great thing about Wilma .

410
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,359
I don't feel to need to impress her .

411
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,520
She's just a simple girl with simple tastes .

412
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,720
You know there are couple things about me ,
I haven't gone around and telling you guys yet .

413
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,399
Well, welcome to the Slaghoople manner .

414
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,760
Your house has a name ?

415
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,040
Fred , Look .

416
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,240
A Cadarock Limo!

417
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,480
Betty I'm sorry .

418
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,399
I was just so ashamed .

419
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,680
You should have realized a caveless girl
couldn't afford a priceless maserocki .

420
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,240
Wilma's home! Everybody!

421
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,919
She is loaded .

422
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,039
I'm afraid you looks like you're really lucked out .

423
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,680
No Barn . This is terrible .
I can't give her this measly ring . Look at her house!

424
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,319
A girl like this is used to the best of everything .

425
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:14,319
She's gonna take one look at this ring
and laugh at me .

426
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,999
You know Barn , its a good thing i didn't 
get the chance to give it to her sooner .

427
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,039
Hey, what are you doing?

428
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,200
This punk's trying to steal my car!

429
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,519
No, sir . I'm the valet .

430
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,319
The valet ? I don't care if you are valet ,
well you are not going in my car!

431
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Barney! Leave him!

432
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,080
Fred , he's the valet . He parks the car .

433
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,160
I know that .

434
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,399

First cooked food, and now this.

Mad ?

Just because you pretended to be poor ?

480
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,839
And I took you in and I felt sorry for you ?

481
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,479

Is it because , they are not like you ?
You know what ?

528
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,600
That is why , I like them .
Because they are not like you .

529
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,280
They like me for who I am ,
and not WHO I am .

530
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,519
I mean...

531
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,240
You know what I mean .

532
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,800
How dare you to talk to me like that , Wilma ?

533
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,680
No one has ever talked to me like that before!

534
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,439
Well , Mother ,

535
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
may be it's a bad time , somebody did .

536
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,839
Let's go , Fred .

537
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,800
We were right behind you , Wilma .

538
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,720
Thanks , Betty .

539
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,399
Wait . Please don't go .

540
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,919
You were right back there .
The way everyone's behaved today is been inexcusable .

541
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,560
Thank you , Chip .

542
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,359
Congratulations, Flintstone . I really mean that , a better man one .

543
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,359
And just to show that there are no hard feelings

544
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:38,039
I'd like to invite the four of you
to the opening of my new casino in Rock Vegas .

545
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,600
You Love birds can taken to the sites ,
and relax in the luxury accomodations...

546
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,919
and enjoy the opening night concert gallery by
Mick Jagger and the Stones .

547
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,959
Stones ?

548
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,080
<i>This is it Love ,<i>

549
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,879
<i>This is Destiny .<i>

550
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,439
What do you say , Wilma ?

551
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:57,640
I, we...

552
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,280
we really appreciate your gesture ,
but i don't think now is such a good time...

553
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,720
Rock Vegas ?

554
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:15,439
We'd love to go .

555
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,640
WELCOME TO FABULOUS ROCK VEGAS

556
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,680
JACKPOT

557
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:41,359
Way to go , Barney!

558
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,120
Great day , huh ?

559
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:40,760
I hope it never ends .

560
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,200
Oh , Young love .

561
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,919
It's a shame it won't last .

562
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,200
Just you wait , Roxie dear .

563
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:04,479
This man is my puppet
and i barely began to pull the strings .

564
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,839
Soon Wilma will see him for the 
pathetic primitive he really is .

565
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,680
I thought you went over this with Wilma person .

566
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:14,280
What do I have to do to convince you ?

567
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,680
Diamonds ? A mazerocky ?

568
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:22,160
Your own show in stalactite Lunch ?

569
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,999
Very nice , Chip , but i prefer cash .

570
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,200
What a coincidence! So do we!

571
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,519
Rocko and Rocko , my favorite maid men .

572
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,959
What can I do for you , Gentlemen ?

573
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,720
The Boss wants his money .
He says he don't think you got it .

574
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:43,120
That's not entirely true .

575
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:45,959
nor is it entirely false .

576
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,200
he don't entirely care .

577
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,439
but he wants all of his money by midnight sunday ,

578
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,800
or we start taking your casinos .

579
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,359
And breaking your legs!

580
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,359
This is a mood discussion , Gentlemen . Because by sunday
evening I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople...

581
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,399
and one of the greatest personal fortunes
in the uncivilized world .

582
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
You better be .

583
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,359
Or else you will be sleeping with the 
Tunasarauses .

584
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,120
The plot's thicken .

585
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,080
This is heaven .

586
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:43,720
Could you get me between my
shoulder blades ? That's cures all my tension .

587
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:47,560
She is tense .
I just found out what calamari means .

588
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,800
Wilma , can I ask you something ?

589
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,160
Sure , Betty . What's that ?

590
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,200
Do you think , Barney is 
serious about me ?

591
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,999
What are you talking about ? He's crazy about you .

592
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,800
I hope so .

593
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,519
I've never met anyone
like Bernard Rubble .

594
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,200
He is so loyal and so sweet .

595
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,439
He makes me feel like I'm the only girl
in this whole flat world .

596
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:16,720
That's exactly how Fred makes me feel .

597
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:18,160
Chip...

598
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,080
it was always about money .

599
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:26,319
Fred does not have a greedy 
bone in his entire body .

600
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:33,080
Look at all these clams , Barn!

601
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,319
Yea.. you got there enough to buy wilma
a ring for each finger , Fred .

602
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:40,240
May be a little stud for me too .
So what do you say , we go cash up .

603
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,839
What are you , crazy ? That's your problem , Barn .
You think too small .

604
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,240
I'm not gonna just stop at a ring .

605
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,200
I'm gonna buy her a whole lifestyle ,
just like Chip Rockefeller .

606
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:55,280
But she doesn't want some smart rich ,
handsome guy . She wants you!

607
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,720
Buzz off , Caveboy!
The man's got magic hands .

608
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,600
I know this will be difficult for you ,
but , let's think for a moment .

609
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:08,560
Chip Rockefeller flew you to his casino in
his plane to play at his tables .

610
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:12,680
And against the odds of 247000 to 1...

611
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:15,399
You have rode 17 straight winners .

612
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,959
Can we connect the dots ?

613
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,319
Sure! Today is my lucky day!

614
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,879
Good Luck, Dum-Dum .

615
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,839
You will need it .

616
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,560
Come on , babies .

617
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,720
Forty seven!

618
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,120
What did I tell you , Barn ? Magic!

619
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,760
It's not magic , it's skill .

620
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:43,280
A gentlemen gambler like you should 
be playing with the high rollers .

621
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,479
HIGH ROLLERS ONLY

622
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,200
I was just getting warmed up ,
You know , building my bank roll .

623
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,680
- Bank roll ? Please I'll give you a line of credit .
- Credit ?

624
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,959
Sure! The house funds you a little extra 
you pay it back , a man of your skill , Please ,

625
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,839
I will be honored to have 
you on a house account .

626
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,800
Don't do it . That's how my 
uncle - the gambler lost everything .

627
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:07,080
He lost his wife , he lost his house , 
his kids , his dog...

628
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:10,280
Guess you know , we have an 
" all you can eat " buffet by the pool ?

629
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:11,680
Fred , please!

630
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,200
" All you can eat " ?

631
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,039
Absolutely! I'd like you to meet Roxie , 
she's my lead actor .

632
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,640
Roxie , Would you show 
Mr. Rubble the buffet ?

633
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:22,479
It would be my great pleasure .

634
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:28,200
Come on , Flintstone . I'll show you to the table 
and have the pitball brings you a nice big pile of clams .

635
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,479
New Shooter!

636
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,439
Freedom and wit , boys .
Four lovely ladies .

637
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,959
Make that six . Where you two been ?

638
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,319
We've been Waiting for you, Fred ,
at the Cadre Club .

639
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,519
Alright , I'm Sorry , Wilma . I've been on a roll .

640
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,399
Where's Barney ?

641
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,959
He went off to the buffet with some show-girl .

642
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,479
A show-girl ?

643
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,280
When they say " All you can eat " 
they don't mean " till you explode " .

644
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:05,439
I'm just getting started .

645
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,519
Look at the size of that pie .

646
00:51:09,879 --> 00:51:12,160
Waiter! Over Here!

647
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:24,359
Let me help .

648
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:42,560
ROCK VEGAS TOURS

649
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,879
I love you , but I gotta go .

Catch you later!

651
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,319
Hello , Love .

652
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,600
Are you...

653
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,439
Yes , Mick Jagger ,

at your service .

655
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,680
And you are... ?

656
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,479
Betty O'Shale .

657
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,999
What a lovely bird doing alone by the pool ?

658
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:21,999
My boyfriend...

659
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,240
He was...

660
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,600
I saw him with another girl!

661
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,439
Oh , Sweetheart .

662
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,080
I'll tell you what .

663
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,760
If you was my lady you wouldn't catch me
even touching another girl . Not never!

664
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,519
Unless I'm on the road . 
On the road doesn't count .

665
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,560
Stop it .

666
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,560
Why don't you try...

667
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,800
stopping crying and give Mickey , 
a little smile , eh ?

668
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,359
That's better .

669
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,640
You look lovely when you smile ,
Miss Betty O'Shale .

670
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:00,519
Thank you .

671
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,200
What do you say we go meet my band mates ?

672
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:07,999
And then we can go
so more quiet , so we can...

673
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,280
talk a little bit more , eh ?

674
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,640
Three thousand and forty-one...

675
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,479
What's going on there ?

676
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,919
Hey , Fred , Look! 
There's Mick Jagger and the Stones!

677
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,560
And there is Betty , she is with the band .

678
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,519
What would be Betty doing with the Stones ?

679
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,519
Yeah .. She doesn't even play instruments .

680
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,680
Betty , Up here! It's me, Barney!

681
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,600
Excuse me .

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,839

Fifteen thousand

00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,800
Fred , let's do something together .
We could go bowling .

686
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,160
Bowling ?

687
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,160
Bowling's for the poor people .

688
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,240
Looks like You and Chip have a 
little more in common than i thought .

689
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,439
Why ? Because we both big winners ?

690
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,879
Here, Fred . Buy yourself a clue .

691
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,399
Wilma , wait .

700
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,479
One red is the winner .

701
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,919
Hello Wilma . Been for a walk ?

702
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,919
Nothing gets by you , Chip .

703
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,120
Forgive me , for disturbing you .

704
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,519
I'm so sorry .

705
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,519
I just got a lot of in my mind .

706
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,959
I have been on that edge too .

707
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,919
Opening weekend , so many guests ,
and now all the room robberies .

708
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:15,080
Robbery ?
No , Nothing , it's just...

709
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:18,640
But , just to be safe I wish you would let me ,

710
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,999
put those beautiful pearls of yours in our safe .

711
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,919
Good idea , Chip .

712
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,800
They mean a lot to me .
I know .

713
00:56:48,399 --> 00:56:50,120
It's up to you , baby .

714
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:52,519
Get me started again .

715
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,399
Mr. Flintstone ?

716
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,160
Mr. Rockefeller has extended an 
invitation to join him at the fight .

717
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,680
ROUND 122

718
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,760
More credit ? No .

719
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,760
No chance . No way . No how .

720
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:18,919
Do you know how much you owe already ?

721
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,240
Owe ?

722
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,280
One million four hundred thousand clams .

723
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,479
It's gonna be a real shame when Wilma finds out
what a loser her new boyfriend really is .

724
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,359
Of course...

725
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,479
she doesn't have to find out .

726
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,720
She doesn't ?

727
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:39,919
See that , I knew you were a good guy .

728
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,319
I'm not .

729
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,640
I said I wouldn't tell her .
I didn't say you can still have her .

730
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,879
I'll erase your debt , Flintstone .
But you gotta disappear , out of town ,

731
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,519
out of bed-rock and never see
or speak to Wilma again .

732
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:58,879
Wait a minute .

733
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,839
You had planned this all along!

734
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,760
Tell me , how do you even dress 
yourself in the morning ?

735
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:09,439
Normally , I just wear what i fell asleeping .
What does that got to do with anything ?

736
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,399
Goodbye , Flintstone .

737
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,519
You won't get away with this , Rockfeller!

738
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,720
I don't care what happens to me ,

739
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,680
but I'm not gonna let you 
easily away closer to Wilma .

740
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:36,359
As soon as I find , I'm gonna 
tell her exactly what's going on .

741
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,240
Then we will see how well your plan worked!

742
00:58:50,479 --> 00:58:53,280
There has been a robbery .
All guests to the lobby .

743
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,160
Uh-oh , there appears to have been a robbery .

744
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,800
We will have to continue this conversation 
later Fred . Please step this way .

745
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:19,479
Ladies and gentlemen!

746
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,280
Ladies and gentlemen! I regeret to inform
you that there is a criminal in our midst .

747
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,240
Now what did he say who was ?

748
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,319
But before I expose him into the public ,

749
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,560
I'd like to give him a chance to step 
forward that admit his wrong doing

750
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,160
only to take his first tiny 
step towards absolution .

751
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,720
I stole all the 
towels in my room!

752
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,399
That is illegal , but still...

753
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,120
I'm wearing someone else's underwear!

754
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:49,640
No, I was talking about a ..

755
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:53,839
I'm systematically poisoning 
the dinosaurs watersupply!

756
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,839
In a matter of decades , their entire 
species will be extinct!

757
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,560
Alright! This is obviously going no where .
I was talking about a necklace .

758
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,839
A very valuable necklace has 
been stolen from our hotel safe .

759
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,200
A necklace belonging to my dear
dear friend , Wilma Slaghoople .

760
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,200
My pearls ?

761
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,760
Alright , who did it ?

762
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,080
So help me . If you don't step
forward right now , I'll personally punch you...

763
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,319
I don't think the violence will be necessary 
Flintstone , because I know exactly ,

764
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:28,039
who stole Wilma's pearls .

765
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:31,120
A desperate man drowning and gambling twits .

766
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:32,640
Low-life!

767
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,879
Hey , doesn't anybody care about this 
whole dinosaurs becoming extinct thing ?

768
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,080
No!

769
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,399
Fred , would you mind emptying your pockets ?

770
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:46,760
Do you think I stole Wilma's pearls ? Chip that's...

771
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:49,039
Why , do you have something to hide Fred ?

772
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:52,800
Definitely not! See for yourself .

773
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,280
Wait a minute . I didn't take these .

774
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,399
Wilma , why would I take your pearls ?

775
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,120
Do you deny that you owe the casino over 
a million clams with no way to pay it back ?

776
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,200
Fred , is that true ?

777
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:16,319
Yeah , but...

778
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,160
Wilma , Darling , I'm so sorry .

779
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,359
Wilma , you can't believe him! He set me up!

780
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,039
Security , take this man to jail!

781
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,240
You're coming with us .

782
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,200
Wait , Wait a minute!

783
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,160
You are all making a big mistake .

784
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,919
Fred couldn't have stolen that necklace .
It was locked up in a safe .

785
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,720
Fred can't even remember the
combination to his bowling locker .

786
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:54,800
Look it's got written down on his hands , see .

787
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:58,879
Great! Now everybody seen it!

788
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,800
Crack a safe ? He couldn't even crack 
his knuckles without my help .

789
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:07,080
Thank you , Mr. Rubble , for confessing 
to be Mr.Flintstone's accomplice!

790
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,760
You are welcome .

791
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:10,319
What ?

792
01:02:10,479 --> 01:02:12,039
Take them both away!

793
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,919
I'm innocent!

794
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,720
Everybody , Gamble! 

795
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,839
Where's my little girl ?

796
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,560
Oh , my poor poor baby!

797
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,680
Perfect .

798
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:37,280
Now everything's going to be 
alright now , Darling . Mommy is here!

799
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:38,720
And I'm going .

800
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,919
I've already talked to Chip and 
he is willing to take you back .

801
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,039
What gives you the right to interfere
with my life ?

802
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,200
I'm your mother and I love you .
And Chip loves you .

803
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:58,720
Chip loves money .

804
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,640
And you have money! 
It's a match-made in heaven .

805
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,160
Look , I think he's already proven his loyalty .

806
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,479
He saved you from that beast .

807
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,479
Fred is not a beast .
He was just raised by them .

808
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,760
Now that explains the missing piece of the puzzle .

809
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,519
Wilma , Listen to me . Go back to Chip .

810
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,879
Please .

811
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,479
Darling ,

812
01:03:26,959 --> 01:03:29,839
Don't let Chip slip through your fingers again .

813
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:34,640
I just do not know how much 
more pain that poor boy can deal .

814
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:37,839
Guys , I'm sure you have your 
money by midnight!

815
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,640
The Boss says , he's got his doubts .

816
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:44,359
See , a little birdie told him that 
you even date Slaghoople damn no more .

817
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:49,879
Hey , I might be out of job tomorrow .
Brothers got a little mess you see .

818
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,560
That's preposterous .
We are getting married this evening .

819
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,519
Good . But if the bride do not show , 
you'll be spending your wedding night...

820
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,879
with me!

821
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,399
I miss Betty .

822
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:16,200
I know Barn . I do anything
to see Wilma again .

823
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,319
We would be with them right now 
if I haven't been so stupid!

824
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:23,160
And now I could have told you that .

825
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,999
Oh boy , you got us sour eyed!
You gotta help us , buddy! You gotta get us out!

826
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,720
" Buddy " ? Did I heard that correctly ?

827
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,839
I am sorry but are you not the 
same Fred Flintstone , who hurt my feelings ,

828
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:39,519
so that I spent the rest of my vacation 
in my room watching paperview ?

829
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,959
You're right , you're right . I was wrong .

830
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:44,399
I...

831
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,800
I tried to impress Wilma with money 
and all i did was ruined everything like I always do .

832
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,800
Cause you know what I am ?

833
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:54,120
I'm nothing but a big...

834
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,879
Yes ?

835
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,919
Dum-Dum .

836
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,439
All of first ?

837
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,200
The eyes have it!

838
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:06,120
Oh , now look .

839
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:10,839
Just because , you finally realized 
what I knew right away, that doesn't mean...

840
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:13,839
I haven't developed a little soft spot for you .

841
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,200
Really ? So you gonna bust us out of here ?

842
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,839
Gazoo's gonna bust us out of here!

843
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,800
Do I look like a cavalry ?

844
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:25,959
that does outfits are adorable .

845
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,680
You two know that I can't actually interfere .

846
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,479
I'm only here to give you some information ,
I thought you might find inlikely .

847
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,999
Hey , I didn't know you can do that .

848
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,839
This is a mood discussion , Gentlemen . Because by sunday
evening I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople...

849
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:45,999
and one of the greatest personal fortunes
in the uncivilized world .

850
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,680
Wilma's in trouble!

851
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,399
We gotta get out of here!

852
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,160
C'mon you gotta help us, Gazoo!

853
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:53,319
I would I could , I really do .

854
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,640
So you are gonna just let it this happen ?

855
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,120
I've gotta sit in this cell ,
when Wilma walks the aisle with the wrong guy .

856
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:03,519
We were supposed to live happily ever after!

857
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,959
Same with me and Betty .

858
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,200
Please , don't .

859
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:11,240
Not emotions .

860
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,200
My race is processed with eons that the 
slightest trace of personal emotions...

861
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,839
and we couldn't be happier .

862
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,720
Well of course , we don't actually get happy ,
because we do not have emotions , but...

863
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,839
Oh , this is so sad .

864
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,999
Somebody hold me!

865
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:40,240
TEEREX TISSUES

866
01:06:57,999 --> 01:06:59,120
Blow .

867
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,640
Barney , you can fit through the bars!

868
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,519
I can ? I guess I should have 
tried that earlier , huh .

869
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,319
Come on . Get the keys!

870
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:29,399
Hey , back in your cage , shorty!

871
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,120
Hi , Betty .

872
01:07:44,399 --> 01:07:45,959
Hi , Wilma!

873
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,879
I just came to say good-bye .

874
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,039
I heard you're going to Stonehenge
with Mick Jagger .

875
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,600
I can't wait .

876
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,200
Chip's going around saying you 
are getting back together .

877
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,919
I'm so happy for you .

878
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:03,280
And I'm so happy for you too , Betty .

879
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,879
I've...

880
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,640
never been so happy .

881
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,640
Me neither .

882
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,999
Hey , knock it off . You're big girls now .

883
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,999
Wilma darling , you are doing the right thing .

884
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,079
I married the Colonel face for money
and look how happy we are .

885
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,800
So , we meet again .

886
01:08:42,959 --> 01:08:45,159
Spread out and find these guys .

887
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,279
They're looking for us , Barn . 
They got guards everywhere .

888
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,640
What're we gonna do , Fred ?

889
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,440
We just gonna have to fight away it .

890
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,999
but these guys are armed!

891
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:02,640
This is a war , Barn .

892
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:05,119
And in a war there's always 
gonna be casualities .

893
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,039
I just want you to know how much 
I appreciate your sacrifice .

894
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,279
What do I've got to be the one gets sacrificed ?

895
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,800
Because I know I'm gonna get Wilma back .

896
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,520
Face it Barn . There is no way Betty's 
gonna dump Mick Jagger for you .

897
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,560
Therefore I've got more reason to live .

898
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,879
Come on , girls! Let's go!
The curtain's coming up!

899
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,159
Come on , out! Oh , you look lovely!

900
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,800
Opening night! Ready to smile .

901
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:39,279
You see , Fred ? Worked like a charm .

902
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,959
No chit-chat . Let's go and sparkle!

903
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,400
The one near the end looks like a man .

904
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:14,959
May be your sister ought to try out .

905
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:32,839
It's them! Get'em .

906
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:36,119
Let's get out of here , now!

907
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,999
Come on! Get them!

908
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,839
<i>This isn't love ,<i>
<i>This is...<i>

909
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:54,999
What do you think , Betty ?
Should I stick up my butt a bit further ?

910
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:56,600
Does it look good like that ?

911
01:10:56,839 --> 01:10:59,879
May be that's too much bad for 
the opening of the show , you know .

912
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,320
It's really upto you , Mick . You're the artist .

913
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,839
Yeah , there I am Betty , that I am .

914
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:15,199
Wow , you really are with Mick Jagger .

915
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,039
Have you not the two girls are sameful .

916
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,959
Actually the cuter one used 
to be my boyfriend .

917
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:22,079
What ?

918
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:27,360
Betty , I understand , if you wanna be 
with this famous rock star instead of me .

919
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,279
but I just had to come back here and tell you ,

920
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,360
I love you .

921
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,239
I don't think I ever told you that before .

922
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,039
but now I did so...

923
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,440
Goodbye .

924
01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:44,800
Barney , wait!

925
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,879
Do you really mean it ?

926
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:50,239
Of course , I do . I never felt 
this way about anyone before .

927
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:53,560
And what about that show-girl 
you were within the restaurant ?

928
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,440
Roxie ? That's Chip Rockefeller's girlfriend .

929
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,199
He sent her to take me to the buffet ,
so i couldn't stop Fred from gambling .

930
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:04,320
Chip Rockefeller has a girlfriend ?
Well somebody's gotta tell Wilma!

931
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,760
Don't worry , Betty .
I'll handle Rockefeller .

932
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:11,640
Alright would somebody mind telling me ,
What's bloody going on here ?

933
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,239
This is not creeky! 
I'm supposed to be on stage .

934
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,239


935
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,079
I'm sorry , Mick .

936
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,959
I had a really great time 
with you and all , but...

937
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,800
I love Barney .

938
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,159
Well , I don't care .

939
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,600
I'm in love with Betty too . She is the first
decent honourable woman I ever met and I'm like...

940
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,640
unbelievably turned on 
by her naivety .

941
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,640
Watch your mouth Mister or 
I'll give you a fat lip .

942
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:47,520
Although it kinda looks somebody already has .

943
01:12:51,879 --> 01:12:54,680
Alright that's it!
Nobody's pinches my bird!

944
01:12:54,839 --> 01:12:58,279
Not after I am , pinching her 
from in the first place .

945
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,520
Take this partner!

946
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,520
Come on .

947
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:09,239
She is mine!

948
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,440
Oh yeah ?

949
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,839
I'd rather ridiculously been dead body .

950
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,159
I love you . I always have .

951
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,839
I lost you once , 
but I won't lose you again .

952
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:42,360
Marry me .

953
01:13:42,999 --> 01:13:44,279
Tonight .

954
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,360
Chip , you're terrific .

955
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,039
but...

956
01:13:52,839 --> 01:13:56,199
it's just a lot of things 
have happened recently

957
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,879
and I need a little time to think .

958
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:02,760
Wilma , I can't live without you .

959
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:05,119
Just say " yes " .

960
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,760
Please .

961
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,079
It's okay .

962
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,480
Ladies and Gentlemen , the 
fabulous Tardust Hotel...

965
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:40,800
<i>This isn't Love ,<i>

966
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,680
<i>This is destiny<i>

967
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:49,279
<i>somewhere above<i>

968
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,800
<i>this was planned for me<i>

969
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,400
<i>Life had no meaning<i>

970
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,320
<i>I never knew , why<i>

971
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,600
<i>Till the dream came true<i>

972
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:08,320
<i>The dream is you .<i>

973
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,480
<i>I never say never<i>

974
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,839
<i>But this love forever<i>

975
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,039
<i>Till over<i>

976
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,959

<i>This isn't Love ,<i>

980
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,640
<i>This is ecstasy<i>

981
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,560
<i>Somehow I knew<i>

982
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,360
<i>you would come to me<i>

983
01:15:48,839 --> 01:15:52,039
<i>I never say never<i>

984
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:55,400
Wilma , Honey .
I never meant to hurt you .

985
01:15:55,879 --> 01:15:58,600
I've done some stupid things , 
like a lot of stupid things .

986
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,999
but love makes you do stupid things .

987
01:16:04,839 --> 01:16:08,959
I never forgive myself if
I didn't give this one last try .

988
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,360
Wilma Slaghoople ,

989
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:20,400
I can't give you diamonds , 
fast cars or fancy houses .

990
01:16:20,839 --> 01:16:22,119
I can .

991
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,360
All I can give you is just plain old
Fred Flintstone from bed-rock....

992
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,640
and all the love in my heart .

993
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,279
and I hope that's enough .

994
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:36,079
It's enough . It's enough .
No , it's not!

995
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,520
Wilma ,...

996
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:44,400
Will you...

997
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:50,600
Will you...

998
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,720
Spit it out!

999
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:55,999
Wilma , will you marry me ?

1000
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,440
This is your last chance! 
Stop me or all the dinosaurs die .

1001
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,800
Shut up!

1002
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:08,239
Wilma , I am still waiting .

1003
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,760
Yes!

1004
01:17:34,919 --> 01:17:37,119
<i>And do you , Fred Flintstone...<i>

1005
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,480
<i>take Wilma Slaghoople to be your wife<i>

1006
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,760
<i>to have into your home 
from this day forward<i>

1007
01:17:48,839 --> 01:17:51,959
<i>Do you, Wilma take 
Frederick to be your husband<i>

1008
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:54,440
<i>to have into your home 
from this day forward<i>

1009
01:17:54,839 --> 01:17:55,720
I do .

1010
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,999
<i>Then by the power vested in me 
by the City of Rock Vegas...<i>

1011
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:05,640
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife .<i>

1012
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:08,320
You may kiss the bride .

1013
01:18:09,879 --> 01:18:12,400
Mrs. Slaghoople .
Where am I ? What is this place ?

1014
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:18,520
Gazoo , are you crying ?

1015
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:21,199
No , No , of course not , Dum-Dum .

1016
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,520
No , I've simply overcomed with information .

1017
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,720
You see , I've finally understand...

1018
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,159
your complex mating rituals .
All the emotions .

1019
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,800
All this...

1020
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:33,159
Love .

1021
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:36,640
And I've come to the conclusion .

1022
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,879
I will never meet anybody .

1023
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,720
You're very sweet , but believe me ,
it would never work out .

1024
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:54,400
Ladies and Gentlemen ,
I now present to you Mr. and Mrs. ...
