Announcer:
And now, the last finalist,

3
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:08,024
three-time champion
Charlyne Phuc.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,537
Excuse me.

5
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,273
Man: Ah!

6
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,110
Announcer: First word: Logorrhea.

7
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,677
Logorrhea, um...

8
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,952
L- o-g-o-r-r...

9
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,155
w- wait...

10
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,155
Logorrhea...

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,761
like diarrhea, but different.

12
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:48,672
I mean, they're both
kind of like a spray,

13
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,075
but logorrhea,
that's a spray of words

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,636
from the mouth, you know?

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,377
And, like, diarrhea,
which is also a spray,

16
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,251
but it comes
from a different orifice.

17
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,380
Announcer: What in the world?

18
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,617
Woman: Ugh.

19
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,489
Fuck, am I, like, way off?

20
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,593
Reporter:
There is breaking news tonight

21
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,761
from the State Spelling Bee
Championship

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,237
as Morgan High's own
Charlyne Phuc has been arrested

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,603
for drug possession.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,471
Phuc has admitted
using marijuana

25
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,069
during her three-time
championship run

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,012
in order to assist her mortal mind

27
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,208
in accessing
the dictionary inscribed

28
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,184
in the fabric of the cosmos...

29
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,152
And that no one would have noticed

30
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,179
if she hadrt been so buttstonked.

31
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,851
Boy: Shh.

32
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,026
Shut up, Dave.

33
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,931
Sh... shut up, Dave.

34
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,739
# The wind blows cool
across my face... #

35
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,607
Little Dave:
Dave, take my weed.

36
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,275
# I can smell the taste,
a trace of lace #

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,583
# There's something
sinister in place... #

38
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,318
- Hold his feet.
- I am, Dave.

39
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,849
- Dave, roll that shit.
- I am, Dave.

40
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,454
- Holy...
- Fuck.

41
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,899
Hey, Mom? I got some
MIT scholarship stuff that I filled out.

42
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,425
If you could drop it in the mail,
I'd appreciate it.

43
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,528
Honey,
I clogged the toilet again.

44
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,597
The plunger should be
under the sink.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,834
- Where?
- The back.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,901
- Oh, l... I got it.
- All right, thanks.

47
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,442
- I love you.
- # My mind slips further #

48
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,006
# From what's real #

49
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,482
# Take my hands away
from the steering wheel... #

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,056
# I'm crashing,
coming down in waves #

51
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,759
# And wipe the sweat
from upon my face #

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,760
# And it's a perfect day
to leave this place... #

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,103
- Ooh.
- # It's a perfect day #

54
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,575
# To hide down
in my own home... #

55
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,101
What the fuck?!

56
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,636
Watch where
the fuck you step, Henry!

57
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,013
Watch where the fuck you step!

58
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,587
# It's a perfect day #

59
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,557
# To waste away... #

60
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,526
# Your perfect part to play... #

61
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:26,521
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone... #

62
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,569
# It's a perfect day to waste away #

63
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,266
- # Your perfect part to play... #
- Shit.

64
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:39,677
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone. #

65
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,014
Oh!

66
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,015
Bravo, fuckers.

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,651
"I swallow."

68
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,329
Shut up.

69
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,231
D- Dad. No...

70
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,326
- It won't happen again. I promise.
- I expect you to pay

71
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,701
every last penny
of my deductible.

72
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,003
In the meantime, you can spend
this afternoon in detention.

73
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,873
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,680
- Come along, Martin.
- Yes, Daddy.

75
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,878
Hey.

76
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,618
Hey, Breaux.
I hit Dr. Gordon because of you.

77
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,355
I shouldn't have to pay
for his car, man.

78
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,884
All right, well, tough shit.
I mean, you're the one who crashed

79
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,726
- into that butthole Gordon.
- To avoid hitting you!

80
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,823
News flash: Wearing headphones
while driving is against the law.

81
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,233
You know, I don't think I should take
behavior advice from a burner flunky.

82
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,170
- Boy: Ouch, dude!
- Yeah, well, why don't you take

83
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,070
your science-fair,
national-scholar status

84
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,506
and cram it up your asshole?

85
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,305
You know, Breaux...

86
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,574
Yeah, thank you.

87
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,410
Way to be a hambro.

88
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,350
It wasrt like I made him crash into
that man-whore's piece-of-shit car.

89
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,012
That's what that scrotum

90
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,782
skin tag Gordon gets
for teaching his fat little clone

91
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,153
how to give a hand job.

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,624
Rollir on 12s, son.

93
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,453
Aw, come on.

94
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,761
He's behind you!

95
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,700
Voice: What?

96
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,304
What?

97
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,364
You know what
the problem is here, Brandon?

98
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,399
Why our average GPA has dropped

99
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,741
three times in as many years?

100
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,407
Uh, the Internet?

101
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,042
The sticky green.

102
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,780
The cannabis sativa.
The sinsemilla.

103
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,811
Marijuana?

104
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,487
Which is serious stuff.

105
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,053
Dangerous stuff, so I hear.
It's a gateway drug.

106
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,964
Hop-heads like Travis Breaux
have been a thorn on my side

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,059
ever since they came here.

108
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,299
That little prick has caused me
more pain than you know.

109
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,436
- My cat...
- Yeah?

110
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,844
...developed an abscess on her face.

111
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,179
I rushed her to the vet
emergency room,

112
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,947
but their nitrous oxide tank
had been stolen.

113
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,683
They later tracked the culprits down

114
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:08,251
to the home of one Travis Breaux.

115
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,491
Without anesthesia,
I had to pin Dolly down.

116
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,261
She scratched my face, my hand.

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,393
I developed a terrible infection.

118
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,370
It's called "cat scratch fever."

119
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,962
My stool became

120
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,496
incredibly painful to pass.

121
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,532
I lost weight, but gained body fat.

122
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,168
I was a mess.

123
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,807
Then I heard my wife telling
her friends that I looked lousy.

124
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,390
My attorney advised me against
taking any sort of action.

125
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,326
No evidence to press charges
against Travis Breaux,

126
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,320
but I knew... I knew
he was responsible,

127
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,357
breathing in that laughing gas filth.

128
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,402
They call it "space surfing."

129
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,472
Where do they come up
with all these clever names

130
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,605
for recreational drug use?

131
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,413
Roasting a bone,
candy flipping,

132
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,614
banging down a stiff loosey.

133
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,385
A stiff loosey...

134
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,188
I haven't heard that one.

135
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,926
When a woman from
a sordid underworld social circle

136
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,766
inales powdered cocaine
off of some loser's erect penis

137
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,432
and then doses acid
off of his testicles...

138
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,804
I think it has something
to do with the Beatles.

139
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,574
Now, they ruined our nation...

140
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,881
drugs, fornicating,

141
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,184
a grown man singing
about his feelings.

142
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,918
It's time we win this war,

143
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,756
expunge this school
of all dope fiends.

144
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,635
Henry: So I've created
a hybrid compound

145
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,901
with a resistance two times that
of regular silicon.

146
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,908
Used as the basis material
for electronics,

147
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,432
it would provide
increased protection

148
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,741
against power surges,
magnetic waves.

149
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,872
This is an electromagnetic
pulse generator.

150
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,475
Actually, could everyone
take a step back?

151
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,179
It's a localized pulse, but it will fry
your laptops, your hard drives.

152
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,056
It'll kill your cell phones
if you're too close.

153
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,358
Tick, tick, tick.

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,635
So as you can see,
the motherboard

155
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,868
manufactured by my compound
is the undamaged one.

156
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,026
Shit.

157
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,565
Bitter aftertaste of reality?

158
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,441
You come to see
how the other half lives?

159
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,381
- Boy: Mr. Thompson here?
- He went lookir for you.

160
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,415
Hey, fool, that's my shirt
you got on.

161
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,651
I gave it to Goodwill last year.

162
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,162
Fuckir hobo.

163
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,688
Don't trip, Rubin.

164
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,327
I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

165
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,200
What the fuck you just say to me?

166
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,831
I said I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

167
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,400
Or did some dry up in your ears?
You should clean them fuckers out.

168
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,967
Try an ear candle, yo.

169
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,540
Rubin?
Why aren't you in your seat?

170
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,381
You know, we could have
a little Abu Ghraib action here,

171
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,944
or we could watch our video.

172
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,751
It's your call.

173
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm just gonna go ahead
and sit down.

174
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,191
Good choice.

175
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,303
Boy:
It's all ready. Just hit play.

176
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,835
Everybody, pay attention.

177
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,436
And no talking.

178
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,970
Narrator on TV: With his parents
out of town for the weekend,

179
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,111
Bob bends to the pressure
of his peers to be somebody

180
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,246
and smokes a joint.

181
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,223
That's street talk
for a marijuana cigarette.

182
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,352
Bob lights up and takes a drag.

183
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,228
What he doesn't realize is that
this seemingly harmless act

184
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,428
will bring the walls
of his reality crashing down.

185
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,908
Narrator: Is this your idea
of getting jiggy with it?

186
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,358
Narrator:
Applesauce 10 times a day.

187
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,521
Man on TV:
How are you feeling?

188
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,157
- Boy: This video eats my balls.
- Boy #2: Word.

189
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,293
Woman on TV: Dr. Gibson,
you're wanted in lobotomy room 7.

190
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,395
Dr. Gibson to lobotomy room 7.

191
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,574
Narrator:
It will also help fund terrorism.

192
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,708
I only really want to blow things up
when I'm high.

193
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,418
Think about it.

194
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,986
Man over radio:
Engage. Smoke 'em.

195
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,261
Henry.
Henry, hey, hey.

196
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,895
Look, I'm sorry.
I drive like shit when I'm high.

197
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,905
You were high at 8:00
in the morning?

198
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,804
Yeah, of course.
I'll help you pay for it, all right?

199
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,331
I'll float you some casheesh.

200
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,709
Well, thanks, man.

201
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,614
I'm sorry about
the whole burner, flunky thing.

202
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,674
Oh, no.
It's all good, you know.

203
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,845
- I get worse from my dad, so...
- Right.

204
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,447
- Yeah.
- How's he doir?

205
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,749
Who's he doir?

206
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,987
He's probably balls deep
in some Jell-O mold as we speak.

207
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,758
Right.
So, um, this is me.

208
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,390
Obviously.

209
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,569
Hey, you remember
how I caught you jerking off

210
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,400
with BENGAY
when you were, like, 12?

211
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,838
- Yeah.
- Aw, yo, that shit must have burned!

212
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,171
- Yeah, that's funny.
- I told everybody, and you ran off

213
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,972
in the woods like some
fuckir cracked-out Hobbit.

214
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,911
- Yeah, no, no. I remember.
- Yo, there were helicopters

215
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,073
- looking for you and shit.
- I remember the helicopters.

216
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,639
I was always wondering what the fuck
they were saying to each other.

217
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,672
- Think about it.
- Really?

218
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,014
"Uh, looking for the kid

219
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,280
who just jerked off. Over."

220
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,015
"Did he just come? Over."

221
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,320
"Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over."

222
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,758
It was like a scene from "The Fugitive,"
but with a naked kid.

223
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,354
Yeah, that's not really proper
pilot speak, but I guess...

224
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,558
I'm just saying we had
some good times.

225
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,033
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,059
The hell happened, do you think?

227
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,703
High school.

228
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,003
Yeah, no doubt.

229
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,677
Hey, look, you know, I was driving
by the old 'hood yesterday.

230
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,181
You remember that tree house,
that lockbox we built?

231
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,782
Yeah, sure. Still there?

232
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,555
Wanna go find out?

233
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,623
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.

234
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,328
What?

235
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,770
Oh, man, all this shit was
so important back in the day, man.

236
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,330
- Henry: Look at these.
- What?

237
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,365
- You look like a fat Billy Ray Cyrus.
- Yo, wait, man.

238
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,173
We should be fuckir high for this.

239
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,141
This is pharmaceutical-grade
Hindu Kush.

240
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,913
What? Do you have
a prescription for weed?

241
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:51,116
- You don't?
- What? What does that...

242
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,885
You haven't gotten
high before, have you?

243
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,718
You're afraid you're gonna end up
ripping down big loads

244
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,196
in a cave
with the Shoe Bomber?

245
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,433
Getting high, it's... it's like freedom.

246
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,376
Smells, tastes, feelings...

247
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,610
they all become, like,
four-dimensional.

248
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,277
When everyting irie,

249
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,445
everyting go twing twing.

250
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,852
Yeah, let me...

251
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,554
- Fuck it.
- Be somebody.

252
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,096
So it begins.

253
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,940
Can't wait to have an ex-wife, man.

254
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,950
Can't wait for that shit.

255
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,349
Whers the good part kick in?

256
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,580
Like the... like
the fourth-dimensional stuff.

257
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,612
I want the freedom.
Whers the freedom kick in, Breaux?

258
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,920
L... I want the freedom.

259
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,020
Should we even be here right now?

260
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,859
I mean, won't people
get suspicious?

261
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,297
I mean, they'll call the cops,
send helicopters.

262
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,528
I hate fucking helicopters.

263
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,763
No, nobody's gonna
do anything, man.

264
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,828
We're trespassing.

265
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,600
I mean, do you feel this?

266
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,108
'Cause, holy shit, I mean,
I don't even think this is...

267
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,244
Oh, God.

268
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,172
- You okay?
- The freedom hasn't

269
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,844
kicked in yet, asshole!

270
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,185
Hey, what we need to do
right now is just relax.

271
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,152
Fuck, God damn it!

272
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,595
Where are you?!

273
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,121
Where the fuck are you?!

274
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,896
Helicopters everywhere!

275
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,699
Everywhere!

276
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,070
Breaux over radio: Uh, looking
for the kid who just jerked off. Over.

277
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,802
Did he just come? Over.

278
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,369
Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over.

279
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,751
There were helicopters.
They were hunting me down.

280
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,395
- It's your phone.
- Shit.

281
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,926
What time is it?

282
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,499
Party time.

283
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,667
- Hey.
- Girl: Henry, where are you?

284
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,698
- I'm so sorry.
- We're all here waiting for you.

285
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,438
- Yeah, I'll be there in 20. Fuck!
- What's going on?

286
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,912
I'm borrowing this. I gotta go
to the annual bake sale prep.

287
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,437
- Can you drive?
- You wanna go now?

288
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,416
Yeah. Yeah, I wanna go now.

289
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,318
All right, man.
Well, I want some road-head, then.

290
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,219
I hope you're good
at swallowing, bro.

291
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,917
It's how I like it.

292
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,797
- Ahh.
- We need some more green.

293
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,065
- Boy: She's got ass for days.
- Boner.

294
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,272
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?
What's crack-a-lackir?

295
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,109
Girl:
Good job. Good, good.

296
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,978
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?

297
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,177
- What's crack-a-lackir?
- What up, tough guy?

298
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,276
- Hey, Sharky...
- Girl: Oh!

299
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,253
I got it.

300
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,482
Fuck!

301
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,822
Oh, I just got my eyebrow
pierced yesterday!

302
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,127
- About freakir time.
- Henry: Hey, guys. Sorry.

303
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,230
- You're such a fucking asshole.
- What?

304
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,831
Sharky Ovante
just gave you an opening!

305
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,844
Microscopic, but still.
You blew it.

306
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,573
Yeah.

307
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,377
We grew up next door
to each other.

308
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,543
We used to play together

309
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,212
till she grew breasts.

310
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,777
And that was that.

311
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,449
I ran the numbers.

312
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,758
Assuming we both ace our finals,

313
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,458
it seems to me
you have valedictorian

314
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,990
by 3/100ths of a percentage.

315
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,366
Salutatorian is a pretty big deal,
too, Sebastian, so...

316
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,530
- Still second place, though.
- Well, I suppose

317
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,564
the hinge upon which fate swings
is a capricious one.

318
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,544
- Why are your eyes all red?
- Brandon: Excuse me, everyone.

319
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,943
Can I please have your attention?

320
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,177
Very impressive, spirit team.
Can you please put her down?

321
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,649
Uh, hey, listen.

322
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,710
We're doing a live
television interview outside,

323
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,951
so if you could all just, you know,
stop throwing each other up in the air

324
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,583
and keep the volume level down,
that'd be great.

325
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,218
- Okay? Thank you.
- Boy: Sorry.

326
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,226
Woman on TV: And now
we'll go live to Julia Louise Hugo

327
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,202
- at Morgan High School. Julia?
- In five, four, three, two...

328
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,170
I understand that you have
a statement regarding

329
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,400
your student, Charlyne Phuc,
who was recently arrested...

330
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,206
Miss Phuc is no longer
a student of this institution,

331
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,644
and I have requested
that her standing

332
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,308
as three-time
State Spelling Bee Champion

333
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,749
be officially revoked.

334
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,620
Morgan is one of the finest
high schools in this state.

335
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,992
We demand excellence,
not inebriation.

336
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,430
And to reassure our students,

337
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,400
parents, faculty,
and board of regents

338
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,993
of this high standard,

339
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,974
we are conducting
a controlled-substance screening

340
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,203
on campus tomorrow.

341
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,805
All students are required
to participate,

342
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,374
and any student who does not
pass the screening

343
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,716
will be immediately expelled.

344
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,121
Cheese and crackers.
No, no, no, no.

345
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,096
I was trying for genial
and it came off wimpy.

346
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,065
I'd like to be stronger.
Could we try this again?

347
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,159
Julia: We're live.

348
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,069
What?

349
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,096
Woman: No, no, no, it's great.
Keep shooting. Looks great.

350
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,005
Big Dave: We gotta be clear
by tomorrow morning.

351
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,805
- Man on phone: What drug?
- Shrooms.

352
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,675
- Yeah, we split an eighth.
- How long ago did you take them?

353
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,238
- Hmm. About an hour ago?
- What strain?

354
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,718
Hold on. Hey.
You know what strain we ate?

355
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,481
Dinosaur bones.

356
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,954
- Man: Are your parents home?
- I think.

357
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,356
- Man: Have you been drinking?
- Look at your face.

358
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,292
Did you smoke marijuana
with these mushrooms?

359
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,056
It's all stroked out.

360
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,324
- Henry: Sorry.
- What?

361
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,423
So it might be that shit
we ate on prom night.

362
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,933
- I'm looking for Breaux.
- Breaux: Gordors been pulling

363
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,594
- this Nazi shit forever.
- Man: Did you call the police?

364
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,161
Breaux: My dad's gonna cancel
the Spice Channel if I get expelled,

365
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,901
beat me up
with my own severed cock.

366
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,738
Let... yo, let me call you right back.

367
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,471
- What?
- You did this to me.

368
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,672
Do you have any idea
how screwed I am right now?

369
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,614
Look, chill, man.
You're causing a scene.

370
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,811
I'm causing a scene?

371
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,618
Causing a scene? What?!

372
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,460
What?

373
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,056
Look, there are other people

374
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,929
trippir balls
pretty hard core right now.

375
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,298
Dude, I'm not like other people.

376
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,825
Okay? I don't trip on balls.

377
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,362
Okay? If I'm busted, I can kiss
my MIT scholarship good-bye.

378
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,671
My entire life
is on the line right now.

379
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,148
Yeah, all right. Hey, you guys,
the pumpkins are trying to kill us.

380
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,447
You gotta go talk to 'em.
Come on, seriously, go.

381
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,510
- What's with them?
- Come on.

382
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,684
This is my cleansing box.
It's for emergency situations.

383
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,129
We've got goldenseal,
but I think they test for that now.

384
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,963
Tea regimen, but it takes
something like two to three days.

385
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,060
There's always urine masks,
but sometimes your piss

386
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,229
can come out a little too clean.

387
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,933
Like it's not even urine anymore.
It's Aquafina.

388
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,941
Okay, so what else
do we have, man? Is that it?

389
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,203
There's the piss pump.

390
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,609
It's classic, but if they frisk you,
they're gonna find it.

391
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,341
- Right.
- The bottom line is anything you use

392
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,214
will buy you a 40% chance
of passing.

393
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,955
That's an F.
That's an F, Breaux.

394
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,150
You know, this is what
they warn you about in that video.

395
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,524
It starts out fun until you start
clawing your eyes out

396
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,926
in a padded cell with al-Qaeda.

397
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,157
One hit could really ruin your life.

398
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,493
I mean, you could always
go around to high schools.

399
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,902
You know, like,
"Don't be like me. I blew it.

400
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,272
Threw my life down
the garbage disposal...

401
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,005
for weed."

402
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,037
Come on!

403
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,982
- Hey, I'm playing, man.
- This is a big deal, Breaux.

404
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,882
I need your... this is a big deal!

405
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,581
Yeah, I know, man.

406
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,093
# Have you ever
watched the sun go down #

407
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,402
# And you're thinking
'bout the world spinnir round? #

408
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,534
# Have you ever
been high as fuck? #

409
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,876
# You're in the bathroom mirror
talking to yourself #

410
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,114
# And your dog's lookir at you
like you need help #

411
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,920
# Have you ever been
high as fuck? #

412
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,101
Oh.

413
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,365
Have you been throwing
cold cuts at my window?

414
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,065
Yo, have you been crying?

415
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,502
Yo, meet me
at the tree house, gangster.

416
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,480
Yo, who the fuck touched my whip?

417
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,675
Got you!

418
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,343
Breaux:
"Sodium aluminum sul..."

419
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,047
There's aluminum in this?
What the fuck?

420
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,886
Look, uh, what if we
walked in tomorrow,

421
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,795
failed the drug test,
and no one even noticed?

422
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,493
What if you could fail and still be
valedictorian and still go to MIT?

423
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,001
- Jesus Christ, you're high again.
- Yeah, I'm always high...

424
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,697
Dude, that's a stoner fantasy, man.

425
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,329
How could I fail the drug test
and no one care?

426
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,431
- If everyone fails.
- Of course.

427
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,534
If we can't pass the test, fine.

428
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,101
Fuck it.
Let's get the whole school high.

429
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,703
Oh, my God.
Please tell me you're kidding.

430
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,441
Tomorrow is the bake sale, right?

431
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,441
We swap in bud brownies,
everyone gets blazed, everyone fails.

432
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,147
They'll have to throw
the test results away.

433
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,882
We won't even use a lot.
All right?

434
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,449
Just enough to muddy the waters.
They'll barely test positive.

435
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,087
Most people won't even notice.
They'll just be a little slow.

436
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,328
- A little slow.
- At times like this,

437
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,230
you need to think like a stoner.

438
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,810
Where are we gonna get
that much weed?

439
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,920
- Frog: What?
- What?

440
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,155
What? What?

441
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,656
You're right.

442
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,438
I harvested the crop
a few hours too early.

443
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,348
Ah! I'm so stupid.

444
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,477
Fuckir... so fuckir stupid!

445
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,289
Stupid!

446
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,722
- What?
- What?

447
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,528
Frog:
What? What?

448
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,467
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,697
I hate for you to see me this way.

450
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,035
Frog: What?

451
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,740
Breaux:
There's this guy... Psycho Ed.

452
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,612
He was like a child prodigy.

453
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,139
Graduated from high school at 15.

454
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,551
Passed the bar exam
before he was old enough to drink.

455
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,386
But then he went
to a foam party in Baja,

456
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,485
smoked a dust blunt
supposedly laced with PCP,

457
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,689
burned something out
in his fuckir brain.

458
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,391
Dropped out the legit world
and became...

459
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,332
Henry:
Let me guess... a drug dealer.

460
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,131
Yeah, but he's got this shit...
it's better than weed.

461
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,105
It's called kief,
and it's really hard to make

462
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,733
because you need a massive crop
of some crypto-dank herb

463
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,336
on a 32-part-per-million
flowering solution cycle.

464
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,040
Psycho Ed:
Calculated to harvest each bud

465
00:26:56,081 --> 00:27:00,211
when its psychoactive component
is at its absolute apex.

466
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,982
Then I process the buds
to extract the excess THC,

467
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,217
the fruit of an entire harvest.

468
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:10,353
One misstep
and the crystals are history.

469
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,193
This is kief.

470
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,132
This will seriously

471
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,398
fuck you up.

472
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,440
Hold on, m-man.
You... you want to steal

473
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,843
a psycho drug dealer's
personal kief?

474
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,904
Precisely.

475
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,347
Look, the Daves scored a dime bag
from him this afternoon,

476
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,251
took a look at the place,
told me the whole setup,

477
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,312
- where the keys are.
- Man, this is insane!

478
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:42,383
- I can't do this!
- You can. It's not.

479
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,054
Look, I know what you're thinking.

480
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,859
- You know, he's got a gun...
- No.

481
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,059
Breaux, I was not thinking that.

482
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,365
Look, at times like this, we can't think
about the things that could go wrong.

483
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,429
We just gotta grab the balls
and go for it.

484
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,703
- The balls. I'm grabbing the balls.
- Exactly.

485
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,334
Whose balls? Stop, Breaux.

486
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,369
- No, I can't do this, man.
- It's easy, okay?

487
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,507
Just hop the back fence,
wait for my signal,

488
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,517
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

489
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,143
What kind of plan is that?

490
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,814
Breaux. Fuck.

491
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,486
"Beware of my fucking dog."

492
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,165
- Fuck!
- Hey.

493
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,473
What the fuck are you doing out here?
Come on, get in here. Come on.

494
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,172
- Come on! Get in here!
- Okay, okay.

495
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,182
- Have you been crying again?
- Fuck off.

496
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,143
Okay.

497
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,815
It's really dicey in here,
so give me exactly one minute

498
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,018
and then get the key from the door
and head to the back.

499
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,459
He keeps the kief
in a freezer in the grow room.

500
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,929
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, I'm serious.

501
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,558
Fuck. Fuck.

502
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,090
Oh, my God.

503
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,536
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay. Okay.

504
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,972
All right.

505
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,567
Okay, okay.

506
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,648
Ain't a strip club, you fuck.

507
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,686
Thanks, brother man.

508
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,987
Everybody says your weed
is the dank shit.

509
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,655
Yeah, well, everyone's right.

510
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,155
Time for you
to get the fuck out.

511
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,658
Well, what about, you know,
weed etiquette?

512
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,068
What?

513
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,573
You know, now I'm supposed
to smoke you out with your own shit.

514
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,768
It's like weed tax.

515
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,171
Do I look like I need you
to get me stoned?

516
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,817
My God,

517
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,753
looks like somebody poured
snake blood in your eyeballs.

518
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,551
Thanks.

519
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,622
Maybe you could
give me some advice?

520
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,151
What?

521
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,494
I bought some seeds online...

522
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,964
- Oh!
- Moron!

523
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,024
Never buy anything online.

524
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,569
Psycho Ed: This botanist in Portland

525
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,875
knows how to make
the most of what you got.

526
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,903
And where to grow.

527
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,281
Yo, could you print this out
for me, bromeslice?

528
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,483
That's Paranoid.

529
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,964
- Yo, why do they call you Paranoid?
- What? Why you wanna know, man?

530
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,472
Yo, is that, like... is that like
an alarm or something?

531
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,911
Timer.

532
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,216
I'm fully automated.

533
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,938
Oh, shit.

534
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,049
Now piss off.

535
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,325
Shh...

536
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,231
- Breaux: What the hell is that?
- That's the alarm.

537
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,260
Ah.

538
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,976
Psycho Ed:
He's got the deep beef.

539
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,003
You better not be fuckir with me.

540
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,845
I told you not to fuck with me.

541
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,557
Hey, who the fuck are you, man?

542
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,258
- What, does ganja affect your hearing?
- What?

543
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,596
I've been knocking for,
like, five minutes.

544
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,431
I'll punch you in the head, man.

545
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,437
Who the fuck is this guy, bro?

546
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,496
- You told him your name?
- What?

547
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,100
- Huh?
- He's my... he's my ride, my ride.

548
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,837
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm his ride.

549
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,141
Come on, man,
we gotta get the car back

550
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,841
before my dad gets back.

551
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,475
He's a renegade cop
with a power mullet.

552
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,178
Works the late shift,

553
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,813
likes to shoot things.

554
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,345
- Hey.
- What?

555
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,050
Hmm?

556
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,927
- Yo.
- What?

557
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,696
- Frog: What?
- What?

558
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,636
Frog:
What? What?

559
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,709
Yo, you woke my frog, cunt.

560
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,004
Frogs sleep?

561
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,505
- Both: What?
- Breaux: What?

562
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,743
- Both: What?
- Henry: What?

563
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,217
Frog: What?

564
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,019
Adios, muchacho.
Muchísimas gracias.

565
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,220
Hey, next time,
leave Chong at home.

566
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,728
Okay.

567
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,254
- Frog: What?
- What?

568
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,493
- Frog: What? What?
- Henry: Jesus fucking Christ.

569
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,068
Yo! G-G-Go!

570
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,435
Go, go, go, go, go.

571
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,201
- Who sent you?!
- Holy shit!

572
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,774
973 kids at least,
two two-inch brownies apiece.

573
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,941
We're gonna need 42 boxes
of brownie mix, 15 dozen eggs...

574
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,610
- Oh, shit!
- 11 bottles of canola oil, and...

575
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,744
- Man: Hector, clean-up on aisle two.
- Fuck.

576
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,448
- Hey, these are on sale.
- So what, man?

577
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,718
These are the ones that taste good.

578
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,951
Wait, wait, wait.
This is white cake.

579
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,425
It's for me.

580
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,920
# Stained roads #

581
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,728
# Opposite direction #

582
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,634
# Hearts are feeling cold #

583
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,833
# Minds are dejected #

584
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,774
# We want the same things #

585
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,075
# Not just for ourselves #

586
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,082
# Created for me #

587
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,914
# A personal hell... #

588
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,791
# Take this #

589
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,663
# Take this with you #

590
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,195
# The two do not exist #

591
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,333
# In conjunction... #

592
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,003
Brandon: Dr. Gordon,
the board members are here to see you.

593
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,913
This is the most important day
of your life.

594
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,489
# Hold on to #

595
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,688
# These ebbs and flows #

596
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,186
# Please, please, please,
don't let me... #

597
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,063
Breaux: Move. Dump them out, man.
We gotta go, quick.

598
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,897
Henry:
No shit.

599
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,629
Breaux: Let's go.
Come on, we gotta move.

600
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,038
- Henry: Shut up.
- Quicker, quicker, quicker. Let's go.

601
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,599
- Henry: Okay.
- Come on.

602
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,806
- # Don't cut me, cut me out #
- There's a car here.

603
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,974
Dr. Gordon: A shepherd must be held
accountable for his sheep.

604
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,177
That is why I welcome
the board's review

605
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:58,018
of our new zero-tolerance policy
on controlled substances.

606
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,353
Today, Morgan High
is conducting

607
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,588
its first ever student screening.

608
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,620
No drug tests! No drug tests!

609
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,693
Brandon over PA:
Greetings, fellow Patriots.

610
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,332
This is your assistant dean,
Brandon.

611
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,569
Just a reminder that today

612
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,409
is the annual end-of-the-year
PTA bake sale

613
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,311
with benefits going toward

614
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,580
the band and track team
to get new uniforms.

615
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,578
So don't count calories
or carbs today.

616
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,386
You know I'm not.

617
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,826
# Necessity... #

618
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,462
Today is the dawning
of a new era here at Morgan.

619
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,262
And I, Dr. Leslie Gordon,

620
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,397
give you my personal assurance

621
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,134
that you will never, ever

622
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,404
hear of another student
from Morgan High

623
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,072
being under the influence
of any illicit drug

624
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,072
ever again.

625
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,648
Punch?

626
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,752
These are fuckir good.

627
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,994
All right, kids, we're only gonna
get a few more chances

628
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,972
to do this this year,
so here we go.

629
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,204
10, nine, eight...

630
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,075
I really don't like doing this...

631
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,273
seven, six...

632
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,043
this is not a test...

633
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,483
five, four...

634
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,010
get to class.

635
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,320
Psycho Ed:
But... but was it...

636
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,428
Paranoid:
Chicken quesadilla?

637
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,135
What?

638
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,649
Shit.

639
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,783
Paranoid:
What's the matter, man?

640
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,988
I could fix you another one.

641
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,366
Yo, Edwin, you all right, man?

642
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,335
Teacher:
Chad, please take the roll sheet

643
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,496
to the administration office.

644
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,529
- Chad!
- What?

645
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,473
What? What?

646
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,273
The roll sheet to the office.

647
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,837
Oh, shit.

648
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,048
Just go.

649
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,923
Dana, Jeffrey, please read
today's announcements.

650
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,923
Wha... what?

651
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,164
Edwin: I got webbed hands.
L... I've never noticed that.

652
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,785
What?

653
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,226
Nurse: Name?

654
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,719
Name!

655
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,361
Uh...

656
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,167
I have a nickname.

657
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,336
Finger.
Oh, and, um, Acorn Dick.

658
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,005
It's un... it's unfortunate.

659
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,105
So which one do you want first?

660
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,342
Man: Hands up.
Got any sharp objects? Needles?

661
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,820
Nurse: Porta-Potty to your left.
Here is the plastic...

662
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,914
Breaux:
I like your... your tats.

663
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:56,552
You're not on the Suicide Girls
website, are you?

664
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,791
Does this nurse look
totally insectoid to you?

665
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,230
Breaux:
Thought I saw you on there.

666
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,733
I'll text you.

667
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,794
What the fuck, man?
People are losing their shit right now.

668
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,828
According to... according to
"Stoner of the Year,"

669
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,865
bud brownies are the most dangerous
and terrifying inebriate.

670
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,877
The thing about them is you keep
getting higher and higher.

671
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,880
It does not stop.
How much kief did you use, man?

672
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:21,351
Uh, you know, a smidge, a shake,
a Martha Stewart steeze.

673
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,289
Okay, I spilled it, all right?
A shit-load.

674
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,347
- All right...
- Sebastian: Did you hear?

675
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,087
Someone locked the PTA moms
in the weight room.

676
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,154
Looks like Dean Gordon installed
that new surveillance system

677
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,029
just in time.

678
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:41,066
Oh, right, you wouldn't know.

679
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,697
I mean, I only know
because, of course,

680
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,834
you know, I tutor his son Mark
and I overheard it.

681
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,039
Cameras everywhere.

682
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,537
It's an Orwellian wet dream.

683
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,948
- Henry, slow down.
- We're going to jail.

684
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,619
- Gordon caught us on camera.
- We don't know that.

685
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,129
- And even if he did, we can fix this.
- Yeah? How?

686
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,063
I don't know, the footage...
we don't even know if they watched it.

687
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,362
- We'll just fuckir find it.
- Dr. Gordors son.

688
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,028
Let's go have a chat
with that veining dildo.

689
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,536
Wait, no, no, no. I can't.
I'm late for my first final.

690
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,663
Forget your final.
This is important.

691
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,673
You don't get it, man. If I screw up
my final, I'm just as fucked.

692
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,197
Okay, I'll find that pimply dipshit
and then I'll text you.

693
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,944
All right.
Thanks, man.

694
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,006
I'ma tell you what hurts...

695
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,708
having a daddy with glaucoma.

696
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,716
Old man couldn't see shit.

697
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,947
So I tried to score him, you know,
an ounce of Chocolate Thai...

698
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,252
Teacher: Uh...

699
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,281
This is cra... this is crazy.

700
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,580
We are proud to have awarded
an academic scholarship

701
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,453
to one of only three living
human beings to have beaten

702
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,220
the Carnegie Mellon Red One
Supercomputer at chess:

703
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,750
Edwin Hunter.

704
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:15,322
Elo rated as the third best
chess player on the planet Earth.

705
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,368
It looks like Edwin
will have the first move

706
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,396
because he's white.

707
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:30,003
I mean... the white pieces.

708
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,572
White always goes first.

709
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,914
I mean, that is...

710
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,921
the person with the white...
oh, look.

711
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,650
This pawn looks like
my Uncle Neville's

712
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,888
elongated nipple.

713
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,763
- Rest in peace, you slut.
- Music! Ahem.

714
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,235
Would you all like to listen
to some music?

715
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,974
Dude, the white judge...

716
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,745
the white judge knocked me
to the joint for 25 to life

717
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,447
for some fuckir sinsemilla, man.

718
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,546
We already heard
that one, too, asshole.

719
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,251
Paranoid:
Well, the world need to hear it,

720
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,556
and they will in my book,

721
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,257
"Alcatrizaz."

722
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,821
Shit.

723
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,709
That sounded like a wet fart.

724
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,646
Well, you'd know, incontinent slank.

725
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,309
What the hell is going on
around this place?

726
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,285
Is someone trying
to sabotage me?

727
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,653
- Are you trying to bring me down?
- Jesus, no. I've been paging you.

728
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,524
No drug tests! No drug tests!

729
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,859
Hmm.
Batteries must have died.

730
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,831
Sir, we've had
an unusual number

731
00:43:55,866 --> 00:44:00,326
of students and faculty
complaining of...

732
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,535
confusion and... and dizziness.

733
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,043
I haven't been feeling
so sweet myself,

734
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,944
so I was thinking that maybe
it was a gas leak,

735
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,845
so I called in

736
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:16,114
an emergency...
work... thingy.

737
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,452
I want answers. Brainstorm this thing.

738
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,515
There he is!

739
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,118
What about our childrers
right to privacy?

740
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,619
- No unlawful search and seizure.
- Yeah, fuck you!

741
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,032
- Fuck you!
- Man: Who do you think you are?!

742
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,128
Charlyne: Oh, fuck, man.

743
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,704
Psycho Ed:
Ah, shit.

744
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,574
- Hey.
- What?

745
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,580
You made me drop
my ice cream.

746
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,310
Why the fuck would you be eating it
like that on a day like today?

747
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,252
Because it tastes ambrosian
when I'm buttstonked,

748
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,313
but don't tell the cops that
when they arrive.

749
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,985
I'm on probation for a misdemeanor
possession charge.

750
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,960
- What?
- Shit.

751
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,930
You didn't think about gettir
no fuckir Slurpee, kid?

752
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,329
You like Slurpees, don't you?

753
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,664
- Psycho Ed: Who me?
- No, the...

754
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,332
Man:
Oh, man.

755
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,377
- Fuck.
- What?

756
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,572
- What?
- Shit.

757
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,741
- Fuck.
- Charlyne: What?

758
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,581
- Fuck.
- Paranoid and Charlyne: What?

759
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,746
- What?
- Fuck.

760
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,585
Charlyne: What?!

761
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,552
Get the fuck out of here.

762
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,578
- Boy: I'm melting!
- Martin.

763
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,809
How many brownies did you eat?

764
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:59,047
- 14?
- Jesus H. Christ.

765
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,122
Henry:
Martin, look at me.

766
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,822
You are really stoned right now, man.

767
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,423
You look like you're about
to summit Mt. Zion.

768
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,194
We'll tell your daddy.

769
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,863
You could get expelled, little man.

770
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,702
Where do they record
the security footage?

771
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,334
Huh? Huh?

772
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,173
- Come on, man.
- Give the fuckir milk.

773
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,111
Tell us, Martin,
and you get the milk.

774
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,115
In the library,
in... in the back room.

775
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,982
- My daddy has the keys.
- Okay, okay, okay.

776
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,179
If you speak a word of this
to anyone and I'll make sure

777
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,949
what you're feeling right now
is permanent.

778
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,423
I'm the pope of dope.
I can make that happen.

779
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,824
Maybe I just dosed the milk
you just downed

780
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,556
with high-grade liquid acid.

781
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,723
Keep your mouth shut, homes.

782
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,664
Well, did you?!

783
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,000
Boy:
Die, Leonard! Die!

784
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,376
Boy: I'm gonna murder you!

785
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,244
Dr. Gordon:
Perhaps you'd like some lunch?

786
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,874
This is great, man.

787
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,350
How are we supposed to get
the keys from him?

788
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,250
Are you joking?
I wanna see what it looks like

789
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,447
when someone is murdered.

790
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,716
Ah!

791
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,451
What if we could unlock
the surveillance room

792
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,890
without even going near
Dr. Gordon?

793
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,053
How, man? How?

794
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:26,502
# Watch out,
here we go again #

795
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:31,571
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

796
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,051
# I'll kill you with my words #

797
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:38,111
# And I'll kill you with mine... #

798
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,350
Breaux:
Gordors a psycho.

799
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,884
He canceled his wife's
gym membership

800
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,556
because he thought
she was fucking her trainer,

801
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,123
but gave her a spare set of keys
so she could work out here.

802
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,658
Must keep in shape
with all the sport fucking she does.

803
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,194
- Wait, what?
- She's a cougar, dipshit.

804
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,831
A fucking coug.

805
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,172
What school have you been going to?
Everybody's fucked her, man.

806
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,109
- I-I haven't.
- Well, everyone but you.

807
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,044
- You haven't.
- Everyone but us.

808
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,843
- The Daves?
- Shut the fuck up, all right!

809
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,214
It's a breeze.
I go out there, I distract her...

810
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,240
Wait, let me guess,
let me guess.

811
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,311
While... while I commit another felony,
sneak into the mers locker room,

812
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,050
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

813
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,079
- Exactly.
- Right.

814
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,524
You grab the keys from her purse
while we're having sex.

815
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,050
What?

816
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,498
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

817
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,523
# With mine. #

818
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,076
Mind if I turn up the heat?

819
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:39,139
Wha... what do you...
what do you think you're doing?

820
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,309
Having a hell of a day.

821
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,216
Thought I'd chill
the fuck out in the pool.

822
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,050
You know, get out of here.

823
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,578
Get out of here
before you get yourself

824
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,989
into some serious trouble,
young man. Okay?

825
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,129
I won't tell if you won't.

826
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,802
Look, how the hell
did you get in here?

827
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,103
- Hmm?
- I'm... I'm into you.

828
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,769
Seriously, I'm down.

829
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:09,973
I'm calling the police.

830
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,072
You shut your blood clat, Mommy.

831
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,015
What do you tink
I came in here for?

832
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,609
What did you just say?

833
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,677
Let me peep them Babylons,
you ras-clat.

834
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,052
All right, listen, you little bastard.

835
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,649
I'm gonna have you arrested so fast
that your head will spin.

836
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:25,128
- Do you understand me?
- I ain't scared of no 5-0.

837
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,790
- Why are you talking like that?
- What?

838
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,691
Girl: Oh, yeah.

839
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,773
- Girl: What is that?
- Girl #2: What?

840
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,283
Girl #2: Oh, I hear it.

841
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,718
Girl: How weird.
Is someone here?

842
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,415
Girl #2: Hello?

843
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,651
Let's stop this.

844
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,989
Girl: Amanda?

845
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,517
Girl #2: Hello?

846
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,553
Henry: "Jizz coming out
of my Johnson..."

847
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,157
- Girl #2: That's just creepy.
- Girl: I definitely hear somebody.

848
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,569
Henry:
"Hog in your mud..."

849
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,799
Henry:
Administration office?

850
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,104
- Girl: Pass the towel.
- Girl #2: No.

851
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,744
- Huh, that was weird.
- Yeah.

852
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,378
I can drive tonight if you want.

853
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,649
Fuck, yeah!

854
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,919
You were like the star of your own
ninja porno back there...

855
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,823
"Enter the Cougar."

856
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,694
- Breaux: Watch this, biatch.
- There's the old sense of humor.

857
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,221
He's holding out on us, man.
I know it.

858
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,799
Fucking notebook?

859
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,868
Español.

860
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,403
What the hell is this shit?

861
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,860
Need to freshen up a bit.

862
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,126
This is gonna get ugly.

863
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,504
A case can be made that things
have already gotten pretty ugly, Edward.

864
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,707
You read my mind, man.

865
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,940
How you be doing
that fuckir shit?

866
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,073
You guys better wait here.

867
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,678
- Gladly.
- Fuckir weirdos.

868
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,711
Paranoid: Don't... don't...
don't make no eye contact.

869
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,281
They've got laser blades.
They can reset your brain.

870
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,783
Thanks for the warning.

871
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,796
Flies in the web.
Yeah, we got 'em. Reel 'em.

872
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,302
Big Dave:
Okay, where's my piss pump?

873
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,105
We have to rig that shit up
before we get chi-chi faced.

874
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,509
Here.

875
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,278
This one has a black
prosthetic dick, asshole.

876
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,516
- What if they take a look, man?
- Maybe you just have a tan cock.

877
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,252
Give me your cock.

878
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,352
Looks Latino.

879
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,192
Little Dave:
Fine, take that cock.

880
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:17,997
I'll wear your
black shriveled dick.

881
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,295
Big Dave: Wait.

882
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,436
Let's make sure there are
no motherfuckers in here listening.

883
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,554
Henry: I'm a surveillance room key.
What do I look like?

884
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,560
Move Neville's nipple
or suck on it already, biatch.

885
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,930
- Try them again.
- I did, man, all of them. Twice.

886
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,365
This must be the door.
So where's the fuckir key?

887
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,130
Sebastian:
What's poppir off, gentlemen?

888
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,570
- Care for a bite, Henry?
- Uh, no, thanks.

889
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,972
- I'm, uh, fasting.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

890
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,498
I've heard they're delicious.

891
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,240
Too bad chocolate reminds me
of human feces.

892
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,748
- Weird day, isn't it?
- It's high school.

893
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:43,913
Everyday is weird.
See you, Sebastian.

894
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:47,151
I found a dumpster full of brownies.

895
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,659
I ask you,

896
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,097
why would someone
wanna throw away

897
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,498
so many perfectly good brownies?

898
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,999
You should have a brownie.

899
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,702
- Pure THC kills nausea.
- Henry: Fuck off, Doctor.

900
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:11,009
- # I am the walrus! #
- Boy: Coo coo ca choo.

901
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,516
We should get this whole school
high more often.

902
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,520
- More often?
- Yeah, on a scale

903
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,387
between a prostate exam
and a reggae festival,

904
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,721
it's somewhere around giving
your mother multiple orgasms.

905
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,249
What kind of scale is that?

906
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,127
You know, you find this
really fuckir funny, don't you?

907
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,563
This could really tarnish
your.65 GPA.

908
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,727
I mean, your bright future is totally
hanging in the balance, Breaux.

909
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,598
Yeah, l... I do have plans,
for your information.

910
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,634
The Daves and I,
we wanna travel,

911
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:45,136
learn to play the sitar, and then
eventually settle somewhere else.

912
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,172
Maybe Nicaragua.

913
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,380
You know, and l... I know buying land
out there can be pretty sketchy

914
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,910
because the government
can pretty much jack it

915
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,719
whenever they want,
but fuck it, right?

916
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,658
Wow, man.

917
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,888
It's a hell of a plan, really.

918
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,418
Oh, shit.

919
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,294
- What?
- Hi.

920
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,093
Where is it?

921
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,662
It's, uh... it's gone.
It's gone, man.

922
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,866
What?

923
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,273
That's impossible.

924
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,834
Where is it?

925
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:21,379
There was enough kief to get
this whole fucking school high.

926
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,312
You sick, twisted fucks.

927
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,793
You did get the whole school high.

928
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,465
Now... now, that's just the most
mental thing I've ever seen.

929
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,031
But you pinched
the wrong mars load.

930
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,441
Okay, okay, we'll pay you back.
We'll pay it back, okay?

931
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,743
- You don't have enough.
- There's cameras, there's cameras.

932
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,079
There's cameras?!

933
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,017
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- There's cameras?

934
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,981
Where's the camera?
Where's the camera?

935
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,115
Huh? Huh?
Where's the camera?

936
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,058
Where's the camera?
Is that a camera?

937
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,424
- No, no. No, no, no. Okay.
- Oh, shit.

938
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,894
You think I give a fuck
about cameras?

939
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,329
The bake sale...
they're raising money.

940
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,855
- How much?
- I don't know! I don't know!

941
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,164
I don't know.
We'll pay it back, we'll pay it back.

942
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,033
- We'll find it.
- I want it in an hour.

943
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,368
- Two hours.
- What the fuck?

944
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,101
Two hours.
Please, please.

945
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,904
That'll get you
till the end of the day.

946
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,477
And then we're gonna
have a very

947
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,915
serious talk.

948
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,386
- Huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

949
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,879
Does this happen to you a lot?

950
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,257
Henry: What the fuck are we gonna do
about that freak Sebastian

951
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,783
and Dr. Gordors
surveillance footage?

952
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,090
Breaux:
Fuck that. Let's worry about

953
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,858
staying out of the morgue first,
then jail.

954
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,559
- What?
- We find the bake sale cash box

955
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,759
and we pay off Psycho Ed.

956
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:18,790
And we have a whole two hours.

957
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,063
- Right.
- "Thank you, Breaux."

958
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,731
Right, which gives us
till about 10 after 12.

959
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,070
Fuck! No, I can't.
I've got my computer skills final.

960
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,303
All right, I'll fuckir deal.
Go be a superstar.

961
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,072
There's tape on the keys.

962
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,444
- How am I supposed to type?
- Dana: It's a final, you 'tard.

963
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,574
You're not supposed
to see the keys.

964
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,650
I think.

965
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,348
Miss Unger?

966
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,880
Hello?

967
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:47,755
Hello. I was just drawing
a picture of my cat Bryan.

968
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,322
I named him after Bryan Adams.

969
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,199
All right, let's take a test.

970
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:59,668
Boy, he's a very sexy singer.

971
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:03,372
I used to pretend
that my glass dildo

972
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:08,214
was, in fact, Mr. Adams' erect

973
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:12,620
glass-encased member...

974
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,886
Because the forest wizard
had turned him to glass, of course.

975
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:20,589
So only the moistened walls
of the village witch

976
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,689
could return him to human form.

977
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,335
Was that out loud
or did I just think that?

978
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,748
Isn't this the administration office?

979
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,013
No, it isn't.
It is my classroom.

980
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,715
- I think.
- Are you fucking with me?

981
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:50,783
Excuse me, is that the attendance list
I gave you this morning?

982
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,541
Henry: You're positive Sharky
left the cash box in Gordors office?

983
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,742
- Yeah. Look, the money's in there.
- Cool, cool.

984
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,716
- So where's Sharky now?
- No, no, come on!

985
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:18,152
Horny man, I need your magical,
geek power brain to be focused for this.

986
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,848
No, man. Fuck that.

987
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,516
I got the keys out of the womers
locker room, man.

988
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,048
- This one's yours.
- That was simple.

989
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:26,186
I had to tame a cougar.
This is the administration office.

990
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,594
Yeah, you're the career criminal, man.

991
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,564
- This should be, like, easy for you.
- Right. You're right.

992
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,295
L... I'm, you know, suspicious.

993
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,099
And you, you're the straight-arrow,
tight-ass geek.

994
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,366
Oh, so maybe I should
smoke weed all day

995
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,067
and I wouldn't have to do
any hard work.

996
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,438
Yeah, well, maybe I should
get some straight As

997
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,306
and hang out with some flip-flop
floobie-doos who eat glue.

998
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,403
Yeah, there's a minimum
IQ requirement to be in the auto club.

999
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:47,473
Is there a minimum vagina
requirement to be in the IQ club?

1000
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,849
No.

1001
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,990
All right, we're gonna
have to clear the office.

1002
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,824
Oh, fuck!

1003
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,059
This is intense.

1004
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,657
Shit.

1005
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,362
- There you are.
- Mom?

1006
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,565
Oh, my God.
Dude, how blazed are you two?

1007
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,598
You tried to hold out
on us, you fuck.

1008
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,044
Oh, shit.

1009
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,340
- Just tell my mom I love her, man.
- You tell her yourself.

1010
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,978
- No, man.
- Breaux: Pull it together.

1011
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,853
Little Dave, you know that stunt
you've been yammering about?

1012
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,119
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, now would be perfect.

1013
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,625
Little Dave:
Why now?

1014
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,356
We dosed the whole school.
We need a distraction.

1015
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,128
- Teacher: That sounded weird.
- Boys: What?

1016
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,069
Frog: What?

1017
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,471
Daves: Oh!

1018
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,285
Big Dave over PA:
May I have your attention, please?

1019
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,551
Witness the death-defying stunt

1020
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,490
never before attempted.

1021
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,189
Little Dave Klein is gonna jump off
the library balcony

1022
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,065
on his motherfuckir skateboard!

1023
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,625
Yeah!

1024
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,870
Boy:
The balcony.

1025
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,010
- Big Dave: Go for it, Dave.
- Girl: It's suicide!

1026
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,536
- Let's check it out!
- Let's roll this shit.

1027
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,385
Whoo!

1028
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:35,891
Yeah!

1029
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,984
Big Dave:
Whoa! Oh!

1030
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,552
Whoa! Yes!

1031
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,932
That was some
"Faces of Death" shit, homes.

1032
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,096
- I can feel skin flapping.
- What?

1033
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,766
Seriously, I think
I've ripped my sack, man.

1034
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,443
Dr. Gordon:
I should have tenured at Stanford.

1035
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,898
Tameka?

1036
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,031
- Tameka!
- I'm sorry. There was an incident.

1037
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,008
Here's your coffee.

1038
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,810
- I'm so sorry?
- Thank you.

1039
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,448
Is there anything else, sir?

1040
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,612
- The gas man is waiting...
- No, I'm finished.

1041
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,089
Actually, there is

1042
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:48,325
one small thing I'd like you
to take care of, Tameka.

1043
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,298
Oh, yes.

1044
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,665
Yes, there is.

1045
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,500
- Brandon: The cops are coming.
- What?

1046
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,067
- They're on their way.
- The police?

1047
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,305
- Yes!
- No, t-tell them

1048
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,177
- that's everything's under control.
- That's not gonna work.

1049
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,978
Oh, God damn it!
I'll be right there.

1050
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,558
- Yeah!
- Big Dave: Live the moment! Live it!

1051
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,793
Fuck.

1052
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,494
I lost count.
Fuckir singles.

1053
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:32,201
$2,403.

1054
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,732
- That's a start.
- Wait, a start?

1055
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,177
- You said if we got you the money...
- I said that it will buy you

1056
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,976
till the end of the day.

1057
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,011
This shit ain't even remotely close
to the street value.

1058
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,043
How much?

1059
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,159
- 50.
- Thousand?

1060
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:56,632
Psycho Ed: No, cents, stupid.
50 fucking thousand.

1061
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,156
US.

1062
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,965
Let's call it 49,
since I like you guys, huh?

1063
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,168
You're both fuckir nuts. Huh?

1064
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,110
- I'll be waiting in the parking lot.
- So you're just leaving, then?

1065
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,635
You don't see
what's going on here?

1066
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,079
You don't see
what we're up against?

1067
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,378
We could use a psychoism fiend
with a lot of green

1068
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,907
and you're turning your back on us.

1069
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:19,183
Go take care of yourself, Ed.

1070
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,519
Guess it's what you're best at.

1071
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:23,320
I'm not fucking around!

1072
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,589
The money or you're
both marked, man.

1073
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,099
Weed legends or not.

1074
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,901
Julia: We're live at the prestigious
Morgan High School

1075
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:43,646
where a group of angry parents
are protesting the school's decision

1076
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:45,637
- to drug test...
- Who are you?

1077
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,673
- We're with Channel 5 News.
- That thing's on?

1078
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,278
Yes, we're live right now.

1079
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,584
What would you like to say
to Headmaster Gordon?

1080
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,922
- Is he watching?
- If he were watching.

1081
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:01,327
What do you mean "were"?
W- Was he watching?

1082
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,889
- Is this the past?
- Man: Cut the feed.

1083
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,924
Is that that same school?

1084
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,402
Brandon: The gas company dude
says that it's not a gas leak.

1085
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,997
We're checking the cafeteria
for salmonella.

1086
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,203
I mean, what else could it be, huh?

1087
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,734
- Asbestos?
- Those are the wrong symptoms, okay?

1088
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,009
This is... this is more psychological.

1089
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,882
It's kind of like
God's eye watching itself.

1090
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,113
Jesus!

1091
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:27,122
Why is everyone acting
like a bunch of baboons?

1092
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,454
Yeah, I don't know.

1093
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,552
It's... it's nuts, but we're having

1094
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,893
a choice brainstorming session
just like you asked.

1095
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,162
No one leaves this place
until we identify this problem.

1096
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,930
Think, people!
This thing is out of control!

1097
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,404
We have to shut it down!

1098
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,305
What? Hey.

1099
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,814
Just think, you did that.

1100
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,680
How's that for an accomplishment?

1101
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,379
Right?

1102
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,910
Oh, come on.

1103
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,923
Look, it's not like he's
irreparably damaged or anything.

1104
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,981
- Leave me alone, Breaux.
- He's gonna be fine.

1105
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,992
I am sick of your
pathological optimism.

1106
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,551
My life is in the shit-house
because of you.

1107
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,085
I didn't put a gat to your dome.

1108
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,293
You smoked that fatty.
You puffed down. You got high.

1109
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,962
You got you into this,
you judgmental hypocrite.

1110
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,198
And to think I did all this bullshit
to try and help you.

1111
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,206
I never had a single thing
to lose, dumbass.

1112
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,730
Yeah, man, you don't need to tell me
you didn't have anything to lose.

1113
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,538
Everybody knows that.

1114
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,605
You know why we stopped
being homies, Henry?

1115
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,083
Come on, man.

1116
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,279
It's when your dad left your mom.

1117
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,720
And that puts you
in the same place as me.

1118
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,053
And having that thought
in your skull

1119
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,059
scared the shit
out of you, didn't it?

1120
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,418
That suddenly your life
could be anything like mine.

1121
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,193
- That's not true, man.
- Fuck you.

1122
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,293
You don't believe that truth,
then fuck you.

1123
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,496
Go ahead, give up,
because I'm not done yet.

1124
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,837
But I am sick and tired
of your candy-ass whining

1125
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,241
when fuckir one door
separates us from that footage.

1126
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,268
- And you can't...
- Man, even if we could get in there...

1127
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,803
I mean, even if we could
destroy the footage...

1128
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,315
I mean,
what about Psycho Ed?

1129
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,180
Man, where are we
gonna get $50,000?

1130
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,984
Sebastian:
Who is Psycho Ed?

1131
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,014
Suck my wispy left nut, Sebastian.
You don't know shit.

1132
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,787
Uh uh uh.

1133
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,523
I know that you two
got the student body

1134
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:18,260
and the faculty high
on marijuana brownies,

1135
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,929
all because you didn't wanna risk
screwing up your finals

1136
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,065
and losing valedictorian to me.

1137
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,405
And I know that
five minutes from now,

1138
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,070
Dr. Gordon will know
as much himself.

1139
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,100
If you say a word to anybody,

1140
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,579
there's gonna be an 18-7
up in this bitch.

1141
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,603
You feel me?

1142
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,707
- Ah! Okay, okay. Ow!
- What do you want, Sebastian?

1143
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,514
- Ow. Okay, okay. Fuck!
- What should have been mine.

1144
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,147
And once you're exposed,

1145
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,521
- I'll have it.
- Breaux: Okay. Ow! Ow!

1146
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,549
Sebastian, I'll throw
my English final.

1147
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,789
If I fail it, you're valedictorian.

1148
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,026
Sebastian:
When you're expelled,

1149
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,797
I'm valedictorian anyway, asshole.

1150
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,498
By default.

1151
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,565
But if I fail, you win
by beating my GPA,

1152
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,803
by earning it in the eyes
of everyone else.

1153
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,438
Fine.

1154
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:10,111
If you fail, Henry,
my lips are sealed.

1155
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,787
Yes!

1156
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,557
Mr. Thompson:
Do you people even realize

1157
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,623
the significance
of the Boston Tea Party?

1158
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,828
I mean, think about it...
it was tea.

1159
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,534
A mere beverage.

1160
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,168
It's like the beverage
gave the oppressed people...

1161
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,580
leverage.

1162
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,979
Beverage.

1163
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:44,042
- Say it with me, come on. Beverage.
- Class: Beverage.

1164
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,920
Be-ver-age, you know...

1165
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,755
Lick it real slowly, like...

1166
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,023
like it was the nipple,

1167
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,962
- the teat of your own mother.
- Students: Beverage.

1168
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,487
Mr. Thompson:
Beverage.

1169
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,898
Ooh!

1170
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:02,995
A sort of lurid chill goes
up and down my spine.

1171
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,233
Don't stop!
Please, don't stop!

1172
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:12,703
Beverage. Beverage.

1173
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,841
Beverage.

1174
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:18,843
Nurse: Excuse me.
Is there a Mr. Henry Burke?

1175
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,384
You haven't visited us yet,
Mr. Burke.

1176
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,520
Can I borrow him
for five minutes, please?

1177
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,554
Say beverage.

1178
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:33,261
Nice and slow.

1179
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,702
- Beverage.
- What the shit?

1180
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,571
- Students: Beverage.
- Beverage, that's it.

1181
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:42,202
Beverage. Beverage.

1182
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,941
Thanks.

1183
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,812
All right, turn around.
Arms up.

1184
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,052
Any needles?
Sharp objects?

1185
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,063
- All right.
- What's this right here?

1186
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:05,066
Oh, it's your penis.

1187
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,931
Sorry about that.

1188
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,278
Man:
Where have I felt this before?

1189
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,543
Miss Unger: Campus Stadium,
best Dead concert ever.

1190
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:22,847
I toasted one just before
they opened with "US Blues."

1191
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,375
You were there, too?

1192
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,547
You remember when we heard
that it was gonna rain?

1193
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:30,150
And everybody joined hands,
young and old,

1194
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,889
- and we sang that rain away.
- We just sang it away.

1195
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,397
Brandon:
Fuck me.

1196
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,162
Whoa.

1197
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,934
We are all buttstonked.

1198
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,873
Miss Unger:
Nuh-uh.

1199
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,741
Brandon:
The sticky green.

1200
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,743
The cannabis sativa.

1201
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:58,579
The sinsemilla!

1202
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:02,887
But how does someone
get the entire school roasted?

1203
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,091
Oh, l... I got it, I got it.

1204
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,120
I got it.

1205
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:13,128
No, I lost it.
I lost it.

1206
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,501
I lost it.

1207
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,529
I had it.

1208
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,667
You're useless.

1209
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,841
Wait, wait. Welcome back.

1210
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:34,754
- Woman: Oh, heart.
- Man: Holy shit, that scared me.

1211
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,789
Tameka, it's Brandon!

1212
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,658
Quarantine the brownies

1213
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,358
and send one away
to get tested, okay?

1214
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,358
Okay. Oh, and bring me
a box of Cheez-lts.

1215
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,166
All right, thanks.

1216
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,103
Hey, Brandon,
how does a brownie take a test?

1217
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,851
Brandon over PA:
Attention.

1218
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,259
Can you hear me?

1219
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,992
Hello, this is Brandon.

1220
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:20,763
Um, all uneaten brownies
need to be brought

1221
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,361
to the administration offices.

1222
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,862
Oh, no.

1223
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:25,999
Brandon:
They have been contaminated,

1224
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,202
so, please, don't eat them.

1225
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,404
Please?

1226
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,107
Don't... don't.

1227
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,776
There is no need to panic.

1228
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:39,219
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1229
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,188
Okay?

1230
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,655
Everything is rad.

1231
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,615
Mr. Burke, first time late,

1232
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,587
ever.

1233
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,229
Ah, well, it appears
you've all had a pleasant lunch.

1234
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:25,324
- The salmon was boss.
- And the brownies were to die for.

1235
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,302
So moist, so delicious.

1236
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,567
Oh, my.

1237
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,198
Shit.

1238
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,869
This is a private meeting room.

1239
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,175
You're fuckir with me.
Arert you?

1240
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,671
I'm...

1241
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,547
I just... I didn't
expect it to be so sad.

1242
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,919
All those books,
all that fire, l...

1243
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,454
- Are you done with that?
- Boy: Oh, yeah, go for it.

1244
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,838
- Clean yourself up, Miss Tombs.
- Fuck you.

1245
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,806
Oh, my God.

1246
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,275
Dr. Gordon?

1247
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,904
Brandon wanted me to tell you
that all the marijuana brownies

1248
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,743
have been quarantined.

1249
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,309
Man:
Um, what does she mean?

1250
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,590
Um, there's been an incident,

1251
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,217
but everything's
under control, I assure...

1252
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,955
The brownies we just ate?

1253
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:31,830
They were more than likely,

1254
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:36,531
uh, tainted with, ahem,

1255
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,369
marijuana.

1256
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:46,072
Yes, l... I think you're right.
Do you all feel that?

1257
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,207
It's kind of like my soul

1258
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,616
were swimming
within my own flesh.

1259
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,882
It's rousing.

1260
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,021
I think I just came.

1261
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:59,926
Teacher:
Next up... Mr. Burke.

1262
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,420
Um, "To be or not to be"...

1263
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:29,981
Shakespeare's great question
to his character Hamlet,

1264
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,358
his great challenge
to his audience in 1600

1265
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,660
and today,
over 400 years later.

1266
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,272
Hamlet, huh?

1267
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,332
What a fuckir pussy.

1268
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,900
I mean, I didn't even read it.

1269
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:52,311
I just Netflixed the DVD with
that "Mad Max" douche-bag in it,

1270
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:55,783
but his uncle
iced his father, right?

1271
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,752
Popped an 18-7 up in that motherfucker
and he's talking to ghosts and shit?

1272
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,982
All like, "Daddy, Daddy,
what am I gonna do?

1273
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,047
What am I gonna do?"

1274
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,752
I mean, bitch, grow a pair
of clackers and snap out of it.

1275
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,727
I mean, clearly this dude
needs some help.

1276
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,728
Sad thing is

1277
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:15,134
every time I think about Hamlet,
I think about myself...

1278
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:22,775
too... too cautious, too deliberate,
planned perfection.

1279
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,745
I'm reaching
for the unreachable,

1280
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,715
something that, quite honestly,
I don't think is there.

1281
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,309
And I get caught up in the bullshit
of trying to be perfect.

1282
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,651
I forget about
what's right in front of me,

1283
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:37,352
like the... like the other
aspects of my life.

1284
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:43,792
My mom's gonna love me
whether or not I go to MIT.

1285
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,357
And, you know,
being valedictorian

1286
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,891
is not that big a deal, really.

1287
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,699
I mean, it may seem
important now,

1288
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,535
but in 10 years, you know,
that's just gonna be shit

1289
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,541
that made me miss
the other moments,

1290
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:57,477
the stuff I wanted to do

1291
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,709
but I talked myself out of,

1292
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,480
stuff my heart wants
but logic would trip over

1293
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:09,650
like grabbing life by the balls

1294
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,319
and going after the girl
I always thought was hot.

1295
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,863
She's too hot for me.

1296
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,160
So what's the point?

1297
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:29,100
When you want
so hard for it to be

1298
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,942
and it's just not to be,

1299
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,971
there's nothing
you can do about it.

1300
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,421
Uh, so anyway...

1301
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:50,591
Hamlet's a punk-ass bitch
and Shakespeare's massively overrated.

1302
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,100
Oh, shit.

1303
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:09,645
Oh, fuck.

1304
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,520
Sharky: Yo, Henry.

1305
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,902
I'll go out with you, dude.

1306
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:31,828
Yeah.

1307
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,705
Okay. Well, that's all
I wanted to say.

1308
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,908
# There's a lot of lies #

1309
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:44,578
# I'd like to get out of my head... #

1310
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,518
Jesus.

1311
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:52,259
You're not sayir that because
you're high as fuck right now, right?

1312
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,922
High as fuck right now?

1313
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,897
# Out of my head... #

1314
01:18:56,932 --> 01:19:00,561
- We all are.
- # Out of my head... #

1315
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,842
# Out of my head. #

1316
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:13,609
Hey, I thought we had a deal.

1317
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,450
You know what?

1318
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,284
You can go fuck yourself,
you warped piece of shit.

1319
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,352
Bravo, Henry.

1320
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,368
Salutatoriars
a pretty big deal, too.

1321
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,769
Dr. Gordon:
Tameka, have Brandon pull up

1322
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,358
the surveillance footage
from the gym this morning

1323
01:19:43,393 --> 01:19:45,907
and summon Travis Breaux
and Henry Burke to my office.

1324
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,438
Oh, and put on a fresh pot of coffee.

1325
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:59,793
- Ahh.
- Tameka: Right away, Dr. Gordon, but...

1326
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,819
Dr. Gordon:
No buts, Tameka.

1327
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:06,357
Except yours
in my face, you fuckir...

1328
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:13,398
Tameka: It's just that Travis Breaux
is already here to see you, sir.

1329
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,755
# I know you're livir life
in a hurry #

1330
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,358
# So afraid to take it slow,
'cause reality is scary... #

1331
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:40,663
Tameka over PA:
Henry Burke,

1332
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,863
please report
to the administration office.

1333
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:48,064
Henry Burke, please report
to the administration office.

1334
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,407
Shit!

1335
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:53,175
Where the fuck
is the administration office, man?

1336
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:57,652
# Ooh, oh, how the hell
did shit get so real? #

1337
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,587
# It's hard for me to deal #

1338
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:05,389
# Sometimes I just sit and think,
I thought it would be... #

1339
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:09,454
I've never felt so good in my life!
It feels so good!

1340
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:13,259
It feels so good

1341
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,633
to be alive

1342
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,901
and an assistant dean!

1343
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,875
# I swear I never felt so alive... #

1344
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:26,108
Sunshine! Oh!

1345
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,210
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Man: Goose?

1346
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,051
- It's me. I've got the video up.
- Bitchir.

1347
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:35,852
So I'm just gonna burn a copy
and bring it up

1348
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,222
to Dr. Gordors office, then.

1349
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:40,194
No, wait... no.
No, no, no.

1350
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,219
Make a copy, don't burn it.

1351
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,824
Make a copy and then bring it
to Dr. Gordors office.

1352
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,892
Don't burn it. Idiot.

1353
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,336
Tameka over PA:
Henry Burke, please report

1354
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,862
to the administration office
immediately.

1355
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:55,035
- Aw, shit!
- Busted.

1356
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,567
- What do we do?
- Hide the rest of the evidence.

1357
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,136
Where did we leave it?

1358
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,148
Tameka: "Tameka.
Oh, Tameka, I need my coffee.

1359
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:12,420
Black, extra sugar."

1360
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,826
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1361
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,650
Just set it down.

1362
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,522
My lord,
that's fucking good coffee.

1363
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:57,331
Big day for you,
Mr. Breaux? Yes?

1364
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,799
Yes.

1365
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,575
Fuck!

1366
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:14,183
Girls: Whoa! Hey!

1367
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,858
Just so you know,
I have surveillance footage

1368
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,226
being brought over here right now,

1369
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,926
footage that caught you and all
your demonic acts in plain view...

1370
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:29,130
you and our valedictorian,
Mr. Burke.

1371
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,065
Henry has nothing to do with this.

1372
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:36,202
So, you admit that you did?

1373
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,083
Normally, discipline
is a passive exercise for me.

1374
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,748
On rare occasion
I do relish it.

1375
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,350
I must admit that
when you go down, and...

1376
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,589
Believe me, you will
go down hard for this,

1377
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,894
I will consider it
one of the highlights

1378
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:02,426
of my career... nay, my life.

1379
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:12,246
Henry:
Oh, no, helicopters.

1380
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,622
Nurse:
What? What is he doing?

1381
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,126
What's wrong with that kid?

1382
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,425
I'll admit I'm no gem
of a student,

1383
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,091
and for whatever stress I've put
my teachers through over the years,

1384
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,329
I'm genuinely sorry,
but there's something worse

1385
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,429
than a kid who breaks the rules,
fucks around, tokes down

1386
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:41,670
on a bit of hakeem marijuolajuwon
now and again.

1387
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:44,906
A middle-aged pimp
who pretends to be the judge

1388
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,073
of all that is right
and good in the world.

1389
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:48,980
What happened to you?

1390
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,110
Did you fail miserably
somewhere along the lines

1391
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,484
as a husband?
A parent?

1392
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,045
You think that if you purify

1393
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,752
your Morgan High
Kingdom of Nastiness,

1394
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,089
you somehow purify yourself?

1395
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,651
Is that it?

1396
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,193
Well, the answer is...

1397
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,859
no.

1398
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,340
What the shit?!
What are you doing?

1399
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,144
Get... get out of the van!

1400
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:25,380
- What?
- Get out of my fuckir van!

1401
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,445
You broke the law,

1402
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,889
you dosed the entire faculty
and student body

1403
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:31,915
with hazardous amounts of THC,

1404
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,192
and you are going
to jail, Breaux,

1405
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,495
where you belong.

1406
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,660
Oh, hell...

1407
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,569
What the shit?
You get the fuck out of my van!

1408
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,039
Whoa! Fuck!

1409
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,239
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1410
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,652
Oh, piss is on me!

1411
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:11,365
My God, he is good.

1412
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,428
Checkmate, Navaline.

1413
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,961
Checkmate.

1414
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,109
You should see
your face right now.

1415
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:25,340
You look like my cat,

1416
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,281
Dolly,

1417
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:34,050
just as we pierced her abscess
sans nitrous oxide.

1418
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,522
You prick.

1419
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,438
Tick, tick, tick.

1420
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,218
Are the police here,
God damn it?

1421
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,252
They're on their way.

1422
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,566
Time seems to be moving
very slowly.

1423
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:26,171
Jesus fucking Christ.

1424
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,902
Aw, hell, no.

1425
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:35,142
- What?
- What?

1426
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:39,747
- What?
- What?

1427
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:46,087
Dr. Gordon:
Wha...

1428
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:14,813
Tameka, have any more
of that coffee?

1429
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,381
Oh, yeah, I should score
some of that.

1430
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:19,416
You already drank
all the coffee, sir.

1431
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,121
Brandon: Damn!

1432
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:24,563
- Going to a Huey Lewis concert?
- Why? Is he on tour again?

1433
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,066
Dr. Gordon: Entrez-vous.

1434
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,068
Sorry about the delay.

1435
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,502
Something weird happened
to the ray drive.

1436
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,836
Luckily, though, I was able
to make a back-up

1437
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,501
before everything crashed.

1438
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:37,705
Perfect.
Go on, show it to us.

1439
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:40,213
If a picture is won'th 1,000 words,

1440
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:44,685
then this footage should be
won'th 1,000 pictures,

1441
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,520
which would equal
a million... words.

1442
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:55,226
Dr. Gordon: Uh, Tameka,
bring the Johnson file.

1443
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,528
- Wait, this isn't...
- Dr. Gordon on TV: Shut the door.

1444
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:11,003
- Tameka: Where would you like it?
- The filing cabinet, please.

1445
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:14,606
- Malcolm, what's going on around here?
- I'll show you where I'd like it.

1446
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,482
- Tameka: What is... what... stop it!
- Sweetie, it's all right.

1447
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:20,681
Dr. Gordon, get off!
That's my underwear, Dr. Gordon.

1448
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,384
- What are you doing?
- Stupid elastic. God damn it.

1449
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,517
- Get... get off of me!
- Daddy wants some chocolate!

1450
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,755
Motherfucker,
this ain't "Monster's Ball!"

1451
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,696
- Dr. Gordon, get off! Get off!
- Talk to me, baby!

1452
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:33,826
I don't understand the... l...

1453
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,462
- This is preposterous!
- Tameka: Back up!

1454
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:38,563
You want your nuts stapled together?
Is that what you want?

1455
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:40,369
- No, no.
- What is wrong with you? What the fuck?

1456
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,933
- I'm... I'm...
- Motherfucker, you ain't Billy Bob

1457
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:44,444
- just 'cause you have a porn stash.
- What?

1458
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,505
- Never do that... never do that again.
- I promise I won't, Tameka.

1459
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,641
You don't understand.
My wife has crabs.

1460
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,413
- Ooh.
- I can't help it. I'm...

1461
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,579
You two, you can go now.

1462
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,919
Wait! I've still got your piss.

1463
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,152
I've got your pissss.

1464
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,888
If there's so much
as an errant molecule,

1465
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:04,295
you will have to spend
the rest of your lives

1466
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:07,392
sans a high school diploma.

1467
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:10,871
Psycho Ed: That's assuming
inculpatory facts not in evidence.

1468
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,169
Reveal your identity, sir.

1469
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,437
- Shit, it's a trap.
- What?

1470
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:17,444
The police put a transmitter
in my teeth.

1471
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,140
I'm Edward Esquire,
cheese-dick.

1472
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:24,083
And it violates
"Katz v United States," 1964,

1473
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:25,710
when the Supreme Court
set the standards

1474
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,482
for reasonable
expectations of privacy.

1475
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:32,721
Certainly, one could argue
that piss is highly private.

1476
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,389
Furthermore,
any statements by you

1477
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,456
regarding these
two little assholes

1478
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:41,059
won't stand up
in court because

1479
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,902
you're blind off your gourd on
really high-caliber mari-hoo-hoo, bro.

1480
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:48,776
Drug test his ass, man.

1481
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,835
Would you agree to submit
to a drug test, sir?

1482
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,368
- L...
- Tameka: For the record,

1483
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:54,643
he made it very clear
he didn't have any of the brownies.

1484
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,276
Wha... honey-pie.

1485
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:00,583
Would you agree
to kiss my hairy sack?

1486
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:03,647
If you wanna sue this prick
for workplace sexual harassment

1487
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:06,717
or, uh, score a chronic
sack of doobies,

1488
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:09,389
just, you know, page me.

1489
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:13,161
Uh, Mr. Esquire?
Can I have a card?

1490
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:16,863
Did he molest you, too?

1491
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,668
- Brandon: In my mind.
- Psycho Ed: That's nasty, dude.

1492
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,835
Thanks.

1493
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,488
Dr. Gordon, what do you have
to say to the parents outside?

1494
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:44,657
My... my balls feel all tingly.

1495
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,896
Hi, son.

1496
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,233
- Hi.
- Fuck you.

1497
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,205
Dr. Gordon:
Oh, how pleasant.

1498
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,174
Dispatcher: 10-4. Principal is in
custody, transporting back to station.

1499
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,555
Dr. Gordon:
Take it easy!

1500
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,284
Oh, I don't like that.

1501
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:14,454
My colon.
Oh, my spastic colon!

1502
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,964
Dr. Gordon:
Hey, you bastards!

1503
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:08,815
We should, uh, you know,
kick it again sometime.

1504
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:11,545
Come on, man.

1505
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,247
- Be somebody.
- Oh.

1506
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:18,557
Be somebody.

1507
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,083
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No, no.

1508
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:21,651
- Be somebody.
- Be somebody.

1509
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,789
- Be somebody.
- Got to... got to be somebody.

1510
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:25,196
Twing, twing.

1511
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:26,563
Henry:
Weed done finally kicked in, man.

1512
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,694
Breaux: Yo, that's some
four-dimensional shit.

1513
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:31,967
Where the fuck
is the administration office?

1514
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:34,304
Are you fucking with me?

1515
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,243
- What?
- What?

1516
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:14,142
Mr. Thompson:
Beverage, beverage.

1517
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:18,015
Students: Beverage, beverage.

1518
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,550
Class dismissed.

1519
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:30,622
Director: Cut.
