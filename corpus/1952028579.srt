00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,880
Splinter-2008

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,600
Beat it! I have nothing!

3
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Jesus!

4
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,320
Help!

5
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Oh, my God! No! No!

6
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,000
SPLINTER

7
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,000
Keep out.

8
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,520
Yes, this is undoubtedly...
our campground.

9
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,920
- So...
- So I arrived. Come on!

10
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Help me with this?

11
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Here. There.
Near the pin. Oh, take, take...

12
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh, yeah... You need this...
You need secure...

13
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Thanks for doing this.

14
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,640
What are you talking about? They are made for camping...
I know that at best.

15
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,360
What? Really?

16
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,600
- You know what?
- What?

17
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,520
- I think you will like the camping.
- Yes?

18
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,160
I will say.

19
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,040
The hell with it...

20
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,640
- Did you bring the solution of cockroaches?
- Come on, let întindem camp.

21
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,000
- The engine is hell, baked.
- So you speak, D.

22
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,880
Mexico is closer
than ever. Come on.

23
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,120
No e.

24
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,240
The truck that does not lead
closer, right?

25
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Let's go.

26
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,520
It can not be! I...
Wait. Just keep in there, right?

27
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Okay, we got her.

28
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,280
- I do not!
- Are you okay?

29
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,080
- Well, that e...
- Sure you've hit the hole good?

30
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,040
That... Good... It's good stake?
Because it is short!

31
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,280
Yes... E... yes.

32
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,200
You start to think that maybe
some are not Robinson. That's

33
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Of course we are...

34
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,120
We can not let this beat us.
Okay? As always saying:

35
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,560
"You just have to be more smarter
when we dance."

36
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
- You know against who are more smarter?
- Who?

37
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,040
- Compared to a motel.
- No...

38
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,480
No, we can not discard in favor of
motel. This was not understanding.

39
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,720
Understanding was to have sex
under the stars.

40
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,120
The part that I call home.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,120
- Hold him. His work in November...
- Okay.

42
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
It's okay.

43
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,760
- Are you ready? I keep well?
- Yes.

44
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you kidding?

45
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
Tell me you remember
the "Spartan".

46
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,600
I do not know...

47
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,040
Come here.

48
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,560
Motel... motel... motel...

49
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,360
Come on! Come on!

50
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,760
What are you doing?

51
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
Hey! D!

52
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,680
Those are all things
what we have!

53
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,200
We have need of things,
baby.

54
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,400
Hey... Who is this kid?

55
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,920
What I hate
when I say so...

56
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,240
Here's kid.
Here it is.

57
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,760
Let's go.

58
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,920
You have to keep good girl...
Almost enough.

59
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,320
This is my little Lacey.

60
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,120
Come on, baby.

61
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
You know how old
is this forest?

62
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,160
Oh... No...
please, tell me.

63
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Across the area have not been too
farm forestry.

64
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,840
So, these trees are
entirely untouched.

65
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Some 400 years old,
maybe more.

66
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
Oh, really?

67
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,680
This increased Aging.

68
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,320
You know what... if you spend
half the time in nature

69
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
as you spend
reading about it,

70
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,160
on the night that I sit
the shining stars.

71
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
Come on.

72
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,520
In addition, we spend a day
Anniversary looking us on television.

73
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,040
In the year... to a camp.

74
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

75
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,680
See that tree? It's an oak
Why are at least 300 years.

76
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,160
Please, can we
a moment of silence?

77
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,640
- You know, we got a little heated camp...
- Okay.

78
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,840
For two seconds, mindful of what was
and follow me carefully, OK?

79
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,920
Go to sit together
at a motel.

80
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,040
There will be bugs everywhere,
power is likely to be defective.

81
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,240
My idea is that... will be the most
less comfortable place in the world,

82
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
so why are you crying?

83
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,360
Do you think they come from?

84
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,840
We will not stop until
we will not find an appropriate place.

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,960
If not, I get myself.

86
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,040
Oh, look at that tree. Should
have at least 400 years, right?

87
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Look what's great

88
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,720
Yes... It's an old tree.
I would say we are approaching it

89
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,040
200 meters to see if
roots half out.

90
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
Laugh at me?
Laugh at me when...

91
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,920
I think you are funny.
It's admirable that tree.

92
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,400
I won 't talk about it then.

93
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
What...?

94
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,680
You...?

95
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,240
It's weird. What do there
alone?

96
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,280
Do not show... well.

97
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
What you gonna do?

98
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,880
- Coming here. What you gonna do?
- I do not know. I think it's something weird.

99
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
All right!
Go ahead. Go ahead.

100
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,640
- Maybe it's her... I do not know.
- No thanks!

101
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,680
- God! Are...
- Are you deaf, to hell?

102
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,560
- No! Honey, no!
- Honey, this is good!

103
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Stop engine.
Get out of the car.

104
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,680
No sudden movements. Okay?
Get out of the car.

105
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Get out of the damn car now!

106
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,240
Okay, okay!

107
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,440
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

108
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,880
Released banquets, fast,
Make way for another two.

109
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,560
Wait, D.! You can not change
plan! You said no hostages!

110
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
I know what I said, baby!
I know what I said, okay?

111
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Listen to me. Okay?

112
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,880
I am 64 km. If the bank is closed, no
will open to anybody. Listen to me.

113
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Trust me, do
as it should. Come here.

114
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Come here.

115
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,800
Listen to me. Trust me, right?
Trust me...

116
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,920
Okay, give me a kiss!

117
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,240
Okay, go in front.
Let's go, kid.

118
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,560
It's the second time.

119
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
Well...

120
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,000
- You get in front. Drive.
- Can I drive.

121
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Do not talk, hell with you.
Drive!

122
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
- But... I can not...
- Drive your fucking car!

123
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,760
I can change speeds, ok?

124
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,280
Damn! Get the fuck in the car.

125
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
Hands on the wheel!
Încuietorile to be disabled.

126
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,840
You. In the back. Here.
Lacey sitting in the front. Come on!

127
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
Get in the damn car!

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,720
Everyone feels damn good,
until now?

129
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.

130
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,760
- It's cold.
- It's okay. Wait just quiet.

131
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,280
Let's go!

132
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,640
Well! Well!

133
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,800
A cell phone! Give it to me.

134
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,440
You can not miss.

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Jesus! 5 dollars...

136
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
Does someone money?

137
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,960
You better take it.
See if you can find something for you.

138
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,000
Seth Turner... Polly Watts.

139
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,920
The same address,
different names.

140
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,800
You are not married?
I lost my mind.

141
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,360
Come on, Dennis, is not your job...

142
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,760
Look... we have an "R".

143
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,840
It's a doctorate.

144
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,040
- Are you a doctor?
- Not yet. No.

145
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,880
Write "papers"?

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,080
- What?
- You can write recipes?

147
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,680
No. Is a doctorate in biology.

148
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,680
- Did you see?
- Well you are not a doctoraº bastard!

149
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,840
Where to go?

150
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Just drive there.

151
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,280
If you want to relieve
situation, do not say anything.

152
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,880
Shit! What was that?

153
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,240
I hit something!

154
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,160
- What?
- Ginger...

155
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,160
Ginger? Ginger is dead.
What are you talking about?

156
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,640
What the hell trying to do?

157
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,680
Calm down, Lacey,
will be good...

158
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,040
Bring another rubber. You.

159
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,680
- Bring another rubber!
- I get it. Is not his car.

160
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,960
Is not my car.

161
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,440
You know... I see that you can not do anything!

162
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,920
Do you think Ginger is good?
It's just a puppy!

163
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
Here. If you do
a move, shoot it.

164
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Let's go!

165
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
Go.

166
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,960
Ginger!

167
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,920
Ginger!

168
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,600
OK... It's okay.

169
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,760
It's here, Mom.
It will be good... Okay?

170
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,360
You... Should help.

171
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,240
Come on, biologule,
Ginger needs you!

172
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,000
Are... most likely
that is dead.

173
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,080
To change quickly.

174
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,800
Damn! What the...

175
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,240
It was a help.

176
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,040
Well, well...

177
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,000
It's okay...

178
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,840
It's okay, honey, is a doctor.

179
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,520
I do not care what Dennis says,
well, dear?

180
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
You go home...

181
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,880
...you'll save...

182
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,680
What about it?

183
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,960
- I do not know what e...
- Heal it quickly!

184
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,880
Well... Well...

185
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,680
See, this is...

186
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,880
What was that?

187
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,280
Shit!

188
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,360
What charms hell...

189
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,760
Stay there!
Lacey!

190
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,000
- Honey...
- What happened?

191
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,400
Are you okay?

192
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,680
- Shut up!
- Talk to me!

193
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,840
- You did what?
- Get inside!

194
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,240
Seth! Seth!

195
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,000
Damn!

196
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,040
- What happened?
- You must get out of here!

197
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
What was it?
What happened there, Lacey?

198
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
- I leave here!
- Drive the hell!

199
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,520
Do not let him!

200
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,040
Come on, go ahead,
Ready, Go!

201
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,400
Accelerates!

202
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,600
Are you big enough to look
TV, so step up!

203
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,240
Tell me what happened, Lace.
What happened there?

204
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
He tried
to put a hand on me.

205
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,280
- Who?
- Ginger.

206
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,000
He attacked with her tail.

207
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
What Ginger, honey? Must have been
Any creature in the forest.

208
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,920
You thought, honey.

209
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,520
Yes, let her down...

210
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,640
You saw something there?

211
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,400
When is the last time
you take the pill, Lace?

212
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,880
- No e... is not it, D.
- Come on...

213
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,400
I swear that this is not...

214
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,800
I saw by
some crazy stuff.

215
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Honey, not e... that!

216
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,440
Okay?

217
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,080
I never had
headache yesterday.

218
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,800
I saw that shit up...

219
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,120
Let's say that Ginger tried
you hit the tail...

220
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,360
OK...

221
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,400
A I will take care of you.
I promise that I will do, right?

222
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,960
Radiator bastard... Damn!

223
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,200
We will see that luck
We will change.

224
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,400
Pull over!

225
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,320
- Hey! Where you going?
- The toilet.

226
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,320
- There are only 50 km.
- You must go!

227
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,160
And you told me you fucking Mexico!

228
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,000
I do not want to look
squinting at me.

229
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,400
Everybody that is blue bitch.
I have to do any discrimination. Okay, D?

230
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,800
Lacey.

231
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
Stop.

232
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,160
Tell me you can refuel.

233
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,080
Go ahead.

234
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,560
In the meantime, buy
snacksuri... and biscuits.

235
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,360
Hello!

236
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Damn... Come on...

237
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
Come on, the door bitch!
Damn!

238
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,360
Hey!

239
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey!

240
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,320
That we ease up...

241
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,520
Damn!

242
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,800
- Sorry, I mean...
- Kill me!

243
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Dennis! Dennis!

244
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,600
- What happens?
- Is a man with spiky!

245
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
- Spiky?
- No, no, dear, please...

246
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,040
Hell, Lace,
I did not hear what you say?

247
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,840
In the bathroom is a man!

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,040
It's fucking...

249
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
Damn!

250
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
Back... Lacey, back!

251
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,920
Lacey!

252
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,080
Damn!

253
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,360
Run!

254
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
Damn!

255
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,720
Run!

256
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,640
Seth! Seth! Seth!

257
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,240
Run! Hurry!

258
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,720
Come on!

259
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,400
Come inside!

260
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,040
- Lacey!
- Are you okay? What was that?

261
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,240
What was that?

262
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,440
- Sometimes we did!
- Shit!

263
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,840
Lacey!

264
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
- What are you doing?
- Call for help.

265
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,280
No, no, no!
What are you doing?

266
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,280
Do not think that would come to me?
That we are in that situation.

267
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,320
That you should convict me
bother? Did you know that something is out!

268
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,920
You were in my way!
Not me!

269
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, so things are going
for you, right?

270
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,280
Why are you stupid idiot!

271
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,040
Plans to change!

272
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,160
Hey, man...

273
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,680
Stay out.

274
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
Damn!

275
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,440
Are you okay?

276
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
Let me see.

277
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,720
Damn.

278
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,200
What are you doing? Hey, stop.

279
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,200
She lives.

280
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
Are you crazy? You can not open
door, ok?

281
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,240
It's alive, look.

282
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,560
Well.

283
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,840
We aim to monitor and got to make sure
that thing the car does not move,

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,680
when you open the door.

285
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,920
Why are you doing this?

286
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,920
If you get...

287
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,480
...to close a door
and it will stay closed.

288
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,600
Are you okay?

289
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,360
Can we close.

290
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,560
He has a gun.

291
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,160
- Can shoot through the window.
- But what are gun.

292
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,080
Can hold just six
gunshots, right?

293
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,880
I do not know.

294
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,280
Can shoot twice.
295
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,1000 
And if it has more bullets?
No.

295
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,160
Everything is okay, honey?

296
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,560
Speak.

297
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
Seth, going to kill us.

298
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,840
Look, speaking in
the Statistical

299
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
many people survive luãrilor
if the hostages remain calm.

300
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,280
Cool?

301
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,800
I take you inside.

302
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,120
Okay?

303
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
Do not you move,
do not move.

304
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,080
Talk to me.
Can you hear me?

305
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
Jesus.

306
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,120
It's completely insane.

307
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,880
Ok. I have to shoot inside.
Let's go.

308
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,160
Oh, my God...

309
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,920
Come on...

310
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,160
Here they come, right?

311
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,480
Polly, open the door.

312
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,120
We'll get through this
if we remain calm.

313
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,400
- I screwed up.
- Polly!

314
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,680
- Seth.
- Polly, open the door.

315
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,080
Open the door!

316
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,920
Let him enter.
Polly! Let him in!

317
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,680
Open. Live!
Open the door!

318
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,640
Everything is okay.
Open the door! Are there!

319
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,320
Open the damn door!

320
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
1!

321
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,280
2!

322
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Everything is fine! No, no!

323
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
3!

324
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,840
Do not open the door!

325
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,400
No!

326
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,680
What is... Why is that?

327
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,480
Remove yourself from it.

328
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,280
Seth, come on!

329
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,280
Moving.
In fact, moving from one.

330
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,760
Search blood.

331
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
No! Come on, do not.

332
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,560
Hold on.

333
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,120
See that? I am pursuing.

334
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,200
In fact, my aims.

335
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,760
Take a look at this.

336
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,080
See? E...

337
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
E...

338
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,680
Metabolised.

339
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,600
What?

340
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,000
I do not believe it.

341
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
I think it feeds.

342
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,280
If blood digestion occurs...
That thing there is black excrement.

343
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,200
It is as if absorbed...

344
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,440
...nutritional ingredients
at the cellular level...

345
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,680
Looks like a mold.

346
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,200
What do you mean?
That feeds people?

347
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,480
No, it is likely that feeds
with any animal.

348
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,160
It's something new. Something
I never saw in my life.

349
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,800
What is it?

350
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,120
I think it stopped.

351
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,160
What was that?

352
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,960
Damn!

353
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,560
Well, everything is ok.

354
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,880
- Hey! Hey, man!
- No!

355
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,520
- Jesus.
- No. Come on, do not.

356
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,760
We need, right?
Be. Trust me.

357
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,280
Hey, man!

358
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,760
Look, I can help it, okay?

359
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,520
No longer is it as a person.

360
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,120
Look... Come on, man,
please.

361
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,000
It should come with us, okay?
It should come with us.

362
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,480
You have to live with me, okay?
Stop it.

363
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,320
Okay? Go, baby.
Everything is okay.

364
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,440
Seth, come on.

365
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,080
No longer is it.
Come, baby! No longer is it, okay?

366
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,560
Everything is fine.
Come on.

367
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,520
I think it is open.

368
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,280
Shit.
We need the key.

369
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,200
Go. Go!

370
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
Key to the back door.

371
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,200
Key to the back door...

372
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,880
Key... key.

373
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,560
Key to the door...

374
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,880
It must be somewhere key.

375
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,600
- Can be removed.
- What?

376
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,520
With screwdriver.

377
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,040
Seth, give me a screwdriver.

378
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,720
- Screwdriver?
- Give me a screwdriver!

379
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Well. Where could it be?

380
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,240
We are moving to Mexico...

381
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,240
Both of us wanted a child.

382
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,200
We have a meeting...
In categorically was my girlfriend.

383
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
We have to get out
Gas from this.

384
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,960
Fail.

385
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,520
Hurry up, honey.
Hurry up.

386
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,640
Are you ready?
Come on, at 1,2,3.

387
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Back.

388
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,440
- Okay.
- Put it there.

389
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
Well.

390
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,280
What?

391
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,480
Wait, wait, wait.

392
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,160
He left.

393
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,080
We have to go.
Come on.

394
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,160
Wait a minute.

395
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,560
It stopped.

396
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,080
Let's go.

397
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,560
- Okay.
- Freeze!

398
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,880
Well.

399
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,200
Shit.

400
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
- We must help. Is something out there.
- Please!

401
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
Farell, are arrested.

402
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,880
- Drop the gun and put your hands under your head!
- I understand!

403
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,080
Do not listen to us?
Is something out!

404
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,600
All police in Oklahoma
you seek, Farell.

405
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,960
I know how you look
and you will not get out of here.

406
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,920
- Mrs, you must go in the car, right?
- Go! Take, please!

407
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,440
I care.
You two are safe.

408
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,080
I have to try anything stupid,
right, Farell?

409
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,800
- It's safe if you get in the car.
- I'll be fine!

410
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,360
Climb in the car!

411
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,760
Jesus!

412
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Jesus.
Farell, what did you do?

413
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,680
- Get in the car.
- Listen to me!

414
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,200
We'll go in the car now
and you call the special troops.

415
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,080
Get all the forces of the whole
if the state should be.

416
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,840
Tell him that you have a situation
with the hostages.

417
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,200
- I call...
- Yes.

418
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,240
But I have to go anywhere.

419
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,040

420
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,080
514 answers.

421
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,200
Don 't you get out of sight.
I will get there.

422
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,880
514 answers.

423
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,840
- Boy!
- It's too late.

424
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,880
Boy, are you there?

425
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,480
Run!
Run to get out now!

426
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,560
A...

427
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,920
He took it.

428
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,080
He killed her, Seth...

429
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,560
He killed her.

430
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,560
He killed her and on the other side.
Kill it.

431
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
I '...

432
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,400
A to...
Going to kill us, Seth!

433
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,960
The car is there.
You should go for it.

434
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,080
Shit.

435
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
We can not make the front.

436
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,720
But we have a gun
and have a bat.

438
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,240
You shit.

439
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,240
Have a cracker in your hand?

440
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,360
Lacey was good.

441
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Is not your friend
two money.

442
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,880
Cracker?
444
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,1000 
What helps us, exactly?

443
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,680
Easy, lady.
We can help.

444
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
We must do something!

445
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,160
Okay, here we go
with what we know, right?

446
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,840
No, no. Heck, Seth.
We know that something toxic and deadly.

447
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,560
No, no, we know that this thing got infected
girlfriend. It's a parasite, right?

448
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,960
It uses the host to
to move,

449
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,920
you consume.

450
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,160
It's like a fungus or mold.

451
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,400
Well. What do you mean?

452
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,640
I do not know.

453
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,600
What do you mean is that anyone
is attacked, it will die.

454
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,520
Police called for help, right?
So, someone will come.

455
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,400
She called for help.

456
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,200
Nobody will come.

457
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,360
How do you know that? He said that you wanted.
You are a kind of escape, no?

458
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,640
No. They think that I am entitled
to Mexico.

459
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,600
- But you to head to Mexico.
- Yes.

460
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,320
I head north.

461
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,160
Wonderful.

462
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
Perfect.

463
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,080
What? What is perfect?

464
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,520
Here is a true
national treasure, right?

465
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,520
Yes.

466
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,600
What is between this building
and trees?

467
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,480
Gasoline.

468
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,040
I will spew gas down the stairs,
until it reaches the trees.

469
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,240
Want to get the fire zone?

470
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,920
I'll burn.
We will wait for help.

471
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,320
It will not work.
It will not burn everything.

472
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,520
But there is a gas lighter
accessories for the grill.

473
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,720
You...

474
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,760
Cracker.

475
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,440
Hold... is something crazy.

476
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,000
You know that fire
comes back to us, right?

477
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,800
I will.

478
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,120
What?

479
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,520
Another one. Thank you.

480
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,880
If you are now
outside the door?

481
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,080
We can stop
and to think a little?

482
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,960
That's it going?

483
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,680
It is extremely flammable.

484
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,520
It may be back in this building.
That's a gas station.

485
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,720
- Sit on a huge reservoir of gas.
- I know, honey, I know that.

486
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,280
If we do not get here
car fire...

487
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,840
Machinery fire... well, but I do not like
the idea of being trapped in a burning building.

488
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,200
The parasite just your work.

489
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,040
If you have another idea, go ahead.

490
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,040
Work.

491
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,800
- Stay... wait!
- What?

492
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,360
All you have to do
is to get a.

493
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,240
Do not take more than 3 seconds.

494
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,920
N-creature needs than
3 seconds.

495
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,560
Okay...

496
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,640
What did you think?

497
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,280
Look what we do: We will stick
These together by one

498
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,120
I'll sneak out, we'll hang
radioreceptorul, bring it inside

499
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,080
and we ask for help.

500
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,520
Without open doors, without
to get out without fire.

501
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,440
Okay?

502
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,760
Well.

503
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,600
Right there.

504
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,680
Ok.

505
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,960
Honey, did quite long.

506
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,960
Are you okay?

507
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,440
Yes.

508
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,720
Just that I cut.

509
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,200
So.

510
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,080
You did it.

511
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,920
Damn.

512
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,840
You got it.
Right there.

513
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,880
Get it.
You got it.

514
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,920
You got it.

515
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,600
So.

516
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,440
Bring it on.

517
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,960
So.

518
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,840
So.

519
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,160
Easy.

520
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,200
- So.
- You got it.

521
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,800
Take care!

522
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,200
Damn!

523
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,080
You do!

524
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,720
Hang of it.

525
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,400
Hold it!

526
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,280
Polly!

527
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Polly!

528
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,280
Stop!

529
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,280
Let's go.
Come on!

530
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,320
He left.

531
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,200
It is four feet.

532
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,960
Jesus Christ!
Why would they do that?

533
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,440
Where did he go?

534
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,920
- Think reached him?
- I see him.

535
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,480
I think it would be better to run.

536
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,360
The door is open.
I have to go back.

537
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,960
- Seth?
- It is not there.

538
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,320
Do not move.

539
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,680
What to do?

540
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,400
Run!

541
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,840
Come on!

542
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,080
Go!

543
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,880
Seth!

544
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,560
Do not leave your stick.

545
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,040
Go, Polly!

546
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,920
- Come on!
- Go!

547
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,920
Fuck you!

548
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,880
Remove your window.

549
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,480
We forget.

550
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,200
- How did you know that?
- Not a smart thing.

551
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,880
I think it is right.

552
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,320
Yes, but he followed up here.

553
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,760
Us, in a way.
Do not think.

554
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,040
I think moving on instinct.
Is...

555
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,160
...some cellular level.
Like... uneui root plants.

556
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,000
- Like try to find water.
- Why can not we follow here?

557
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,480
I do not know.

558
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,720
Damn!

559
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,320
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

560
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,160
He caught?

561
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,600
Don 't let you touch.

562
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,960
Do not touch!

563
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,080
Stay away!

564
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,720
Stay away from her!

565
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,840
My God!

566
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,840
Bring a knife.

567
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,280
Lumme!

568
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,880
It is infested.
We have a cut.

569
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,840
Take a knife!

570
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,400
My God!

571
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,520
- What do we do?
- I have a cut.

572
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,440
- What?
- Take anything you put it.

573
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,960
Get that thing out.

574
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,440
Take it!

575
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,200
Try it a cover.
Do not let you touch.

576
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,240
Well.

577
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,000
- You tie it.
- Don 't let you touch.

578
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,720
- That's it?
- Yes.

579
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,760
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

580
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,200
It's okay.
Cut arm.

581
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,520
Push.

582
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,400
Damn, can not reach
the bone with it.

583
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,640
What do we do?

584
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,360
What do we do?

585
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,840
Well.
Three.

586
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,360
One, two,

587
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,000
three!

588
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,960
I'd like to do that
to me when I retire.

589
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,840
Things will end.

590
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,080
That's all.

591
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,760
It appears that we underestimated.

592
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,200
You can change a tire

593
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,600
if you did it
to cut an arm.

594
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,200
I'll keep.

595
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,960
Looks better,
c-did it.

596
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,360
E as in dreams... when you can
things that others do.

597
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,160
- Drink to that.
- I wish to be reached in Mexico.

598
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,560
I wish
should not be left to grass green.

599
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,520
Tãceþi, guys, do not die here.

600
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,480
Still has not finished.
You have to get him to the hospital.

601
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,160
- It is one, right?
- I do not know, I was not.

602
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,040
Medicines made the call empirically.

603
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,200
Do not you read about me?

604
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,080
You shot a cop?

605
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,920
No, he shot me.

606
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,040
I was on the way...

607
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,200
...but last time I told him
that if you do not want to have problems,

608
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,080
you have to give up keys.

609
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,880
I did that and I shot.

610
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,440
Not killed immediately.
I shot him in the column.

611
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
And about a year after...

612
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,880
...I was broke because of bills
medical, and I was in prison.

613
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,160
I know how it sounds,

614
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,760
but I thought that if I leave,

615
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,920
I will do two things:
I pass the border

616
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,000
and I will ensure
that his wife is fine.

617
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,240
What did you want to give him
His wife?

618
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,080
Sounds silly, but...

619
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,240
...if I offered a guy a second
chance, so you should do you.

620
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,280
It is not the strangest held
you have met?

621
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,440
Honey?

622
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,120
Temperature.

623
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,040
You need to check something.

624
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,680
You need to check.

625
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,920
Do not see it.

626
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,600
Be prepared.

627
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,640
It may gathered by the sea.

628
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,840
You see?

629
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,120
Seth?

630
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,040
You see?

631
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,400
Watch this.

632
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,720
That left me in the head.

633
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,800
Why waive me
and goes directly to the car?

634
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,160
Simply hit the car.

635
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,840
Do not come after me.
Nor do I believe that came after me.

636
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,480
Go for the car,
because the car was hot.

637
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,360
I think it detected
the temperature.

638
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,560
It is a simple organism,
searching for food.

639
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,240
Search for the hot and kill him.
The engine was overheat,

640
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,120
So was hot like me.

641
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,400
And therefore we can
track in the refrigerator.

642
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,721
Accurate. It was too cold.

643
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,960
I was invisible to him.

644
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,040
Everything that we have
to do is go

645
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,240
the sheriff 's car
and bring it to the front door.

646
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,240
That thing will follow.
Even you said it.

647
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,440
Yes, but not if my temperature
would be below that of the environment.

648
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,160
Human temperature can reach
32 degrees C before danger.

649
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,040
That means 89.6 Fahrenheit.

650
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,840
Thank God HEATING
Global in July.

651
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,840
All you need to do is
to keep my body temperature below 93

652
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,320
and be like a ghost for him.

653
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,320
And what about the medical emergency?

654
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,400
95.

655
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,360
I will commit suicide.

656
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,320
Not if I keep from 89.6.

657
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,520
Let me rãcesc my hand.

658
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,960
You do not need to prove anything to me.

659
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,400
I know.

660
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,240
If you do not get out of here...

661
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,600
...I will not grab them show
who's the boss.

662
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,560
Try again.

663
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,720
94.

664
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,280
If we do that much,

665
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,640
I will warm lips.

666
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,120
Shut up!

667
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,240
- You'll be all right?
- Yes.

668
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,280
A few degrees less.

669
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,440
It's almost done.

670
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,320
Used to artificially hold
that thing away from you, right?

671
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,960
Are enough?

672
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,440
Hey, sure is ready
you get the car.

673
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,320
We take an eternity when...

674
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,200
No, do not touch me
or you get warm.

675
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,280
Come back!

676
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,880
You know...

677
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,320
...that I will.

678
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,840
I love you.

679
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,920
Things will be better.
I promise.

680
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,920
In some cases', go to Hawaii.

681
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,080
Go!

682
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,520
Go!
Go!

683
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,040
Damn.

684
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,880
Brother...

685
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,360
...you have to move faster.

686
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,240
We need more time.

687
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,560
- Nearly reached.
- So.

688
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,960
This is worse.

689
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,680
Do not see him.

690
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,600
Where did he go?

691
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,000
Hello.

692
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,600
Hello.

693
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,360
Polly not see him.

694
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,200
My God!
My God!

695
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,320
Seth!

696
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,720
Polly!

697
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,600
Seth.

698
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,920
Come on.

699
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,080
Where did it go?

700
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,960
- You see?
- No.

701
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,840
Hold.

702
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,400
Hey.

703
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,840
Hey!

704
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,160
Seth!
Seth!

705
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,000
Fire.

706
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,040
You have to take him to fire.

707
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,920
- Damn.
- Polly?

708
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,440
Polly!

709
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,880
Here.

710
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,840
Are you sure?

711
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,160
Here.

712
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,680
Hold.

713
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,160
Get out!

714
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,640
- Come on. Come on.
- Keep going.

715
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,880
Continue to run.

716
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,760
You bastard.

717
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,520
Dennis?

718
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,960
Go, go.

719
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,880
Let me see.

720
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,520
- No.
- Must finish, Doc.

721
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,840
Hold.

722
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,520
Take that.

723
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,520
Go to the bank...

724
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,240
