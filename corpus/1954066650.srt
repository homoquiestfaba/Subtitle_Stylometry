2
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,503
Step.

3
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,104
What is that, Lou?
- Jewellery and a balaclava.

4
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,546
The car of a thief.
Nice catch.

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,305
Where to go?
- The workshop. We demolish him!

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,741
Stop, come back.

7
00:01:10,110 --> 03:14:09,000
My car.

8
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,027
Leave that stuff but. What are you doing?

9
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,345
One thing I quickly.

10
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,344
If you show fear,
calculates this city with you.

11
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,103
Rule two: Pick up the spoils
without much fuss.

12
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,501
Rule Three: Do not open your mouth.

13
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,939
Unless you are at the dentist.

14
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,347
Only if you bring it out alive.

15
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,421
And I did it.

16
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,938
The question is: What should I
with life in 't prospect?

17
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,588
Crazy. When I look back,
everything has changed. Everything.

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,504
There are a hundred guests
who want to kill me.

19
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,346
I see.
A coward dies a thousand times.

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,978
I die but once.

21
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,543
Our gang, the Rampers, was just
the reserve bank of the Cosa Nostra.

22
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,498
Everyone wanted to participate in the highest division.

23
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,629
The question was: Who is
the first 't field in sent?

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,989
"I made him a offer he could not refuse."
- Even my grandmother mimics Brando better.

25
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,019
"If my son by lightning
affected, I blame you. "

26
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,627
The best was: "Leave the gun but are,
but take the cannoli's it. "

27
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,466
"Fredo, you're my brother and I love you,
but once you never against the family. "

28
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,780
Look at that moment.

29
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,419
I get palpitations.

30
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,786
Joey, join us.
- Sammy, how are you?

31
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,941
I'll be right back.

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,705
What are you doing out?
- We'll go drinking.

33
00:03:29,870 --> 08:51:21,000
We are going to gamble?

34
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,584
Put Camille greetings.

35
00:03:37,750 --> 11:28:06,000
The best.
- I'll see you in the "Push-Push".

36
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,348
You wish.

37
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,899
There you have it not for tools.

38
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,779
We go.
- Why?

39
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,704
Suzy 'Cream Cheese' wait.
- On a sandwich.

40
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,868
I must go.
- What did you do?

41
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,305
I got up early for school.

42
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,859
For beauticians.

43
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,668
Do you love me for a fool?

44
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,869
Did I say that?
- You're not a sissy?

45
00:04:15,030 --> 05:58:59,000
These girls were to get eaten
and I'm the only normal guy.

46
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,661
What are you doing? This is much too short?

47
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,821
Do you see that?

48
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,100
I want to look like Vogue.

49
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,989
Shut up and let me do my job.

50
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,506
What did you say?
- I'm so ready.

51
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,539
Look what you've done.

52
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,022
In the five years that I come here,
I have never been treated.

53
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,942
Louie with his plans.

54
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,580
You know what you should be?
Construction Worker.

55
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,020
This is not a job.
- Where do you find these broads?

56
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,148
Those broads I do not.
- What then?

57
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,189
If I see her, I know.
Someone with intelligence, character.

58
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,104
Someone who suits me.
- You know Nicky Scibetta's sister?

59
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,501
Debra?
- That's a girl with class.

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,701
Sometimes you have never seen a girl standing ...

61
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,704
But ... if you r d better learn
know, it's touch.

62
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,984
So it was with Debra.

63
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,185
Could. I've never been outside
New York.

64
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,144
I did some traveling.

65
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,939
Florida, LA.
- What did you say?

66
00:05:47,110 --> 14:30:00,000
I had to get out.
I wanted to be an actor.

67
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,109
How long have you been there?
- Two weeks.

68
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,943
Then it was really serious.

69
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,343
They said I was too small.
But I have a nice head.

70
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,466
They talk but what.

71
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,341
You also have a nice cup
and I find not too small.

72
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,023
Cute girl, huh?

73
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,149
She is the faithful type.
They will not let you down.

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,302
I told you it was a girl with
class was?

75
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,544
I also have one and it's serious.
- You serious? Make it equally.

76
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,862
Her name is Linda, she's a Jewish.
She was five o'clock this morning with me.

77
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,989
Then you must be tired.
- We have hacked phones.

78
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,699
I want to be there
d'r when you propose to your mother.

79
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,861
I love her.

80
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,669
How is she?
- Beautiful.

81
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,419
Lefty, Tony, how is he?

82
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,463
I'll see you later.
- I want that Jewish ever seen.

83
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,418
What kind of job?
- According to my uncle you can.

84
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,707
Someone 'm screwed.
- I beat it well together.

85
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,942
That's not enough.
This is a big job.

86
00:07:09,110 --> 03:20:44,000
I'll do anything you ask.

87
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,783
We went for a drink with Joey Colucci.

88
00:07:16,950 --> 06:10:39,000
We went home.
This would change my life.

89
00:07:27,270 --> 08:54:07,000
And he wins as fifteen thousand.
- And it's still a loser too.

90
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,298
He always wins. I do not understand.

91
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,940
You do not have to be smart to
to win the lottery.

92
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,180
What is this noise?
- T-Rex. From England.

93
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,262
It's not that bad.
- That they prohibit.

94
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,708
I think it's good.
- Is there no Italian music?

95
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,579
Let him listen as he likes.

96
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,709
That I forgot.
This is Joey's evening.

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,540
Tony just wanted the wife of Joey.

98
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,703
Shortly afterwards he married her.
The bastard.

99
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,705
The next day I noticed something.

100
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,703
I had no regrets or guilt.

101
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,465
I felt only one thing: Power.

102
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,180
What expectations do you have for?
From the life I mean.

103
00:08:59,350 --> 00:39:18,000
Married. Two, three children ...

104
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,620
That's a big garden.

105
00:09:07,790 --> 03:25:23,000
I love horses.
- I also, at the racetrack.

106
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,464
I have not got all day.
Is it going to?

107
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,221
Not bad, huh?
- It's beautiful.

108
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,462
And what do you expect from life?

109
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,867
Give me but Manhattan.
- Do you live there?

110
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,544
No, I mean the building there.

111
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,429
One day I want to be able to say:

112
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,629
"See that building over there?
I've worked on. "

113
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,739
You have big dreams. I like that.
- You must also be true.

114
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,664
I will not stay all my life
one hustler.

115
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,345
I've heard about you. You are notorious.

116
00:09:59,590 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you mean?

117
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,300
I will be good for you. I promise.

118
00:10:15,670 --> 06:09:46,000
Toddo Aurello, a capo of the
Gambino family wanted to see me.

119
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,188
I had found the right woman
and I had a goal.

120
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,342
I played in the top division.

121
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,980
How are you?
- Say Toddo.

122
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,987
You know the ropes.

123
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,587
They had seen me fight
with a boy who had stolen my bike.

124
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,505
When they called me Sammy "The Bull"
and has since remained so.

125
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,982
I have orders from the top.
You work for me now.

126
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,063
Paul Castellano.
- No names like.

127
00:10:57,230 --> 00:29:29,000
You apply twice a week with me.
- Clear.

128
00:11:06,910 --> 03:20:41,000
And they can only deal with you
my permission.

129
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,981
Can you handle that?

130
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,981
You bet.

131
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,662
Only Sevito and I play this game.
The other cards and laughing at us.

132
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,345
I know this game.

133
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,142
These are the pawns. Which should
protect important documents.

134
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,949
As the runner and the horse.

135
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,580
In our borgata, our family,
that the capos.

136
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,345
Which in turn protect the king.

137
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,503
These should always be covered.
He should never be free.

138
00:11:49,630 --> 14:28:07,000
Does not matter.

139
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,421
Toddo took me in and took me
under his wing.

140
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,467
He was my second father.

141
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,943
My father was a goeierd,
but that he was cheated.

142
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,104
He had to be protected
by people like Toddo, people like me.

143
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,501
What are you staring at?

144
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,309
Sammy, come here.

145
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,986
This is Sammy 'The Bull'. Let him inside.
- You're a celebrity.

146
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,425
You do not have to wait.

147
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,662
If anything, ask for
Mikey 'The Bat'.

148
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,582
And my buddy Louie?

149
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,186
If he hears you, he's okay.
Have fun.

150
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,301
Toddo let me turn up every day.

151
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,985
I watched as he was at work.

152
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,539
He steamed me ready for life.

153
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,709
I did not bother.

154
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,509
Does not matter. Sit down.

155
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,745
That guy whined but
money on his credit.

156
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,868
Then asked Toddo what to do.

157
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,989
I said: "We are looking at the other guy
and break his legs. "

158
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,983
Then Toddo that person come.

159
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,028
And who came up with a different story.

160
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,664
What do you think of these?

161
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,219
This should be your pick.

162
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,510
I think they are equal.
- And yesterday you believed that other.

163
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,582
Everyone has their own story.

164
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,947
But you must listen to both parties.

165
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,669
If you decide to participate, without either
to hear stories, do not you long.

166
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,025
That will be your downfall.

167
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,339
Folks, go all equally stand.

168
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,388
We drink at Sammy Gravano.

169
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,226
Sammy and Debra, I have given you more or
more linked.

170
00:14:07,390 --> 03:25:48,000
But now it's up to you,
so do not come complaining.

171
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,469
I drink to Sammy Gravano.

172
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,623
The nicest guy in Bensonhurst.
- Do not overdo it.

173
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,425
Where's that kiss?

174
00:14:30,190 --> 09:04:28,000
I love you.

175
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,388
You must believe it. Cheers.

176
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,509
A man is nothing without a good woman.
- I 'il drink.

177
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,629
With us is not true.
We do it every night ten rounds.

178
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,419
You need a woman to take you into a
punch down gets.

179
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,947
What is he yet again romantic.

180
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,422
How about you and Linda?
- We are thinking about.

181
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,104
She is a lot, but she can cook?

182
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,706
She is Jewish, she can not boil water.

183
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,986
Then you are a hungry jew.

184
00:15:18,150 --> 06:19:19,000
If you're hungry, you eat it with me.

185
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,624
I'll drink to.
- On the friendship.

186
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,621
I'm here.

187
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,939
I told you what the
would be between you?

188
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,749
Who is this?
- A buddy of mine.

189
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,787
Do you mind?

190
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,142
What is that? That powder in your nose?

191
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,948
We feast.

192
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,499
Your parents are there. Mine too.

193
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,743
Have you no respect?
- Sure I have respect.

194
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,583
Keep it fun. Good?

195
00:16:57,470 --> 00:42:09,000
What a great night.
Everything was perfect.

196
00:17:06,430 --> 03:24:45,000
But I was not reassured.
Nothing lasts forever perfect.

197
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,106
I did not ruin the evening,
So I thought of it no more.

198
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,861
Paul Castellano, Sammy Gravano.

199
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,748
Sit down.

200
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,545
You know why you're here?

201
00:17:49,710 --> 14:28:03,000
Sure.

202
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,825
Look around you.

203
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,145
Do you know anyone here?

204
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,106
Get your men and respect them?

205
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,942
Sure.

206
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,869
We allow you to our family
which belongs to the Cosa Nostra.

207
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,662
This insert this brotherhood
above God, above the state ...

208
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,869
Above ... and your family. Is that clear?

209
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,748
That is clear.

210
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,188
If we call you
and your son or daughter is sick ...

211
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,539
... Or even dying, then you immediately
and get them back.

212
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,745
I see.

213
00:18:46,910 --> 14:39:40,000
If we ask you to kill us,
do you do that?

214
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,619
Which finger pull the trigger?

215
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,988
They do not come to each other's wife
and kill each other.

216
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,986
If you have this oath,
love you for always secret.

217
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,780
If you violate the law of omerta
or betray the brotherhood ...

218
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,147
May your soul ... then burn
as this saint.

219
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,065
I see.

220
00:20:04,830 --> 03:26:18,000
You are now part of the Cosa
Nostra as a member of the Gambino family.

221
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,548
Congratulations.

222
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,101
In this brotherhood went
to honor, respect and loyalty.

223
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,139
The day of my admission
was the most beautiful of my life.

224
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:54,066
I no longer wanted to fight
and steal cars for acorns.

225
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,189
I wanted fixed income.
Something tangible.

226
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,229
Go ahead.
- These are your new companions.

227
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,585
I have no companions.

228
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,980
Now it is. You work for us.

229
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,301
Clear? We take over the business.

230
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,588
That's just not.
What gives me that?

231
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,186
You do too. You'll get your cut.

232
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,227
Come here.

233
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,063
And we'll let you live.

234
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,586
That does it for you.
Pour into something.

235
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,902
Do they do it?
- Yes, of course.

236
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,024
A beer from your own tap
tastes a lot better.

237
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,183
Especially because my boys.
My gang.

238
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,341
It's good. It has been running for more
than the "Push Push".

239
00:21:59,510 --> 00:43:02,000
Soon they could close.

240
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,625
What kind of business?
- A construction company.

241
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,987
But the construction is unknown terrain.

242
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,459
We knew nothing of clubs.

243
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,464
Now Phil Catrelli gone,
we can expand.

244
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:25,500
With our contacts with the Teamsters
will the money will flow.

245
00:22:25,670 --> 08:59:43,000
If you think it is something, I do it.
- I already have an office at Stillwell.

246
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,866
Who does he think he is, Don Juan?

247
00:22:38,030 --> 11:52:20,000
That's John Gotti gang of Neils
of Ozone Park.

248
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,187
He has made Mick still cold?
That Gambino's nephew killed?

249
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,866
I walk a while back.

250
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,306
Gotti was also a rising star.

251
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,746
Now he came with his buddy
View the competition.

252
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,062
John, how are you?
- Nice to see once.

253
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,540
This is my size. Angelo Ruggiero.

254
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,826
Do you know Mickey 'the Bat'?

255
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,989
So now you're here?
- Yes, now we're here.

256
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,618
I hear good things about you.

257
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,781
I about you.

258
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,783
Already long free?
- A few months. That was nothing.

259
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,661
Do not you played baseball?
- At Wake Forest. Until injury.

260
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,625
What do you think of the Giants?
- Worthless. Can not win.

261
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,782
They have given me three grand cost.

262
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,181
Of betting only
the bookies better.

263
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,069
You're right. So it is.

264
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,062
Is also gambled?

265
00:23:57,230 --> 00:49:08,000
A little dice and stuff.
And with you?

266
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,709
We have a lot TVs.
Wish you a few Sony's?

267
00:24:08,830 --> 03:41:47,000
You do not go into details.

268
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,822
Grant my friends in something.
- Coming up.

269
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,907
So you have the funeral
Gambino missed.

270
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,939
Very sorry I was not there
to say goodbye to Carlo.

271
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,022
It was great. Everyone was there.

272
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,945
Police, friends, politicians.
Certainly a thousand people.

273
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,227
He was loved.
- Definitely.

274
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,270
What do you think about Big Paul?

275
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,740
He's the boss. Right?

276
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:57,423
Not as Carlo. He sits there on that
hill, away from his soldiers.

277
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,979
Carlo never left us in the lurch.

278
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,143
He was a lion and a fox.
He had power.

279
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,386
Real power.

280
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,620
And brains.

281
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,101
On you.

282
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,421
On you and on us.

283
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,342
The future.

284
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,345
I was impressed.
A smart boy.

285
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,741
Something too flashy, but a real guy.

286
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,982
I knew we would ever work.

287
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,266
What are you doing? Everything is controlled,
tires, lights ...

288
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:49,140
Concrete and steel, the best business there is.

289
00:25:49,310 --> 14:40:46,000
What is it?
- Who are you?

290
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,103
If so, we lay quiet.

291
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,546
How dare you three dollars per cubic
meter questions?

292
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,579
I have magic concrete. Your problems
disappear like snow before the sun.

293
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,947
This is pure theft.
- What is that guy?

294
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,343
What nerve. Here I would like to know more.

295
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,907
Go ahead.
Bring on those cars.

296
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,780
I had other things on my mind.
I had a family to support.

297
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,466
Money is not everything, but it will come
in the first place.

298
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,349
I did everything for money.

299
00:26:37,510 --> 11:58:29,000
Predatory Practices, hospitality, construction,
you name it.

300
00:26:45,910 --> 14:47:41,000
To the delight of Castellano,
which are 20 percent pocketed.

301
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,308
Big Paul was very happy with me.

302
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,984
He knew he could count on me.

303
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,063
I had Johnny Keys cold make.
A wrong capo.

304
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,141
Where is Paul saying?

305
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,266
I had to do this right.

306
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,421
He's on his way.

307
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,505
You just said also al
Should I wait?

308
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,868
He is certainly in a file.
The traffic is a disaster.

309
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,426
Troublesome ball.

310
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,387
You call that wave?
What is your disability, 40?

311
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,347
Why, disability?

312
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,707
What clubs do you use?
I get mine here.

313
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,504
Dirty rat. You tricked me.

314
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,787
Just walking by, nothing happens.

315
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,781
What did he say?
- My heart.

316
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,510
What should we do with him?
- What is it?

317
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,505
I have heart problems.
The pills are in my pocket.

318
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,587
Is it?

319
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,741
Come.

320
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,424
If you want me to finish, then do it.

321
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,502
But let me not die of a heart attack.

322
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,185
It's okay. But quietly.

323
00:28:28,870 --> 09:17:08,000
Call Paul. Say that we have him.

324
00:28:36,950 --> 11:53:02,000
You had me pretty tuk.
You have played your part well.

325
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,546
He has no money.

326
00:28:59,790 --> 00:58:41,000
Check it out.

327
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,908
Forget it.
- I'm not doing anything. This is a family matter.

328
00:29:17,510 --> 06:22:39,000
It's not personal.
I get my orders.

329
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,825
35 years. You call that friendship?

330
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,903
So is life.
- That Paul. Dirty liar.

331
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,507
Watch your mouth. Do not talk
about my boss. Clear?

332
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,098
Before you do it,
I want to ask you two things.

333
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,900
He must be an expert.
- That is my size though.

334
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,268
I promised my wife
I would die without shoes.

335
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,342
May I take off?
- Is that all?

336
00:30:00,510 --> 01:01:03,000
That's all.

337
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,141
Why had those shoes now?

338
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,189
That's between me and my wife.

339
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:42,508
That's a real guy.
He accepted it.

340
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,865
He was a real gangster.

341
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,544
He was not afraid.

342
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,985
I think it's a shame.

343
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,710
Tonight I do not sleep because of that
shoes question.

344
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,338
He was a real guy.

345
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,783
We were called by the White House.
Big Paul was satisfied.

346
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:22,423
One-third, one-third. I want a third
of money. One third of all.

347
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,546
I pass it on.

348
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,101
The Chinese, the Jews and the rest
get more than enough.

349
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,148
I'll talk to 'Fat Man'.
We get it though.

350
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,301
Would you like a cookie?

351
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,099
All talk to the President.
I want that money.

352
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:46,261
Something else. We have a
problem with 'Fat' Angie of Gotti.

353
00:31:46,430 --> 14:50:10,000
He deals drugs. And for my part, he
the nephew of the Pope or Neil.

354
00:31:56,990 --> 01:03:45,000
John might be a gambler,
but he is not a drug dealer.

355
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,699
He pays his debts than that
plumbing business?

356
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,906
You can not do with toilet seats sales.

357
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,269
I find this is just out.
- You do that.

358
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,261
Sammy and his buddy there.

359
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,348
I need to stretch our legs.

360
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,627
How are you? Nice to see you again.
Do you already Louie?

361
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,739
You carpentry runs well, I hear.
- It's excellent.

362
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,779
Louie Di Bono's business runs
very well. Right?

363
00:32:37,950 --> 12:03:05,000
I want you to cooperate.

364
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,782
Sounds good to me.
- I'm fine.

365
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:55,344
I'll talk to the Teamsters.
A little lubrication, then runs it better.

366
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,140
From you we should have.
I'm counting on you.

367
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,460
We will not disappoint you.

368
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:13,226
We go next week hunt? I must
my new Winchester adjustment.

369
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:18,384
This life of ours is very nice,
but also unpredictable.

370
00:33:18,550 --> 06:26:09,000
Before you know it, you fucked up.

371
00:33:27,550 --> 09:13:25,000
You must be on your guard for
the people around you.

372
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,701
I will.

373
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,545
Why do not you help at home?

374
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,580
Watch your mouth.
- Can not help pay the boss?

375
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,221
You are in his house.
Something you do not say. Clear?

376
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,746
You made this?

377
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,299
Sure.
- What can you cook.

378
00:34:08,470 --> 03:47:41,000
Taste my marinara but once.

379
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,826
Mikey is faithful to me.
He's with me, are not you?

380
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,140
That you can shake.

381
00:34:25,470 --> 09:21:39,000
John and I had become friends.
I felt I had to warn him.

382
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,660
You should see what a freak.

383
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,185
That's my brother.

384
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,502
Remember, this is just between us.

385
00:34:47,670 --> 14:53:09,000
He thinks that 'Fat' Angie and you
drugs act.

386
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,186
I only drink sometimes a glass.
Angelo and does not deal in drugs.

387
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,865
If I notice that he is lying,
then he goes out.

388
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,909
Frank DeCicco chose your side.
- He's a good guy.

389
00:35:08,070 --> 03:42:47,000
What are they doing now?
- They seek it out.

390
00:35:16,630 --> 06:26:07,000
I see no evidence of this.
- I know you do not see.

391
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,182
I do not want to ruin it for you,
but keep your eyes open.

392
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:33,140
Because if you blink,
He cheats on you before your eyes.

393
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,143
Then I will not blink.

394
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,188
John and I were playing chess.

395
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,470
We just did not
how the game would end.

396
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,101
Johnny V, 500.
- Dear guy, Johnny V.

397
00:35:49,270 --> 14:58:50,000
Dog is still showing up?

398
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,222
I'll talk to him.

399
00:35:56,390 --> 00:55:05,000
Should I send Joe?
- No, I see him on Friday at the construction.

400
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,983
Joe, we need you here.

401
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,823
Hurry up with that coffee.

402
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,989
With Debra.
- Hello, how are you?

403
00:36:17,150 --> 06:39:00,000
Say it.
- Can I just Sam? It's important.

404
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,306
Debra I have for you.

405
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,748
I'll call her back.
- She says it's important.

406
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,229
What has he been up to now?

407
00:36:40,270 --> 12:12:23,000
You must help him.

408
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,468
I'm really sorry.

409
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,348
I do not wanna hear.

410
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,549
He called me a sissy.
What was I supposed to?

411
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,065
Who was it?
- Bobby Giordano.

412
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,781
His father runs in the family.
Become anyway once wisely.

413
00:36:57,950 --> 00:56:41,000
If they scold, shoot.
Would you do the same.

414
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,309
Are you still working on that powder?
What did I say?

415
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,348
I quit.
I will improve my life.

416
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,707
And do not lie to me. Never do that.

417
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,986
I swear. I quit.

418
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,062
This was the last time. Clear?

419
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,465
That's not all.
What do you think Scibetta doing?

420
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,305
He insulted the niece of Frankie D.

421
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,268
What did he say?
- That's what I'd rather not.

422
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,621
He used drugs, acting drugs.

423
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,749
He talks too much. He is a sentinel.

424
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,663
Who says that?
- Everybody knows it.

425
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,942
Louie, you know this trade it off.

426
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,420
And Sammy?
- They do not need to know.

427
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,981
He's my best friend.
Should I be his brother ...

428
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,664
... Then he. Understood?

429
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,541
Where is that steel?

430
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,827
It's hard to get good people.

431
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,981
It is not a vacation.

432
00:38:19,030 --> 06:36:18,000
Hi there Lou. How's it going?

433
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,989
I need to talk. I'm telling you
honest, because we are old friends.

434
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,629
What is it?

435
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,465
I must make Nicky cold.

436
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,825
Go away. He's just a loser.

437
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,107
I could just break his legs?

438
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,980
It's too late. He bullshit too much.
They think he betrays them.

439
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,269
That stupid jerk. He sits me all cross
since my wedding.

440
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,105
Whether you like it or not,
it happens anyway.

441
00:38:59,270 --> 01:03:25,000
Do you understand my position?

442
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,703
He dug his own grave.

443
00:39:16,150 --> 06:40:08,000
For Paul and I went with Di Bono
and I made Johnny Keys off.

444
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,183
When I look back, I know
that Paul was already off me wild.

445
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,102
Nicky, how are you?

446
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,346
For whatever job you?

447
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,580
A jewelry store.

448
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,344
Should I drive? All right.

449
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,980
If I bring in need,
it is also best.

450
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,744
That we discuss later.

451
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,068
What is it?

452
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,543
Nothing.

453
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,581
What is it?

454
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,499
What did I do?

455
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,304
In and around the central building of
Jonestown are 400 bodies were found.

456
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,906
That all those idiots themselves poison.

457
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,067
My parents called.
Nicky's been two days.

458
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,619
He will be at the celebrations.

459
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,862
But he calls them always.

460
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,789
Do not worry.
He'll turn up. As always.

461
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,462
I did not know him
would be cut in pieces.

462
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:17,183
Lord, the dead are with You and Your saints
rejoice in gladness.

463
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,583
Hear the prayers for Nicholas
Scabetti, who passed away ...

464
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,628
... And give him eternal joy.

465
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,669
We ask this through Jesus Christ.
Amen.

466
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,584
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

467
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:39,108
Our Father who art in Hemele, Your Name
hallowed be Thy Kingdom come ...

468
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,308
It's a shame.

469
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,189
Who can do anything now?

470
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,899
He was such a sweet kid.
He had a good heart.

471
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,858
He loved everyone.
Of the children.

472
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,383
I know.

473
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,709
We must find out who did this.

474
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,465
And we need to make them pay for this.

475
00:42:28,510 --> 09:19:50,000
I will say to the boys.

476
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,149
Sorry.

477
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,180
I know how bad this is.

478
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,148
We have also lost a son.

479
00:42:49,310 --> 14:58:20,000
We will always remember you.

480
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,581
Thank you guys came.

481
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,543
Strength.

482
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,345
Did I say I was?

483
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,825
You get the money.

484
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,106
I give you my word.

485
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,024
I like you,
but you lapse into repetition.

486
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,739
I'm Joe Bertinelli
Gialucci of Concrete for you.

487
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,107
Now, no phone calls.
I'll call him back.

488
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,903
I do not threaten,
So make me not one of them.

489
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,548
I know there is something on.

490
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,660
I have a house in Jersey.
It has long been in the family.

491
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,185
And I want you to have.

492
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:58,788
Debra had been through a lot. I wanted
her and the children a favor.

493
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,906
And it seemed to me something.

494
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,544
You can have it.

495
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,628
How do you like it?

496
00:44:16,790 --> 06:44:59,000
You did not say it was furnished.
- That was the price.

497
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,342
Our first apartment fits in that kitchen.

498
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,348
Do you remember our first night out?

499
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,863
The horses?

500
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,146
Do you remember that?

501
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,585
This garden is large enough.

502
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,948
Wish you the barn on fire sometimes stabbing?

503
00:44:49,430 --> 15:06:19,000
Acorn, what are you doing?

504
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,390
This is a robbery.

505
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,140
This one I just bought.
- Are you going to hunt elephants?

506
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,141
Where are your clothes?

507
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:13,269
You lost yesterday,
you must clean up.

508
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,661
It is well our horses,
I make nothing but clean.

509
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,709
You lost, so to work.
Give him the shovel.

510
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,670
Not bad, huh? She's pretty good.

511
00:45:28,830 --> 09:31:23,000
I must say, this was the one.

512
00:45:40,030 --> 12:20:02,000
How are you?

513
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,099
Come on, now you.

514
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,068
Dad has rescued animals.

515
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,745
How did you get that?
- The butcher wanted to kill them.

516
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,502
Dad has saved them.

517
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:00,186
What was I supposed to? I saw those eyes
and when I had to.

518
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,262
Get in, we're about to eat.

519
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,944
Good thing you did not cows.

520
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,945
I bought a horse.
Took me 30 grand, 'Golden Passion'.

521
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,784
It's a whopper. In a few years
he goes running races.

522
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,340
Nicky 'Cowboy' is on the phone.

523
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,068
What is it?

524
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,988
We have a problem.

525
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,583
Forget it, Shirley.

526
00:46:29,830 --> 09:28:23,000
How you doin '?

527
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,985
You mess with the books.
- I'm not cheating.

528
00:46:39,150 --> 12:24:23,000
I can show you.

529
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,107
The only thing I want to see is money.

530
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,502
It goes on to bribe
the Teamsters and auditors.

531
00:46:49,670 --> 15:11:45,000
Is it my money?
- Exactly.

532
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:57,742
I will not cheat.
- I've never stolen money from you.

533
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,142
If you sew me, you're dead.

534
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,146
Di Bono complained to Big Paul I
had threatened him.

535
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:20,101
He wanted me dead. I had to
Castellano come. This was bad.

536
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,821
You have no evidence against Di Bono.

537
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,905
Deny that you threatened him.
It's your word against his.

538
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,585
I'm not gonna lie.
I tell it like it is.

539
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,469
Sometimes you live in a different world.

540
00:47:36,630 --> 12:18:05,000
If you do, put them
you offside or you die.

541
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,426
You're right, I just deny it.

542
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,983
So it went. 'T One moment I was
the darling ...

543
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,825
And ... it was another moment my life
at stake.

544
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:19,106
We are together because Salvatore
Gravano them is accused ...

545
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:24,822
That ... he is a holy rule of
Cosa Nostra has violated.

546
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:29,825
Louie Di Bono says ...

547
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:36,828
That this brother ... his confrere has
attacked and threatened with death.

548
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:42,990
Di Bono has given us access
in his books.

549
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,348
There is no evidence that he has deceived you.

550
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,582
Or that he has harmed you.

551
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,346
Is it true that you him with death
have threatened?

552
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,266
I threatened him.

553
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,144
Friends I never threatened.

554
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:19,068
But this scab ... He is
a festering, a liar and a thief.

555
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,382
You go too far.
- No, Frankie.

556
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:29,261
He goes too far. He has everyone
at this table robbed.

557
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,945
Give me a gun, I make you here
cold spot.

558
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,578
I make that fat guy off.

559
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,904
How dare you say that?
Who are you to talk so disrespectfully?

560
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,821
Only I decide on the death of the
members of this family.

561
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,265
I swear ...
- You deserve death.

562
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,900
I swear, I'm not lying.
- Calm down.

563
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:59,428
Sammy has gone too far.
I understand you.

564
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,627
But I am sure that he
truth.

565
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,661
He had everything to deny.

566
00:50:07,830 --> 04:00:59,000
But here is a man of honor,
of principles.

567
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,506
Well then.

568
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,979
But the next time ...

569
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,904
You ... that crosses the line,
you die.

570
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,543
Where was the honor and loyalty?

571
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,178
Where was the brotherhood?

572
00:51:06,350 --> 03:54:46,000
Each week brought Di Bono Paul
the envelopes with my money.

573
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:20,140
There is a saying: "Keep laughing even
you're screwed. "

574
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,701
But after that time it was hard
against Paul to laugh.

575
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:33,547
Against John Paul has said that
anyone who does drugs, it goes.

576
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,101
He has something against drugs because he himself
never been poor.

577
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,830
Then everything went wrong.

578
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,141
I have some furniture ingested.

579
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,699
So we can talk?

580
00:51:46,870 --> 15:08:01,000
I have everything checked.
This is the phone of my daughter.

581
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,863
How much is it?

582
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,421
Thirty seats. Street Value sixty,
seventy balloons.

583
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,900
Call the movers then.

584
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,107
I say so often:

585
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:13,263
"Who's dealing, playing with fire.
If they catch you, going down. "

586
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,458
Fat Angie and Gene were caught. John
got them free and gave them along.

587
00:52:18,630 --> 06:51:02,000
This was it. It has now ended.

588
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,141
They only have that tape.

589
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:32,749
You're full of shit too. If the phone
pick up, you hear all those thick cocks.

590
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,904
We have always been together.
Have I ever done something wrong?

591
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:43,019
I know that you are my friend,
but you cut yourself in the fingers.

592
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:53,500
With Angie's big mouth the trouble started.

593
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,185
Neil Della Croce, Gotti's capo, was dying.

594
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,818
Yet he did the defense.

595
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:05,508
Angelo's lawyers refute
those tapes in several ways.

596
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,300
There is a good chance that we are good
come from.

597
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,859
Maybe my name.

598
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:17,740
Soon I am associated
with them and with drugs.

599
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:23,906
Your name is not mentioned.
If so, I bring you their heads.

600
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,868
I'm powerless. I want certainty.

601
00:53:27,030 --> 09:38:01,000
The FBI has more to me.
This I can not do.

602
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,906
Angie's lawyers have those tapes yet.

603
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,619
I promise you if we have them,
you get them.

604
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:44,420
You know, Angelo is a piece of dirt,
he is nothing.

605
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:49,220
But if you're behind it,
go your whole gang coming.

606
00:53:49,430 --> 15:12:40,000
I swear.

607
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,258
What do I do with those tires?

608
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,504
What do I need? I can see my brother and
my best friend not to burst.

609
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,228
Tell me about it.

610
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,507
Paul gets drug money from anyone.

611
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:13,822
And I think he suits. He makes
the rules, but not to live there.

612
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:18,620
He's not a real gangster. He does
in shares and fills his pockets.

613
00:54:18,790 --> 06:45:39,000
I told you so.

614
00:54:27,310 --> 09:36:29,000
Everything goes to his own family.
- That's right.

615
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,863
That the police are the real heroes.

616
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,907
Go away.
- Really.

617
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:44,666
She lazily against various armed
can get.

618
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,139
Real heroes.
- I can not believe.

619
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:52,179
Would you say to your men for you
she sends path?

620
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:58,220
Let him send for the police
a job. Me he should leave it alone.

621
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:05,064
How do you do this?
- I love him on the line. What else?

622
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,099
If his name is on that
tapes, he gets a thousand years.

623
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,500
That would be nice.

624
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,943
Forward, skip it.

625
00:55:29,110 --> 09:35:26,000
Is it? Nothing wrong with you?

626
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,819
Do I have your moles?
- I could not help it.

627
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,221
You think I'm kidding myself?

628
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,781
What do you think we will let him go?

629
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,020
Hoop it.

630
00:55:48,150 --> 15:20:04,000
Those guys are too strong.
Give me at a pair of gloves.

631
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,708
That's what I hear.

632
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,829
With Mikey can not be mocked.
He is my size.

633
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:00,629
They seem to be Nixon.

634
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,942
We have no tapes.
We must eliminate.

635
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:08,580
And do not Gravano.
They are good friends.

636
00:56:08,750 --> 04:02:58,000
Sammy has never done anything.

637
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:19,228
I do not. I fight it out in
the courtroom.

638
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:23,941
If they catch me for conspiracy ...
- It's okay.

639
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,829
Well, we do so.

640
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,903
If Neil is dead, putting an end
to Gotti's gang.

641
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:37,349
Then we cut his wings.

642
00:56:39,110 --> 12:29:44,000
Day, sister.
- Hi, Mikey.

643
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,583
Day, Louie.
- Is there Sammy?

644
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,389
Sammy, Louie's.

645
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,266
How are you?

646
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,219
Give this but Sammy.
I go to the car wash.

647
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,028
Come Sunday?

648
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:09,820
Keep what meatballs.
And remember the breasole not.

649
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,105
Say it again.

650
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:18,060
That whole thing with horses
gives me a penny on.

651
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,985
That takes time. A matter
of breeding and training.

652
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:26,187
Gem delivers good bit on?

653
00:57:26,350 --> 09:44:09,000
I have some on order
I need my money.

654
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,580
How can you work with another?

655
00:57:38,750 --> 12:33:27,000
I must do what's best for me.

656
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:47,109
I do not think you suddenly from
want steps.

657
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,909
Why? Is rumored about me?

658
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,186
Of course not.
- Are you sure?

659
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,942
Definitely.

660
00:57:57,790 --> 01:21:05,000
Go ahead.
You must do what is best.

661
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:07,106
If you think this is the best,
I can understand that.

662
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,102
Of course not.

663
00:58:18,630 --> 06:50:24,000
Take care of yourself.

664
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,507
What were you with Castellano and Bilotti?

665
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,540
You think I do not notice?
You took the spoils fixed inside.

666
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:52,866
Big Paul had a capital spent
an alarm.

667
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,546
But it was the FBI succeeded
listening devices to place.

668
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,986
He was arrested for conspiracy.

669
00:59:06,550 --> 04:16:43,000
Not only did Angie's mouth
beyond talk, Paul himself.

670
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,863
How are you?

671
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:20,347
I looked at John in his club "The Ravenite.

672
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,901
How is life?

673
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,662
Well, are you?

674
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,186
Norman, make the same card table ready.

675
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,109
Where is John?
- They had to get away.

676
00:59:38,270 --> 12:34:40,000
You said he'd be here?

677
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,783
'Fat' Angie is now door number one.

678
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,669
Right, that's 'Fat' Angie.

679
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:17,948
Who's the other guy?
- Never seen before.

680
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,544
We have a novice at.

681
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,429
They walk to the corner.

682
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,582
I think he will be chatting.

683
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:35,180
The food remains in my throat stabbing.
I have constant heartburn. Terrible.

684
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:39,184
You say that all the time.
What are you thinking?

685
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:42,103
There going to change things.

686
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:46,866
Paul wants us tackle
So we need him to be.

687
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,188
Was this your idea?

688
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,382
I represent John.

689
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,428
He needs me to say this myself.

690
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,220
Sammy, listen.
You must understand this.

691
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,700
He wants to know if you participate. Nothing more.

692
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,828
I do not know. This is quite a bit.

693
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,504
This is no small thing.

694
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,264
John does not do anything without you or Frankie.

695
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,785
And what does Frankie?

696
01:01:29,950 --> 09:42:43,000
Who participates.

697
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:36,823
I have to think.
I'll talk to you later.

698
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:08,662
John us dared to imagine,
there was guts.

699
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,379
A murder is easy, but he is a
good boss?

700
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,781
I like him, but he is the best choice?

701
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:19,829
This shows he still initiative?

702
01:02:19,990 --> 07:00:23,000
Quiet moment.

703
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:34,461
What about you? Would not you boss?

704
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:38,100
I can work under him,
but not me.

705
01:02:38,270 --> 12:33:41,000
His ego is bigger than the Empire
State Building.

706
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,983
The question is: Can he'll curb?

707
01:02:48,150 --> 15:18:21,000
As well, can Sammy "The Bull" him?

708
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,340
Also, you and me.

709
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:08,345
The boss is off.
This was done in thirty years.

710
01:03:08,510 --> 04:18:41,000
That went against everything. All rules.

711
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:19,781
He is a fish in the desert.
He is a dead fish.

712
01:03:19,950 --> 07:00:43,000
Are you in?

713
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,988
I'm with you.
- Then the war.

714
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,822
We do it.

715
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:33,058
We polsten the Columbo's, the Bonnano's
and the Luchese's.

716
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,982
We sought support.

717
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:39,940
The message was simple:
Give the thugs in power back.

718
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:45,586
If we would not do,
it would be over with us.

719
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,266
If we could do it,
it could be a long war.

720
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,180
When are you coming back?

721
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,861
About a week or so. I do not know.

722
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,340
These are important issues.

723
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,986
Are you home for Christmas?

724
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:16,069
Tell the kids that Santa
had to leave. I send something.

725
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,105
Is it really matters?

726
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,899
I have really no other. That's not it.

727
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,425
Here I have no sense.

728
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:42,266
I said it was for business
and that it is therefore also for this.

729
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:39,307
Frankie would mediate peace.

730
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:43,782
Paul trusted him.
And that was his fatal mistake.

731
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:47,659
Without trust there is no treason.

732
01:05:47,830 --> 15:21:19,000
A vodka martini.
- Whiskey with ice.

733
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,784
I hope so too.

734
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,900
Where are they?

735
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,501
Nothing to show yet.
Do nothing and stay where you are.

736
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,945
Wait till I give the signal.

737
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:48,986
Chanel No.. 5.
Gloria loves that perfume.

738
01:06:49,150 --> 15:32:23,000
She says the money to smell.

739
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,423
Just be careful that you do not mix.

740
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,899
Then your wife desolate.

741
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,263
What do you and Francis for Christmas?

742
01:07:09,430 --> 04:23:59,000
We celebrate it in Lido Beach.

743
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,786
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

744
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,068
On you.

745
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,938
He stands beside us.

746
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,305
Here beside us.
- I heard you.

747
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,701
If they look, I shoot straight.

748
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:45,987
I swear, if they look, I shoot.

749
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,505
If you do not touch me.

750
01:07:48,670 --> 15:20:50,000
He stands at the first traffic lights.

751
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:07,660
They're coming. Caution.

752
01:09:09,390 --> 04:26:04,000
They have been there.

753
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:32,541
Castellano was gunned down by four men.

754
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:37,147
These are cold-blooded murders.
- His bodyguard ...

755
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:44,386
According to the police, it
a violent takeover.

756
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,701
Look at that.
It's on all channels.

757
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:53,547
There is no one arrested. Tommy's
devastated, but that's it.

758
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:58,261
He's a good guy. He must know
he has nothing to fear.

759
01:09:58,430 --> 01:41:40,000
Now see who our opponents are.

760
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,630
Nobody dares us to challenge.

761
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:10,626
Who knows? The Chin and brothers
Rotondo worked with Paul.

762
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,339
They see it.
We are not afraid of anyone.

763
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:19,142
So the "Boss of Bosses" is dead?

764
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,347
Yes, and he has lived.

765
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,024
His servant will'm missing.

766
01:10:29,550 --> 09:58:20,000
But his wife.

767
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:38,627
He just for that girl
to strengthen his dick.

768
01:10:38,790 --> 12:37:38,000
And now we make him cold.

769
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:49,305
We are a great couple.

770
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,100
To you and me.

771
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:57,340
On us.

772
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,901
On that side a little more.

773
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,510
Guess who's here.

774
01:11:19,670 --> 07:04:03,000
Daddy's home.

775
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,666
I felt like a soldier
had made it out alive ...

776
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,786
Home ... and could celebrate Christmas.

777
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,987
Glad you're here. I missed you.

778
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,663
Me too.

779
01:11:35,830 --> 12:43:21,000
Business is good. The next
year we will have even better.

780
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:50,184
At the funeral of Carlo Gambino
thousands of people.

781
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,818
That of Paul.

782
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,143
You now have a lot more guts.

783
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:14,505
You've taught me.

784
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:20,749
I hear you John as second man wants.

785
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:24,380
Give me your blessing?

786
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:29,259
You know, the commission has a rule.

787
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,309
You need permission to a boss
to liquidate.

788
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:38,908
There are many rules.
Paul did nothing else. You know that.

789
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:44,747
Without rules, there is no order
and without order no family.

790
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:48,744
What else is there?
- It had to change.

791
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:52,823
It did not work.
And I mean not personally.

792
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,505
Loyalty, obedience, honor.
Empty words.

793
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,628
That will always exist.

794
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:04,068
Only we must now honor and obey John.

795
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:08,223
I thought I knew a lot. Really.

796
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,349
My whole life I have worked on this.
To us.

797
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:18,824
You think you are doing something good,
but then something happens. Something goes wrong.

798
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,778
And then you wonder what all those
years have done.

799
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,589
And if you look back, everything seems small.

800
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,546
Very small.

801
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,903
The 21 heads came together.

802
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:43,700
In Caesar's East. A restaurant where I
money had been.

803
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,985
Sit all.

804
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:55,423
We know what we are here.
What happened is terrible.

805
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:00,459
We do not know who killed Paul.
That is being investigated.

806
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,145
No one here will hurt.

807
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,666
We want no discussion outside the family.

808
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:12,142
Who has a problem with that,
should say that.

809
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,383
Beautiful.

810
01:14:18,550 --> 07:09:03,000
We are as befits a family.

811
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,748
I wear for John Gotti.

812
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:34,585
Anyone who supports, is now standing.

813
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,463
It's unanimous.

814
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:48,669
The new head of the Gambino family
is John Gotti.

815
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:14,980
It is now time to forget all grudges and hatred.

816
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:19,587
Everyone here is, the Cosa Nostra.

817
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,059
And so it continues until our death.

818
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:26,667
Whether it's about an hour, or about
100 years in prison.

819
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,866
It remains a Cosa Nostra.

820
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,349
On the Cosa Nostra.

821
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,702
You do not know how much money is going.

822
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:55,148
It is as 21 rivers that flow into a lake.

823
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:59,701
All those years they have it culminated,
but that's over.

824
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:02,304
This is a new era.

825
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:06,019
It must return to the leaders and soldiers.

826
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:09,387
They are eager and are entitled.

827
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:13,668
There is enough for everyone.
For the whole family.

828
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,147
That is the message of this evening.

829
01:16:48,950 --> 15:27:40,000
He looks at whether the FBI is here.

830
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:58,460
Look at you.
All they crawl for Gotti.

831
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:02,900
Is it true that you are the boss of the
Gambino family?

832
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:06,187
I'm home alone the boss.

833
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,308
Are you not worried about the charges against you?

834
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,348
I'm not worried. I am innocent.

835
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:16,820
Ask him for under Castellano.

836
01:17:16,990 --> 07:12:47,000
Gotti has style and flair.
He is the opposite of Paul.

837
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,707
Inside is even better.

838
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:58,985
So Charlie and I'm full of shit by
on hot coals.

839
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,142
But he does not stop and I'm not leaving.

840
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,143
If I'm tired, I tell him:

841
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:10,179
"All your stories are the same question:
I molde him. "

842
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,428
Typical Charlie.

843
01:18:16,510 --> 07:23:03,000
With you I can enjoy chatting.
That's not going with those guys.

844
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:24,425
I'm not going to decrease.

845
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,706
You're the boss.

846
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:32,740
If they give us a few years,
we make something indestructible perch on.

847
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,902
Something about our lives. That would be nice.

848
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:49,539
Santa is busy.
- It's been more than a million.

849
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:53,749
You have a good Christmas.
- This is not a crazy job.

850
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:58,859
Shall we give agents a cup of tea?
They have fixed the cold.

851
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,986
Who do not celebrate feast.

852
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:10,102
The whole day?
They never go to the toilet?

853
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:13,501
I can go and ask them.

854
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,382
Go ahead.
- It's no joke.

855
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:23,749
They do nothing but wait
till we drop a stitch.

856
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:26,344
And then they strike.

857
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,387
What are you talking about at night?

858
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:33,101
Listen carefully. You must know how to
enemy thinks.

859
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,182
You worry too much.

860
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:40,502
But because you always worry and
everything at once thinks ...

861
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:44,743
Eyes ... because you have in mind ...

862
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:47,902
Therefore ... I make you my consigliere.

863
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,503
I feel honored.

864
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:59,662
Consigliere. Now there were only John and
Frank, the underboss, still above me.

865
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,220
I was the third man in the Gambino family.

866
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:10,748
I hear you. Continue.

867
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:13,299
Did you get that number for me?

868
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:19,146
Johnny wants us to speak later in the city.

869
01:20:19,310 --> 07:25:49,000
He may say. He's the boss.

870
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,659
That number is still in the car.

871
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,109
Shall I go get?

872
01:20:29,270 --> 09:59:41,000
That's all right.

873
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,743
Hold on.

874
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,669
You'll never make it.
John said something about food?

875
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,627
Guess.

876
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:42,350
Weather Da Noi?
- What were you thinking?

877
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,466
He loves soup.

878
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:50,626
Every day that you survive, is included.

879
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:54,908
You can not imagine your life that,
if not you yourself have experienced.

880
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:58,619
You will always wake up with the same idea:

881
01:20:58,790 --> 01:47:28,000
Who survives and who dies?

882
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:08,268
Some things you forget.

883
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,458
Some things you have to let go
before you really noticing.

884
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:24,389
Do you have a bet?
- I, on the Knicks.

885
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:27,781
Against the Celtics? Are you sometimes religious?

886
01:21:58,550 --> 01:51:07,000
I thought of the words of Castellano.

887
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:14,945
Continued

888
01:22:26,950 --> 10:07:01,000
Frankie came in the same cemetery
to lie as Paul Castellano.

889
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:39,749
If Frankie does not own the car was
walked, I had that chest area.

890
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,979
His time will come.

891
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,389
The sooner, the better.

892
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:20,943
Frankie's killers were there.
As proof that they knew nothing.

893
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:30,980
I think Bilotti's family was behind it.

894
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:38,107
He's as cunning as a fox.

895
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:42,263
He plays theater to stay out of jail.

896
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:45,706
I saw him in action.
He's a real gangster.

897
01:23:47,750 --> 15:49:22,000
Now Frank is dead, you're my number one.
You are my underboss.

898
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,539
You barks and bites me.
- Exactly.

899
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:57,986
You're a real tough guy.

900
01:23:58,150 --> 01:56:18,000
Therefore, I will.
I can only trust you yet.

901
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,828
That goes for me.

902
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:07,869
If anything happens to me, you take over for me.

903
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,828
Two against one that nothing happens to you.

904
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,869
Three against one. You need me justice.

905
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:18,864
If the Chinese did it, I blow him.

906
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:22,261
I put him out of his eyes.

907
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:45,144
What did I say about the Chinese?
He wanted us still off.

908
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:50,225
In a restaurant in New Jersey
they had a secret meeting.

909
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,699
Exactly, in the ladies room.

910
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,862
This is the ladies' room.
- Put it on the street.

911
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,305
Very funny.
- Hoop it.

912
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:02,179
She is a good customer of mine.
Who said such a thing?

913
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:05,581
We are here on business. We need to talk.

914
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,059
Where do the Chinese do it cold?

915
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,186
For his club in Ozone Park.

916
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,423
There he is every Saturday.
You blasts him down and you smear him!

917
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:18,503
I bang Gotti down with pleasure,
but it's not that simple.

918
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:20,820
I needed professionals.

919
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:24,949
Say who you need.
I take care of the rest.

920
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:33,786
I bang Gotti down with pleasure.
- This saves us time and money.

921
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:38,501
If we match Gotti, Gigante know that we
him eavesdropping.

922
01:25:38,670 --> 12:52:10,000
Then we're back to square one.

923
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:48,423
I want this guy suits, but then
the legal way.

924
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:52,780
John, I have some new information for you.

925
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:56,386
A tip for the races?
- We want to protect you.

926
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,461
Are you now sizes from me?

927
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:03,658
Pity you nothing to take.
I have a few costumes on.

928
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:06,424
You're too fat, but you adjust them.

929
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,702
Not everyone likes you.
- Because they do not know me.

930
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:13,499
Got any more?
- Beware of the man in the bathrobe.

931
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:18,542
Do you have anything better to do?

932
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:22,184
Damn those FBI guys.

933
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:26,059
Who have come to tell me this?
That dirty bastard.

934
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:30,826
He wanted to challenge me?
He wanted to make me sometimes cold?

935
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:33,345
These filthy freckle-faced.

936
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:36,468
I told Frankie that he had on his conscience?

937
01:26:37,110 --> 12:59:01,000
The Chin is furious because he was buddies
with Paul. These two best eels us.

938
01:26:47,750 --> 15:50:28,000
This is for us a little something,
but is it worth it?

939
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,386
That piece of shit is not worth the risk.

940
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:59,020
If we catch him, we get the FBI
on our roof.

941
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:02,546
They know everything about us.
Let this be a lesson to you.

942
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:06,669
Never say anything that you do not want to tire.

943
01:27:06,830 --> 04:44:04,000
If you bullshit like 'Fat' Angie, it costs
you life. Never forget that.

944
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:17,065
We do it.

945
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:20,779
Eye for an eye. We are boss
Rotondo cold.

946
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,783
Will do.
- And the brothers Falcona.

947
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:28,307
Frankie who have stoked.
- We take three for the price of one.

948
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:33,180
No one sews this family.
We are the largest in the world.

949
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,703
Nobody.

950
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:47,427
How's it going?
- Jimmy, you're in the wrong place.

951
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:50,866
I thought you sat down to pee.

952
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,705
Sammy, I beg you.

953
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:12,225
You Frankie and family betrayed.

954
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:15,826
I swear. I did nothing.

955
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:18,220
Away with that guy.

956
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:28,585
Then asked the Chinese to a conversation
between the families.

957
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:32,982
We are like brothers.
We want an end to the feud.

958
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:36,699
We said we did not know who Paul
killed.

959
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:40,180
He said he knew nothing about the
murder of Frankie.

960
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:46,141
We said that we are not people
had been killed and that it was very.

961
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:48,460
We gave the state debt.

962
01:28:48,630 --> 15:44:23,000
All lies and gossip.

963
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,548
We were a Cosa Nostra.

964
01:28:58,710 --> 01:59:27,000
We are surely a Cosa Nostra.

965
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,626
I was unstoppable.

966
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:17,420
I did now building and concrete for the entire
Gambino family.

967
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:22,823
Together with the other families scaled
We construction costs by 20 percent.

968
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:27,108
This city was not built without
We got paid for it.

969
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:34,905
Nothing for nothing. We determined the price
and the little guy got the bill.

970
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,787
Our family had everything in hand.

971
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:44,819
Construction, clothing, garbage, transportation,
Hotels, restaurants.

972
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:48,699
Everything you can imagine.
We were the boss.

973
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:53,669
We abused the system at all
conceivable ways.

974
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,741
We knew no mercy.

975
01:29:57,790 --> 01:58:23,000
Not all guys who could fame to.

976
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:09,988
Guys, you must see this.

977
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:28,101
What is this?

978
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,623
That's not much.

979
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:33,499
My mother was sick. That cost money.

980
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:35,979
You'll get it next week.

981
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,425
Fine, no problem.

982
01:30:38,590 --> 13:03:47,000
The problem is that shit you snort.

983
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:47,541
I'm just cold.
I have a pill too much.

984
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:50,941
Do you like a little. Did you hear me?

985
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,989
Sure.

986
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:57,146
I heard you.

987
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,583
There's that fucking FBI again.

988
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,344
They can flag it hang.

989
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,308
I have an idea. Give me an ice pick.

990
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,108
Yes, grab at an ice pick.

991
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,823
What that club one evening yields,
is enough for the whole week.

992
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:34,063
I know Nicky is your friend,
but keep him a bit of an eye.

993
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,788
What does he do then?

994
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:40,944
I'm not confident.
He does not think. Keep an eye on him.

995
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:44,700
Well then.

996
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,499
A liar is always looking in his glass
if he's lying.

997
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:52,788
Mikey was in the wrong camp and I
should have known.

998
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,901
That sound I like to hear.

999
01:32:09,390 --> 04:40:21,000
So I can see it.

1000
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:23,823
Well done, Sal. Very good.

1001
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:37,656
Joe, watch out for your heart.

1002
01:32:37,828 --> 01:32:39,864
Are they happy now?

1003
01:32:40,028 --> 01:32:42,781
They now come back with reinforcements.

1004
01:32:57,468 --> 01:32:59,743
What has this guy done?

1005
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,468
You have not said anything.
- Oh, no?

1006
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:04,346
No, you did not say anything.

1007
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:08,899
I heard that guy for themselves
wanted to start.

1008
01:33:09,068 --> 01:33:10,979
Can you imagine that?

1009
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:20,263
Driving with that trade.

1010
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:52,419
Then the guy had witnesses he had,
Fortunately for him, amnesia.

1011
01:33:52,588 --> 01:33:55,739
The headlines screamed: "I Vergotti.

1012
01:33:59,908 --> 01:34:03,867
From this period dates his nickname
"Distinguished Don '.

1013
01:34:04,028 --> 01:34:08,146
His face appeared in the newspapers and on TV.

1014
01:34:08,308 --> 04:39:06,000
Everyone was busy with John.

1015
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:16,818
It's the moment.
- Go ahead.

1016
01:35:13,948 --> 01:35:15,904
They sit down cards.

1017
01:35:18,268 --> 01:35:22,056
Louie was just released after a short sentence.

1018
01:35:22,228 --> 01:35:25,982
I went to greet him.
I wanted to know what he was planning.

1019
01:35:26,148 --> 01:35:28,946
And I wanted to know what he did to me was.

1020
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:33,344
Welcome home.
- I'm glad I'm free.

1021
01:35:33,508 --> 01:35:37,706
How you doin '?
- I came 's see how you were.

1022
01:35:37,868 --> 01:35:39,904
How was in jail?

1023
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,821
As always. You're your time.

1024
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,537
And you're doing well in construction.
- That's right.

1025
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,381
There, you too can benefit.

1026
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:53,221
There I therefore regret.

1027
01:35:53,388 --> 01:35:56,937
Thanks for your help when I was stuck.

1028
01:35:57,108 --> 01:55:41,000
It was your money. You're still in Tali's.

1029
01:36:05,668 --> 01:36:09,707
Imagine. Sammy 'The Bull' underboss
of the Gambino family.

1030
01:36:09,868 --> 01:36:12,905
I really did not ask.

1031
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:17,061
Is not it great that a kid from our
neighborhood that has reached?

1032
01:36:23,228 --> 01:36:28,825
What actually happened with Paul
and Tommy when I was in jail?

1033
01:36:28,988 --> 01:36:30,580
What are you talking about?

1034
01:36:30,748 --> 01:36:34,787
You know that.
How you've tackled the boss.

1035
01:36:34,948 --> 01:36:38,657
So is life. Those things happen.

1036
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:43,902
How those damn Gotti ever boss
become remains to me a mystery.

1037
01:36:44,068 --> 01:36:48,778
We owe everything to Paul.
Why did he kill? And Tommy?

1038
01:36:48,948 --> 01:36:53,260
Because he walked away. Since when
do you care about Tommy?

1039
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:55,578
He was a friend.
- Your partner, you mean.

1040
01:36:55,748 --> 01:36:58,057
You let me fall for him.

1041
01:36:58,228 --> 02:03:58,000
You went behind my back to him.
I know.

1042
01:37:04,908 --> 01:37:10,460
You saw the storm coming, and you chose for him.
And now you regret it. Yet?

1043
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:13,700
What should I say.
I did not mean to hurt you.

1044
01:37:13,868 --> 01:37:19,147
Understand one thing. That Paul and
Tommy was strictly business.

1045
01:37:19,308 --> 01:37:23,506
You simply do not talk about it.
Is that clear?

1046
01:37:26,468 --> 01:37:28,538
Let's not more brands.

1047
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:38,346
He continued to haunt us.

1048
01:37:38,508 --> 13:06:01,000
It is now the case one after the other.

1049
01:37:44,068 --> 01:37:49,062
That dirty bitch Giacoloni would catch me.
40 years to life.

1050
01:37:49,228 --> 01:37:53,824
These witnesses are jailbirds who hope
a shorter sentence.

1051
01:37:53,988 --> 01:37:57,901
I'm crazy about you.
- Good to see you. Have a nice day.

1052
01:37:58,068 --> 01:38:00,457
Do you understand?
- Have you any news?

1053
01:38:00,628 --> 01:38:04,906
My old pal Louie Milito bullshit behind
my back on us and Paul.

1054
01:38:05,068 --> 01:38:07,901
Indicators can not use.

1055
01:38:08,068 --> 01:38:12,220
He knows nothing. I'll make sure he
his mouth.

1056
01:38:12,388 --> 01:38:15,266
If he's too much bullshit, he goes out.

1057
01:38:15,428 --> 01:38:19,501
Let him now.
I vouch for him, I mean.

1058
01:38:19,668 --> 01:38:23,377
But keep him in the hand, for I speak
you pointed to.

1059
01:38:23,548 --> 01:38:24,901
I give you my word.

1060
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:33,022
How you doin 'here? What's the score?

1061
01:38:33,188 --> 01:38:36,305
Forty-Niners 21 points, against 10 for Chicago.

1062
01:38:36,468 --> 01:38:40,302
Those damn Bears.
I have $ 60 on them deployed.

1063
01:38:40,468 --> 01:38:42,663
I need to call.

1064
01:38:56,548 --> 01:38:58,186
Deb, it's me.

1065
01:38:59,228 --> 01:39:03,983
I'm home late, do not wait for me.
I do not eat at home.

1066
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:08,577
I'm home at ten o'clock.

1067
01:39:13,868 --> 01:39:15,984
Norman, come here.

1068
01:39:24,028 --> 01:39:25,381
What is this?

1069
01:39:25,548 --> 01:39:27,425
A staple.

1070
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:30,739
Do you DIY here?
- I do not.

1071
01:39:37,948 --> 01:39:40,143
Damn.

1072
01:39:57,388 --> 01:39:58,901
Look at this' s see.

1073
01:40:05,508 --> 01:40:06,907
That's number one.

1074
01:40:25,428 --> 01:40:27,862
This tent is secure?

1075
01:40:28,028 --> 10:27:03,000
Next time do better.
- You would still guarding the lot?

1076
01:40:36,668 --> 01:40:38,977
They are smarter than they seem.

1077
01:40:55,348 --> 01:41:00,945
Our informant was an investigator for
the team Organized Crime.

1078
01:41:03,948 --> 01:41:08,703
He told us what investigations
there against the family walked ...

1079
01:41:08,868 --> 04:51:28,000
... What they knew about the case Castellano ...

1080
01:41:15,628 --> 01:41:18,779
Only the FBI he knew nothing.

1081
01:41:18,948 --> 07:47:25,000
Their microphone I could not find.

1082
01:41:22,148 --> 01:41:24,298
But I never chatted.

1083
01:41:24,468 --> 01:41:28,620
It gave them
4500 hours of tape recordings of me.

1084
01:41:28,788 --> 10:24:47,000
And what did they get it? Zilch.

1085
01:41:48,628 --> 01:41:52,416
John had a subscription to the courtroom.

1086
01:41:52,588 --> 01:41:56,467
Look how he's a hall arrives.

1087
01:41:56,628 --> 01:41:58,380
As if he was right.

1088
01:41:58,548 --> 01:42:00,937
Whether the court he presides.

1089
01:42:04,948 --> 01:42:08,827
That's all invented by the
U.S. government.

1090
01:42:08,988 --> 04:46:18,000
They may not be my client Gotti.

1091
01:42:15,908 --> 01:42:19,901
Gambling or ... are the people with whom he deals.

1092
01:42:20,068 --> 01:42:24,937
But it is forbidden to deal with
people that the state should not?

1093
01:42:25,108 --> 01:42:29,147
Is it forbidden your free time in clubs
to spend?

1094
01:42:29,308 --> 01:42:33,460
With some cards,
watching TV and drinking coffee?

1095
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:35,903
They want to punish him.

1096
01:42:36,068 --> 01:42:37,979
And there is good for nothing.

1097
01:42:38,148 --> 13:16:57,000
Think of it like a rotten stew.

1098
01:42:46,228 --> 15:54:57,000
... The smell remains, the remains rot
and you still have to puke.

1099
01:42:54,588 --> 01:42:58,103
You hear this accusation home.

1100
01:42:59,148 --> 02:08:03,000
At the other junk.

1101
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:06,698
Talking costs nothing, until you hire a lawyer.

1102
01:43:06,868 --> 01:43:10,497
Or judges who kicked it, I do not know.

1103
01:43:14,148 --> 01:43:15,786
How many are you?

1104
01:43:15,948 --> 01:43:17,825
To 120.

1105
01:43:17,988 --> 07:44:37,000
You're not serious.
- He gets it rough time.

1106
01:43:25,028 --> 01:43:29,465
Sixty. And let's say that he with us
person can come whenever he wants.

1107
01:43:29,628 --> 01:43:30,981
Agreement?

1108
01:43:35,028 --> 01:43:37,747
A different voice is enough.

1109
01:43:37,908 --> 13:06:45,000
I can not just guilty.

1110
01:43:49,788 --> 01:43:53,383
In the case of the United States
against John Gotti ...

1111
01:43:53,548 --> 01:43:57,097
Accused of criminal conspiracy ... ...

1112
01:43:57,268 --> 02:06:21,000
... We consider, the jury, John Gotti
not guilty.

1113
01:44:14,268 --> 01:44:16,941
It was Friday the thirteenth.

1114
01:44:17,108 --> 01:44:19,178
But it was John's lucky day.

1115
01:44:27,108 --> 01:44:28,461
Comments like.

1116
01:44:28,628 --> 10:27:46,000
They have no evidence and no conscience.

1117
01:44:37,868 --> 01:44:39,221
How you doin '?

1118
01:44:39,388 --> 01:44:42,664
We would like to say that we do not
will forget.

1119
01:44:42,828 --> 01:44:44,261
That can not be otherwise.

1120
01:44:44,428 --> 01:44:46,896
Nice suit. The clearance?

1121
01:44:47,068 --> 01:44:50,697
Of a truck cases.
Go catch crooks.

1122
01:44:52,388 --> 01:44:56,586
This was madness.
What were all these people here?

1123
01:44:56,748 --> 01:44:59,103
He seemed to be the mayor.

1124
01:44:59,268 --> 01:45:03,819
All that publicity could we miss
as toothache.

1125
01:45:27,828 --> 01:45:29,659
It seems to be Independence Day.

1126
01:45:29,828 --> 01:45:33,059
We had good they are.
Now they let us be alone.

1127
01:45:33,228 --> 01:45:36,857
According to our man
they get all the microphones away.

1128
01:45:37,028 --> 01:45:40,862
At Christmas I want you by my
chimney.

1129
01:45:54,948 --> 01:45:56,984
This is not to believe?

1130
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:03,185
You got it permit?

1131
01:46:03,348 --> 01:46:06,738
The crawling with cops.
- So what?

1132
01:46:06,908 --> 01:46:09,661
Congratulations. We love you.

1133
01:46:09,828 --> 04:53:41,000
All the best.

1134
01:46:13,068 --> 01:46:17,141
Previously the old guard is still quiet.

1135
01:46:17,308 --> 01:46:20,266
The people did not even know existed.

1136
01:46:20,428 --> 01:46:24,262
I like being among people.
I wish them a pleasure.

1137
01:46:24,428 --> 01:46:26,988
I do not like Paul.

1138
01:46:27,148 --> 10:23:41,000
Not so dicks, entertain you a bit.

1139
01:46:35,148 --> 01:46:40,017
Next year I care for a permit.
To you a favor.

1140
01:46:40,188 --> 13:20:27,000
All right.

1141
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:52,142
Sammy can not relax again.

1142
01:46:53,268 --> 01:46:55,862
The business is going through.

1143
01:46:56,828 --> 01:47:00,377
I have one of my boys.
- Then who?

1144
01:47:00,548 --> 01:47:04,826
Mikey 'The Bat'. He had
Nicky 'Cowboy' keep an eye on.

1145
01:47:04,988 --> 01:47:09,300
But he sat with him in the coke.
Now he chats about it.

1146
01:47:09,468 --> 01:47:12,062
He knows too much.
- What then?

1147
01:47:12,228 --> 01:47:14,901
Everything, and he is unreliable.

1148
01:47:15,068 --> 01:47:18,743
The FBI gets him as on their side.
- Did you say that informant?

1149
01:47:18,908 --> 07:42:42,000
We need them just for that.

1150
01:47:59,428 --> 01:48:02,500
Debra and you have your wedding here
not celebrated?

1151
01:48:02,668 --> 01:48:04,624
Time flies.

1152
01:48:04,788 --> 01:48:06,858
Indeed.

1153
01:48:07,028 --> 04:56:26,000
It's like it was yesterday that we
together with the Rampers sat.

1154
01:48:20,268 --> 01:48:23,624
Listen. You've put me offside.

1155
01:48:23,788 --> 01:48:26,018
Would not you tell me again back?

1156
01:48:26,188 --> 01:48:29,066
I would like to take part again.

1157
01:48:29,228 --> 01:48:33,187
Act like you do?
And you stay on Staten Island?

1158
01:48:33,348 --> 01:48:36,624
Give me a little room.

1159
01:48:36,788 --> 01:48:39,222
You know I have done nothing.

1160
01:48:40,308 --> 01:48:42,538
I'll think about it.

1161
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:46,020
I'll be right back.

1162
01:48:52,948 --> 01:48:55,860
I was up at five. I'm tired.

1163
01:48:56,028 --> 01:48:58,588
A dance. This is such a beautiful song.

1164
01:48:58,748 --> 01:49:00,659
I said I do not want.

1165
01:49:00,828 --> 01:49:04,138
You never more sense.
- That's what you think.

1166
01:49:05,228 --> 01:49:08,186
Your weakest link determines your strength.

1167
01:49:08,348 --> 05:08:03,000
Mikey was a good guy, but he was weak.

1168
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:15,305
By a weak link can break your chain.

1169
01:49:15,468 --> 01:49:17,584
Mikey, you got a minute?

1170
01:49:35,308 --> 01:49:37,617
I'll come to a few people.

1171
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:40,666
You say it but.
- I'll see you there soon.

1172
01:49:43,508 --> 01:49:45,942
Do I need anything else for you?

1173
01:49:46,108 --> 01:49:48,144
No, I'll see you later.

1174
01:50:35,108 --> 01:50:37,668
That was a beautiful wedding.

1175
01:51:26,988 --> 01:51:28,387
What do you hear?

1176
01:51:30,508 --> 10:44:07,000
Never mind.

1177
01:52:18,228 --> 01:52:20,059
It's still a shame.

1178
01:52:44,948 --> 01:52:48,384
A weak link and the chain breaks.

1179
01:52:48,548 --> 16:09:06,000
Those two dancing all night.

1180
01:52:54,028 --> 01:52:57,577
Mikey was a good guy. A brother.

1181
01:52:57,748 --> 02:16:43,000
But he knew it and he knew
the consequences.

1182
01:53:27,068 --> 01:53:29,024
Why are you open?

1183
01:53:35,268 --> 01:53:36,986
That was Sammy.

1184
01:53:37,148 --> 01:53:38,581
You're kidding.

1185
01:53:38,748 --> 01:53:42,297
We wanted the killers of your brother
show ...

1186
01:53:42,468 --> 01:53:46,825
We just wanted to make clear
that they can find us here.

1187
01:53:46,988 --> 01:53:52,426
If they have something against us,
we wait for them here.

1188
01:53:52,588 --> 01:53:54,783
That is reassuring.

1189
01:53:54,948 --> 01:53:58,987
And the mess is neat and tidy.
All the blood is gone.

1190
01:54:00,148 --> 02:25:40,000
Fortunately.

1191
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:05,458
Otherwise it would not be fun
for you.

1192
01:54:05,628 --> 01:54:10,941
Let me not disturb you while you
my brother Mikey drink.

1193
01:54:15,828 --> 01:54:19,867
By Mikey. God rest his soul.

1194
01:54:20,028 --> 07:53:01,000
Yes, on Mikey.

1195
01:54:23,468 --> 01:54:27,984
Maybe he's better now
here with you.

1196
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:42,782
John was accused that he
a union had to murder.

1197
01:54:42,948 --> 01:54:45,621
The last two cases he had won.

1198
01:54:45,788 --> 01:54:47,460
Would it succeed him?

1199
01:54:52,308 --> 01:54:55,505
Why are they so you on the skin?
Is this a vendetta?

1200
01:54:55,668 --> 01:54:58,705
This statement is a message
for the accuser?

1201
01:54:58,868 --> 01:55:05,057
You guys were great. Without the help
of the press had it ended differently.

1202
01:55:05,228 --> 01:55:09,619
This was your third acquittal.
Do you think they are now alone?

1203
01:55:09,788 --> 01:55:12,461
Hopefully. I'm building this Sat

1204
01:55:12,628 --> 01:55:17,099
What do you think of that persistent attacks
of the state?

1205
01:55:20,228 --> 01:55:23,425
Well done. We're all behind you.

1206
01:55:23,588 --> 01:55:26,421
Go's delicious food. Drowning not.

1207
01:55:26,588 --> 01:55:29,341
Do you have anything else to say?

1208
01:55:30,988 --> 01:55:35,857
Then everyone called him the "Teflon Don".

1209
01:55:37,028 --> 01:55:42,182
If someone disappears, everybody understands
that they should not mess with us.

1210
01:55:42,348 --> 01:55:45,420
Fear keeps the business going.

1211
01:55:45,588 --> 01:55:48,227
Provide fear and everything runs well.

1212
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:54,304
Machiavelli said: "If you must choose
between love and fear, fear is better. "

1213
01:55:58,148 --> 02:27:42,000
Would you like to sign?
- Of course.

1214
01:56:02,068 --> 01:56:04,377
Is not that good?

1215
01:56:05,708 --> 01:56:08,347
And you, Frankie?
- Sounds good.

1216
01:56:08,508 --> 01:56:10,624
Is not that John Gotti?

1217
01:56:13,548 --> 01:56:16,426
What does a bottle?
- $ 50.

1218
01:56:16,588 --> 01:56:20,217
Say Vincenzo but that he was 200 for
should ask.

1219
01:56:20,388 --> 01:56:23,698
This is the wine that Gotti drink.
- I'll say.

1220
01:56:24,748 --> 01:56:28,058
I will ensure that they are not as to
watch us?

1221
01:56:35,748 --> 01:56:39,184
That his fans. They love me.

1222
01:56:39,348 --> 01:56:43,102
Give people a bottle of champagne.

1223
01:56:44,228 --> 01:56:49,302
We are the Cosa Nostra. We have
No fans. We did not even exist.

1224
01:56:55,788 --> 01:56:59,827
How often I 't said, it urged
not get through to him.

1225
01:56:59,988 --> 01:57:03,537
We are not movie stars, we're gangsters.

1226
01:57:04,908 --> 01:57:08,218
A gangster boss on the cover of Time magazine.

1227
01:57:08,388 --> 05:03:26,000
It's a disgrace to justice.

1228
01:57:13,668 --> 01:57:16,102
Tell them we do our best.

1229
01:57:16,268 --> 01:57:18,224
Hey, Paulie.
- How you doin '?

1230
01:57:18,388 --> 07:53:20,000
What you got for me?
- You look tired.

1231
01:57:24,268 --> 01:57:28,386
I got my share and he had information for me.

1232
01:57:28,548 --> 01:57:30,698
I must tell you something.

1233
01:57:30,868 --> 01:57:34,986
There's a guy who constantly gossips about you.

1234
01:57:35,148 --> 01:57:40,017
I did not believe my ears. I had Louie
warned and yet he continued.

1235
01:57:40,188 --> 01:57:44,386
I warned Louie yet
he keeps talking.

1236
01:57:44,548 --> 01:57:47,506
I told you, over him.
- I will do that also.

1237
01:57:47,668 --> 01:57:50,341
It is difficult for you.
Let Genie 't do it.

1238
01:57:50,508 --> 01:57:53,386
It's my problem. I should be there.

1239
01:57:53,548 --> 01:57:56,858
Have you caught?
- You get it Saturday.

1240
01:57:57,028 --> 02:27:43,000
Those lawyers dress me.
How much did you bring?

1241
01:58:04,788 --> 01:58:06,699
Eighty-to ninety thousand.

1242
01:58:06,868 --> 01:58:10,019
Give it. Every little bit helps.

1243
01:58:10,188 --> 01:58:13,464
It was not his attorney,
but for his bookie.

1244
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:16,461
John bet on everything apart and stuck.

1245
01:58:26,068 --> 01:58:28,298
Do you see those guys again.

1246
01:58:28,468 --> 10:36:27,000
Just as I was when I started.

1247
01:58:32,148 --> 01:58:34,787
They think they can handle.

1248
01:58:35,828 --> 01:58:38,296
They do not know what awaits them.

1249
01:58:38,468 --> 01:58:42,825
Friends become enemies and enemies
be friends.

1250
01:58:44,388 --> 01:58:48,506
In this crazy world is none
and nothing is certain.

1251
01:58:53,468 --> 01:58:55,857
I freeze some.

1252
01:58:56,028 --> 01:58:57,461
Do you not it cold?

1253
01:58:57,628 --> 01:58:59,539
I love fresh air.

1254
01:59:07,348 --> 01:59:08,940
Come.

1255
01:59:19,468 --> 08:04:02,000
He said: "He must 't be able to."

1256
01:59:22,068 --> 01:59:26,778
Sammy said: "This man has experience."
He referred me.

1257
01:59:26,948 --> 01:59:33,421
Then he said: "I promised my wife
I would die without shoes. "

1258
01:59:33,588 --> 01:59:37,297
"May I now take off?"

1259
01:59:37,468 --> 01:59:40,585
Making that up. Nobody says anything.

1260
01:59:40,748 --> 01:59:44,058
True or not? Who was it?
- Johnny Keys.

1261
01:59:44,228 --> 01:59:46,947
Exactly. Was that true of those shoes?

1262
01:59:47,108 --> 01:59:50,066
He had white socks.
- And why was that?

1263
01:59:50,228 --> 01:59:54,904
No idea. It was a kind of message
for his wife.

1264
01:59:55,068 --> 01:59:58,105
You know what my message to my
woman would be?

1265
02:00:03,108 --> 02:00:05,781
You have forced me to do so.

1266
02:00:05,948 --> 02:00:07,825
All those years.

1267
02:00:07,988 --> 02:00:09,899
We were like brothers.

1268
02:00:10,948 --> 02:00:13,781
Why were you so stupid?

1269
02:00:13,948 --> 02:00:15,904
You kept talking.

1270
02:00:19,068 --> 02:00:23,698
I can not believe it.
Wednesday I saw 'r at the hairdresser.

1271
02:00:23,868 --> 02:00:28,464
She said it so well with
Louie and her.

1272
02:00:28,628 --> 02:00:30,186
And now this.

1273
02:00:35,188 --> 02:00:37,907
Deena that her father must get rid of.

1274
02:00:38,068 --> 02:00:40,741
I give them something. I help them.

1275
02:00:43,828 --> 02:00:45,181
I'll go.

1276
02:00:50,428 --> 02:00:52,419
It's me, Linda.

1277
02:00:53,588 --> 02:00:56,660
Linda, I'm so sorry.

1278
02:00:56,828 --> 02:00:58,307
Come on.

1279
02:01:03,028 --> 02:01:05,417
I need to talk.

1280
02:01:05,588 --> 02:01:07,624
I need to talk.

1281
02:01:07,788 --> 02:01:09,619
Sit down.

1282
02:01:10,748 --> 02:01:12,659
You killed Louie.

1283
02:01:13,748 --> 02:01:16,103
What? Why would I do that?

1284
02:01:16,268 --> 02:01:17,986
You killed him.

1285
02:01:18,148 --> 02:01:19,900
He killed him.

1286
02:01:24,548 --> 02:01:28,177
You killed my husband.
- He was my best friend.

1287
02:01:28,348 --> 02:01:32,739
That would never do. There was sometimes
what, but I loved him.

1288
02:01:32,908 --> 02:01:36,901
They grew up together.
Sammy would never do such a thing.

1289
02:01:37,068 --> 02:01:38,626
He did it.

1290
02:01:38,788 --> 13:25:57,000
Linda, stop now.

1291
02:01:44,588 --> 02:01:47,421
I have everything for that.

1292
02:01:53,748 --> 02:01:55,545
She's really upset.

1293
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:59,178
They are looking for someone to blame.
I understand.

1294
02:01:59,348 --> 02:02:02,818
The fact is that Louie had many enemies.

1295
02:02:02,988 --> 02:02:06,981
Suppose I knew who did it.
She gets him so back?

1296
02:02:07,148 --> 02:02:09,787
Let her blame me but give.

1297
02:02:09,948 --> 02:02:15,306
But one day she comes to me
her to apologize.

1298
02:02:18,308 --> 08:02:18,000
With me. I have a job for you.

1299
02:02:25,748 --> 02:02:27,101
Clear?

1300
02:02:33,228 --> 02:02:36,937
Forward Golden Passion.

1301
02:02:38,948 --> 02:02:40,506
Now outside.

1302
02:02:40,668 --> 02:02:42,624
Good. Forward.

1303
02:02:42,788 --> 02:02:45,382
Go ahead.
- You can 't do.

1304
02:03:00,388 --> 02:32:01,000
I said 't you think?

1305
02:03:05,788 --> 02:03:08,621
He's going to win everything.
- I said it anyway.

1306
02:03:08,788 --> 05:10:36,000
Mr. Johnson on the phone.

1307
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:20,304
Norman, for me another glass of whiskey.

1308
02:03:23,108 --> 02:03:25,019
How you doin '?

1309
02:03:27,668 --> 02:03:35,063
If we do not help, we get a
communist Central America ...

1310
02:03:35,228 --> 02:03:38,220
That guy's a liar?
than you.

1311
02:03:40,108 --> 02:03:42,417
I did not know that was possible.

1312
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:47,303
The members of the democratic opposition t ...

1313
02:03:47,468 --> 16:29:24,000
What is really going on?

1314
02:03:52,148 --> 02:03:56,938
Trade unionists who are accustomed Sammy.
They do not talk to one another.

1315
02:03:57,108 --> 02:03:59,258
All roads lead to Sammy.

1316
02:03:59,428 --> 02:04:04,183
If I send Joe, then they talk with Joe.

1317
02:04:04,348 --> 02:04:06,816
So does it work simply.

1318
02:04:07,868 --> 02:04:09,221
How it works.

1319
02:04:09,388 --> 02:04:14,508
The democratic opposition without
not operate.

1320
02:04:14,668 --> 02:04:19,583
Reagan and Italian muzak.
I can not hear.

1321
02:04:19,748 --> 02:04:22,387
I do not know which is worse.

1322
02:04:22,548 --> 02:04:24,698
Why all roads lead to Sammy?

1323
02:04:24,868 --> 02:04:28,827
Gotti raving.
His hairstyle suits him.

1324
02:04:28,988 --> 02:04:33,300
Look over there. There's that little
sewer rat in person.

1325
02:04:34,388 --> 02:04:36,982
Maybe we hear something.

1326
02:04:49,228 --> 16:24:17,000
Is Johnny there?
- Go on.

1327
02:04:56,828 --> 02:04:58,864
How you doin '?
- Great coffee.

1328
02:05:00,948 --> 02:05:02,779
I need to talk.

1329
02:05:19,828 --> 02:05:23,025
I sent Joe to the union.

1330
02:05:23,188 --> 02:05:26,658
But they only want to talk to you.

1331
02:05:26,828 --> 02:05:29,626
You should also always send others.

1332
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:32,382
Do you like a little, will you?

1333
02:05:32,548 --> 02:05:35,267
What do you mean now?

1334
02:05:35,428 --> 13:29:20,000
You forget who's boss. They talk
not by me with the right man.

1335
02:05:44,348 --> 02:05:46,737
Listen, I care for you.

1336
02:05:46,908 --> 16:16:00,000
If you call, I come. I do everything for you.

1337
02:05:55,588 --> 02:05:57,499
I know.

1338
02:05:57,668 --> 02:33:07,000
But think how the family sees this.

1339
02:06:05,708 --> 02:06:08,745
You're the boss.
I am happy with my place.

1340
02:06:08,908 --> 02:06:12,059
Or any other position that you give me.

1341
02:06:12,228 --> 02:06:17,382
You tell that bondslui they talk
with Joe or whomever I please.

1342
02:06:17,548 --> 08:02:22,000
Otherwise she added.
- I make it clear they do.

1343
02:06:24,948 --> 02:06:27,303
How can that be? I hear Sammy not.

1344
02:06:27,468 --> 02:06:29,060
Gotti not.

1345
02:06:29,228 --> 02:06:33,346
They have not gone back?
Then sleeps Smitty.

1346
02:06:33,508 --> 02:06:38,298
I get this dribble through my throat.
I'm going to get something to eat.

1347
02:06:40,148 --> 02:06:42,537
Take once a pizza with it.

1348
02:06:45,868 --> 16:25:05,000
What nerve. I work me 24 hours a day
and seven days a week bad for him.

1349
02:06:56,468 --> 02:06:59,540
He'd be grateful.

1350
02:06:59,708 --> 02:07:02,859
He's worried about my ambitions.

1351
02:07:03,028 --> 02:07:05,861
He just reads his press releases.

1352
02:07:08,508 --> 02:07:12,137
Your chances in life are seven
against five.

1353
02:07:12,308 --> 02:07:17,063
And if you stay where you are,
your chances are smaller.

1354
02:07:17,228 --> 02:07:19,617
But nobody listened to me.

1355
02:07:19,788 --> 08:09:24,000
Only the neon signs ...

1356
02:07:37,748 --> 13:44:46,000
The more people you kill,
the greater the chance for revenge.

1357
02:07:43,668 --> 02:07:47,183
You can get away with six guys repositioning.

1358
02:07:47,348 --> 02:07:48,861
But at number seven ...

1359
02:07:49,028 --> 02:07:54,978
Suddenly ... are all brothers, uncles
and nephews for lurking.

1360
02:07:57,588 --> 02:30:22,000
Previously if someone does not commute
in his house.

1361
02:08:06,988 --> 02:08:09,456
We live in a different era.

1362
02:08:09,628 --> 05:26:57,000
Your attention must never slacken.

1363
02:08:12,108 --> 02:08:13,461
Never.

1364
02:08:14,508 --> 02:08:19,024
I love him like a brother.

1365
02:08:19,188 --> 02:08:23,625
But I say it so many times against him.
Take it easy, love you.

1366
02:08:23,788 --> 02:08:27,224
You have 15 companies,
you have rebar and concrete ...

1367
02:08:27,388 --> 10:51:47,000
Marble ..., construction, carpentry, asbestos.
What more could you want?

1368
02:08:33,988 --> 02:08:39,665
With each new business he conquers
the market under my flag.

1369
02:08:39,828 --> 02:08:42,900
I have more people.
Should I throw it out?

1370
02:08:43,068 --> 02:08:48,301
If I wanted to be a billionaire, I would
A selfish boss have been.

1371
02:08:48,468 --> 02:08:52,461
But that's not me.
You see this sandwich here?

1372
02:08:52,628 --> 02:08:55,506
I just need a good tuna sandwich.

1373
02:08:55,668 --> 02:08:58,341
You're easily pleased.
- Exactly.

1374
02:08:58,508 --> 02:09:02,296
Exactly. He did not love me.

1375
02:09:02,468 --> 02:09:04,857
Sammy can not just his own way.

1376
02:09:05,028 --> 02:09:09,465
Under Paul all went to 't construction,
and does Sammy.

1377
02:09:09,628 --> 02:09:15,544
He creates an army in a military
and the rest of the borgata is nothing.

1378
02:09:15,708 --> 02:09:17,699
Assign him his place.

1379
02:09:17,868 --> 02:09:19,586
Should I talk to him?

1380
02:09:19,748 --> 08:10:44,000
Sleeve will enjoy.

1381
02:09:26,548 --> 02:09:27,901
I take this with you.

1382
02:09:28,068 --> 10:52:44,000
Everything all right?
- Everything is checked.

1383
02:09:33,668 --> 02:09:36,501
That's better. Come on, let's go.

1384
02:09:38,988 --> 13:42:02,000
The whole thing is a circus.

1385
02:09:46,868 --> 02:09:52,261
The problem is that everyone is greedy
is. Everyone is after money.

1386
02:09:52,428 --> 02:09:54,896
You mean me there sometimes participate?

1387
02:09:55,068 --> 02:09:57,218
We 't great example.

1388
02:09:57,388 --> 02:10:00,937
I share with my people and you'll get your cut.

1389
02:10:03,988 --> 02:10:08,186
We are the Cosa Nostra.
You and I give it a good example.

1390
02:10:08,348 --> 02:10:12,466
Lui stabbing money in their pocket that not
of them.

1391
02:10:12,628 --> 02:10:16,985
They give me my part not.
- We have it harder.

1392
02:10:17,148 --> 08:01:01,000
The only thing you hear are complaints.

1393
02:10:24,788 --> 02:10:27,256
I feel like a sitting duck.

1394
02:10:27,428 --> 02:10:32,343
I can not even walk quietly.
I see only agents and traitors.

1395
02:10:32,508 --> 02:10:36,387
I've told you so many times.
We have too much familiarity.

1396
02:10:36,548 --> 13:49:46,000
Wherever we go, my house,
the cemetery, they are everywhere.

1397
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:46,902
I'm sick of it and it should not.

1398
02:10:47,068 --> 16:29:44,000
What a job. Only misery and pain.
Who wants that?

1399
02:10:55,028 --> 02:10:56,825
Everyone wants more.

1400
02:10:56,988 --> 02:10:59,377
I need that rich life.

1401
02:10:59,548 --> 02:11:02,460
I do my best and I do nothing about.

1402
02:11:02,628 --> 02:11:04,300
Everyone benefits.

1403
02:11:05,388 --> 02:11:09,222
The informers were everywhere.

1404
02:11:16,348 --> 02:11:20,546
How much money do you get from him?
- Ten thousand dollars.

1405
02:11:20,708 --> 02:11:22,585
I've been waiting six months.

1406
02:11:22,748 --> 02:11:28,744
Robert Di Bernardo, the porn king
John had his back to be offended.

1407
02:11:28,908 --> 10:48:04,000
John wanted me to finish it.

1408
02:11:36,228 --> 13:47:20,000
John wanted to talk to him, but he did not.
So John gave the order.

1409
02:11:47,508 --> 02:11:49,817
John gave the orders.

1410
02:11:50,868 --> 02:11:54,383
If I myself did not,
I made sure it happened.

1411
02:11:58,668 --> 02:12:00,818
Moreover Chair Sleeve.

1412
02:12:02,268 --> 02:12:05,385
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

1413
02:12:08,108 --> 02:12:10,827
Let's hear that band.

1414
02:12:14,308 --> 02:12:19,302
And you know why Di Bono it goes?
He has not shown up.

1415
02:12:24,908 --> 02:12:27,741
Before we knew who was Di Bono,
He was already dead.

1416
02:12:27,908 --> 02:12:30,980
Now it's over. We count them.

1417
02:12:46,428 --> 02:12:48,783
Look what a view.

1418
02:12:48,948 --> 02:12:52,861
Fifteen years ago I had not a penny.

1419
02:12:53,028 --> 02:12:56,304
And you should now see. The city is ours.

1420
02:13:00,588 --> 02:13:03,978
Laugh 's a bit. This is our wedding.

1421
02:13:08,428 --> 02:13:09,781
What is it?

1422
02:13:09,948 --> 05:26:06,000
What's on your mind?

1423
02:13:13,308 --> 02:13:17,381
You feel you might want to,
but I do not.

1424
02:13:17,548 --> 02:13:18,981
What are you saying?

1425
02:13:20,468 --> 02:13:23,426
When the phone rings, I'm scared stiff.

1426
02:13:23,588 --> 02:13:28,184
Every time you leave the house,
may be the last time.

1427
02:13:28,348 --> 11:00:04,000
You know I would never let that happen.

1428
02:13:33,948 --> 02:13:38,305
The kids and I never see you anymore.
You only think about things.

1429
02:13:38,468 --> 02:13:40,459
All day, all night.

1430
02:13:40,628 --> 02:13:45,782
Get you and the kids are not everything
what you want? You get everything.

1431
02:13:47,948 --> 02:13:49,745
Except you.

1432
02:13:52,268 --> 02:13:54,657
I have no one to talk to.

1433
02:13:54,828 --> 02:13:58,821
I have no friends.
Linda now lives in Florida.

1434
02:13:58,988 --> 02:14:00,706
Dawn would not see me.

1435
02:14:00,868 --> 02:14:03,860
Make new friends.
- What, what?

1436
02:14:04,028 --> 02:14:09,580
When I talk to someone, I just do
if we are not who we are.

1437
02:14:09,748 --> 02:14:14,868
It's like I'm walking on eggshells. Or I
Each time something bad to say.

1438
02:14:15,028 --> 02:14:17,667
You knew what you were getting.
This is our life.

1439
02:14:17,828 --> 08:04:25,000
I leave you and the kids never
in the lurch.

1440
02:14:26,788 --> 02:14:28,141
Well then.

1441
02:14:29,308 --> 11:07:01,000
That is precisely the problem.

1442
02:14:32,148 --> 02:14:34,423
I cock it no longer.

1443
02:14:36,868 --> 02:14:38,938
I want a divorce.

1444
02:14:39,988 --> 13:44:21,000
What do you want?

1445
02:14:43,308 --> 02:14:45,663
I want a divorce.

1446
02:14:50,868 --> 02:14:55,339
That can not be. You are my wife.
Yes, you can forget.

1447
02:14:55,508 --> 02:14:59,023
I love you, but sometimes I
not anymore.

1448
02:15:02,188 --> 02:15:05,544
We are a family. Nobody goes away.

1449
02:15:05,708 --> 02:15:09,667
We started together and we continue
together until the end.

1450
02:15:28,188 --> 02:15:32,022
If something goes well, it 's really good.

1451
02:15:32,188 --> 02:15:35,703
If something goes wrong, it 's also very wrong.

1452
02:15:37,388 --> 02:15:39,344
Then everything goes wrong.

1453
02:15:40,668 --> 02:15:42,898
Sammy's inside.

1454
02:15:43,068 --> 02:15:45,263
That's two. Now another.

1455
02:15:50,868 --> 02:15:53,177
How you doin '?
- Well, are you?

1456
02:15:59,908 --> 02:40:26,000
How you doin '?

1457
02:16:06,068 --> 02:16:08,343
John is on the way.

1458
02:16:08,508 --> 02:16:12,183
We have not come here anymore.
He just does not listen.

1459
02:16:13,948 --> 02:16:19,386
We'll keep it short. I must
Christmas shopping with my wife.

1460
02:16:19,548 --> 02:16:23,587
I have fifteen hundred dollars
Christmas lights in the house.

1461
02:16:23,748 --> 02:16:28,026
Debra I wanted a little cheer.

1462
02:16:28,188 --> 02:16:29,906
I get it.

1463
02:16:39,868 --> 02:16:43,907
The boss is also there.
- Gotti is now the club.

1464
02:16:44,068 --> 02:16:45,740
Toward it.

1465
02:17:03,908 --> 02:17:09,744
I do not want new people. We have
but a handful of good boys.

1466
02:17:09,908 --> 02:17:12,581
It is becoming increasingly difficult.

1467
02:17:12,748 --> 02:17:16,707
But the men that we have,
and not the loafers ...

1468
02:17:16,868 --> 02:17:19,382
Which ... are becoming better.

1469
02:17:19,548 --> 02:17:23,939
In ten years we can be proud
on those guys.

1470
02:17:25,228 --> 02:17:28,664
FBI. You know what we're doing.
Do you like it quiet.

1471
02:17:28,828 --> 11:09:25,000
We come for Sam, Frank and John.

1472
02:17:36,548 --> 02:17:38,982
I knew you would come.

1473
02:17:39,148 --> 02:17:43,426
Why are you so nice?
- Only Sammy knew nothing.

1474
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:48,708
Even my coffee drink.
- You will now not much else.

1475
02:17:48,868 --> 02:17:50,665
Drink your coffee.

1476
02:17:50,828 --> 02:17:54,218
Grab the cannoli's. We will take that.

1477
02:17:59,908 --> 02:18:03,503
Walk along with me to your new residence.

1478
02:18:03,668 --> 02:18:09,698
Hopefully you have a better cook. Previous
time the chateaubriand some tough.

1479
02:18:13,308 --> 02:18:17,506
John is my friend.
Say something nice or shut up.

1480
02:18:17,668 --> 08:20:21,000
That's a lot of money grab.
- That's for my wife.

1481
02:18:24,908 --> 02:18:28,139
If you want to.
- I just.

1482
02:18:28,308 --> 02:18:33,746
I have to make Christmas lights.
Let me know how it is.

1483
02:18:33,908 --> 02:18:35,580
I will.

1484
02:18:43,828 --> 02:18:48,299
I ran the risk of the rest of my life behind
bars by having to spend.

1485
02:18:48,468 --> 02:18:49,981
Never again a free man.

1486
02:18:50,148 --> 02:18:54,187
I could not believe it.
Everything that I had built.

1487
02:18:54,348 --> 02:18:57,818
For myself, my family, the whole borgata.

1488
02:18:57,988 --> 02:19:00,741
It could just collapse.

1489
02:19:00,908 --> 02:19:04,787
Obstruction of justice,
tax evasion ...

1490
02:19:04,948 --> 02:19:06,540
Criminal conspiracy ... ...

1491
02:19:06,708 --> 05:38:47,000
... And the murder of Paul Castellano,
Thomas Bilotti, Robert Di Bernardo ...

1492
02:19:12,148 --> 02:19:15,299
Louie Di ... Bono and Louis Milito.

1493
02:19:16,348 --> 02:19:22,821
The state has shown that
your lawyers Cutler and Shargel ...

1494
02:19:22,988 --> 02:19:26,583
As counselors have worked for ...
the Gambino family.

1495
02:19:26,748 --> 02:19:32,903
Therefore they can not occur
if your lawyers in this case.

1496
02:19:34,468 --> 02:19:38,347
Mr. Gotti, you should find another lawyer.

1497
02:19:38,508 --> 02:19:44,060
I'm not afraid of the fake admissions
of that man there.

1498
02:19:44,228 --> 02:19:48,699
He can not fight fair and he
can a fair case can not win.

1499
02:19:48,868 --> 16:34:02,000
Thank you Mr. Gotti.

1500
02:19:55,228 --> 02:40:24,000
In the normal course, I never
a. Jacoby and Meyers there are not.

1501
02:20:02,828 --> 02:20:05,422
That's very funny.

1502
02:20:05,588 --> 02:20:09,979
$ 30 you can not score.
- Watch me.

1503
02:20:10,148 --> 02:20:13,936
That's because you're white.
- I'm an Italian.

1504
02:20:19,508 --> 02:20:22,181
We need to get out of here.

1505
02:20:22,348 --> 02:20:24,179
We really can not lose.

1506
02:20:24,348 --> 02:20:26,179
Otherwise I escape.

1507
02:20:26,348 --> 02:20:28,737
Wish you cross the river?

1508
02:20:28,908 --> 02:20:30,261
I certainly do.

1509
02:20:30,428 --> 02:20:32,498
That's crazy.

1510
02:20:32,668 --> 02:20:34,977
Must we then rot?

1511
02:20:35,148 --> 02:20:36,900
You look like a gravedigger.

1512
02:20:37,068 --> 02:20:40,219
They are often caught me and I always won.

1513
02:20:40,388 --> 02:20:42,344
We always won.

1514
02:20:42,508 --> 02:20:44,942
But now we're well into trouble.

1515
02:20:45,108 --> 02:20:47,463
We really do not lose.

1516
02:20:47,628 --> 02:20:53,146
And otherwise we our time. The
family and the money is waiting for us.

1517
02:20:53,308 --> 02:20:56,300
Do not think that we are alive.

1518
02:20:56,468 --> 02:21:02,259
We are going to appeal for perjury, tampering
the jury or false evidence.

1519
02:21:06,628 --> 02:21:08,346
And those tapes?

1520
02:21:08,508 --> 02:21:10,146
What's on those tapes?

1521
02:21:10,308 --> 02:21:12,697
A lot of bullshit. Junk, nothing.

1522
02:21:12,868 --> 02:21:14,347
I hope so.

1523
02:21:14,508 --> 02:21:19,298
We buy the presidential order.
We obtain grace, like Hoffa.

1524
02:21:19,468 --> 02:21:24,303
Why, pardon? Am I crazy?

1525
02:21:24,468 --> 02:21:30,179
We get fan mail. Everyone hates
the state. They are behind us.

1526
02:21:30,348 --> 02:21:33,624
We win again, like the previous times.

1527
02:21:33,788 --> 02:21:36,461
We win it. Understood?

1528
02:21:37,708 --> 02:21:40,825
Get that ball but now, white boy.

1529
02:21:42,148 --> 02:21:46,824
John did not want me without him
with a lawyer talking.

1530
02:21:46,988 --> 02:21:49,582
And then came the big surprise.

1531
02:21:49,748 --> 02:21:56,506
This was recorded on December 12, 1989
in the room above the Ravenite Club.

1532
02:21:56,668 --> 02:21:58,818
Let's hear it.

1533
02:22:08,348 --> 02:22:10,543
Sammy said he chatted.

1534
02:22:10,708 --> 02:22:15,498
Louie Di Bono has ever behind my
back to chat about me?

1535
02:22:15,668 --> 02:22:18,228
Di Bono has never stolen.

1536
02:22:18,388 --> 02:22:24,020
Do you know why he's coming? Because
He would not come when I wanted it.

1537
02:22:24,188 --> 02:22:29,103
Anyone who is cross, going down.

1538
02:22:29,268 --> 02:22:30,940
He makes them.

1539
02:22:35,548 --> 02:22:40,303
Now Sammy Gem Atlas Steel.
What else should I say?

1540
02:23:05,308 --> 02:23:07,583
We go to court.

1541
02:23:32,908 --> 02:23:35,866
About ten minutes by bus.

1542
02:23:47,188 --> 02:23:52,740
I never cheated. I did
matters, but I've never cheated.

1543
02:23:52,908 --> 02:23:56,184
I know you're angry,
but I take it you're not sorry.

1544
02:23:56,348 --> 02:23:58,066
I take nothing amiss.

1545
02:23:59,108 --> 02:55:01,000
This was our case.
Where's the loyalty?

1546
02:24:02,028 --> 02:24:04,986
I just let myself go.

1547
02:24:05,148 --> 02:24:08,060
You gave the orders.
- Calm down.

1548
02:24:08,228 --> 05:36:18,000
If someone wants to get rid of Gotti, make it
but then for.

1549
02:24:15,828 --> 02:24:19,821
You got some balls after you've done it me something.

1550
02:24:19,988 --> 02:24:22,183
Who said of Milito and Di Bono?

1551
02:24:22,348 --> 02:24:26,500
I protected you and this is just
then my reward?

1552
02:24:26,668 --> 02:24:29,341
They have tires, no witnesses.

1553
02:24:29,508 --> 11:15:37,000
The lawyers know what to do with.

1554
02:24:32,068 --> 02:24:34,184
I was still an army into an army?

1555
02:24:34,348 --> 02:24:37,420
Do not be silly.
I say strange things often.

1556
02:24:37,588 --> 02:24:39,818
You know me?

1557
02:24:39,988 --> 02:24:42,786
I trust you. Why you underboss.

1558
02:24:42,948 --> 02:24:47,942
You say that I have betrayed the family.
No one is more loyal than me.

1559
02:24:48,108 --> 02:24:52,704
How many times have I told you:
"Do you. Take it easy."

1560
02:24:52,868 --> 02:24:56,304
Treat the others something.
You pick up everything.

1561
02:24:56,468 --> 02:25:00,461
Those three, four million per year
I gave you, did you quite differently.

1562
02:25:00,628 --> 02:25:03,904
I need to think about the whole family.
Not only to you.

1563
02:25:04,068 --> 02:25:08,425
I arranged your trades and bookies
for you and you never said anything.

1564
02:25:08,588 --> 02:25:12,501
We're like bitches. This is beyond
and it means nothing.

1565
02:25:12,668 --> 02:25:14,067
Does it not?

1566
02:25:14,228 --> 02:25:16,696
For you, maybe.

1567
02:25:17,748 --> 02:25:19,978
This is my downfall.

1568
02:25:20,148 --> 02:25:23,345
You wanted D.B. finish. I asked Angelo
waiting.

1569
02:25:23,508 --> 02:25:25,863
But you had it right.

1570
02:25:26,028 --> 02:25:29,338
I only know what Angelo said to me.

1571
02:25:29,508 --> 02:25:33,501
That Sammy said D.B. behind my back
chatted to.

1572
02:25:33,668 --> 02:25:36,228
Now I know that Angelo has lied.

1573
02:25:36,388 --> 02:25:38,856
Now I know it. Good?

1574
02:25:39,028 --> 02:25:42,338
I had my mouth shut.

1575
02:25:42,508 --> 02:25:46,820
I chatted too much, but you had to
I should have listened.

1576
02:25:46,988 --> 02:25:49,024
We'll get out.

1577
02:25:49,188 --> 02:25:53,227
Let this be clear, we are friends.

1578
02:25:53,388 --> 02:25:55,060
I never doubted you.

1579
02:25:55,228 --> 02:25:59,062
This should not destroy the family.
Do you understand me?

1580
02:26:00,468 --> 02:26:02,459
I understand you.

1581
02:26:02,628 --> 02:26:06,462
If we are out, we'll straighten everything.

1582
02:26:10,548 --> 02:26:15,064
Louie Milito had Gem Atlas Steel.
Sammy said he chatted.

1583
02:26:15,228 --> 02:26:16,786
Furthermore, he did nothing.

1584
02:26:16,948 --> 08:24:19,000
I heard John me deeper
drilled into the ground.

1585
02:26:25,148 --> 02:26:28,185
It was his lawyer, his ego,
his style.

1586
02:26:28,348 --> 02:26:30,464
I should never have trusted him.

1587
02:26:32,948 --> 02:26:36,145
He sent to my downfall.

1588
02:26:36,308 --> 02:26:39,664
I'm through. He pretty ...

1589
02:26:39,828 --> 02:26:42,581
I ... and life behind bars.

1590
02:26:43,908 --> 02:26:47,344
I had no choice. I had to murder.

1591
02:26:47,508 --> 02:26:50,784
But there would be more to go.

1592
02:26:50,948 --> 02:26:55,021
His brothers Gene and Pete and his son
John Junior.

1593
02:26:55,188 --> 02:26:58,066
Some I could, others not.

1594
02:26:58,228 --> 02:27:05,100
I began to count. I had three men
cool it in four different gangs.

1595
02:27:05,268 --> 02:27:10,547
I think there 's about it and
realized that it was not feasible.

1596
02:27:22,868 --> 02:27:27,066
Now I delve into the shit Sat
than I ever imagined ...

1597
02:27:27,228 --> 02:27:30,937
... I looked back and I saw
something else.

1598
02:27:39,628 --> 02:27:44,383
Without that there remained nothing else
than treason.

1599
02:27:45,748 --> 02:27:47,978
What do you want exactly?

1600
02:27:49,788 --> 02:27:52,063
My freedom.

1601
02:27:52,228 --> 02:27:54,901
You ask the impossible.

1602
02:27:55,068 --> 02:27:57,946
What do you have to offer us?

1603
02:27:58,108 --> 02:27:59,985
Everything.

1604
02:28:00,148 --> 02:28:04,027
Castellano's murder, the murder D.B.

1605
02:28:04,188 --> 02:28:08,978
Di Bono, Louie Milito. You get the 5
families on a silver platter.

1606
02:28:09,148 --> 02:28:10,786
Whatever you want.

1607
02:28:14,988 --> 02:28:17,024
And what do you want in return?

1608
02:28:17,188 --> 02:28:22,626
Immunity. I will testify if I
my life returns.

1609
02:28:23,828 --> 02:28:26,945
That's impossible. You'll have to sit.

1610
02:28:27,108 --> 02:28:29,906
How long?
- Twenty years.

1611
02:28:30,068 --> 11:18:20,000
If I get out after five years.

1612
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:39,820
I'm not the rest of my life witnesses.

1613
02:28:39,988 --> 02:28:43,025
Other matters covered by this agreement.

1614
02:28:43,188 --> 02:28:45,941
If you want more, I want five years.

1615
02:28:46,108 --> 02:28:49,657
Up. Since I do it for.

1616
02:29:07,988 --> 05:42:03,000
You want the big boss.
- It's just how you look at it.

1617
02:29:17,868 --> 08:20:05,000
It is night.
I know nothing of a transfer.

1618
02:29:23,788 --> 02:29:25,858
They have a warrant.

1619
02:29:26,028 --> 02:29:28,940
I want my lawyer.
- Talk to the FBI.

1620
02:29:29,108 --> 02:29:32,259
Wait.
- What does that now?

1621
02:29:32,428 --> 02:29:35,067
You got the wrong guy.

1622
02:29:35,228 --> 02:29:37,617
What do you mean, wrong?

1623
02:29:39,788 --> 14:05:19,000
You come for Sammy.

1624
02:29:43,428 --> 02:29:45,384
I may burst.

1625
02:29:45,548 --> 02:29:48,506
You come for Sammy.
- Bring him back.

1626
02:29:48,668 --> 02:29:50,898
Come on John, let's go.

1627
02:29:54,308 --> 02:29:56,185
Come.
- You're going down.

1628
02:29:56,348 --> 02:29:59,340
Do you hear me? You're dead.

1629
02:29:59,508 --> 02:30:02,705
Nasty cowardly Judas.

1630
02:30:02,868 --> 02:30:05,177
I'll kill you.

1631
02:30:35,748 --> 02:30:38,262
The state calls Salvatore Gravano on.

1632
02:30:45,068 --> 02:30:48,617
Look over there, a rat in a suit.

1633
02:30:55,788 --> 02:30:57,699
Your name?

1634
02:30:59,268 --> 02:31:03,181
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing
the truth?

1635
02:31:03,348 --> 02:31:04,781
I swear.

1636
02:31:05,908 --> 02:31:09,059
I never looked behind me.

1637
02:31:09,228 --> 02:31:15,303
I knew that if I would do anything
I believed, would be destroyed.

1638
02:31:15,468 --> 02:31:17,584
Do you have a nickname?

1639
02:31:18,868 --> 08:36:40,000
Yes, they call me Sammy "The Bull".

1640
02:31:23,708 --> 02:31:26,825
How many murders have you committed?

1641
02:31:27,868 --> 02:31:30,063
Eighteen or nineteen.

1642
02:31:36,068 --> 02:31:39,697
Traitors, addicts, informers.

1643
02:31:39,868 --> 02:31:43,338
People who broke our laws
as I do now.

1644
02:31:45,508 --> 02:31:50,502
How many of these murders were ordered
or approved by John Gotti?

1645
02:31:54,668 --> 02:31:58,058
Gotti gave the order to murder
by Paul Castellano?

1646
02:32:00,668 --> 02:32:03,705
Why is Mr. Castellano murdered?

1647
02:32:03,868 --> 02:32:09,465
There were several reasons. He dressed
the family for their own gain.

1648
02:32:09,628 --> 02:32:12,096
He was with a few people at loggerheads.

1649
02:32:12,268 --> 02:32:17,262
John and Angelo Ruggiero thought
Paul wanted them to finish.

1650
02:32:17,428 --> 02:32:20,738
John Paul wanted to be one step ahead.

1651
02:32:25,108 --> 02:32:29,067
I told them everything. As I had promised.

1652
02:32:29,228 --> 02:32:30,581
Everything.

1653
02:32:35,468 --> 02:32:38,028
And I take that responsibility on me.

1654
02:32:38,188 --> 13:56:26,000
But that tape recordings were his work.

1655
02:32:44,308 --> 02:32:46,742
The game was out.

1656
02:32:46,908 --> 02:32:48,819
And John had lost.

1657
02:32:53,628 --> 02:32:58,418
He is bad, disingenuous.
He manipulates and is vain.

1658
02:32:59,468 --> 02:33:05,065
He tries to get out of
by nineteen murders to confess.

1659
02:33:05,228 --> 02:33:10,461
Nineteen people. Some of his
the relatives present here.

1660
02:33:10,628 --> 02:33:16,578
They should be happy if he will for
murder every three months receives.

1661
02:33:17,628 --> 08:27:17,000
What is left of our legal system ...

1662
02:33:22,308 --> 02:33:27,336
... Like a deranged serial killer
free to roam?

1663
02:33:27,508 --> 02:33:28,861
And for what?

1664
02:33:30,308 --> 02:33:33,857
For the head of the man on a
platter.

1665
02:33:35,028 --> 02:33:40,421
And if you still doubt
his mendacity ...

1666
02:33:44,588 --> 02:33:46,704
The mother of his two children.

1667
02:33:46,868 --> 16:44:06,000
For fourteen years, she did not know ...

1668
02:33:52,308 --> 02:33:55,584
... That her own brother killed.

1669
02:33:55,748 --> 02:33:58,820
And it is chopped into small pieces.

1670
02:33:58,988 --> 02:34:03,300
A funeral has organized
for what's left of him was over.

1671
02:34:03,468 --> 02:34:05,140
A hand.

1672
02:34:08,428 --> 05:43:00,000
I want silence in the courtroom.

1673
02:34:16,748 --> 02:34:19,387
Suspects, stand.

1674
02:34:26,388 --> 02:34:29,585
President of the jury, what is your opinion?

1675
02:34:29,748 --> 02:34:35,141
The RICO Act. Conspiracy to murder
by Paul Castellano. What is your opinion?

1676
02:34:35,308 --> 02:34:37,026
Guilty.

1677
02:34:40,068 --> 02:34:45,825
The RICO Act. Conspiracy to murder
by Thomas Bilotti, what is your opinion?

1678
02:34:45,988 --> 02:34:47,421
Guilty.

1679
02:34:57,508 --> 02:34:58,861
Guilty.

1680
02:35:08,988 --> 02:35:14,699
The RICO Act. Conspiracy to murder
by Louie Di Bono. What is your opinion?

1681
02:35:14,868 --> 02:35:16,665
Guilty.

1682
02:35:20,908 --> 02:35:23,547
It was over for John.

1683
02:35:23,708 --> 02:35:26,984
He later went to Marion, Illinois.

1684
02:35:27,148 --> 02:35:29,298
For the rest of his life.

1685
02:35:30,628 --> 02:35:33,620
John Gotti Fri

1686
02:35:36,068 --> 02:35:40,141
This is a milestone in the fight
against organized crime.

1687
02:35:40,308 --> 02:35:44,620
The smooth Teflon is gone and the Don
is as soggy as hell.

1688
02:35:44,788 --> 02:35:48,098
He did not come under these charges out.

1689
02:35:52,748 --> 02:35:57,742
The Mafia in New York City and in the
United States can now pack.

1690
02:36:20,868 --> 02:36:23,257
For many people it ended.

1691
02:36:23,428 --> 02:36:26,579
They were not happy and I took it to them
sorry.

1692
02:36:26,748 --> 02:36:29,023
Now they had to work for their money.

1693
02:36:40,468 --> 02:36:43,983
Sorry, we did not have anything better.

1694
02:36:44,148 --> 02:36:46,025
Thanks anyway.

1695
02:36:46,188 --> 02:36:49,783
Do you want something?
- Coffee, cigarettes?

1696
02:36:49,948 --> 02:36:52,985
No, thanks.
- We wait outside.

1697
02:37:03,748 --> 02:37:08,185
All these years I thought I knew you.

1698
02:37:08,348 --> 02:37:12,899
And all this time the man next to whom
I woke up every morning ...

1699
02:37:13,068 --> 02:37:15,218
... One thing, a beast.

1700
02:37:17,028 --> 02:37:20,020
Come on, you knew what I was doing.

1701
02:37:24,828 --> 02:37:27,501
How could you Nicky murder?

1702
02:37:27,668 --> 11:17:17,000
You lied to me, my parents,
our children.

1703
02:37:38,508 --> 14:04:41,000
So it just to you.

1704
02:37:42,348 --> 02:37:46,580
The kids and I have decided that
we can not go with you.

1705
02:37:48,668 --> 02:37:53,947
You can not stay here. The people
want revenge. Then they grab you.

1706
02:37:54,108 --> 02:37:56,099
We're not leaving.

1707
02:37:57,588 --> 03:01:42,000
We get protection from the FBI.
It's safer.

1708
02:38:03,708 --> 02:38:07,826
Since we were married, I
flee and hide.

1709
02:38:07,988 --> 02:38:09,546
That's over.

1710
02:38:14,988 --> 02:38:16,546
I want the kids to see.

1711
02:38:16,708 --> 02:38:20,303
First Nicky, when Mikey and Louie.

1712
02:38:20,468 --> 02:38:24,017
And now you betray your own people.

1713
02:38:27,468 --> 11:17:03,000
Do you think John is not also
I was planning?

1714
02:38:34,228 --> 02:38:38,540
It leaves me cold.
I turn to anyone in jail.

1715
02:38:38,708 --> 02:38:42,667
But remember this well, you should about me
say what you want ...

1716
02:38:44,228 --> 02:38:48,506
But ... I've always loved you.
To you and the children.

1717
02:38:48,668 --> 16:48:23,000
You are everything to me.

1718
02:39:23,388 --> 02:39:28,303
One day you wake up
and then your whole life wiped out.

1719
02:39:28,468 --> 02:39:30,823
Until the last piece.

1720
02:39:30,988 --> 02:39:33,502
How should you proceed?

1721
02:39:33,668 --> 02:39:35,465
How?

1722
02:39:46,028 --> 02:39:49,987
Mafiosi, corrupt police lazy,
union bosses.

1723
02:39:50,148 --> 02:39:52,537
I threw them down like skittles.

1724
02:39:52,708 --> 02:39:57,543
Never before has a criminal
the level of Mr Gravano ...

1725
02:39:57,708 --> 02:40:02,065
About ... leap from one world
to the other.

1726
02:40:02,228 --> 02:40:06,301
Never has anyone organized
crime as disadvantaged.

1727
02:40:06,468 --> 02:40:13,180
Those criminal octopus industry
and labor in its grip.

1728
02:40:15,468 --> 02:40:17,299
I got five years.

1729
02:40:18,348 --> 08:44:23,000
Yes, I did it to save my skin.

1730
02:40:22,028 --> 02:40:24,986
I sat my time and went to the West.

1731
02:40:28,348 --> 11:24:25,000
When I had it not, but I do now.

1732
02:40:36,988 --> 02:40:39,183
... Was a big lie.

1733
02:40:39,348 --> 02:40:44,217
In reality it one
muck after the other.

1734
02:40:44,388 --> 02:40:47,027
One betrayal after it another.

1735
02:40:49,268 --> 16:56:58,000
Now there is no family.

1736
02:40:59,788 --> 03:00:01,000
Away with it.

1737
02:41:03,228 --> 02:41:04,661
Away with it.

1738
02:41:10,268 --> 02:41:13,419
How can live with that bastard?

1739
02:41:13,588 --> 02:41:17,467
With what he has done to me
and the borgata.

1740
02:41:17,628 --> 02:41:20,665
And his family and friends.

1741
02:41:23,668 --> 02:41:29,186
Only in this country can such cowardly Judas
rich and also a hero.

1742
02:41:30,228 --> 02:41:34,824
Sammy once said: "Indicators
are born, not made. "

1743
02:41:34,988 --> 02:41:38,060
He would rather die than squeal.

1744
02:41:38,228 --> 14:19:23,000
Then will he be dead
and in the sky.

1745
02:41:43,988 --> 02:41:48,618
You know what Gotti's problem?
He thought he could walk on water.

1746
02:41:48,788 --> 02:41:52,576
He thought that the earth, the moon and
the sun revolved around him.

1747
02:41:52,748 --> 02:41:57,617
And everyone bowed to him and kissed
his feet.

1748
02:41:57,788 --> 02:42:03,499
His run-beaten ego meant the
downfall of this borgata.

1749
02:42:05,228 --> 02:42:10,097
Only the prosecutor, the judge
and the FBI show that bastard as humans.

1750
02:42:10,268 --> 02:42:14,341
But that is only to deal with
him to justify.

1751
02:42:14,508 --> 02:42:16,942
He's a liar and a coward.

1752
02:42:17,108 --> 02:42:20,418
And he will spend the rest of his life
to flee.

1753
02:42:20,588 --> 02:42:24,217
But I love it still full.
If a man.

1754
02:42:25,268 --> 02:42:27,828
Cosa Nostra until my death.

1755
02:42:27,988 --> 02:42:30,661
What exactly goes into your head?

1756
02:42:34,148 --> 02:42:37,220
I must say it was sorry?

1757
02:42:37,388 --> 02:42:39,379
What should I say?

1758
02:42:39,548 --> 02:42:43,223
I'm a gangster.
What happened, happened.

1759
02:42:43,388 --> 02:42:47,461
You must understand one thing.
So that was life.

1760
02:42:47,628 --> 02:42:50,267
You are no longer protected witness.

1761
02:42:50,428 --> 02:42:52,862
You are no longer protected.

1762
02:42:53,028 --> 02:42:56,623
Be not afraid for your life?

1763
02:42:56,788 --> 03:13:16,000
I think there was a day when they
I want to tackle.

1764
02:43:09,428 --> 02:43:12,625
It goes as it should go.
I'm ready.

1765
02:44:00,468 --> 02:44:05,781
John Gotti is serving a life sentence
and will not be released early.

1766
02:44:05,948 --> 06:00:24,000
He sits in a prison for heavy
criminals in Marion, Illinois.

1767
02:44:17,468 --> 02:44:22,781
They accuse him of murder and
attempted embezzlement.

1768
02:44:22,948 --> 02:44:27,419
Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano lives
somewhere in the United States.

1769
02:44:27,588 --> 02:44:33,299
He is a businessman and he defends
in the proceedings against him.
