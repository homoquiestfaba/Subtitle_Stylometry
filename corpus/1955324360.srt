Thank you.

00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,300
Well?

377
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,733
I think you should see this.

378
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,533
The body of this man was found
by his poultry truck.

379
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:21,433
He was apparently attacked
by some kind of animal.

380
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,467
The local doctor sent some
tissue, saliva,

381
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,000
and blood samples
to the state to check

382
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,800
for any animal diseases...
Rabies, in particular.

383
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,733
The tests were all clean.

384
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,367
So what's your point?

385
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,733
But something else showed up
in the test.

386
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:37,400
This is a genetic marker
for a neutral sequence.

387
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,900
The marker showed up
in the saliva of the animal.

388
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,367
This particular marker is
registered to Eunice.

389
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,733
It's supposed to be
in chickens.

390
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,733
Now, couldn't the animal have
absorbed the marker

391
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,067
by eating the chickens?

392
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, either that,
or the animal that attacked him

393
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,233
was a chicken.

394
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:53,467

00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,967
Nothing I could say or do would
bring your daughter back.

You're not half stupid
for a man, you know that?

00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,367
You're funny...

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
And you're a good kisser.

568
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,833
[Sighing] It's too bad
you don't give a shit.

569
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,767
I give a shit.

570
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,567

571
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
Mm.

572
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:53,800
Given half a chance, I could
give a shit about you too.

573
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,367
That's too small of a party
for me.

574
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,500
But you care about the earth.

575
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,800
I care about you.

Everybody's happy, huh?

577
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,233
It doesn't work that way,
not for me.

00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:19,433
How does it work?

579
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:22,767
Does it really work at all?

580
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,100
And what's that supposed
to mean?

from, huh?

about me!

Oh, uh, by the way, you know,
be on the lookout for bobcats.

an endangered species,

are usually pretty hungry.

- Hm?

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,033
I heard that kid you found

631
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,833
was all carved up
like a Christmas Turkey.

632
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,567

I heard it was some sort
of psycho cannibal job.

too many

Must have been some kind
of animal, huh doc?

637
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,767
You know, a bobcat ate a
fellow when I was a little kid.

638
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,833
It wasn't a local, though.

639
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,000
It was a hobo.

of chicken shit.

641
00:36:56,767 --> 00:37:00,167
Hey, doc, you ever heard
of a bobcat ate anybody's eyes?

642
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,467
No, predators don't usually go
for eyeballs.

643
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,600
Eyes are more appealing
to birds,

644
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:08,467
like seagulls or crows
or vultures.

645
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:13,000
Hey, gimme a... gimme
a chicken salad, would you?

friar.

right out of his head.

not talking so loud?

653
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:31,433

up at county line,

she was pregnant,
eight months pregnant.

655

It was hunting season.

656
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,967
And her husband just
couldn't stop talking

657
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,867
about the big buck he bagged.

658
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Yeah, he kept going over
and over and over it,

659
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,133
all the gory details.

660
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,467
What happened?

661
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,967
She had a baby boy,
a beautiful baby boy,

662
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
cute as a button,
healthy as all get out,

663
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,700
except had these
two little bony growths

664
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,933
coming out of his head,
kind of like deformed antlers.

throw a little salad
in a bag for me?

693
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,333
Since when did you
start eating rabbit food?

694
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:35,767
Maybe he's not.

695
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,700
Maybe he's keeping a rabbit.

Don't you understand,
the thing that killed them

702
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,667
is the same thing
that killed the others?

703
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,400
All right.

704
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,800
Okay, doc.

705
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,267
Look.

706
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,833
Till I get this thing settled,

707
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm gonna have to take you in.

708
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,567
I'm sorry.

709
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,867
Can I take a leak?

710
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,267
Yeah, you can take a leak.

711
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,700
- You want to guard me?
- No, I don't want to guard you.

712
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,367
Go ahead.

713
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,533
Doc?

714
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,033
It's nothing personal.

715
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,767
[Sighs]

716
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,333
Now, these people
weren't killed by a shotgun.

717
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:41,133
It's the exact same in all
these cases,

718
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:45,200
same as the truck driver,
same as the kids.

719
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,767
In each successive killing,

720
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,533
the victim was pinned
to the ground and torn open.

721
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,467
While they were still alive?

722
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,867
Quite possibly.

723
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,900
Each case, the wounds have
stayed essentially the same.

724
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:05,767
The same area is generally torn,

725
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,767
same parts eaten,
same mode of attack.

726
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,000
This suggests
it's the same animal.

727
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:17,133
But in each successive killing,
the wounds have been deeper.

728
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,400
The truck driver was killed
with a small claw,

729
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,200
maybe three inches.

730
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:23,933
The kids seem to have been torn
by a larger one,

731
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:27,567
maybe six or seven inches.

732
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,067
But these bodies...

733
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,500
They look like they've been torn
by a scythe.

734
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:36,600

00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,067
before breakfast,
building a better chicken?

920
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,467
All she asked
was that we be quiet.

921
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,233
She wanted no publicity there.
Yeah, sure.

922
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:46,467
She knew
if we saw her name on any

923
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,267
of the research dockets,
we'd be all over her.

924
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
I don't know what you
gentlemen are talking about,

925
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:52,033
but someone called
in a code blue.

926
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,167
I'd like to know why.

927
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,433
Less than 72 hours ago,
a truck driver was attacked

928
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:01,400
and killed by a wild animal
not too far from here.

929
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:04,267
The blood of the truck driver
contained

930
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,533
a molecular configuration,
a trademark,

931
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:09,200
a trademark registered
to Eunice.

932
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:12,100
We believe it's
some kind of virus.

933
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:15,067
Our job is to determine
what it is

934
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,333
and with the power vested in us

935
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,833

management authority,

a hold of one of them bad eggs,

942

that's all,
don't worry about it now.

I've got
a very, very sick woman here.

958
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,267

Okay, be very careful
with her.

961

She... she ain't feeling
too well.

Hey, is she gonna be all right?

964

Well okay, I'm gonna head back
into town then,

965
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,100
and you have Downey give me a
call when she's feeling better.

966

fabulous.

An ugly, cancerous, gray planet,
littered with the dying remnants

986
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:41,167

as we know it.
