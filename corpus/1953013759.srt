Yes. I need some pussy here.

345

You know, you don't want to have a
fucking machete and get in there, and just...

346
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,670
night-vision goggles and shit.
You want a clean runway.

347
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,240
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

348
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
This is the best I felt all year.

349
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,920
Being here with you guys.

350

A question, Rich:
Is that why we do this?

356
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,040
I love it.
I think it's quintessant.

357
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,750
I look forward to it. I...

358
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,280
plan for it.

359
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,560

It's like, uh...

360
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,000
Christmas, for me.

361
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,000
Or if you're a non-Christian,
it's like your birthday.

Or if you're a Jehovah's Witness,
and don't celebrate birthdays,

363
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,380
then it's like the day
you get married, you know?

364
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,120
Slightly less subdued than I imagine

365
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,580

wedding to be.

366
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,580

371
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,980
I mean, I know you
have women, but, like,

372
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,980
- the woman.
- Why?

373
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
Why do I need
"the woman"? Why?

374
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200

to tame you.

Ah, the personal stuff.

684
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,310
God, no, he's so great.

685
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,260
He's really amazing.

686
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,220
And, then, so, you...

687
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,620
you submit them, right,
to quarterlies? Crap like that?

688
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,550
My last one actually
ran in <i>The New Yorker</i>.

689
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,840
So proud!

690
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,490
And then, you'll write another one.
And then, you'll get the heat

691
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:19,760
behind you that will push you through

692
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,500
to write the novel.

693
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,640
To type the end.

694
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,740
And then? Fuckin'...

695
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,980
What?

696
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,580
I don't understand.
I mean,

697
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,610
is there something wrong that?

698
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,790
You published a book.
I'd love to be able to.

699
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,830
I was like that.

700
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,150
I was so fucking excited

701
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,890
about this,

702
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,630
and about that,

703
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,670
but you just...

704
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,510
you think it's going to be so fucking rosy.

705
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,920
So fucking rosy...

706
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,330
- Well, Jonah's not like that.
- No?

707
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,160
He doesn't think anything is
going to be one certain way.

708
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,820
He just loves to write.

709
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,000
- You don't have to speak.
- You live in some sort of

710
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,780
disillusionment.

711
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,420
because it's easier than being honest.

712
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,460
What are you hiding from, old man?

713
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,390
You think that he's going to
be like you when he's older?

714
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,220
'Cause it makes you feel
better about yourself.

715
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,380
I still love it.

Let me see your heart.

You look just like my sister, Jill.

724
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,280
You should ask her to come over.

725
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,940

No, it's impossible.

How did she die?

729
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,620
- You can tell me.
- I killed her.

730
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,200
I killed her.

I killed him.

733
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,130
I killed them in a car.

00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,680
Death is something to attain.

740
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,860
Do you see them alive,

741
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,020
when you close
your eyes to go to sleep?
