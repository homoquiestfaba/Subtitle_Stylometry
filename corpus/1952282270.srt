1
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,039
Please please.
What's this all about?

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,906
Oh, I think you know
what this is about, Nick.

3
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,756
Nicky man.

4
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,691
What up?
What up? What up?

5
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,092
Surely you knew this was
gonna happen, right?

6
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,688
- Seth--
- Shut up.

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,699
What, did you think

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,792
you could rat out
a guy like me to the cops

9
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,928
and get away with it?
Is that what you thought?

10
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,370
Seth, it's not
like that, man.

11
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,203
- Shut up, rat.
- I'm telling you--

12
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,141
- Shut up.
- I wouldn't--

13
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,769
Fuck.

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,145
I busted my ass to get to the top
of the food chain for what?

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,150
To let a little prick
like you tear it down?

16
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,913
Seth, I would never
rat you out, man.

17
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,385
It's gotta be some kind
of a mistake.

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,751
- A mistake?
- A mistake.

19
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,814
A mistake?
Yeah, Nick, it was a mistake.

20
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,486
Tell me, was this
also a mistake?

21
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,394
Hey, Briggs,
it's me, Nicky Wilcox.

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,398
Listen, I just heard
Seth Bordas took delivery

23
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,400
of 200 lbs of China white.

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,231
He had it stashed
in his club.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,328
That's worth something,
right?

26
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,100
No no no no, Seth.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,233
Seth, it's not
like that, man.

28
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,073
It's that fucking Briggs.
He's a snake, man.

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,080
He's trying to set you up.
I was trying to help you.

30
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,480
Of course you were, Nick.
Of course you were.

31
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,143
Of course you were,

32
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,744
you stupid prick fuck!

33
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,255
I trusted you!

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,655
I got your sorry ass
a job,

35
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,216
and this is how you
repay me?

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,728
Nicky, Nicky,
Nicky.

37
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,230
Briggs, you motherfucker!

38
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,198
Hey, nothing personal,
Nicky.

39
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,831
Just business.

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,744
Gentlemen.

41
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,817
Don't get up.

42
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,792
Seth, please, man.
Seth, listen.

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,797
I look up to you, man.
I look up to you.

44
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,994
Look, I'll leave town.
I got a wife. I got two kids.

45
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,161
I want to see them grow up.
I want to see my babies grow up.

46
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,602
- Just please--
- Shh shh.

47
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,230
Shh.

48
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,901
- Seth.
- Shh.

49
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:01,143
Nick, I read
in a newspaper--

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,174
bull sharks,
big bull sharks.

51
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,210
They swim up the Mississippi
from the Gulf

52
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,722
searching for food.

53
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,225
It's absolutely amazing

54
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,955
what an animal will do
to survive.

55
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,987
Please, Seth, one more chance.
Just please.

56
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,762
Cement blocks--

57
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,826
old school.
I love it.

58
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,070
Nicky,

59
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,598
you should have taken
the hard time.

60
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,111
Seth, you got it
all wrong. Seth.

61
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,944
Please, Seth.
It was a mistake.

62
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,507
Seth, no!
No, Seth!

63
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,720
Shit.

64
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,876
Yah!

65
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,471
Bobby, Bobby,
it's Brianna!

66
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,154
Oh my God.
Oh my God, breathe.

67
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,755
Gotcha.

68
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,289
Not cool,
young lady.

69
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,063
I was just practicing
for my drama class.

70
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,967
I guess I did
pretty good, huh?

71
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,869
You scared the crap
out of your mother and me.

72
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,464
You should have seen
your faces.

73
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,409
That little stunt just got you one month
grounded, young lady.

74
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,639
A month?
That's so unreasonable.

75
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,614
A month is
a little long, honey.

76
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,878
- Fine, two weeks.
- Deal.

77
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,908
- Daddy.
- Honey, quit while you're ahead.

78
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,688
Oh my God.

79
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,487
- It's your daughter.
- That's your daughter.

80
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,551
Hey.

81
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,130
Daddy, there's some guy
at the front door.

82
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,403
Hi there. I'm your new neighbor
Clay Freeman.

83
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,032
I just moved in
next door.

84
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,406
Hi, it's nice
to meet you.

85
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,877
I'm Dawn Kalinowski.
This is my husband Bobby.

86
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,504
Nice to meet you.

87
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,481
And our drama queen
daughter Brianna.

88
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,006
- Hi, neighbor.
- Hello.

89
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,608
Hey, Bri,
put some clothes on.

90
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,347
Hey, welcome to the neighborhood.
Clay, right?

91
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,689
Yes, thanks.

92
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,218
Hey, could I possibly
trouble you for your hammer?

93
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,231
I can't find mine.
My wife insists

94
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,426
that I hang the wedding photos
before I do anything else.

95
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,435
Yeah, I can help you
with that,

96
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,131
providing you've got a driver's license
and a major credit card.

97
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,435
I don't understand.

98
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,375
No, he's kidding. Bobby.

99
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,877
Oh.

100
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,374
This work for you?

101
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,247
Oh, yeah.

102
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,410
Glad I could help.

103
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,479
Cool.

104
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,885
I got this great spot that
I do business with downtown--

105
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,896
the best Szechwan
in the city.

106
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,454
Me and the wife are
heading there tonight.

107
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,897
You guys want
to come with?

108
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,766
I'm really not much
for going out, Clay,

109
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,201
especially to the city.

110
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

111
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,563
What do you say?

112
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,541
Let me run it by the boss.
I'll get back to you.

113
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,339
We'd love to.

114
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,385
Remember that one night?

115
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,647
Shh.

116
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,914
So you guys ever been
to the Mayan?

117
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,290
The ruins?

118
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,589
No, silly, the club.

119
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,993
Haven't been there.

120
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,725
The owner's one of Clay's
biggest clients.

121
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,460
Mm-hmm,
and I kid you not,

122
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,468
the Mayan is
so happening.

123
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,902
And we're going to be there,
so we're happening.

124
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,702
Oh, awesome.

125
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,371
Honey, I'm driving.

126
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,778
Sorry.

127
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,783
Hey, guys, I'd be happy
to take the wheel

128
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,512
if you want
the back seat.

129
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,520
Yeah.

130
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,580
You're so bad.
Look at you.

131
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,806
Cool, huh?

132
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,867
Way cool.

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,441
There you go.
No, don't do it like that.

134
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,379
I'm tired of you
telling me.

135
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,507
No, I'm not--

136
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,880
I know how to do it,
okay, honey?

137
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,748
Let me show you.
You put it in between--

138
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,152
I know that. You told me
a million times.

139
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,691
But you look like
a tourist.

140
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,217
You're nitpicking
all the time.

141
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,820
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

142
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,728
No no, wait.
Look, just sit down.

143
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,165
Hey, do you think
we should say something?

144
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,227
Like what--
"Unhand that woman"?

145
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,330
Go on if you want to, Clay,
but not me.

146
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,034
So is there
a problem here?

147
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,542
Seth, hey,
how are you doing?

148
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,212
Clay, good to see you.

149
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,373
Seth is the guy
I was telling you about.

150
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,246
He owns the club.

151
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,252
Well, me and the banks.

152
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,254
- Hello, Elise.
- Hi, Seth.

153
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,721
- A pleasure to see you.
- You too.

154
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,781
Seth, these are my new
neighbors-- Kalinowskis.

155
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,793
This is Bobby.
This is Dawn.

156
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,762
Kalinowski-- that's
a fine Polish name.

157
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,889
Thanks.
I got that from my dad.

158
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,058
Well, listen, I would love
to stay and chat.

159
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,367
Please forgive me,
but my empire calls.

160
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,603
Waiter, this table's all
on the arm, a full comp.

161
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,610
Thanks, Seth.

162
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,841
My pleasure.
Enjoy yourselves.

163
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,111
I'll call you on Monday
with the wine order, okay?

164
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,277
Sure thing.

165
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,456
Isn't that great?
Totally on the arm, totally free.

166
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,688
From my experience, Clay,
there is no totally free.

167
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,820
You end up paying
one way or another.

168
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,562
Ethan, good.
I gotta go do something.

169
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,764
I need you to watch
the joint while I'm gone.

170
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,432
You think you can
handle that?

171
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,338
Yeah, man, you know you can
count on your little bro.

172
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,603
Go handle your shit.

173
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,406
And no screwing around,
you hear me?

174
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,276
This is a business.

175
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,771
It is not your own
personal dating service.

176
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,547
Keep your hands
off the customers.

177
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,645
I got you.
Hands off the customers.

178
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,053
I got you.
I can't help it

179
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,058
if I'm a young man
with a lot of testosterone.

180
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,822
Have a little faith, okay?
I got this.

181
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,351
Whatever.

182
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,957
I love you, you idiot.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,433
I love you.

184
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,333
I know.

185
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,100
I just need to know
I can count on you.

186
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,731
You can.

187
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,572
Good.
I'll see you in an hour.

188
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,074
See you in an hour.

189
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,928
Yeah.

190
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,765
What do you think, huh?

191
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,825
This place is not too shabby.
It has everything.

192
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,099
Oh, yeah, drunks,
loudmouths and assholes.

193
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,105
What more could
you ask for?

194
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,300
Come on, you're like
an old fart.

195
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,311
You're still young.
Have some fun.

196
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,313
Believe me,
once we had our daughter,

197
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,315
a night without being
puked on

198
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,408
or changing diapers
is a good night.

199
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,612
Babies puke on you?

200
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,779
Oh, yeah.

201
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,584
You're gonna love
changing diapers.

202
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,683
I didn't think
about that.

203
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,654
Are you okay?

204
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,490
Oh, God.
I'm fine.

205
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,496
That sushi did a number
on my stomach.

206
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,498
Oh, well,

207
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,500
I'll see you
back at the table.

208
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,559
Okay.

209
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,777
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, my bad.

210
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,779
Damn, girl, you are

211
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,373
the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen,

212
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,976
and I've seen some honeys
up in here, let me tell you.

213
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,350
Oh, thank you.

214
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,878
I'm Ethan.
I own this club.

215
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,948
It's nice to meet you,
Ethan.

216
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,358
I just met someone upstairs
named Seth.

217
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,362
He says that he owns
the Mayan.

218
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,364
Yeah, well,
that's my brother.

219
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,366
We own it together.

220
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,368
I let him
handle the food

221
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,370
and I take care of
all the hospitality.

222
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,372
Well, it's nice
meeting you, Ethan.

223
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,567
Hey, baby, where are you going?
You're in my club,

224
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,576
so I know you're looking
to have a good time.

225
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,578
How about you come
check out my office?

226
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,977
Actually, I can't.

227
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,345
I have to get back
to my husband.

228
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,509
Hey, baby, come on.
I'm just trying to be friendly.

229
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,485
Come on.

230
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,316
You like to slide
the ropes?

231
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,323
- What?
- I got some great shit.

232
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,554
What? No,
I don't do drugs.

233
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,753
Baby, come on.

234
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,762
Fucking asshole!

235
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,264
I like it rough,
the aggressive ones.

236
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,824
Get off.
Argh!

237
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,836
Come on, bitch.
Come on.

238
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,876
Where's Dawn?

239
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,883
I don't know. She left the ladies' room
before I did.

240
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,942
She should have been back
by now.

241
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,247
Come on, baby.

242
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,256
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on, bitch.

243
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,557
No!

244
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,122
Fucking get off!

245
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,437
Dawn.

246
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,837
Dawn, are you in here?

247
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,467
No no no!

248
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,741
No!
Fucking get off!

249
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,582
What the fuck?

250
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,024
Oh my God.

251
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,233
You're fucking dead,
you motherfucker.

252
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,529
Bobby, look out!

253
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,869
Get up, motherfucker.

254
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,169
Come on, asshole.

255
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,713
Oh my God.

256
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,344
Oh, shit.

257
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,821
We have a big problem.

258
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,523
He had it coming.

259
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,890
No, you don't
understand, Bobby.

260
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,124
That's Ethan.
That's Seth's brother.

261
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,564
This is not good.

262
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,592
This is not good.

263
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,650
Gentlemen.

264
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,354
Looks like you had
a good day, huh, Briggs?

265
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,496
So what do I need
to know?

266
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,900
Well,

267
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,904
everything's good
right now,

268
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,906
but you need to

269
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,908
screen your boys
a little more carefully.

270
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,910
You got lucky today.

271
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,912
I was able to intervene.

272
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,005
You might not be so lucky
next time.

273
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,016
Yeah, right.

274
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,449
Rat bastards.

275
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,012
Can't trust anybody
nowadays, can you, Briggs?

276
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,656
Jesus fucking Christ,
what did he do now?

277
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,769
Look, I gotta roll.
It's my little brother again.

278
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,772
Ethan.

279
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,401
The little bastard can't keep his prick
in his pants.

280
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,536
Just remember
what I said, Seth.

281
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,979
You can count on it.

282
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,753
Let's roll.

283
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,677
I need you to calm down
and tell me what happened.

284
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,481
- Can't come in here, sir.
- The hell I can't.

285
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,483
I'm Seth Bordas.
This is my club.

286
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,418
Sir, please please.

287
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,752
- What happened?
- Are you Seth Bordas?

288
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,416
That's right.
What happened?

289
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Bordas.
Your brother's dead.

290
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,760
Ethan!

291
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,788
Ethan! Ethan!

292
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,198
Ethan!

293
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,725
Get out of here.
Ethan!

294
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,000
Ethan!

295
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,167
Who did this?
Who did this?

296
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,543
You menace!

297
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,230
He asked me

298
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,700
if I wanted
to go to his office

299
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,703
and do some coke,

300
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,227
and I said no.

301
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,409
Dawn left the ladies' room
before me.

302
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,968
And when I got back
to the table

303
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,412
she wasn't there.

304
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,416
Bobby got worried,

305
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,078
so he went
to look for her.

306
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,882
- Why stab him?
- What are you talking about?

307
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,085
I didn't stab him.
He came at me with the knife.

308
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,150
So it was his knife?

309
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,219
Yeah, of course
it was his knife.

310
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,231
How did his knife
end up in his chest?

311
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,527
How did that happen?

312
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,193
I stepped to the side.

313
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,997
He tripped and
fell on it, I guess.

314
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,503
This guy was
out of his mind.

315
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,506
I was just
defending myself.

316
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,270
Can you be a little
more specific?

317
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,777
What do you want me
to say,

318
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,303
that he tried
to rape me?

319
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,509
Suppose I told you
I had a witness

320
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,040
who says you did
stab him?

321
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,953
I'd say you and your witness
are full of shit.

322
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,513
So are you charging me with something
or am I out of here?

323
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,082
Just sit tight.

324
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,618
Can I get you anything--
a water, a coffee?

325
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,029
My wife.
I want to see my wife.

326
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,362
Where is she?

327
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,425
You're gonna see her.

328
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,983
So what do you think?

329
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,508
The stories match.
He hasn't lawyered up.

330
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,613
I think it's just like
he's saying-- self-defense.

331
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,624
Bordas was
a train wreck anyway.

332
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,455
This was another one.

333
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,462
Ain't that the truth?

334
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,293
If old Ethan was found
dead in a ditch,

335
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,128
we wouldn't have
the personnel

336
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,031
to interview all
the likely suspects.

337
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,695
Right.

338
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,533
What about fingerprints?

339
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,369
The only fingerprints on that knife
belonged to Ethan Bordas.

340
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,934
Okay, cut him loose.

341
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,916
Briggs.

342
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,753
Talk to me.
What did you find out?

343
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,317
It looks like
self-defense.

344
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,625
Look, you know Ethan
better than anybody.

345
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,631
What?

346
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,429
I want that rat bastard's
head on a stake.

347
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,460
You hear me, Briggs?
You hold on to him

348
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,131
until you fucking
hear from me.

349
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,640
Too late.
We just released him.

350
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,302
God damn it!

351
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,675
Listen, Seth.

352
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't do
anything stupid.

353
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,682
If anything happens
to this guy,

354
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,240
cops will be
all over you

355
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,877
and there won't be a damn thing
I can do about it.

356
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,514
Son of a bitch!

357
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,216
Seth.

358
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,255
Fuck.

359
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,167
Looks like I gotta
take care of this myself.

360
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,405
Want us to go
pick him up?

361
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,178
It's too late
for that.

362
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,186
That idiot Briggs
let him go.

363
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,586
All right,

364
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,648
I want you to put
a word out on the street--

365
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,717
100K cash for anyone

366
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,352
who brings me
Bobby Kalinowski.

367
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,522
This city is officially
on lockdown.

368
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,555
What about your friend
the booze guy?

369
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,932
He brought death
into my house.

370
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,961
If he gets in the way,
kill him.

371
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,906
But I want
Bobby Kalinowski alive.

372
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,932
Now get out of here.

373
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,259
Y'all down?

374
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,598
For 100 grand I'd get
Seth Bordas my mom.

375
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,604
- For 100 grand?
- Yeah.

376
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,629
- Let's get this paper, man.
- Let's do that.

377
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,641
All right then.

378
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,555
Y'all down?

379
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,095
Sounds good.

380
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,159
What the hell
is going on?

381
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,173
Come on, asshole.

382
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,676
- Oh, shit.
- Get us out of here, Clay.

383
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,546
Oh, shit.

384
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,015
Oh, shit.

385
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,751
Clay, get us
out of here.

386
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,226
- But I might hit someone.
- Clay, go now.

387
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,931
Oh, shit.

388
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,264
- Clay.
- Okay.

389
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,439
Go!

390
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,250
Pull into that
parking garage.

391
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,553
- Dawn, call 911.
- I'm not getting any service.

392
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,940
Right there, Clay.
Back it in by those cars.

393
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,685
Bobby, what are you
doing, man?

394
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,657
I'll distract them.
Clay, get the girls out of here.

395
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,751
- Take them to the police station.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

396
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,352
- Dawn, please.
- Forget it.

397
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,455
Okay, listen, I'll meet you
at 7th and Oak in 10 minutes.

398
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,489
Don't wait
one second longer.

399
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,122
Oh my God, Bobby.

400
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,876
What's this guy, a freakin'
human spider or what?

401
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,672
Aim for the legs.
Seth wants him alive.

402
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,592
Cops. Shit!

403
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,342
It's been 10 minutes.

404
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,277
We're not leaving him,
Clay.

405
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,610
Oh my God, Bobby.

406
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,754
- Oh my God, are you hurt?
- It's nothing.

407
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,120
Come on, baby, I've hurt
myself worse shaving.

408
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,591
Relax relax relax.
We gotta go.

409
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,457
- Clay, Elise, out of the car.
- Okay.

410
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,257
I'm not leaving my car
in this neighborhood.

411
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,264
They know this car.
Come on, man.

412
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,459
I'm sorry.
Leave it. Let's go.

413
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,491
Come on.

414
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,139
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

415
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,274
We gotta go back
to the police station.

416
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,422
So how do you know
he was dead

417
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,859
if you didn't
check him?

418
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,863
He fell off
the side of a building

419
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,161
and splattered
like a bug.

420
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,836
Briggs, what did you
find out?

421
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,544
Understood.

422
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,146
Let me know
when you find him.

423
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,483
Nobody-- but nobody

424
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,921
could have survived
that fall.

425
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,697
You stupid
fucking moron.

426
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,100
I tell you
I want him alive

427
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,468
and you try
to kill him.

428
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,872
Now I find out
you can't even do that.

429
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,870
Apparently,
you both don't know

430
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,709
the difference
between dead or alive.

431
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,272
Markus.

432
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,786
It's really not
that difficult.

433
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,120
Dead.

434
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,183
Alive.

435
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,726
Dead.

436
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,596
Alive.

437
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,895
Dead.

438
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,629
No!

439
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,762
We'll get him,
I swear!

440
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,205
Alive.

441
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,882
Say, Chris, let me see
that GPS, nigga.

442
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,577
No, man, I ain't
giving you my GPS.

443
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,585
I just got this
jump-off, man.

444
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,416
Man, give me the GPS.

445
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,423
Quit bullshitting, man.

446
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,220
We don't need no GPS.

447
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,226
These motherfuckers
is on foot,

448
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,353
with some bitches.
They can't be no further

449
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,364
than a couple of blocks
north of Washington.

450
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,764
Oh, so you're
a compass now?

451
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,131
Look, man,

452
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,035
let's do this the "G" way.
Let's hit these streets.

453
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,936
Feel me?
Ask a few people.

454
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,737
That's straight, boss.
Let's bounce, man.

455
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,744
Damn right,
that's straight.

456
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,609
Let's roll,
my nigga.

457
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,657
Shit, still no signal.

458
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,670
Okay, the police station
is two blocks that way.

459
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,332
I think if we cut
through here,

460
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,341
we won't be seen.

461
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,570
Damn it, Clay, get back here.
You'll get spotted.

462
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,442
I think I'm getting
a signal.

463
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,673
Clay.

464
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,782
Don't even think
about moving.

465
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,519
Put your fucking hands
up in the air, stupid.

466
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,619
Hey, D, call T.
Let him know we got him.

467
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,789
Make sure he got
that cash A.S.A.P.

468
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,026
Got you, my nigga.
Make sure we get paid.

469
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,636
Hey, man, what are you
doing out here, black,

470
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,270
huh, hanging out
with these cats?

471
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,941
Don't you know you could get
six feet deep for that?

472
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,416
You're hanging out with
"America's Most Wanted."

473
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,114
You're a dead man
walking, homie.

474
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,123
D, what's up with T, man?
He got that cheese?

475
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,852
Yeah, that's right.

476
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,951
Cheese?

477
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,154
Money.

478
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,188
I have money.
I have $500 cash.

479
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,894
$500?

480
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,894
That man right there
is worth 100 grand.

481
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,907
But since you're feeling
so generous and all,

482
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,306
you want
to give me $500,

483
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,003
as a matter of fact
I'll take that,

484
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,978
and your watch
and your ring.

485
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,742
Give me all that shit.
That's a polo jacket, huh?

486
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,443
Oh, yeah yeah, give me
all of that shit.

487
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,510
Andale andale, nigga.
Move.

488
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,680
You two, muscle-man.
I want your shit too.

489
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,747
Let's go.

490
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,986
The credit cards--
all of it.

491
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,756
Give me that shit.

492
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,161
What the fuck are you
laughing at, man?

493
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,757
I bet it won't be
so funny

494
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,735
if I put this gun
in your mouth, boy.

495
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,760
So what the fuck
are you laughing at?

496
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,205
100 Gs?

497
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,970
That's right, bitch.

498
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,307
Your ass is worth 100 grand
on the streets right now.

499
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,210
So what you think
about that?

500
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,216
You guys like working
for minimum wage?

501
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,650
I should pop your ass
right now.

502
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,880
Shoot me-- you lose
the 100K and the diamonds.

503
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,856
Diamonds? What you talking about--
diamonds, man?

504
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,155
We don't know nothing
about no diamonds, man.

505
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,185
The diamonds that are
stuffed in my sock.

506
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,719
What do you think
this is about?

507
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,527
You think we're stupid?

508
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,591
No, you're a genius.

509
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,626
Here, see for yourself.

510
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,400
Hey hey hey,
don't move, boy.

511
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,805
You almost got shot
right now.

512
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,309
Don't be moving.

513
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,176
Chris man, you think he's serious
about these diamonds, man?

514
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,181
I mean, that just don't
make no sense to me.

515
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,183
He's in this neighborhood
at this time

516
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,947
with a whole bunch of diamonds?
What do you think, dawg?

517
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,954
Maybe that's what Bordas
wanted him for--

518
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,717
the diamonds.

519
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,090
Diamonds could be a lot more green
than Seth's paying.

520
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,095
What you think
about that?

521
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,892
I don't know.

522
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,058
Check it out.

523
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,067
- All right, you got me?
- I got you.

524
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,625
All right.

525
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,433
Keep your
hands up, man.

526
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,137
Clay, get in the car.

527
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,206
Let's go, ladies.

528
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,348
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

529
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,357
I watched a lot
of Jackie Chan movies.

530
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,416
Get in the car.

531
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,995
What are you doing?

532
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,860
I'm taking my cheese
and my watch.

533
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,163
We've come a long way
from slavery to Obama.

534
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,964
You need to stop using
the "N" word.

535
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,471
It's disrespectful.

536
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,349
Excuse me, we need to see
someone in charge.

537
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,017
That'd be me.
Can I help you?

538
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,583
- Yeah, I'm Bobby Kalinowski.
- Kalinowski?

539
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,095
- That's right.
- Come with me.

540
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,564
Wait, we were just
attacked--

541
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
Ma'am, please just
follow me.

542
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,542
Okay, you want to tell me
what's going on?

543
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,517
Seth Bordas
is trying to kill us.

544
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,541
Trying to kill you?

545
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,349
He paid 100,000
to have us killed.

546
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,787
And you have proof
of that?

547
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,256
The guys who attacked us said
they were hired by Bordas.

548
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,691
- Attacked you?
- We were held at gunpoint.

549
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,890
Listen, I'm gonna get some detectives
in here to take your statements.

550
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,592
You know what?
How about this--

551
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,329
no more detectives,
no more statements.

552
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,462
- Let's go home.
- I cannot help you

553
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,267
unless you're willing
to file charges.

554
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,797
That's okay.
I don't need your help.

555
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,704
Special Services.

556
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,440
Why didn't you say something
in the first place?

557
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,880
Didn't think
it was necessary.

558
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,350
Okay, look, I will personally
look into your story

559
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,513
and I'll get back to you as soon
as I find out something, okay?

560
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,580
At least let me
get you a ride home.

561
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,550
Come on.

562
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,874
- Here you go.
- A cab?

563
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,744
Aren't you gonna take us home
in a police car?

564
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,341
Sorry, department policy.

565
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,876
But don't worry.
The city will pick up the tab.

566
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,319
Cool.

567
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,184
My cell number's
on the back of this.

568
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,251
If you need anything,
give me a call.

569
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,896
Thank you, Detective.

570
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,937
Look at you.
A rough night, eh?

571
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,651
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

572
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,846
Yes, ma'am, I know it well.
Not a lot of people go to the 'burbs.

573
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,879
I go over the bridge, take
the back road, Sycamore--

574
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,118
Hey, you mind keeping
your eyes on the road?

575
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,684
Oh, yes, sir.

576
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,696
I hope my car is okay.

577
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,325
Must be the wife.

578
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,546
You're not taking
the freeway?

579
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,641
No. Yes, sir.
I have to go to a gas station.

580
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,311
I have to relieve myself
real quick.

581
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,820
You couldn't have done that
before you picked us up?

582
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,823
Sir,

583
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,826
nature calls
when nature calls, okay?

584
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,691
Make it quick.

585
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,389
Yes, sir, I will.

586
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,779
Just make it fast.

587
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,612
I will, I promise.
I'll be very quick.

588
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,743
Sure you don't want to grab a sandwich
while you're at it?

589
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,811
No, thank you.
I already have eaten.

590
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,030
Oh, we got company.

591
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,004
Lock the door.

592
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,633
I'm not a fan
of downtown.

593
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,907
Bobby, what are
you doing?

594
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,151
Stay in the car.

595
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,631
Going someplace, buddy?

596
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,230
I'm actually just
on my way home.

597
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,434
You guys seem to have
accidentally blocked me in.

598
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,874
Would you mind moving?

599
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,172
You're a real
funny guy, huh?

600
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,771
But you're coming
with us, man.

601
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,485
You know,

602
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,249
I am really not having
a good night tonight.

603
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,985
Up until now I think
I've done a pretty good job

604
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,255
of keeping
my sense of humor.

605
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,762
But I feel like
I'm starting to lose it.

606
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,627
So how about this?

607
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,930
How about you take your
gang of goofballs here

608
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,936
and you get out of my way
before you find out

609
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,599
what happens when I lose
my sense of humor?

610
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,608
Maybe you really need
to take that up

611
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,507
with Animal
over here.

612
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,704
Yeah?

613
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,680
You must be Animal.

614
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,241
Animal's a big dude.

615
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,809
Yeah, real big.

616
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,289
I bet you can help me
get all these fellows out of my way.

617
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,752
Tell you what, Animal--
I got another idea.

618
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,057
Pick a hand.

619
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,394
Why don't we just
fuck your ass up?

620
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,872
Go get him, you big ape.
Come on.

621
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,220
Back the fuck up.

622
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,421
Let him go.

623
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,864
Back the fuck up.

624
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,880
Hang on.

625
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,573
Hey, what are you doing?

626
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,587
We gotta separate.
It's only me they're after.

627
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,283
- Wait, Bobby, no.
- Clay, I need you to take the wheel.

628
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,121
I don't think this is a good idea, Bobby.
Please don't leave me.

629
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,458
Come on, man, listen to your wife.
You should stay with us.

630
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,998
What? I don't--

631
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:06,093
Clay, I need you to get
in the front seat now.

632
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,627
Bobby, this is
absolutely crazy.

633
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,264
Honey, listen,
I'll be fine.

634
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,798
I need you to just go home
and wait for me, okay?

635
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,368
I'll see you there
shortly.

636
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,380
Clay, get them
out of here.

637
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,712
Don't stop for anything.
Don't trust anyone.

638
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,184
- I'm counting on you.
- What are you gonna do?

639
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,619
Call in an old debt.

640
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,850
Where's BR?

641
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,917
He's over there.

642
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,366
What the fuck is it
that you don't understand?

643
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,668
You were short two cases
of vodka in my last order.

644
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,968
I want my booze

645
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,636
or I want my fucking
money back by Friday.

646
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,077
Jesus fucking Christ.

647
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,450
I must look like some asshole
that everybody wants to fuck.

648
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,511
What's up, BR?

649
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,891
Bobby fucking K
at my place.

650
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,726
I know this is
gonna be good.

651
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,732
I need to talk
to you, bro,

652
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,233
alone.

653
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,235
Can you believe
this guy?

654
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,032
I haven't seen him
in 100 years

655
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,562
and he comes in here
barking orders.

656
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,904
We're not in the navy
anymore.

657
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,910
And you're not
in charge here.

658
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,969
This is my place.

659
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,607
What's the matter?
Don't like girls?

660
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,252
Ronnie.

661
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,311
That's all right,
go ahead.

662
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,062
How about a dance?

663
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,261
No, thank you.

664
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,327
Your loss.

665
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,205
What are you doing on this
side of town anyway, Bobby?

666
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,903
I thought you were
a family man now.

667
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,503
I don't want to be
down here.

668
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,537
A neighbor invited
Dawn and I to a club

669
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,173
and I got into
some trouble.

670
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,649
What kind of trouble?

671
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,414
You know this guy Seth?

672
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,422
- Bordas?
- Yeah, that's him.

673
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,014
He put 100 grand
on my head.

674
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,354
You're the guy
that killed Ethan.

675
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,654
I didn't kill him.

676
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,719
Look, Bobby man,

677
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,857
anybody but
Seth fucking Bordas.

678
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,095
I can't help you, bro.
I'm sorry.

679
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,968
BR, maybe you got
a short-term memory,

680
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,303
but you owe me.

681
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,400
Look, man, you heard of
"Three strikes and you're out"?

682
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,071
I've got four.

683
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,138
I'm sorry.

684
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,342
Maybe you don't remember,
but you wouldn't be alive

685
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,648
to get those strikes
if it wasn't for me.

686
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,654
Yeah, I remember.

687
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,418
You don't remember.

688
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,618
Where have you been
all these years?

689
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,389
You got a wife now,
a daughter, right?

690
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,124
Have I ever met them?
Hell no.

691
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,223
When was the last time
you popped your head in here

692
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,166
and said, "Hey, Big Ronnie,
want to come over for dinner?"

693
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,725
How about never?

694
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,035
So don't walk in here
like we're family.

695
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,439
You know what? Why don't you just
get the fuck out of here

696
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,443
before I collect
that bounty myself?

697
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:29,160
Do you want us to come in
and wait with you?

698
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,326
No no no.

699
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,995
I'm gonna be
all right.

700
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,233
We're right next door
if you need anything.

701
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,701
Please let us know the minute you hear
from Bobby, okay?

702
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,678
Okay, I will.

703
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,738
Bye.

704
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,094
You gotta stop
tearing up the town, Seth.

705
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,188
Let it go.

706
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,721
I can't let it go.

707
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,200
I want to know where
Bobby Kalinowski lives.

708
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,136
I'm sorry, Seth,
I can't do that.

709
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,401
Oh, so what do we
got here?

710
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,101
A crooked cop
with a conscience?

711
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,769
Is that what you're
telling me?

712
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,971
Look, I have
some new information

713
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,571
on this Kalinowski.

714
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,014
He was Department of Defense
for 10 years.

715
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,712
So he served in the military.
What do I care about that?

716
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,586
No, I checked his service records.
He was a Navy SEAL.

717
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,090
I don't give a flying fuck
who or what he is.

718
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,719
He killed my brother,
and for that he's gonna pay.

719
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,093
Seth, I don't think
you understand

720
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,098
the level of training
and skill

721
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,565
that it takes
to be a SEAL.

722
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,967
As far as killers go,
this guy is the elite of the elite.

723
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,631
I've handled
trained killers before.

724
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:43,969
No, not like this,
you haven't.

725
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,975
Look, I'm not gonna go

726
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,977
back and forth with you
on this, all right?

727
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,979
I want you to give me
his address,

728
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,641
or I'm gonna go public
with your second income.

729
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,115
You understand me?

730
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,419
You do that--
you go down with me.

731
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,152
So be it.

732
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,858
6808 Sycamore.

733
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,558
Now you stay
out of my way.

734
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,546
Deacon,
change of plans.

735
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,220
Nowhere to run now, huh?

736
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,746
You're not gonna be able
to fight your way out of this one,

737
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,781
Mr. Badass.

738
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,495
This does not look good
for me, does it?

739
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,261
Who are you
kidding, man?

740
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,790
You don't know how
to shoot that thing.

741
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,030
What did you say,
motherfucker?

742
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,095
All right.

743
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,187
Hold him up.

744
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,110
What the fuck, man?

745
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,116
That's enough.

746
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,482
Bordas wants him alive.

747
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,487
Sorry, Bobby.

748
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,149
100 grand is
a lot of money.

749
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,158
The club ain't doing
too good these days.

750
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,990
Are you fucking kidding me?
You set me up?

751
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:56,089
Hey, guys, hold him down.
He may not look like much,

752
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,100
but this guy is
a trained killer.

753
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,763
You piece of shit,
I took a bullet for you.

754
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,466
Whatever, hero.

755
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,701
Look, this ain't
personal, man,

756
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,835
just business.

757
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,640
You fucking
piece of shit.

758
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,546
I should have let you
die out there.

759
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,209
You know,

760
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,687
you really need to stop
living in the past.

761
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,246
See you, Bobby.

762
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,690
Hey, what happened to
"No man left behind"?

763
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,724
Over here, tough guy.

764
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,098
I took a bullet
for you!

765
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,570
Stop making this
hard on yourself.

766
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,437
This ain't nothing compared to
what Seth will do to you.

767
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,008
Let him go.

768
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,313
What?

769
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,910
I changed my mind.
Let him go.

770
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,286
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

771
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,450
I said, I changed my mind.
Let him go.

772
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,618
Let him go.

773
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,560
- Go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck myself?

774
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,529
- Yeah, I'm taking him in.
- You're taking him in?

775
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,360
- I'm fucking taking him in.
- You're taking him in?

776
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,833
He's worth $100 fucking thousand.
I'm taking him in.

777
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,927
- Am I not speaking English?
- I don't give a fuck

778
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,733
what you're speaking,
you big goofy motherfucker.

779
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:09,966
I said
I'm taking him--

780
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,807
Telling me to go
fuck myself?

781
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,644
I thought
we were friends.

782
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:23,119
What? What?
You're sorry?

783
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,451
Apology not
fucking accepted.

784
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,978
Fucking piece of shit.

785
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,388
All right.

786
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,265
Who wants to die first?

787
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,076
Just like
old times, huh?

788
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,078
Go ahead, man.
Get out of here.

789
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,637
These guys aren't
going anywhere.

790
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,239
Thanks, man.

791
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:56,548
Hey, this wasn't a favor.
We're even.

792
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,132
Honey,

793
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,193
I'm worried about Bobby
out there all alone.

794
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,070
I should have done more
to help him.

795
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,075
Damn it.

796
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,704
Baby, Clay, try and get
some sleep, okay?

797
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,510
I feel

798
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,483
like a coward.

799
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,952
I didn't do anything
to help.

800
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,080
Baby, yes, you did.

801
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,956
You got us home safely.

802
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,358
Did you see the way he
took on some of those guys?

803
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,126
There's more to him
than what it appears to be.

804
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,133
What do you mean?

805
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,567
He's no landscape architect.

806
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,436
That guy is
a trained killer.

807
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,350
Bobby, Bobby,

808
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,124
I'm so glad to see you.

809
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,995
What happened, man?

810
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,590
Hey, man, how's Dawn?

811
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,602
She's inside. She's fine.
I got us here okay.

812
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,695
Thank you, buddy.

813
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,002
Where did you get
the bike, man?

814
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,634
Go back to bed,
all right, buddy?

815
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,974
I promise I'll tell you all about it
in the morning, okay?

816
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,570
Okay, we'll catch up
in the morning.

817
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,105
I want to know everything,
the whole story.

818
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,480
Good night, man.

819
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,919
Wow, you're the man.

820
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,087
Dawn?

821
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,556
Dawn.

822
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,693
Oh my God.
Bobby, thank God.

823
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,696
- They took Brianna.
- Who did?

824
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,290
- Those two guys from the Mayan.
- Bordas's men?

825
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,300
They said that they were
gonna kill her

826
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,427
- if you didn't come and rescue her.
- Where did they go?

827
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,030
The abandoned pier by the bridge.
Bobby, please.

828
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,768
I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

829
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,333
No, wait, Bobby, wait.
No no, just wait a minute.

830
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,237
Bobby, wait.

831
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,249
Bobby, what are
you doing?

832
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:04,413
No, Bobby, I'm begging you,
please don't do this.

833
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,979
Bobby, just call
the police.

834
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,991
Why don't you call
Detective Briggs,

835
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,583
see if he can help?

836
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,821
Honey, I need you to go
back in the house.

837
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,830
- I know what I'm doing.
- You know what, Bobby?

838
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,890
I don't think that you do
know what you're doing.

839
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,994
Dawn, I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

840
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,471
Go back in the house.

841
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,145
- Briggs.
- Detective Briggs,

842
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,672
Seth Bordas's men

843
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,685
broke into our house
and took our daughter.

844
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,277
Mrs. Kalinowski?

845
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,717
All right, listen,
calm down.

846
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,693
Tell me
everything you know.

847
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,632
When my dad gets here,
he's gonna kick your ass,

848
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,662
meatheads.

849
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,674
Not likely.

850
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:36,371
It's not nice to talk
to people like that, kid.

851
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,505
Didn't your daddy
teach you anything?

852
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,047
And I'm not a meathead.
I went to community college.

853
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,609
Did you graduate?

854
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,417
No.

855
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,609
Put that down.

856
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,927
Watch out.

857
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:42,073
Hello, sweetheart.
My name is Seth.

858
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,738
I'm a friend
of your father's.

859
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:44,973
I gotta pee.

860
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,141
I'm sorry, dear,

861
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:48,844
that just isn't
gonna happen.

862
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,819
Fine, then I'll just
go right here.

863
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,117
Deacon, take her.

864
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,597
This way.
Move it.

865
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,294
Is everybody in position?

866
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,304
Yes, sir.

867
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,363
Perfect.

868
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,942
Right here.

869
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,143
Thanks.

870
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,015
Hey, look over there.

871
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,452
Yeah, right.

872
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,422
- Oh my gosh.
- What?

873
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,750
That's something
my dad taught me.

874
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,369
Who's the meathead now?

875
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,395
Come on.

876
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:50,477
What the hell
happened to you?

877
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:54,574
The little bitch
kicked me in the balls,

878
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,108
and then she
took off running.

879
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,313
Idiot.

880
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,322
Let me tell you
something, Deacon--

881
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,846
you let her
get away again,

882
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,722
and you're gonna be wearing
your balls for earrings.

883
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,488
You get me?

884
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,519
You big moron.

885
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,100
Stop. Ow.
You're hurting me.

886
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,403
Stop.

887
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,563
Shut up.

888
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,165
Would you do something
about her?

889
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,940
Let her go.

890
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:03,418
Ah, Officer Briggs.

891
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,942
Welcome to the party.

892
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,080
I said
let the kid go.

893
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,988
I don't take orders
from you.

894
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,993
It's none of
your business.

895
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,995
Why don't you do
what you do best--

896
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,792
look the other way?

897
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,390
Are you out of your
fucking mind--

898
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,869
grabbing a kid,
kidnapping?

899
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:23,064
What the fuck
are you thinking?

900
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,073
Would you look
at this?

901
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,132
A crooked cop
with a conscience--

902
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,144
how heroic.

903
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:32,045
Seth, looking the other way
on a drug deal is one thing.

904
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,107
Grabbing a kid--
you're over the line.

905
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,119
Oh, am l?

906
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,179
Because of that kid's
father, Ethan's dead.

907
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,849
The universe
has to balance.

908
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,416
That girl's father
is a war hero.

909
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,621
Your brother's
a world-class asshole.

910
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,152
Where's the balance
in that?

911
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,688
Don't you fucking call
my brother an asshole.

912
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,530
Oh, come on, man.

913
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,536
Your brother's
a smartass coke freak

914
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,698
that pisses people off
for a living, you included.

915
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,731
Stop it.

916
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,453
Who do you think told
Nicky Wilcox

917
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,547
what's on that
tape, huh?

918
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,785
I'll tell you who.
It was Ethan.

919
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,794
Ethan's popping off
to Nicky

920
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,695
and, dumb luck for you,
the junkie calls me.

921
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,994
You shut the fuck up
now, Briggs.

922
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,005
Ethan Bordas

923
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,007
always wanted to be
big brother Seth,

924
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,009
always wanted
to be you,

925
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,136
resenting the fact
that he would never be

926
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:40,376
anything than your
little brother.

927
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,384
Truth is, that kid

928
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,886
was so sick of being
in your shadow

929
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,888
that he had to get
himself killed

930
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,890
to craw out
from under it.

931
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:50,858
Seth, your brother--

932
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,918
Shut up!

933
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:58,299
Ethan wasn't
my brother.

934
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,302
What?

935
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:03,328
He wasn't my brother.

936
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,500
He was my son--

937
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,033
my son.

938
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,740
You hear me?

939
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,748
My son.

940
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,750
When I was 16

941
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,752
I was fooling around
with the girl upstairs

942
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,754
and she got pregnant.

943
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,018
Her parents wanted her
to get rid of the kid,

944
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,025
but my mother
wouldn't have it.

945
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,357
So when Ethan was born
we took him in

946
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,853
and she told everybody
that he was hers.

947
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:32,390
So you see, Briggs,

948
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,402
me grabbing the kid

949
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,597
of the guy
that killed my kid

950
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,106
makes perfect sense.

951
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:42,543
Seth, it's not gonna
bring your son back.

952
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,069
Now I can fix this.

953
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,082
It's not too late

954
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,677
if you just
give me the girl.

955
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,711
And we go back to doing
what we do best--

956
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,280
making money.

957
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,690
Okay.

958
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,886
All right.

959
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,692
All right.

960
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,391
Take her.

961
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,631
It's okay, sweetie.
It's over.

962
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,166
You'll be home soon.

963
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,852
I lied, cop.

964
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,186
I never like that
piece-of-shit cop anyway.

965
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,993
Bordas, if my daughter isn't
released in five seconds,

966
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,763
this next shot
goes through your head.

967
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:44,000
Don't move, Kalinowski,
or I'll kill your daughter.

968
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,028
Go ahead.

969
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,598
What?

970
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,941
I said go ahead.
Then I'm gonna shoot your boss

971
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,447
right between his eyes.

972
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,449
Let her go, Deacon.

973
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:56,110
Do what he says.

974
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,051
I knew you'd come
and save me.

975
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,154
- You okay, Bri?
- I am now.

976
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:07,253
So what now, war hero?
Are you gonna shoot me?

977
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,264
Well, that's up to you.

978
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,858
I don't want to, but if you
keep coming after me,

979
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,733
what choice do I have?

980
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,705
You win.

981
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,103
Call your men off.

982
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,381
It's over.

983
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,406
Bobby Kalinowski's
free to go.

984
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,816
Let's go, baby.

985
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,910
Go after them.

986
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,065
Come here.
Bri, listen to me.

987
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,071
We need to hide you
for a little while.

988
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,369
- Oh.
- I know, baby. I'm sorry.

989
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,432
You'll be safe in here.

990
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,413
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Daddy.

991
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,472
Go kick their asses.

992
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:30,093
All I want to know is,
did you get him yet?

993
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,664
Almost. We got him cornered
down at the new pier.

994
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,936
No sign of the girl,
though.

995
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,568
Almost?

996
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,341
What if I almost put
my foot up your ass?

997
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,405
Yes, sir.

998
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,811
Move.

999
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,175
Come on, Kalinowski,
get up.

1000
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,851
Daddy?

1001
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,727
Not really.
Hello again, sweetheart.

1002
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,166
- Big Ronnie.
- Hey.

1003
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,171
I'm glad to see you.

1004
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,537
What took you so long?

1005
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,805
A strong current.

1006
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,711
Hey, go get your daughter, man.
I got this.

1007
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,085
Yeah?
Are you sure?

1008
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,522
What do you think he weighs,
about a buck fifty?

1009
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:31,287
Yeah, you got him.

1010
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,202
You really need that?

1011
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,195
I was thinking
the same thing.

1012
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,252
Come here.

1013
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,811
Shut up.
Trouble!

1014
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,381
Oh, yeah, big trouble.

1015
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,256
Let her go, Seth.

1016
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,090
- No.
- Let her go.

1017
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,859
No, you took my child.
I'm gonna take yours.

1018
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,559
What?

1019
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,194
No, Bordas,
Ethan took his own life

1020
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,727
when he decided
to attack my wife.

1021
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,603
Shut up, shut up.

1022
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,631
All right, your move,
big man.

1023
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,576
What are you
gonna do now,

1024
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,579
kill us both?

1025
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:05,739
No.

1026
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,271
Just you.

1027
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,151
Daddy.

1028
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,221
You okay, baby?

1029
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,934
Wow.

1030
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,943
Brianna,
meet Big Ronnie.

1031
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,138
Ronnie, Brianna.

1032
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,977
It's a pleasure
to meet you finally.

1033
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,074
Hey, man,
thank you.

1034
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,313
All right.

1035
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,617
I guess this makes us
even, huh?

1036
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,316
No, we're not even.

1037
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,325
I saved your ass,
like, three times.

1038
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,327
You only saved me once.

1039
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,953
Even?

1040
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,464
I saved you
in the park.

1041
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:34,026
I saved you from those
two fat guys.

1042
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,629
I saved you
from ninja boy.

1043
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,265
Save me, like
two more times

1044
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,275
before we're even.

1045
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,472
Wait, the park?
You set me up in the park.

1046
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,481
Yeah yeah yeah.
You still owe me.

1047
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,982
Who's he?

1048
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,984
An old war buddy, baby.

1049
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,009
Well, he's cool.

1050
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,816
Yeah, he's cool.

1051
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,186
But you're cooler.

1052
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:58,317
But his tattoos were awesome.
I want one.

1053
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,328
- No, no tattoos.
- Please, Daddy, come on.

1054
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,296
We're not gonna talk
about this, Bri.

1055
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,321
Just one,
one little one.
