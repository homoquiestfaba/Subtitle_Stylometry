1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,631
You're tuned to Bludso on the radio.

2
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,343
Stage one of my dramatic transformation
is almost complete.

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,387
Oh, my God. You're such a child.

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,475
Well, I'm an actual child, so...

5
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,572
How is that an insult?

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,285
It just means it's working.

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,194
Girls, we're home!

8
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,751
Listeners, the music
will be right back after a quick break.

9
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,299
Fine, but don't get mad when
you're just as nappy as you ever were.

10
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,545
- Come on, Linda!
- I'm right here!

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,177
Ow! Linda!

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,054
Oh! Aah!

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,349
Calm down.
I'm putting the neutralizer in now.

14
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,643
Hurry up. It really hurts!

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,019
Hold on.

16
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,898
Anna, you've been with
our family for a year.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,859
This is way past due.

18
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,778
You might could pass
as my sister, after all.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,613
Should it still burn?

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,198
Linda!

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,117
Hey, what... What's going on up there?

22
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,797
That hurts.

23
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,162
Linda?

24
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,426
I did what the box told me.

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,877
I did what the box told me.

26
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,265
Girls!

27
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,797
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,465
I didn't mean to!

29
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,925
- Hey, what's going on up there?
- It was the box!

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,261
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do it!

31
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,262
Ow.

32
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,406
The call was for
a Downtown Julie Brown type.

33
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,106
Someone worldly, articulate,

34
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,495
knowledgeable, charismatic?

35
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,653
Black?

36
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,242
Assistant at Culture for four years.

37
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,327
- Uh-huh.
- They never gave you a shot?

38
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,633
Only so many spots in Culture.

39
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:43,003
Um, we just need a little bit more
rock than urban here.

40
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,504
Perfect.

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,133
I appeal to a global audience,
you know?

42
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:53,013
"It's Anna Bludso, coming at you
with the hottest of the hot."

43
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,276
Thank you so much.

44
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,588
RMV. Rock Music Video.

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,342
The only place that will rock you.
You know you want it.

46
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,227
- Oh!
- Hey. All right.

47
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,189
She doesn't work here,
does she?

48
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,216
From the people
that brought you RMV,

49
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,082
we are Culture.

50
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,751
Featuring Brook-Lynne, Sista Soul,

51
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,545
and Julius.

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,643
Culture. We're coming on for you.

53
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,771
Damn it.

54
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,189
All right, big board meeting.

55
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,983
You're all called here.
You know something's up.

56
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,527
And I'm not gonna bullshit you.
Do you know what Culture is

57
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,654
to the suits downstairs?

58
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,126
It's a liability.

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,536
It's in place only so that
Yetnikoff at CBS and Clive Davis at Arista

60
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,510
don't sue RMV's asses
for not playing "that black disco shit."

61
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,470
Their words.

62
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,003
I'd love to tell you the board put me here

63
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,337
because they think I'm
some kind of wunderkind,

64
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,048
but the truth is, anytime they see
an executive with a hairline

65
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,259
and a working dick, they think
he's not qualified to do shit,

66
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,023
except babysit a loss leader.

67
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,693
But let me tell you something.

68
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,863
This is exactly where I want to be.

69
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,564
I spent my entire summer at the Apollo,
kicking it with Teddy Riley,

70
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,524
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

71
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,749
Hip hop? This New Jack shit?

72
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,698
It's the future.

73
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,949
And not just black music.

74
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,910
It's the future of the
entire music industry.

75
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,411
And we have a chance to own it.

76
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,663
Look at Julius' whack-ass fade.

77
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,624
- He's cute.
- Is not.

78
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,877
- Nigga think he Eddie Murphy.
- Shut up!

79
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,129
- She ain't wrong.
- Which is why Edna

80
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,715
has decided to step down
as EVP of programming.

81
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,592
- Wait, what?
- Edna!

82
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,888
- Hell, no.
- Culture needs to grow in a direction I simply cannot take it.

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,183
- It's okay. It's totally admirable.
- She said she was gonna give me a raise.

84
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,727
- Well, that's out.
- I begged her to stay.

85
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,897
But I'm confident
we're in excellent hands.

86
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,316
Allow me to introduce your new EVP:

87
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,485
The legendary Zora Choice.

88
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,239
- Thank you, Grant.
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

89
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,950
They say I'm the world's first
black supermodel.

90
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,660
Of course it's a light-skinned bitch.

91
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,786
And what does a...

92
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,955
An aging supermodel
know about running a channel?

93
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:09,209
Well, I've been quietly inching my way
toward this goal for quite some time now.

94
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,880
And rest assured, I will be consulting
the brilliant Edna Knight

95
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,882
- as long as she'll have me.
- Absolutely.

96
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,926
Programming will be suspended

97
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,887
for a few weeks while we are retooling.

98
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,932
I, I know it seems sudden,
but we simply must.

99
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,186
If Cult, and that's what we're calling it,
by the way,

100
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,232
if Cult is going to be the authority
on pop culture in the '90s,

101
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,943
well, we simply must be sure
of its direction.

102
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,405
My assistant Rosalyn will be
setting up meetings with all of you,

103
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,823
just to get to know you,

104
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,034
and find out what skills
you will bring to Cult.

105
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,620
"The Block" continues to do
well enough in the ratings.

106
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:50,625
Especially with our very exciting and
contractually obligated Sandra premiere.

107
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,211
That program will continue
as scheduled.

108
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,007
If this succeeds,
we change popular culture.

109
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,717
Y'all, we are doomed.

110
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,260
Come on, there's gotta be
something we can do.

111
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,678
Edna, this is your channel.

112
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,556
- Look, I just bought a condo, okay?
I'm not going back to radio.

113
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,392
Edna, she brought her own assistant!

114
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,687
Okay, look, I'm gonna start
my own production company

115
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,398
that's programming for us, by us.

116
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,650
Now, it's gonna take
a few months to get started,

117
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,528
but I will be calling you all, okay?

118
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,502
And then maybe we can work for
somebody other than them.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,244
Uh, I'll be waiting by the phone.

120
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,498
It's your man Julius,
and welcome to The Block,

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,960
where we got a bangin' exclusive
from the princess of pop soul.

122
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,004
It's already on the Billboard top 10,

123
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,299
- and has its sights on number one.
- Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you.

124
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,510
Thank you so... I'm so sorry I'm late,
guys. Beauty takes time.

125
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,470
Anna better not be
still hooking up with him.

126
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,222
You know Anna
don't live in the real world.

127
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,098
- Oh, hey, Anna.
- Thanks for proofing, girl.

128
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,060
- No problem.
- ...four, three, two,

129
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,686
Hey, it's your man, Julius,

130
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,522
and welcome to The Block,

131
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,399
where we got a bangin' exclusive
from the princess of pop soul...

132
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,943
"I Get It!"

133
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,206
I said...

134
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,888
Is that a new nose?

135
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,348
Contouring.

136
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,445
And contacts, maybe?

137
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,360
Oh, that thing must be glued down.

138
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,612
Or a really good relaxer, maybe.

139
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,198
Mm-mm, my shit don't move like that,
and I'm part Cherokee.

140
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,200
It's a weave, I think.

141
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,287
Yeah, my girl Tanitra
just started doing those.

142
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,622
Take whatever hair you want
and sew it into your real hair.

143
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,667
- Ugh, that sounds painful.
And expensive.

144
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,044
It actually sounds like a good idea.

145
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,589
Guess it's better than
a creamy crack, right?

146
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,133
Of course,
I know what's better than either.

147
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,344
- Okay, Sojourner Truth.
Ain't nobody got time for all that upkeep.

148
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,067
- Really, dookie braids?
- It didn't take that long.

149
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,957
Hell, I think I need me a cigarette.

150
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,292
I think I need a weave.

151
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,919
How anyone can sew someone else's

152
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,879
dead energy into their head is beyond me.

153
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,423
You see shorty's hair?

154
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,258
I get it, okay?

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,898
Aah.

156
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,908
Ahem.

157
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,036
- Crazy day.
- Humph.

158
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,365
So, what are you doing tonight?

159
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,450
You know,

160
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,257
I've been seeing someone.

161
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,803
You heard me. Hmm?

162
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,379
Like, a therapist, or...

163
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,049
I know I've crossed some lines.

164
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,885
Turned us into something
we should have never been.

165
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,638
We've been crossing a line for years.

166
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,776
Fresh!

167
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,697
You know, I'll take
full responsibility for it.

168
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,617
We crossed the line this afternoon
in your dressing room!

169
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,787
But you pushed for that, though.

170
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,581
I am sorry.

171
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,585
It's, it's been killing me, though.
All right?

172
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,170
Has it?

173
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,845
Anna! We need you now!

174
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,211
Coming!

175
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,340
Jesus.

176
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,889
Anna, you all right, girl?

177
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,891
Yeah, just...

178
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,019
these cramps, and this,
this damned machine.

179
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,854
Oh, just ask.

180
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,160
You know we are all synced up in here.

181
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,706
Hey.

182
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,125
You'll be all right.

183
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,782
Why would they get rid of you?

184
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,173
You barely cost the network anything.

185
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,467
You ever have a dream...

186
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,262
Something...

187
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,003
you would do anything for?

188
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,476
Especially when someone says...

189
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,217
you can't do it.

190
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,302
You don't deserve it.

191
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,066
You were that dream for me.

192
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,891
No. Your career was your dream.

193
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,282
Just know that I will always love you.

194
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,106
My lovin'.

195
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,619
You're never gotta get it.

196
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,361
That was amazing.

197
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,030
Sandra, oh, my gosh.
She's so sexy. So beautiful.

198
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,242
Listen, I'm your man, Julius.
And I'm gonna be here,

199
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,786
you know, I got some stuff
to really put you in the mood.

200
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,789
Get your candy box going, ladies.
Put a little bit of sugar in there.

201
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,293
I got everything that you need.
That's right. Everything right here.

202
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,919
Right here. You know.

203
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,213
I love using
this time to talk to the ladies,

204
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,923
because you all buy tickets to things,

205
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,385
so y'all know where I'm gonna be at.
I'm gonna be DJing downtown...

206
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,553
You're ten days late!

207
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,567
Don't think I won't
kick your ass out of here!

208
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,411
God damn it.

209
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,581
All right, I'll be back tomorrow.

210
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,138
I thought she was just
getting to know us.

211
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,018
Hey girl, how you holdin' up?

212
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,237
Anna? Zora will see you now.

213
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:21,993
Girl to girl, this isn't a chat.
It's an interview. Understand?

214
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,966
I'm getting the picture.

215
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,882
So, you were Edna's assistant, no?

216
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,635
I mean, I'm sure
you're much more than that.

217
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,387
You've been here forever.

218
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,401
But that was your title.

219
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,891
Yes.

220
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:49,437
Edna was very concerned
about her dear Anna.

221
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,326
She never got you promoted?

222
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,067
It almost happened.

223
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,653
After I came up with The Block,
Edna said...

224
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,488
You came up with The Block?

225
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,950
I wanted to produce, and host, but...

226
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,547
But that went to Julius.

227
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:06,705
Hmm.

228
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,053
Julius was a receptionist
when I started.

229
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,765
Mr. Madison must have
seen something in him.

230
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,311
So, what do you think of the network,
as a whole?

231
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,021
Um...

232
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,941
Uh, empowering.

233
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,652
Once more with feeling, darling.

234
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,365
The Block is a good start.

235
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,703
But I think Grant's right.
This new Teddy Riley sound...

236
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:41,781
Everyone's stealing our styles,
and making it palatable for RMV.

237
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,284
Our music is way beyond the black charts

238
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,174
and we're the only one in town
who will play them.

239
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,637
It's not a niche. It's the future.

240
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,169
Why aren't we playing the real deal,

241
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,923
like, what the kids who buy music
actually listen to?

242
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,021
Culture viewership skews fairly older.

243
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,525
Um, right.

244
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:10,280
So, our VJs could...

245
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,897
host different blocks
of specialized videos

246
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,357
throughout the day.

247
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,610
And we could...

248
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:22,364
more than host.
They could rep different styles of music.

249
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,325
And they have their viewers call in,

250
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,244
and vote for their favorites.

251
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,704
Something for everyone, you know?

252
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,581
So no one feels left out.

253
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:35,627
All while we cultivate
a more engaged audience.

254
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,560
Consumer research disguised
as entertainment.

255
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,092
Sounds pricey.

256
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:46,358
- RMV has plenty of empty stages.
We just need a phone line.

257
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,062
Uh, and it all culminates into

258
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,869
a daily live countdown show.

259
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,664
Do me a write-up.

260
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,156
A treatment, some sample scripts,

261
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,713
budget, list of guests that could come on.

262
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,635
How did you know I'd ask for this?

263
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,971
I didn't.

264
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,185
Obviously, I don't need an assistant.

265
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,011
Perhaps an associate producer.

266
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,368
Uh, Anna, who... who does your hair?

267
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,704
No one.

268
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,331
Me.

269
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,334
Aren't you tired of it?

270
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,451
All the stares you get
walking through the RMV lobby?

271
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,590
Everyone wondering why you're here.

272
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,750
If you went to any other floor
in this tower for a job interview,

273
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,597
you wouldn't get past reception.

274
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:00,891
And you know that.

275
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,895
Sistas get fired for less than that
every day.

276
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,096
Now, music people have
certain expectations,

277
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,819
and my girls need to flow freely.

278
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,938
I wonder, do you want to be
one of my girls?

279
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Yes.

280
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,303
Anna's living in a fantasy.

281
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,972
I mean, how long...

282
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,683
- Uh, so this is the book Mama gave me...
- Hey, baby.

283
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,853
Uh, took me years to track it down.

284
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,773
Look who decided to grace us
with her presence.

285
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,733
Unc.

286
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,734
Mama used to know all these by heart.

287
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,987
Almost wondered if there was even
an actual book.

288
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,864
Something new for his
wall of oppression.

289
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,615
Child, please.

290
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,702
Does
it have the, um... what was it?

291
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,873
- "Skinny, Skinny" story.
- "Skinny, skinny, don't you know me."

292
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,751
It's a folk tale the slaves
used to tell about witches

293
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,045
who would leave their own skin
at night to go haunting.

294
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,047
- Oh.
- Aah.

295
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,342
"Moss Hair Girl."
That was the one Mom used to tell.

296
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,356
Uh, can I take a look?

297
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,931
- Uh, yeah.
- Thank you.

298
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,392
So, Anna, how's work?

299
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,811
- Intense.
- Um, I can relate to that.

300
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,730
I hardly see this one anymore.

301
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,859
Well, they have me teaching history now,
in addition to English lit,

302
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,904
and I just started an after school
college prep program.

303
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,739
- Remarkable.
- Uh...

304
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,742
I'm sorry. Anna, I cut you off.
You were talking about work?

305
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,327
Now, are you still interning
for that lady?

306
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,414
Executive assistant, and no.

307
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,082
Actually, she left the company.

308
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,835
Oh. Your job's not
in jeopardy now, is it?

309
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,129
No! Not at all.

310
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,631
Look, they're doing some retooling,

311
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:11,259
and actually, they're looking at giving me
my own show, so...

312
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,023
When does it air, Anna?

313
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,308
I mean, there's still a lot to do,
so it might be a while,

314
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,352
but it's all moving along.

315
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,020
Hope it works out.

316
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,606
It already is, so...

317
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,484
- Oh, the flying African story.
I did my thesis on these.

318
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,736
- Yes!
- No, that's in there?

319
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,321
It's ridiculous.

320
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,417
I'm sorry?

321
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,327
I'm just, um,

322
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,914
surprised to see a room
full of people

323
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,916
with doctorates, like,

324
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,961
trippin' over superstitions
and fairy tales.

325
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,224
Fairy tales.

326
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,090
Humph.

327
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,217
How does one group of people
subjugate another?

328
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,829
Uh, Amos... No,
no, no. I'm just educating the girl.

329
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,347
You subjugate a people

330
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,684
by telling them their science
is superstition,

331
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:04,563
their faith is heresy,
and their wisdom is make-believe.

332
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,857
They called the American Indians savages.

333
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,120
And they called us...

334
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,485
Well, what didn't they call us?

335
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,446
- I got it, okay?
- No, you don't get it.

336
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,658
From the moment you are born,
you are so thoroughly indoctrinated

337
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,452
by the insanity of
Western European world views,

338
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,456
you can't bear to see yourself
the way nature would have.

339
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:27,544
And you scoff at us and our superstitions.
Well...

340
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:31,631
those superstitions are in fact
tributaries leading to rivers

341
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:35,635
and oceans of truth
about what you really are.

342
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,929
And who you might have been.

343
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,821
Someone pass the salt.

344
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:47,063
Uh, why you never bring Julius?

345
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,524
His show is doing really well, so...

346
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,817
it keeps him busy.

347
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,236
- Hmm.
- Our show, really.

348
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,250
But you're making your rent, right?

349
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,033
Anna, no. Your credit.

350
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,285
You can't mess with that. Baby...
They wanna raise the rent 500-

351
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,746
- What? What? 500?

352
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,706
Five hundred bucks. I'll figure it out.

353
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,625
No, that is outrageous.

354
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,211
White folks started moving in, so...

355
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:12,684
Well, they have a habit
of doing that, don't they?

356
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,091
- Auntie, no.
- Mm-mm.

357
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,929
Please. Your uncle doesn't know anything
about my little account.

358
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:24,029
Humph. Besides, you can pay me back
when your show comes through.

359
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,656
Okay?

360
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:29,951
Okay.

361
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,567
Mm. So...

362
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,152
We finally gonna do something...
Auntie!

363
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,364
Oh, okay. All right. I'm just sayin'...

364
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,158
Wigs have gone a long way since,
you know...

365
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,827
last time you tried 'em.

366
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,757
What'd you want me to do with that?

367
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,968
It's a book. People read 'em.

368
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,428
I'm good.

369
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:54,518
I forget to leave Professor Bludso
at work sometimes.

370
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,895
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,013
Don't you think Kieren might be
more into that folklore stuff?

372
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,515
You're into it, too.

373
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,852
As long as it involves a fly girl
making it big in the city.

374
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,187
Starring Sandra.

375
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,022
- A fly girl, huh?
- Hey.

376
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,778
Their stories run the world.

377
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,334
Sure as the sun, these are ours.

378
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:51,856
Hi.

379
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:55,025
Um, are your prices listed?

380
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,610
Oh, for a sew in?

381
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,625
- Yeah.
- Oh, hair and service is 450.

382
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,908
- Four hundred and fifty?
- Mm.

383
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,952
And Virgie's earliest appointment
is the 15th...

384
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,466
of February.

385
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,832
Look, sista to sista,

386
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,417
I work in TV.

387
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,336
I'm actually a VJ at Culture,

388
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:18,006
and girl to girl, I really need this.

389
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,218
Well, I can see that.

390
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,847
Look, I don't know how it works
in your hood, or wherever.

391
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,310
But we are a world-class salon, okay?

392
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,159
Look, I'm sure you can find
someone else to hook you up.

393
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,332
Excuse me!

394
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,490
- Hi.
- Uh, Denise?

395
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,200
Please. I just need a moment.

396
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,285
You ever had a dream?

397
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,454
One you'd be willing
to do anything for?

398
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,249
Very few things are worth
doing anything for, baby.

399
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:55,585
Right. Especially when
everyone says you can't do it.

400
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,254
You don't deserve this,
says you don't belong

401
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,685
where you know
your destiny tells you to be.

402
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,271
Sista, have you ever been there?

403
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,469
Okay.

404
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,608
It'll be my good deed for the day.

405
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:11,697
You can wait over
there until she can slip you in.

406
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,540
Sweetheart.

407
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,796
All right, baby.

408
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,257
Let's find her.

409
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,012
Go on and look around, honey.

410
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,308
You won't see my supply
at any other salon.

411
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,272
My sources are exclusive.

412
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,953
I thought so.

413
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,736
I really do feel something.

414
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,750
Clients wear this stuff as magic.

415
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,283
You know, in some parts of India,

416
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,411
a woman's hair is her
most prized possession.

417
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,623
It's the greatest sacrifice
she can make to her gods.

418
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,917
This came all the way from India?

419
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,848
Forget about where it's from.

420
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,047
Let's focus on where it's going.

421
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,806
You're not tender-headed, are you?

422
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:13,974
I'm sorry!

423
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,571
I'll be fine.

424
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,696
Aah.

425
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,202
Ow.

426
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,162
My mama used a hot comb on me.

427
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,553
And she burned the shit
out of my scalp.

428
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,927
Ow. Ow.

429
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,986
You almost finished?

430
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,710
Ow.

431
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,262
Sweetheart.

432
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:19,152
I'm sorry, I... I've never had
my hair done before.

433
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,243
You're not the first to faint.

434
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,758
Ow.

435
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,657
- It's...
- Stunning.

436
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,083
My line of essential oils for the scalp.

437
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,336
Proprietary blend.

438
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,411
You want to get it between your braids
and work it into the hair,

439
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,163
at least twice a day.

440
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:26,011
Trust me. And never get it wet.

441
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,169
It'll hurt for the first week or so.

442
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,518
A lot, but that's normal
for the first time.

443
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,479
But once you get through it,

444
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,775
I'll never be this bad again, okay?

445
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,934
I thought you said
there wouldn't be anybody else here.

446
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,572
She's leaving.

447
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,702
When she tells you not to get it wet,
believe her.

448
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,026
What the hell, Sandra?

449
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,414
Rain at the venue.

450
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,823
Manager wanted a Diana Ross moment.

451
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,449
Oh, such a fan.

452
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:03,245
I work for Culture, and it's all because
growing up, I saw you.

453
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,008
Someone who looks like me on TV.

454
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,554
Love, love the new video.

455
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,014
So does the label.

456
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,733
Hey! It's Anna. Leave a message.

457
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,777
Hey, it's Edna.

458
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,863
It's happening a lot faster
than I thought,

459
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,740
and I want you by my side.
Call me, sis.

460
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,757
This is it! Open it!

461
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,638
Fuck.

462
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,963
- What?
- Fuckin' rent! That's what.

463
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,560
I paid you.

464
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,633
That increase happened after...

465
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,677
The increase happened
when I say it did.

466
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,971
It's 500 bucks. Now.

467
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:06,183
What are you gonna do? Just
drag me into the middle of the street?

468
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,768
Mr. Tannen!

469
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,270
Cops will do that for me.

470
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:11,813
Mr. Tannen!

471
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:14,244
My toilet's overflowing!

472
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,506
"First there was only
the wild beasts and the red man.

473
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,187
Then the white man came
and brought our people."

474
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,899
"The Moss Haired Girl."

475
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,226
"The house negress was a plain woman"

476
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:34,867
"who took up walking in them woods
when her work was done."

477
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:40,068
"She'd see tress covered
in black moss so fine

478
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,736
"it looked like massa hair.

479
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,335
She stole the moss from the tree,
and made herself a wig."

480
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,417
Welcome back to RMV.

481
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,294
Can you believe it?
We are gonna do something so crazy

482
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,879
and so different for us right now.

483
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,839
Okay, the princess of soul, Sandra...

484
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,051
- Ow! Ow.
- Is now the queen of pop!

485
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,678
Her newest single "I Get It"
is rising the pop charts,

486
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,097
so let's give it up for her RMV debut.

487
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,153
Here's Sandra!

488
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,112
Yeah, man.

489
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,489
Oh, who dat?

490
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,074
Oh, oh, my, my, my.

491
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,672
Anna, uh, so I got these
Janet Jackson tickets, if you...

492
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:13,966
Feel like...

493
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,135
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

494
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,099
Hmm. Humph!

495
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,617
Aah.

496
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,080
- Mm.
- Wow.

497
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,571
You look good, girl.

498
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,877
Hey.

499
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,087
Thanks to you.

500
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,079
I overheard Zora's hair speech.

501
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,957
So, I thought she might like this.

502
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,470
How does it feel?

503
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,002
It's fine.

504
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,462
I know. When I first got mine in,
I wasn't used to all that length.

505
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,673
I was always swiping at my neck,

506
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,188
- like, "What is this?
- Yeah."

507
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:13,263
Oh, there's a planning meeting
in the conference room at 11:00,

508
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,973
and Zora wants you there.

509
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:17,196
She... She does?

510
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:18,685
She does.

511
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:31,990
Ew!

512
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,259
I told you.

513
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,305
So sad.

514
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,980
Mm. Lookin' fly, Anna.

515
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:54,429
Fuck you.

516
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,902
So, uh, here's where I'm at.

517
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,518
No more cooking shows.

518
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,394
No more hair shows.

519
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,522
No more endless blocks
of Anita Baker.

520
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:06,775
She gave us good love,
and we've had enough of it.

521
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,110
Ooh, uh, what's wrong with
Anita Baker?

522
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,238
Look, Hair Beat got mad ratings.

523
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,949
A point 6 in 5 share
would make me mad, as well.

524
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,242
That ain't bad for cable.

525
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,661
Brook, you are better than Hair Beat.

526
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,162
You've got personality.

527
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,747
With clothes that fit,
you could be a star.

528
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,124
Sista Soul, you could be...

529
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,429
something.

530
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,838
The quiet storm is a little
too loud for our channel.

531
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,131
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love the whole organic,

532
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,218
earthy dashiki vibe,
but we need to find you a new lane.

533
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,095
A new lane?

534
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:38,348
Sista, I represent black women, okay?

535
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,975
Real working women.

536
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,601
Who evidently don't have cable.

537
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,728
Don't come up in here trying to
make us something we ain't.

538
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,689
Yo, yo, yo. I don't want to change you.

539
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,315
- Mostly just Sista.
- Brook.

540
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:50,277
I want you more... whatever this is.

541
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,530
This is what we can sell
advertising around.

542
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,949
Uh, let us not be precious here.

543
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,546
Back me up on this, Anna.

544
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,371
Oh, so you've been
talking to her about us.

545
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,623
- Got it.
- I didn't say anything like that.

546
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,970
Humph.

547
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,460
- Wow.
- This is what I want to do.

548
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,422
I want to create a
programming centerpiece.

549
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,465
Live. Something fresh.

550
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,759
- A live call-in countdown show.
- Live countdown show.

551
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,720
- Viewers rank their favorite videos.
- ...vote for their favorites.

552
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,723
Then we create programming blocks to
showcase these videos, - ...who rep different styles.

553
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,142
...in new and exciting ways.

554
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:27,522
You want us to reprogram
an entire network...

555
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,608
...in six weeks?

556
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,207
If you plan to still be working here
in six weeks, Sheryl, yes.

557
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,250
What kind of advertising?

558
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,162
You wanted to see me?

559
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,800
What the hell was that in there?

560
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,458
I'm just confused.

561
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,126
You haven't commented on the proposal,

562
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,128
and suddenly...
You being invited in a meeting

563
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,559
with producers and hosts
was my comment.

564
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:55,938
Virgie's?

565
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:59,721
Yes.

566
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,026
It has her signature.

567
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,655
What?

568
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,202
Are you giving me the show?

569
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,044
To host?

570
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:23,215
Awful big bet to make on someone
who's never hosted a show before.

571
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,790
Like the one Grant made on Julius?

572
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,959
Or is Julius somehow special?

573
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,337
What are you getting at?

574
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,007
It just seems like Julius is the
only one not under a microscope.

575
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,219
Like he's getting special treatment
or something.

576
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,983
And why would he get that?

577
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,433
Because we're fucking?

578
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,322
What?

579
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,992
We're fucking.

580
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,357
You have a problem with that?

581
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:53,525
Why would I?

582
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,653
Your private life is your business.

583
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,030
A live show is all hands on deck.

584
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,740
I need everyone working on this.

585
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,922
I will decide who the lead is
when I can see what you all can do.

586
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:06,007
Cool?

587
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,834
Oh, and, uh, Anna?

588
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:13,182
Get your girls in check.

589
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,823
Zora's who you've been seeing?

590
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,566
Nigga, you get out the hood
off my idea. You wanna what, trade up?

591
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,151
Just chill with that.

592
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,235
Who else knows?

593
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:41,406
- Your girl told me.
And I use the term "girl" very loosely.

594
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,659
- 'Cause she old enough to be your mama.
- Enough with that.

595
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,785
Okay?

596
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,997
- But it makes sense.
'Cause you act like a fuckin' child!

597
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:53,335
So, what, you're gonna sleep your way
to the top, like a little bitch?

598
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:56,725
- What?
- This is the first time I actually heard you raise your voice.

599
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,353
- I kind of like it.
- Fuck you!

600
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,719
Listen, I don't want this
to get out okay?

601
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,304
Tell Zora that, then.

602
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,442
Oh, I will.

603
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,300
You know, I'm not the only one
with secrets around this place.

604
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,201
Unless you found somebody
to do that thing that you like.

605
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,651
What's that got to do with anything?

606
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,195
This is a gossipy office, and, uh...

607
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:23,043
your discretion is appreciated, okay?

608
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,631
We had fun.

609
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,342
Let's not make it more than that, okay?

610
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,047
Ow.

611
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,842
Hey, it's me!

612
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,927
Just wanted to make sure
you're not dead.

613
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,027
- Hey.
- Whoa.

614
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:34,686
So this is why you haven't been
at dinner in a while. Okay.

615
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,106
Oh, my God. Dad is going to flip.
And Mom?

616
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,121
- Actually, Mom's gonna love it, but...
- So nice to see you, too, Linda.

617
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:44,196
You hungry?

618
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,947
You can't get that wet, can you?

619
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,449
Like, at all.

620
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:50,368
Oh, honey. I think you're allergic.

621
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,370
No, it's human.

622
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:53,872
I think my neck's just...

623
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:57,042
not used to having all this
brushing up against it.

624
00:43:57,054 --> 00:44:00,807
Oh, so you're the one
that's been hogging this.

625
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,882
Unc gave that to me to read.

626
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,646
Yeah, like a month ago.

627
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:08,815
Okay. Keep it. I don't care.

628
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,285
Hey. I wasn't done!

629
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:22,871
It's fine.

630
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,363
Kieren says I've put on a few.

631
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,584
What?

632
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,451
Hey, what...

633
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,590
What does Julius think?

634
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,553
He loves it.

635
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:45,644
You must have all those
famous people on speed-dial.

636
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:50,053
I mean, not all of 'em.

637
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,110
So cool.

638
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:55,654
You knew what you were gonna do
your whole life.

639
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,782
Dad knew what I was gonna do
before I was even born.

640
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,368
Must be nice.

641
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,486
I should... I should go.

642
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,458
Oh, but first...

643
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:12,129
These are for you.

644
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:16,717
Aah! Thank you.

645
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,928
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

646
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,973
- Have a good night.
- Okay. Drive safe.

647
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,987
I always do!

648
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,617
You're
tuned to Bludso on the radio.

649
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:57,746
Stage one of my dramatic transformation
is almost complete.

650
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,278
Oh, my God. You're such a child.

651
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:04,544
Well, I'm an actual child, so...

652
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,379
how is that an insult?

653
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,261
It just means it's working.

654
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,059
Listeners, the music will be right back

655
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:20,656
after a quick break.

656
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,899
Fine, but don't
get mad when you're just as nappy as you ever were.

657
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,412
Mr. Tannen.

658
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,738
- May I help you with...?
- Do we still gotta do this?

659
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,198
Come on, Linda!

660
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,908
- I'm right here!
- Do what?

661
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:39,716
I actually have your money.

662
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,386
W-Why don't you hold onto it?

663
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,378
You been drinking, Mr. Tannen?

664
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,589
- Don't do that.
You're not the only one, you know.

665
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:50,853
I know the game.

666
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,176
You know, my cousin's actually waiting...

667
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,232
No, she's not.

668
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,693
Relax, baby.

669
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,446
Black pussy is a passion of mine.

670
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,367
How about some music? Thin walls, right?

671
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:08,567
Okay.

672
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,210
YOUNG ANNA : Linda!

673
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:33,812
Fuck!

674
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,427
Aah! Aah!

675
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,680
Aah!

676
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,152
Aah!

677
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,613
We're just gettin' started. Yeah!

678
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,224
Mr. Tannen?

679
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,396
Mr. Tannen.

680
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,164
Oh.

681
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,676
What the fuck is this?

682
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:11,815
Good morning, Los Angeles.

683
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:14,693
You were listening to "One Night,"
the latest from Sandra.

684
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,237
We got traffic and weather coming up
for you right after the break,

685
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,446
but first, some good news.

686
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,573
Stay close to that dial

687
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:22,117
for your chance to win tickets
to see the The Fellas,

688
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,244
live and in concert at the Forum.

689
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,545
- We're ready to transport.
- All right.

690
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:39,050
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mm-hmm. Mr. Tannen.

691
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:42,149
They found that bastard
dead in the dumpster.

692
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:46,558
The door to the roof was open.
There was empty bottles of gin everywhere.

693
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,019
You know what? I bet he slipped.

694
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,854
Ooh, that drunk-ass.

695
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,117
Liv.

696
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:54,203
Yeah.

697
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,205
How horrible.

698
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:57,986
You know what he did to me?

699
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,864
He tried to raise my rent by $500.

700
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,837
I had to threaten to sue his ass.
He ever try that shit with you?

701
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:09,456
- No. Thank God.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, praise Heaven.

702
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:11,541
Fucking rapist.

703
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,588
Damn, that took a turn.

704
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,300
Ooh, Mr. Tannen, you dead.
Bye, girl.

705
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:40,165
I'm not changing who I am
just to appeal to some whiter...

706
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,532
...wider demographic.

707
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:46,701
No one's asking you
to change who you are. Just...

708
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,090
the way you look.

709
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,121
The name of your show.

710
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,123
It's not that big of a deal.

711
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,459
You know how long
it took me to get here?

712
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,920
How many interviews I've had to walk into,

713
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,339
not knowing if they wanted Angela Davis,

714
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,842
or Diahann Carroll, or Queen Latifah,

715
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:04,177
or fucking Claire Huxtable.

716
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,304
I'm sick of this shit!

717
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,558
- Come on, Sista.
It ain't gotta be all that.

718
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,227
I mean, look. Black women are magic.
You know that.

719
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,145
We could put our hair
all the way up to the sky,

720
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:16,606
drape it down to our shoulders,
or somewhere in between.

721
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,609
Shit, Patti LaBelle changed her hairstyle
20 times in one performance.

722
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,027
What you need is a new attitude.

723
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,821
Yeah, but that was her choice.

724
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,614
A career in TV was your choice.

725
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,576
I chose a career at Culture.

726
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,036
A place where I ain't gotta
look like a different bitch every week

727
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,121
just to do what I love.

728
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,594
Culture is dead.

729
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:36,221
For real?

730
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,462
- Sista.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

731
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:40,475
Sista...

732
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:44,104
Sista...

733
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,512
Hey.

734
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,932
- Yes, Sheryl?
- Um, is this a programming meeting?

735
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,225
It was.

736
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,906
I wasn't informed.

737
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,325
I'm the VP of programming.

738
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:59,232
What have you done for me lately?

739
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,414
Anna, you have a month.

740
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:08,116
It's not fair. It's not,

741
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,088
playing by these rules, but...

742
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:13,425
Do you really want to quit the game?

743
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:18,805
And it's fun. I'm telling you.
It's like...

744
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,725
Like Halloween or something.

745
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,510
People look at you
and they see somebody else,

746
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:31,485
and somehow, you become...
more of yourself.

747
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:36,949
Or at least, a bigger version, or...

748
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:39,993
I don't know.

749
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,151
Look,

750
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,445
let's just get through this season,

751
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:47,405
and then take that shit out.

752
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,616
Wear what you want to wear.

753
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:54,746
And we'll all go to Jamaica, or something.

754
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,623
Jamaica, bitch?

755
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,054
You, me, and Brook.

756
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:02,307
Look...

757
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,061
Please, please don't quit.

758
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:09,940
Y'all the only ones here I understand.

759
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:17,531
I'll think about it.

760
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:19,950
Got the news.

761
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,986
Never again.

762
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:59,144
Baxter was a...

763
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:02,701
a bad man. But I'm not...

764
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,214
Aah!

765
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,845
Come on! Come on, come on!

766
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,836
So, Sista.

767
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,338
Divas with soul.

768
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,048
A block of all women,

769
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,426
MCs, soul singers,
and of course, occasionally,

770
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,023
the men we love.

771
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:35,817
Nice.

772
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:44,272
Um, so, with Sista,

773
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:48,080
we now have enough VJs for every segment
of the audience.

774
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:52,656
Mm, that just leaves a host.

775
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:56,159
I think you'd agree that
no one Grant's team suggested had that.

776
00:54:56,171 --> 00:55:00,205
Anna, I know how hard
you're angling for this, and...

777
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:02,678
I've seen the work you're putting in,
and...

778
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:04,918
I'm impressed.

779
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,061
You still using the pink stuff?

780
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:14,427
Yeah.

781
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:15,816
It's not enough, is it?

782
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,695
What? Do you mean...?

783
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:22,227
Guess who...?

784
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,105
Ooh. My bad, Anna.

785
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:28,233
You, uh, ready for that lunch meeting?

786
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,818
I'm starving.

787
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,752
Can't wait for tonight.

788
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,725
You okay, Sis?

789
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,342
Up all night.

790
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,315
Lord, they put this thing in tight.

791
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,597
I'll be all right.

792
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:01,641
- What changed your mind, girl?
I love it.

793
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,101
Me, too, girl.

794
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,493
You did good today.

795
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,370
Thanks, girl.

796
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,301
Ow.

797
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:29,431
Are you serious?

798
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,229
This never happened.

799
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:50,959
What's up, everybody?
We are here to celebrate

800
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:54,796
the hottest 24-hour music network, Cult,

801
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,174
and here are The Fellas!

802
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,638
Hey.

803
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,488
Wow. Oh, my God.

804
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,240
You look great.

805
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,326
- Hey!
- Sista!

806
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,286
Look at you.

807
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,579
Wow!

808
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:28,997
Anna.

809
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,500
You never called me back.

810
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,460
Babe, I've been so busy.

811
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:36,796
Rubbish. I want you and me
at the Madonna party, okay?

812
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,798
- Call me back.
- I'll see. I'll see.

813
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,354
Okay.

814
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:46,348
...every time!

815
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,945
Well, as I live and breathe.

816
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:51,311
You made it!

817
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:55,732
Isn't it exquisite?

818
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:57,984
Yes, well,
it's certainly very different.

819
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,947
Uh, what'd you say?

820
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,657
Congratulations.

821
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:07,035
We... so need to catch up.

822
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,870
Let's go find somewhere to talk.

823
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,092
Come on.

824
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:14,543
Now, your first reaction may be
that the office seems cold.

825
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:19,393
But we like to think of Cult
as a little more posh.

826
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,521
Wouldn't you say?

827
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,136
That's some hair.

828
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:26,638
Yeah.

829
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,932
Can you believe it?

830
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,863
I'd have to see it to believe it.

831
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,606
It's...

832
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:39,401
been hard without you, Edna.

833
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,862
You seem to have adjusted pretty well.

834
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,655
I had no choice.

835
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,615
You always have a choice.

836
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:47,004
Not always.

837
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,464
Okay.

838
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:54,261
Edna, what is it?

839
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,253
Grant offered me the world

840
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:02,507
to turn what was for the people,
by the people, into...

841
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,604
this.

842
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,939
I chose to walk away.

843
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:08,471
I almost got evicted.

844
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,307
I had something for you, Anna.

845
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,975
You never returned my phone calls.

846
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,989
I have something here.

847
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:17,480
Finally, after four years.
You want me to start over?

848
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:18,982
I can't afford that.

849
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:21,193
You couldn't afford that hair,
but that didn't stop you.

850
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,290
Mm.

851
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,326
Not with what you paid me.

852
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,509
She's giving me my own show.

853
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,553
More than that.

854
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:42,893
She's making me the centerpiece
of the entire channel.

855
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:47,761
Well, I hope it's worth it.

856
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,532
There's a code.

857
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:02,567
Uh, 1-8-6-6,

858
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,486
9-8.

859
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,031
It's still locked.

860
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,253
Did you press pound?

861
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,372
Like I said, I hope it's worth it.

862
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:16,665
It is.

863
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:21,503
It is.

864
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,933
Yeah, you know I could help you
with whatever you need.

865
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:36,643
Yeah.

866
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,728
Julius!

867
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,951
Mm, mm, mm.

868
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:51,241
Hey.

869
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,369
Oh, my God. Hey.

870
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:56,341
Um, you're...
Germane.

871
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:00,917
I met you at Sandra's spot, right?

872
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:03,962
Yeah, Anna. Anna Bludso, um, with Cult.

873
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,882
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
Have you been back...

874
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,842
there? Virgie's.

875
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,927
Oh. No.

876
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:11,928
Why?

877
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,098
It's just that ever since
she started going there,

878
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,392
Sandra's been acting a little...

879
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,894
Anna.

880
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,270
Anna Bludso.

881
01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:21,950
Mr. Madison?

882
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:23,993
Zora?

883
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,485
- You know what?
It's not a big deal.

884
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,988
No, you should stay and say hi.

885
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,753
Uh, I don't do suits. I, uh...

886
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:35,672
I, I'll see you around.

887
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,631
So, word on the street is
you're our secret weapon.

888
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:49,925
Where did Zora find you?

889
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:52,677
I've worked here for four years.

890
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:57,724
So, Zora shared with me
your plans for Cult Live. Brilliant.

891
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:59,893
Now, be prepared. You're gonna get
a little bit of push back

892
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:02,145
on the host thing. I'm all in.

893
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,647
Yeah? You are?

894
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:06,066
There's no one better to have
as the face of Cult Live.

895
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,817
Wow.

896
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:10,654
- You really mean that?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

897
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,836
Zora back on screen? Slam dunk.

898
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:19,591
Very proud of what the two of you
put together. All right?

899
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,998
Excuse me. Rosalyn?

900
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,292
- Anna...
- Zora.

901
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,306
Sorry, excuse me, Anna. This is, um...

902
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,967
Z, I mean, come on. It's your party.

903
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,552
And you've ruined it.

904
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:34,982
Where the hell were you?

905
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,057
Hey. Come on.
Hey, don't leave...

906
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,363
Eh, Anna... I mean, Zora!

907
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:43,615
Shit.

908
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:00,078
Everything okay?

909
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,011
You smoking again?

910
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,061
So, um, you good?

911
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:18,555
Listen, she's a monster, Anna.

912
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:21,516
She's manipulative, she's possessive,

913
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:25,532
she's insecure...
It must be awful, Julius.

914
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,650
I really fucked things up, huh?

915
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,748
Yeah.

916
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,625
Yeah, I know I did.

917
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,199
Can I tell you something?

918
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:38,378
Fuck!

919
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,494
What?

920
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:44,748
I miss you. Okay? So, so much. And I...

921
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,597
I know it's not fair to you,
and I shouldn't say that, but it's true.

922
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,476
You ever...

923
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,645
...miss me?

924
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,148
I know, I shouldn't ask that.

925
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,651
Right?

926
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:07,324
You drive?

927
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,130
Which one? Red or white, Anna?

928
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,719
Anna?

929
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:32,266
I used to fantasize about
waking up in your bed.

930
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:36,591
And I would go to start
packing my things,

931
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:38,260
and you would grab me.

932
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:41,012
And you would say,

933
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,807
"Where are you going, Anna?

934
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:45,988
This is your home, Anna."

935
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:49,324
That's so stupid, huh?

936
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:55,777
I'm gonna go.

937
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,835
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

938
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,159
Where you going?

939
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:35,454
Pick your weapon.

940
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:37,819
Oh!

941
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,740
That's it?

942
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,366
I've got an early morning.

943
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:44,868
Mm.

944
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,828
I'll be looking like Zorro.

945
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,247
Or I'll be the Phantom of Your
Ass. Come on.

946
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,583
- Did you miss that?
- Yeah. You miss this?

947
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:55,295
Fuck.

948
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,715
- Last time you were inside of me...
- Uh-huh...

949
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,884
Were you thinking about her?

950
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:04,054
- Who?
- Zora. Were you thinking of her?

951
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,680
Huh? Wha...

952
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,641
Oh, Anna.

953
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:09,017
Your eyes.

954
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,894
You never looked so beautiful.

955
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:16,024
And what about the blonde from RMV?

956
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:18,151
Huh? What?
I don't know what you're talking...

957
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,278
From the party. The blonde.

958
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,489
Oh. Where are you going with this?

959
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,710
I want to know...

960
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,953
- I'm the best...
- The best...

961
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,874
Yeah, you never
could resist a little bit of rope, huh?

962
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,543
- Guess not.
- Fucking ride that dick.

963
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,628
Ride that shit hard...
I'm the best?

964
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,964
- Fuckin' best, baby.
- Best you ever had?

965
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,174
Best I fucking had!

966
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,555
Then why did you leave?

967
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:49,808
- Could... Could you chill out, baby?
It's a little sensitive down there.

968
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,393
I can relate.

969
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:56,606
Aah! Aah!

970
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,588
I did what the box told me.

971
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,604
- Hello?
- Hey, Linda?

972
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:07,844
Hey, it's Anna.

973
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:10,400
Uh, you know that book? Unc's book?

974
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:14,267
I never finished the moss girl story.
Could you read it to me?

975
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,519
Right now?

976
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:17,562
Just from the part
where she gets the wig.

977
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:20,440
You know,
it helps me fall asleep.

978
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:23,610
That's... not weird at all.

979
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:27,239
So, slave girl... Moss...
Blah, blah, blah. All right...

980
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,032
"She made herself a wig.

981
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:32,494
"She sees herself in the mirror
and she thinks she looks good.

982
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:36,665
"Almost like someone else
was staring back at her. Someone was.

983
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:40,252
"She came across a slave crying
on account of massa's whip,

984
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:44,506
"and looked down and see her wig
start drinking the blood from his wound.

985
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:47,217
"'What kind of moss is this?' she say.

986
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:50,428
"But with his dying breath,
he tell her, 'That ain't moss.

987
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,390
"'That's the hair of witches
from the before time.

988
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:57,602
"'They need blood to grow strong enough
to take over a person's body.

989
01:09:57,614 --> 01:10:00,117
"'Then, they can come back to the world.'

990
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,774
"She ain't want to believe him,

991
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:05,443
"but then she feel her hair
wrap around her neck,

992
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:07,028
"and strangle her.

993
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,865
"Even now, if you still see her
walking around them woods,

994
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,659
"remember, it's only her body.

995
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,090
The witches take turns in her head."

996
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:44,703
Welcome, honey.

997
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,320
Thank you for taking me last minute.

998
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:49,946
All good.

999
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,793
I had an opening, like I said.

1000
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,035
This gon' take a while
to get all this out.

1001
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:57,662
...first of all, okay,
'cause I know who my daddy is.

1002
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:58,955
Couple hours.

1003
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,499
- Okay.
- Okay.

1004
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:03,835
All right, Coral.

1005
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:06,642
Miss Thing better be ready,
'cause I don't have all night.

1006
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,436
Well...

1007
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:13,232
I didn't know you went here, Edna.

1008
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:19,392
Crowned is Black Hollywood's
secret weapon.

1009
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,186
'Course, you'd know that if

1010
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:23,867
you didn't have a thing
about people being in your hair.

1011
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,733
If that were ever true.

1012
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:29,611
- She's fucking killing me.
- Aisha will be out in a minute.

1013
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:32,572
- No, I do. I have to go.
I told you that.

1014
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,908
It's kind of funny seeing you here.

1015
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,285
Damn, this is in here tight.

1016
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,496
- Ow!
- Okay, hey, hey.

1017
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:41,122
Don't go there with that.

1018
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:44,471
I'm sorry. It hurts so bad.

1019
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:47,712
- I fucked up.
- Jesus, Anna.

1020
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,184
It's just hair.

1021
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:53,313
Edna, I'm so sorry.

1022
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,900
You were my friend and my mentor.

1023
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,737
I just got caught up. I got...

1024
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:02,936
really caught up.

1025
01:12:02,948 --> 01:12:04,408
I'm still caught up.

1026
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,619
Ow.

1027
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:11,665
You know I talk a lot of shit.

1028
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,989
But the truth is,

1029
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,951
I can't fault you for doing
whatever it takes

1030
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:20,674
to get where they keep trying
to keep us from getting.

1031
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,707
And fuck you. The hair looks good.

1032
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,459
That's probably why I'm so mad.

1033
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,920
You know, in a perfect world,

1034
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:32,257
a woman would be able to wear her hair
the fuck the way she wants to.

1035
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,146
Yeah. Yeah.

1036
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,430
Well, if she wants another weave,
I ain't the one.

1037
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,351
Can you put it up in a bun, please?

1038
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,603
What's that, darlin'?

1039
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:48,106
Uh, just put it up as tight as you can.

1040
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:50,996
Uh, I don't want to yank it.
I'm tender headed.

1041
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:54,571
Girl, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:58,867
Y'all, this surfer nigga from Venice
got me so twisted. Mm.

1043
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,995
I don't know. You got a surfer
colonizing your lands?

1044
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:03,133
Oh, Lord.

1045
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:05,469
- Be right back.
- Jesus.

1046
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:17,385
Anna...

1047
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:20,889
Oh, shit!

1048
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:26,019
Aah!

1049
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:52,212
Oh! Aah!

1050
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:53,642
No!

1051
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:06,268
It's Zora.
Can't come to the phone right now,

1052
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,686
so please leave a message.

1053
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:10,021
Truth be told,
I'm probably still at the office.

1054
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:49,489
Oh, Sheryl!

1055
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:55,204
Zora?

1056
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,666
Anna.

1057
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,045
Something bad has happened.

1058
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,453
Oh, I'm aware.

1059
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:08,175
It's happening to you, too.

1060
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,679
What do you mean?

1061
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,015
How many lives has it taken?

1062
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:18,423
It's so strange.

1063
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,383
One moment you think
you recognize yourself,

1064
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:23,982
and then the next
there's this rush of hunger.

1065
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:28,308
Sheryl came in. All kind of job demands.

1066
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,896
Spelling out all of her strengths.
If only timing was one of them.

1067
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:35,315
This is happening to other people?

1068
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,526
Let me check with my killer weave
support group

1069
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:39,027
and find out their sentiments.

1070
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:41,822
I don't fucking know
what's happening with everyone else!

1071
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,490
Now, who else have you told about this?

1072
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,158
- No one!
- Of course not!

1073
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,660
No one would fuckin' believe it!

1074
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:48,787
That rush of hunger.

1075
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:51,081
How often do you get it?

1076
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:55,138
- At first, it was like, once in a while.
Then it started to be constant.

1077
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:58,964
And some days it doesn't stop.

1078
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,758
Do you get the dreams, too?

1079
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,760
Oh, my God.

1080
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:06,555
It's... It's trying to get in here.

1081
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:09,319
It wants to take over us.

1082
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:15,105
Fuck it. It's just hair.

1083
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:17,440
Just... It's just hair.

1084
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,932
- It won't let you! It won't let you!
- It's fucking just hair!

1085
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,210
Aah! Aah!

1086
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:01,914
Unc?

1087
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:07,211
Anna.

1088
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:14,456
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep. What's your excuse?

1089
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:16,720
And how often do you come by in the...

1090
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,097
...dead of night?

1091
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,714
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

1092
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:25,467
Uh, the, um...

1093
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:27,260
uh, moss haired girl.

1094
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:29,262
Anything hair-related, really.

1095
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:32,891
Yeah, so, this one has a few
hair stories in it.

1096
01:17:32,903 --> 01:17:35,227
It's mostly from American Indian tribes.

1097
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:40,106
There are some tribes who believe that
a person's hair holds all their thoughts,

1098
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:41,942
even after death.

1099
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:44,778
The idea being that
one must have pure intentions,

1100
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,781
so that enemies can't use
the hair they leave behind

1101
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:49,074
for evil spells.

1102
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:52,828
"First, there was only the
wild beasts and the red man."

1103
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,747
Do you think the moss tree story
could somehow be related?

1104
01:17:55,759 --> 01:18:00,502
Like, uh, maybe the hair in the tree
was enchanted, or...

1105
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:01,514
I don't know.

1106
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:03,797
It's fun to think about.

1107
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,967
But didn't you say that
the native tribes of this land

1108
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:09,803
and the ones brought here were wise
about things we've forgotten?

1109
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,305
Things we consider... magic?

1110
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:15,350
Sure. But the minute you start
supposing and what if-ing,

1111
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:18,728
and now you've, you've, you've
stereotyped a whole group of people.

1112
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,023
If there's something that
they were trying to warn us about,

1113
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:24,401
or even, if there's something real, then...

1114
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:25,873
We'd never know.

1115
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:31,378
Conquerors don't write much
about the people they conquer.

1116
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,297
What is this about?

1117
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:38,218
I'm doing a segment. Um...

1118
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,334
...inspired by you.

1119
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:44,224
A little hair history thing.

1120
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,061
That's very sweet.

1121
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:53,066
Um, time to put this old man to bed.
Past my bedtime, so...

1122
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:56,308
Always good to see you, honey.

1123
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,059
- You, too.
- Mm.

1124
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:03,076
You look...

1125
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,120
...beautiful.

1126
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:13,366
Hey, it's Anna.

1127
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:15,368
Leave a message.

1128
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,245
Anna, it's Rosalyn.

1129
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:18,747
It's almost noon. Where are you?

1130
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:31,897
Ooh. Not today, Satan. Not today.

1131
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:49,957
Anna! Oh, thank God.

1132
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:53,406
No one's been able to reach Zora.
Have you heard from her?

1133
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:57,005
No.

1134
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,497
Anna.

1135
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,415
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1136
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:05,418
No, I know. It's been so crazy.

1137
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,431
Anna...

1138
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,101
We need a host.

1139
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,509
You sure about the belt?

1140
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,357
It's pristine. Nice heels.

1141
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:18,110
- Thank you.
- It's time.

1142
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,944
What's up, America?

1143
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:33,947
I'm Anna Bludso, your host for today.

1144
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,658
Now, if you've been watching
the promos,

1145
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,244
I know you were expecting
someone a little taller,

1146
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:41,246
a little more model-esque, but...

1147
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:42,914
Psych! You got me!

1148
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:46,001
Okay, all right, all right.

1149
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:49,546
Welcome to Cult Live!

1150
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:02,142
All the fans out here are going crazy.

1151
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:04,686
You know why? 'Cause they want to know
who's got the number one spot.

1152
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:08,440
Okay. Well, we're down to our top two.

1153
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:11,109
- Who got it?
- What haven't we seen yet?

1154
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:13,320
Well, you know, we ain't seen
"Break U" by The Fellas yet.

1155
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:15,739
And you know I mess with The Fellas.
Sometimes.

1156
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:21,161
Okay. Our number two video is...

1157
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:26,500
Which means our number one video...

1158
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,419
Wait, wait, wait!
Now, everyone at Cult knows

1159
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:33,924
Anna is Sandra's biggest fan
in the whole world.

1160
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:38,011
So, we thought we'd do something
special...

1161
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,234
All right, sis. Do you mind?

1162
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:44,196
And the number one video is...

1163
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,103
Sorry Fellas...

1164
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:49,105
"I Get It," by me!

1165
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:03,674
And... commercial.

1166
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:16,019
Goodnight. See you all tomorrow.

1167
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,108
Zora.

1168
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,568
Anna.

1169
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,874
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

1170
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,865
Wow. You were...

1171
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:42,951
- great.
- Ros, did you see Zora?

1172
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:45,954
No, Anna. She's totally M. I. A.

1173
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:48,039
I saw her looking out of that window.

1174
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:51,376
I've been organizing her office
for hours. She's not here.

1175
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,420
Ros, I saw her.

1176
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:55,046
Anna...

1177
01:22:55,058 --> 01:22:56,256
there's something...

1178
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:10,979
Ros?

1179
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,460
Ro...

1180
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:19,912
What's the code?

1181
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:20,627
Help me!

1182
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,933
Somebody help me! No!

1183
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:44,985
Fuck!

1184
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:06,131
Oh, shit! What the fuck!

1185
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,549
Come on, man. I ain't one of them!

1186
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:09,009
- You're not?
- No!

1187
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,427
What were you doing upstairs?

1188
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:11,928
I thought motherfuckers
was going up there to celebrate,

1189
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,013
so shit, I went, too.

1190
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,432
Shit, I was trying to blend in with these
zombie bitches to keep 'em at bay.

1191
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:17,225
Brook, you gotta take this out.

1192
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:19,519
I don't know the last time
you went to Virgie's...

1193
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,771
- Virgie's?
Bitch, I ain't got $500 to give her!

1194
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:24,024
Especially when La'Neka
hook a sister up for $250!

1195
01:27:24,036 --> 01:27:25,942
Look, I cannot die today, okay?

1196
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:27,360
I haven't been to church
in like, 15 years.

1197
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,654
Aah!

1198
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,490
Aah!

1199
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:32,325
Anna!

1200
01:27:32,337 --> 01:27:33,897
Shit.

1201
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:47,559
Aah!
This bitch is trying to kill me!

1202
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:55,609
Anna, cut this bitch!

1203
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:58,076
Bitch, what is you doin'?

1204
01:28:58,088 --> 01:28:59,536
I done seen all the Jason movies.

1205
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:01,163
You ain't gotta check to see
if she's dead!

1206
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:02,342
Come on!

1207
01:29:07,556 --> 01:29:09,379
I should have died back there.

1208
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,881
But I'll tell you what.

1209
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:15,468
That crazy hoe had them blue eyes
directed on you. Okay?

1210
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,840
Come on, come on, come on, come on...

1211
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,184
Uh, h... Hey. Hey, hey, girl.

1212
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:23,476
Hey.

1213
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:24,853
Did you forget your coat?

1214
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:13,287
Shit.

1215
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,042
Shit.

1216
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:42,901
Please, please, please.
Please, God. Please, somebody.

1217
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:45,237
What the fuck?

1218
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:53,912
Okay, okay, okay.

1219
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:22,227
"Porcine albumin."

1220
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:33,363
Pig's blood?

1221
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,744
This is a fucking appetizer.

1222
01:33:41,748 --> 01:33:44,696
Oh, love your hair! Super cute.

1223
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:46,323
Thanks. It's a little tight,

1224
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:49,993
but hopefully my boyfriend
fucks it loose tonight.

1225
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:51,548
I'm just kidding. I need it to last.

1226
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:57,125
Okay, here's the last of it.

1227
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,836
At least for me, it is.
Girl, I can't carry no more of your stuff.

1228
01:33:59,848 --> 01:34:01,671
What'd you pack in there? Bricks?

1229
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:04,508
Oh, and before I forget to tell you,

1230
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,511
I'm gonna be late for dinner tonight.
I'm doing something super top secret.

1231
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:09,733
Can't tell you. Okay, fine.
Don't pull my leg...

1232
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:28,657
"Even now, if you see the moss haired girl

1233
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:30,575
"walking around in them woods,

1234
01:34:30,587 --> 01:34:32,869
"remember, it's only her body.

1235
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,843
The witches take turns in her head."

1236
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:03,108
"As for massa,

1237
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,527
"he was survived by two boys

1238
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:09,114
"who would take over the land
and all that grew upon it,"

1239
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:12,796
"including the hair that seemed like
moss on the trees."

1240
01:35:15,132 --> 01:35:16,997
"The way they saw it,

1241
01:35:17,009 --> 01:35:18,915
"as long as their name
was on the land,"

1242
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:21,930
"they could do as they pleased
with anything that grew from it..."

1243
01:35:25,017 --> 01:35:26,810
"Whether it was plants..."

1244
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:28,937
"Or people."

1245
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:35,015
"If it grew on the land,
their daddy claimed..."

1246
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:39,114
"They owned it."

1247
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:43,035
"And it owned them."

1248
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,373
Anna.

1249
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:51,198
Um, what'd you say?

1250
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,782
I said I may be late for dinner.

1251
01:35:52,794 --> 01:35:54,242
I finally got in at Virgie's!

1252
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:57,204
Girl, I am so over this
Creamy Crack relaxer!

1253
01:35:57,216 --> 01:35:59,706
Just put someone else's hair
on my head and call it a day!

1254
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:00,874
Linda!

1255
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:02,429
Linda!
