00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,186
Jasper!

6
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,822
That was five bullets.

[cocks gun]

8
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,393
You better make
the next one count.

[gunshot]

10
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,202
Son of a bitch.

11
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,911
Son of a bitch.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I got you pinned, boy.

13
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,794
Come on out.

14
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,098
[laughs]

15
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,801
That was your sixth bullet, son.

16
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,838
You're done, boy.

17
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,871
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,283
There was only two ways
this was gonna end,

19
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,452
and you choose the wrong way.

20
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,154
Now, turn over...

21
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,891
so I don't have to shoot you
in the back twice.

22
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,647
Who'd you cross, hmm?

23
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,626
[groaning]

24
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,319

Can I speak to
the man of the house?

53
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,335
Why don't you put your hands
where I can see 'em?

54
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,107
Both hands!

55
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,545
Uh, I would if I could, ma'am.

56
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,049
You get shot?

57
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,686
Ma'am, I'm a U.S. Marshal.

58
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,956
I'm asking you for assistance.

59
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,915
[groans]

60
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,488

would get shot in the back.

64
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,546
You can sleep in the yard

65
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,914
till you're well enough
to git along.

66
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,687
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,510
I ain't gonna try
anything funny, ma'am.

68
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,480
Who did that to your shoulder?

69
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,451
Are they still alive?

70
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,956
Can I trouble you
for a cup of coffee, ma'am?

71
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,931
Thank you, ma'am.

72
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,569
What are you even doing way out
here without a horse or nothin'?

73
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,539
- Ma'am...
- You can tell me or get out.

74
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:59,610
I have a right to know
who sleeps on my property.

75
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:18,261
I was taking a prisoner down
from Tanner City to Morlansburg.

76
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,067
He was a leader of a band of
outlaws out near Chapton ways.

77
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:29,172
He just got the drop on me
real good.

78
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,975
Scared my horse away.

79
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,844
Stole a pistol.

80
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,484
Shot me in the back.
I had to kill him.

81
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,492
Shame I had to leave his body
there though.

82
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,962
Man's got $5,000 on his head
and...

83
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,197
now he's just rotting
in the middle of the desert.

84
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,500
Five thousand dollars.

85
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,002
That's a lot of money.

86
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:05,075
That must be a real bad man
to have that much put on him.

87
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,245
Nah.

88
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:14,317
Just means he stole a lot of
money from the wrong person.

89
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,752
[door opens]

90
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,591
What can I get ya?

91
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,259
A horse and a rifle.

92
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,592
Sorry to be
an inconvenience, ma'am.

93
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,896
Should be out of here tomorrow.

94
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,430
Know where you're headed?

95
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,966
I was hoping you could
point me in the direction

96
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,935
of the nearest town,
if you wouldn't mind.

97
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,403
Just keep heading that way.

98
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,939
You'll hit Carsonville
in two or three days.

99
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,841
Is that where your husband's at?

100
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,108
Mm-hmm.

101
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,679
Well...

102
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,151
I can stay till your husband
gets back, if you like.

103
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,720
You should go
as soon as you're able.

104
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,359
Thank you, ma'am.

105
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:32,095
Mm-hmm. Dinner's at dusk.

106
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,950
Hola, compadre.

107
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,319
Could you help me with a drink
of water, maybe some food?

108
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,255
Tengo hambre.

109
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,261
No.

00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,897
[cocks gun]

111
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,832
I'm not really asking.

112
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,039
May I?

113
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,914
Que Bonita pistola.

114
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,183
I'm gonna need that too.

115
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,887
You should move along.

116
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,057
Tell that to my friends.

117
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,198
Que lastima.

118
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:29,039

121
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,539
Survival is restraint.

[blows]

123
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,566
I'm... I'm sorry, ma'am.

124
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:09,039
My name's Annabell,
and I'd like it if you used it.

125
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,517
Don't be so shy, Marshal.

126
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,864
I'll see you inside for coffee
in a minute.

127
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,603
Thank you, ma'am.

128
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,340
[door opens]

129
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,515
Good morning, Mr. Jefferies.

130
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,120
Your wife has been very
hospitable to me this morning.

131
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,225
I didn't see you when I rode in.

132
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,037
How was my oatmeal?

133
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,373
Excuse me?

134
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,212
You my cousin?

135
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,617
No, sir, I am not.

136
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,086
Hmm.

137
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,755
So we aren't related.

138
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,426
I just can't understand
why the hell you're in my house,

139
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,362
at my table, in my chair,
eating my oatmeal.

140
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,774
Thank you, ma'am.

141
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,342
It was delicious.

142
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:12,982
So what kinda badge is that?

143
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,684
Special Detective.

144
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,851
Well.

145
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,591
What is it exactly you,
uh, specially detect?

146
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,759
How did you hurt your arm,
Mr. Jefferies?

147
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,763
He, uh, fell
while he was working.

148
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,723
And the lacerations
on your wrist?

149
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,171
That's an awful big word,
partner.

150
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,772
How did you hurt your wrist?

151
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,874
I know what it means.

152
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,582
On my last drive,
a steer bolted,

153
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,051
dragged me clean off my horse.

154
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,821
Messed me up real good.

155
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,789
It's part of the job.

156
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,794
Well, I do hope
you recover soon.

157
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,296
Thank you.

158
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:08,171
Ma'am, do you mind if I ask you
a few questions before I go?

159
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,175
Like...

160
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,377
Like what?

161
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,748
[taps chair]

162
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,664
Have you seen any men
pass through here recently?

163
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,300
Talkin' 'bout the man who came
by yesterday and stole my horse?

164
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,202
What are you gonna
do about that, lawman?

165
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,804
Gonna help me get
my stolen property back?

166
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,507
I'd be much obliged.

167
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,579
Ma'am...

168
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,917
what did this man look like?

169
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,022
I don't know.
Pretty normal, I guess.

170
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,458
Average.

171
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,195
Yeah, I didn't really
get a good look at him.

172
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,533
What exactly did he do?

173
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:14,837
Stole a lot of money
that didn't belong to him.

174
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,872
That's all?

175
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,444
He's also killed just about
everyone who got in his way,

176
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,213
but that's not my concern.

177
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,856
So you're just trying
to get that money back then.

178
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,028
How much did they
get away with anyway?

179
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:42,498
Now, that's privileged
information, Mr. Jeffries.

180
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,436
Sent you out here.

181
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,004
Must've been enough to share.

182
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,679
That and a noose.

183
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:02,552
Rest assured,
the outlaws will hang.

184
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,725
Was he wounded
when he came through?

You killed all the boys
in cold blood, Kane.

369
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,162
Special place in hell
for people like that.

370
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,597
Yeah, I'll see you there,
friend.

371

01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,312
Jasper!

377
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,361
I get you?

378
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,269
All right, Jasper,
come on out now!

379
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,550
All I want is that gold now.

380
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:32,420
And your horse.
I'm gonna take that too.

381
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,755
And I'll be on my way.

382
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,930
Look, I'm sorry about the boys.

383
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,598
If it makes you feel any better,

384
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,569
they was gonna just gonna divvy
it up and cut you out anyway.

385
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:56,511
Aw, hell.

386
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,715
Welcome, stranger!

387
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,017
Why don't you set by my fire
a minute?

388
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,187
I'll just be right there.

389
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,988
Take your time, sir.

390
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,824
You look pretty tough-lookin'.

391
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,259
I bet you got a badge on.

392
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,462
U.S. Marshal.
Just passin' through.

393
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,264
Can I buy some dinner from ya?

394
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,066
Shoot, I'll just give ya dinner.

395
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:35,236
Ain't takin' no more for free
in this lifetime, sir.

396
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:45,179
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

397
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:46,547
I know there's gold.

398
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,449
I know there's gold
right down there,

399
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,984
and I've been dreaming about it.

400
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,153
Been been dreaming about it
for a couple of weeks,

401
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:55,356
but I ain't found any.

402
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:58,626
And then you show up.
[laughs]

403
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,695
Sure this here's gold country?

404
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,296
[laughs]

405
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,132
Lookee here!
What do you think?

406
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,102
The Lord moves
in mysterious ways,

407
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,338
but He is never wrong.

408
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,777
What's a decent man
like yourself

409
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,012
doing out here looking for gold?

410
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,748
Well, you know, son,

411
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:24,051
a man's gotta do somethin'
important in his life.

412
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,220
You know that.

413
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,456
I figure the more gold we find,

414
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,425
then the more gold people
will have gold,

415
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:36,130
then, well, finally nobody
will be short of coin.

416
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,366
Understand what I mean?

417
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,800
So you're helping.

418
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,802
Well, ain't you helping?
You're a marshal.

419
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:47,841
You keep this free country safe
for us to roam about unafraid.

420
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,145
And I wanna tell ya
I respect the job that you do.

421
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:54,882
I do respect the job
that you do.

422
01:10:54,950 --> 01:11:00,888
You know, I think maybe we're
a little bit alike, you and me.

423
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,690
I doubt it.

424
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,359
We're both moving this land
into the future.

425
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,829
It's a big country.

426
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:13,634
Lot of room,
but people are crowding in.

427
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:18,205
It's gonna be your job
to keep us safe.

428
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,041
Think you can do that, son?

429
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,946
Thanks for the food.
My name's Jasper.

430
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,948
Jasper. I'm Abner.

431
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:31,285

439
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,068

440
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:58,939

[shouting]

444
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,726
Jasper Mudd,
you are under arrest

445
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,162
for the robbery
of a Carsonville Bank car,

446
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:18,365
the murder of U.S. Marshal
Denton J. Cartwright,

447
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:21,568
and his unlawful impersonation.

448
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,503
[grunts]

449
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,406
You gonna kill me or not?

450
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,809
I'd rather see you hang.

451
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,450
Listen!

452
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,418
Hey, listen to me!

453
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,822
You don't gotta kill me.

454
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,327
Listen!

455
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:23,396
You just need the gold
that's in my saddlebags.

456
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,698
It's real close.

457
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,534
Real close by.

458
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,036
You just grab it and go.

459
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:30,670
Nobody's gonna know
the difference.

460
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:33,841
No, no, no, no, Mr. Mudd!

461
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,012
You must pay for your crimes.

462
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:42,883
And you will hang by the noose
until dead.

463
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,988
That's not your job.

464
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,959
That's not your job.

465
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,428
I know.

466
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:01,468
No.

467
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:42,843
We wouldn't anybody
to cut you down.

468
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:59,359
Now, what was that song
you sang to me?

469
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,795
Something about a, um...

470
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:04,865
a worried man.

471
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,535
Tell me.

472
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,603
Are you worried now?

473
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:16,310
Best say your prayers now,
Jasper,

474
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,179
if you're gonna say them at all.

475
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:30,924
What?

476
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:35,595
Hmm?

477
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,565
I oughta kill you...

478
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,168
with my bare hands.

479
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,372
Empty threats.
