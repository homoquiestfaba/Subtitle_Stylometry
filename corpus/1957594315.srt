00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:04,640
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:16,897
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:19,564
(pod exploding)

4
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:23,652
- My name is Josh Kirby.

5
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,975
I was just your average ninth grader.

6
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:29,241
My biggest problem (chuckles)
was getting good grades,

7
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,731
and my idea of excitement
was racing my bicycle.

8
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,489
(bell ringing)

9
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,538
Yes!

10
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,764
I never thought time
would catch up with me,

11
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:39,514
but I couldn't have imagined

12
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:40,347
(train horn blaring)

13
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:42,534
that hundreds of years from now mankind

14
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,955
would invent the Nullifier,

15
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:49,331
a device capable of controlling
or destroying the universe.

16
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,211
- - [Irwin 1138] Prepare for the storm.

17
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,258
- [Josh] A scientist
named Irwin 1138 tried to

18
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,818
disassemble and hide the Nullifier,

19
00:00:56,818 --> 00:00:58,086
but even he couldn't stop...

20
00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,777
- [Irwin 1138] Dr. Zoetrope.

21
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:03,437
(lasers blasting)

22
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:04,501
- [Dr. Zoetrope] Give me the Nullifier.

23
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,392
- [Irwin 1138] You're too late, Zoetrope.

24
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,412
- [Dr. Zoetrope] It's
never too late for me.

25
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:11,081
- Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing

26
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,102
each other across the time stream,

27
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:16,107
trying to be the first to
find the Nullifier's pieces.

28
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:19,208
This time they're gonna land in 1995.

29
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,291
The place, my front yard.

30
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,098
Now I'm going along for
the ride of all time.

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,095
What's going on?

32
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,337
Where are we?

33
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,725
- [Irwin 1138] I hope you
prepared to do battle, young man.

34
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,444
This will be a war through time

35
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:38,498
and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners.

36
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,637
(pod exploding)

37
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:44,527
- [Josh] We've got help from a warrior.

38
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:46,701
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

39
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,459
- Oh, she's amazing.

40
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,615
- [Josh] And a magical
creature called Prism

41
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,489
to show us the way.

42
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,387
Together we're on a quest through time,

43
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,227
visiting different worlds to fight for

44
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,974
the Nullifier's pieces.

45
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,328
- [Dr. Zoetrope] I'm
obviously in the right place

46
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:03,756
and the right time.

47
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,045
- Because of Zoetrope ever assembles

48
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:08,462
the Nullifier, he'll conquer time itself.

49
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,679
I've gotta try and save the universe.

50
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:15,679
(triumphant instrumental music)

51
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:56,475
I was just a 14-year-old kid
before my adventure began,

52
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:59,558
but now I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

53
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,016
(uplifting instrumental music)

54
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:20,568
(dramatic music)

55
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:01,530
(electronic beeping)

56
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:05,190
(humming)

57
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:54,329
- [Irwin 1138] Prepare for the storm.

58
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:00,055
(dramatic music)

59
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,033
(electronic beeping)

60
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:14,633
(dramatic music)

61
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:25,002
(pulsing throb)

62
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:34,716
Next.

63
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,977
(electronic beeping)

64
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,551
(pulsing throb)

65
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,585
Next.

66
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:24,774
(electronic beeping)

67
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:27,441
(pulsing throb)

68
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,032
Next.

69
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:34,699
(pulsing throb)

70
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:40,663
(dramatic music)

71
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,724
(electronic beeping)

72
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:59,617
(pulsing throb)

73
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,867
We need another 93 seconds.

74
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:04,351
Seal the door.

75
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:10,548
(electronic beeping)

76
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:15,105
(pulsing throb)

77
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:22,163
Quick, load the final component.

78
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:24,410
- [Man] Let's go.

79
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,160
(door crackling)

80
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:29,920
(door banging)

81
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,753
- [Man] He's through!

82
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:31,586
Back there!

83
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,419
Let's go!

84
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,639
- [Irwin 1138] Dr. Zoetrope.

85
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,049
- [Man] It's him! Run!

86
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,882
(lasers blasting)

87
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,916
- [Man] Get out of there!

88
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,749
- Ah, uh!

89
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,171
- [Man] We can't hold him off!

90
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,120
- [Man] Come on, we gotta get out of here!

91
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,953
This way!

92
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:09,667
There he is!

93
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,426
- [Dr. Zoetrope] Give me
the Nullifier component.

94
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,855
- [Irwin 1138] You're too late, Zoetrope.

95
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,406
- [Dr. Zoetrope] It's
never too late for me.

96
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,457
(lasers blasting)

97
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,624
- [Irwin 1138] Oh! Ah! Oh!

98
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:28,119
(electronic beeping)

99
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,376
- In the name of all of creation,

100
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:42,376
twisted old man, what have you done?

101
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:47,973
(dramatic music)

102
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,887
(clock buzzing)

103
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:00,962
- Mmm.

104
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:04,890
- [Dad] Movin' out, Josh.

105
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,057
Breakfast is almost ready.

106
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:11,165
(birds chirping)

107
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:28,411
(soft instrumental music)

108
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:51,026
- Morning, Dad.

109
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:51,989
- Morning.

110
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:52,822
- Morning, Genghis.

111
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:57,336
Conquered a new kingdom
while I was sleepin'?

112
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,169
- Brain food, son.

113
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,531
Drink up.

114
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,396
- Dad, the calcium in milk's
good for teeth and bones,

115
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,694
not brains.

116
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:03,611
- [Dad] Eh.

117
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,769
How's the new watch holding up?

118
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:07,893
- Guess.

119
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,984
- Another one bites the dust, huh?

120
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:10,958
- Yup.

121
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,705
- What is it with you and watches, Josh?

122
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:14,538
- I don't know.

123
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,316
The school nurse said I
had some screwy metabolism

124
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,004
or something.

125
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,207
My stopwatch still works, though.

126
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:22,300
- Talk to that guidance counselor yet?

127
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,979
- Dad, I'm already taking two
advanced placement classes.

128
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,235
My head's gonna explode.

129
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,933
Yeah, I talked to the counselor.

130
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,691
That's what I was studying for last night.

131
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,525
The advanced placement chemistry test.

132
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,966
I'm supposed to take that today.

133
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,090
- Don't just take it, Josh.

134
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,782
- I know, I know, don't just take it.

135
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:37,615
Ace it.

136
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:42,253
- Your mother would've been proud of ya.

137
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,868
The two of you would've
gotten along great.

138
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,034
She was one smart lady.

139
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,264
That's where you get your
brains from, you know.

140
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:51,398
- She was cute, too, right?

141
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,731
- Not just cute.

142
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:54,704
Beautiful.

143
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,549
- See ya later, Genghis.

144
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,716
(light playful music)

145
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,139
- Josh, be careful.

146
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,875
And ace that test.

147
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,458
- No problemo, Dad.

148
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:20,923
(light playful music)

149
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,518
Yeah, ha ha!

150
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,612
Rur, rur, yeah.

151
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:41,538
Yeah!

152
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:44,564
Woo-hoo!

153
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:48,731
(upbeat pop music)

154
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,066
Woo! Yeah!

155
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,732
(upbeat pop music)

156
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,545
Woo, woah, sorry.

157
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,316
Woah, oh!

158
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:28,288
Woah!

159
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,584
(laughing)

160
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,937
(bell ringing)

161
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:45,770
And woah!

162
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:50,637
Yes!

163
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,091
Josh Kirby sets a new world record.

164
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,162
Ah!

165
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:58,356
- Aztecs were the dominant
civilization of Mexico

166
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:02,439
when Hernando Cortes
invaded that country in 1519

167
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:08,952
under the auspices of the Spanish Empire.

168
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,867
Yes, Joshua.

169
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,342
- Ms. Mandelbaum, are
we almost to the part

170
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:17,131
where the Aztec priests
rip out human hearts

171
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:19,826
with their bare hands and eat 'em?

172
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,000
(kids talking over each other)

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,750
- Mr. Kirby, this is a
G-rated history class.

174
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:32,105
We will not be studying
anything that is not rated G.

175
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,216
- But Mrs. Mandelbaum,
isn't history kind of

176
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,555
made up of all ratings?

177
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,222
From G to PG to PG-13 to even R?

178
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,508
(laughing)

179
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,336
(bell ringing)

180
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,541
(kids conversing in background)

181
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:56,660
- Yo, Josh man, Kirby man.

182
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,540
That was incredible.

183
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,384
What an amazing concept.

184
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,846
R-rated history.

185
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,940
Imagine ancient Rome babes
dancing around in togas

186
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,960
with grapes, man.

187
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,730
With grapes!

188
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,376
- I think Beth Sullivan thinks I'm weird.

189
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:11,191
- Josh man, Kirby man,
to all that cutting edge

190
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:12,686
people here at Green Oaks High,

191
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:14,727
you're a guy of major import.

192
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:18,721
But Beth Sullivan, cheerleader,
Miss Teen USA semi-finalist,

193
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,518
and most popular girl in school.

194
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:24,382
Beth Sullivan definitely
does not know you exist.

195
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,316
- Thanks a lot, Irwin.

196
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:26,149
- Don't mention it.

197
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:27,408
I'm always here for ya.

198
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:28,590
- Hey, Josh.

199
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,840
How's it goin'?

200
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:32,532
- It would go a lot
better if I could breathe.

201
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,104
- Well, what's the status
of my homework, pal?

202
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,213
- Um.

203
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,388
- You didn't forget about my homework.

204
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,471
Did you, pal?

205
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:44,176
'Cause my homework is
very, very important to me.

206
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,187
- Well, actually, Duke,
I've been thinking about

207
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:50,125
your homework a lot lately.

208
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,455
- You hear that?

209
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,117
He's been thinking.

210
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:55,779
Now that's what I like to hear.

211
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,537
I love this guy.

212
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,370
Mwah.

213
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,509
- And after much thought,

214
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,931
I came to the conclusion
that it's pointless

215
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,740
for me to do your homework,

216
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,221
'cause the whole point
of doing your homework

217
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,387
is so you can learn.

218
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:12,639
And how can you learn if I'm
doin' all your homework for ya?

219
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,078
- Oh, I'll learn, Kirby.

220
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,002
I'll learn how to kick your butt.

221
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:17,585
You do my homework.

222
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,722
- Duke, what are you doing?

223
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,324
Why are you picking on this guy?

224
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:24,241
He's weird.

225
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,485
- Ah, babe.

226
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,951
You got me all wrong.

227
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:32,061
Ah, my pal Josh and me are
just workin' out some business.

228
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,894
Ain't that right, pal?

229
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,079
Sure, that's right.

230
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,050
Just go along with the guys, honey.

231
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
I'll see you in the gym.

232
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,236
The homework, Kirby.

233
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,741
- Don't worry, man.

234
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,074
I got your back.

235
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,268
(bell ringing)

236
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:10,435
(light playful music)

237
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,407
(dog whining)

238
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,240
- Genghis?

239
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,273
Hey, Genghis.

240
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,714
What's wrong, Genghis?

241
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:54,547
Huh?

242
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:58,483
(electric buzzing)

243
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:02,617
Holy moly!

244
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,032
(zapping)

245
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:12,225
(electronic beeping)

246
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,603
- X marks the spot.

247
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:29,280
(footsteps thumping)

248
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,076
(electronic beeping)

249
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:42,731
(knocking)

250
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,528
- Nobody's home.

251
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:47,681
(electronic beeping)

252
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,858
(knocking)

253
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,255
All right, all right, I'm coming.

254
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,672
Don't have a fit.

255
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,163
Ah!

256
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,672
Woah, Josh man.

257
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,813
You almost gave me a heart attack.

258
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,808
What the heck are you wearing?

259
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,236
- It's my dad's spare
industrial gear from the plant.

260
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:10,050
I'm a little worried about contamination.

261
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,174
- From me?

262
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,007
- No.

263
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:14,875
From this.

264
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:16,626
- Cool!

265
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:21,889
I give up.

266
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:22,969
There's nothing in any of this stuff

267
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:27,136
that remotely resembles that
crazy thing-a-ma-jig you found.

268
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,954
- You know, it must be pretty cool to have

269
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,426
a dad who's a physicist.

270
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,541
- My dad's a wuss.

271
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,708
But it does come in handy when
it comes to science projects.

272
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,874
Maybe your dog dug it up.

273
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:43,734
Maybe it's some kind of
bizarre bone that got

274
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,096
buried in China and
some how worked its way

275
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,643
through the earth's core until it wound up

276
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,060
in your backyard.

277
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,035
- Get real.

278
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,877
I told you a million times,

279
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:57,038
it was crackling like
lightning when I found it.

280
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,205
It must have some hidden
power source inside somewhere.

281
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:06,296
- [Irwin] Hey, maybe it's
some kind of new battery.

282
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:09,275
- And maybe it's some new
kind of nuclear warhead.

283
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,222
(phone ringing)

284
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:12,389
(gasping)

285
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,858
(phone ringing)

286
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:16,691
- Phone.

287
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:26,895
Lee residence.

288
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,658
Irwin Esquire speaking.

289
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,449
- [Josh's Dad] Irwin, is Josh over there?

290
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,366
- He's coming down now.

291
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:41,716
- Who is it?

292
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,049
- [Irwin] Guess.

293
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,433
- Dad?

294
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,575
- Josh, get your but home right now.

295
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,500
- [Josh] But Dad, I found
the most incredible thing

296
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,580
in Genghis Khan's doghouse.

297
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,981
- I've told you a thousand times,

298
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,901
you come straight home from school,

299
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:56,897
finish your homework,

300
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:59,214
and then we'll talk
about your social life.

301
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,150
- But Dad.

302
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,233
- 15 minutes or your bike
privileges are history.

303
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:08,553
- I'm dead.

304
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,458
(footsteps thumping)

305
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:33,613
(doorbell ringing)

306
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:43,051
(electronic beeping)

307
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,849
(laughing)

308
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,934
- How long did it take you
jokers to build this thing

309
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,434
down at the plant?

310
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,005
Hey Herb, is that you in there?

311
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:55,575
(laughing)

312
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,825
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

313
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:04,035
(dramatic music)

314
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:04,868
- Nothing.

315
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,889
(dog barking)

316
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,586
- [Josh] I told you a million times,

317
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,515
it was crackling like
lightning when I found it.

318
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,318
It must have some hidden power source

319
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,394
inside somewhere.

320
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:26,305
- For a 20th century primitive,

321
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,555
you have been most helpful.

322
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,914
(dog barking)

323
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:46,189
(pulsing lightning)

324
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,723
- Ahh!

325
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:50,906
Woah!

326
00:22:56,351 --> 00:23:00,470
- [Irwin 1138] The Nullifier
component, young man.

327
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,720
I must have it.

328
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:03,754
- Pardon me?

329
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:05,135
- [Irwin 1138] Don't toy with me, boy.

330
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,354
I know it's here in this
time, in this place.

331
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,332
I sent it here.

332
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:09,612
- [Dr. Zoetrope] Don't
listen to him, Joshua.

333
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:11,879
This evil genius wants
to destroy the earth.

334
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,374
Turn the Nullifier component over to me

335
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:15,917
and I'll see that it's
put to its proper use.

336
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,140
- [Irwin 1138] Don't listen to him, boy.

337
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,973
- Wha, what?

338
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,800
How did you know my name?

339
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,584
- Your friend Genghis Khan told me.

340
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,001
- Oh, oh, my dog.

341
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,485
My dog told you my name?

342
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:32,318
Okay.

343
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:35,696
Look, I'm sure this is some
kind of dream or hallucination

344
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:38,178
brought on by too much
dye and too little sleep,

345
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:39,345
but just in case it's not,

346
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,851
I have got to get home before
my dad gets really PO'd.

347
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,713
Well, it was really
nice meeting you people

348
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,811
from other worlds.

349
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:45,647
Goodbye.

350
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:49,082
(lasers blasting)

351
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:51,156
Hey, take it easy, pal.

352
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:53,441
- [Irwin 1138] He's
nobody's pal, young man.

353
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:56,274
(lasers blasting)

354
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,540
- My bike!

355
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,532
(lasers blasting)

356
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,999
(creature jabbering)

357
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,515
Hey, who are you?

358
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:28,598
(creature jabbering)

359
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,359
Hey!

360
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,779
Holy moly!

361
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,885
- [Irwin 1138] Quick! Prism!

362
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,561
Quick, before he gets away.

363
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:51,644
- [Josh] Oh no you don't.

364
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:54,405
- [Irwin 1138] Brace yourself, Prism.

365
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,238
Prepare for the storm.

366
00:24:58,315 --> 00:24:59,648
- [Josh] Oh. Ah!

367
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:03,842
- Oh, no.

368
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,214
(dog barking)

369
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:24,646
- Woah! Ah!

370
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:29,784
- Calm down, young man.

371
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,184
You shouldn't be here.

372
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,725
- Oh, you're telling me.

373
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:33,866
Well, what's going on?

374
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,042
And where are we?

375
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,000
- Hyper time.

376
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,396
The limbo which flows between every moment

377
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,947
of past, present, and future.

378
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,280
There, we've got him, Prism.

379
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,461
(crashing)

380
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:51,160
- Who is this guy?

381
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,730
And why are we chasing him?

382
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,234
- That, young man, is the
insane Dr. Zoetrope 366.

383
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:58,075
And we are not chasing him.

384
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:59,492
I am chasing him.

385
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,856
- So you better step on it
'cause he's getting away.

386
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,773
(engines rumbling)

387
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,044
- Ah!

388
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,211
- [Josh] Woah!

389
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,542
- All right.

390
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,935
- Come on.

391
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,361
- Thank you, young man.

392
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,013
Dr. Zoetrope must not be allowed to escape

393
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,763
the Nullifier component.

394
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:23,596
And...

395
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:25,822
- Nullifier?

396
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:26,967
What's a Nullifier component?

397
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:29,372
- The Nullifier was a strange alien device

398
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:31,500
which washed up in the Milky Way galaxy.

399
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,142
Young Zoetrope was the only man on earth

400
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:35,254
clever enough to decipher
its true purpose.

401
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,891
To nullify all of existence,

402
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,276
past, present, and future.

403
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,485
- A Nullifier, perfect, transit.

404
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,387
A drainer void.

405
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:44,573
You mean that thing I found in my backyard

406
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,789
could destroy the world?

407
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:46,730
- No, not on its own.

408
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,421
But when it's reassembled
together with its five

409
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,960
other component parts.

410
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,309
The authorities confiscated the Nullifier

411
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:53,682
and ordered it destroyed,

412
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:55,773
but having this brilliant
discovery taken away from him

413
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:59,236
drove the already unstable
Dr. Zoetrope over the edge

414
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,451
and deep into the pit of madness.

415
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:03,430
He was imprisoned for his own good,

416
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,703
and for everyone else's.

417
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:06,585
- Woah.

418
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:10,093
- Unfortunately, the Nullifier
proved to be indestructible.

419
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:13,588
Luckily I had just perfected
a chrono-displacement device

420
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,197
capable of launching inanimate object

421
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:16,698
into the fourth dimension.

422
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:19,495
- Wait, you invented a time machine?

423
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:22,577
- Isn't that just what I said?

424
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,652
- I was able to split
the Nullifier into six

425
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,248
component parts and then
randomly launch each one

426
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,375
into a different time zone.

427
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,520
But that blasted know-it-all
criminal Zoetrope

428
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,109
managed to escape from prison and steal

429
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,751
the coordinates from my computer.

430
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,817
Now that immature madman
means to collect each

431
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,232
of the Nullifier components
from all across time,

432
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:44,371
rebuild the Nullifier, and
then press the start button,

433
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,360
destroying everything
that has ever existed

434
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,114
or ever will exist.

435
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:50,642
- But won't that destroy him, too?

436
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:52,559
- I told you, he's mad.

437
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:55,268
- But if the Nullifier
has to be reassembled

438
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:58,121
for it to work, why do
you need all six parts?

439
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,151
Why don't you just grab
one and that would keep

440
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:03,281
him from putting it back
together, wouldn't it?

441
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,114
(laughing)

442
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,245
- It's too risky.

443
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,969
Zoetrope is so darn smart
he just might reassemble

444
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,308
the Nullifier using only five pieces.

445
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:13,267
Or four, or three, or two, or--

446
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:16,352
- Okay, okay, I get the idea.

447
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:17,402
But how could he do all this?

448
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:19,138
I thought you invented the time machine?

449
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:21,905
- Turns out Zoetrope invented
that lousy time armor

450
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:25,017
of his before I even built my time pod.

451
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:26,526
He was just so obsessed
with the Nullifier,

452
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:29,522
he didn't bother to tell anybody.

453
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:30,832
- Well, you gotta admit,

454
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:33,986
time armor is cooler than a time pod.

455
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:36,238
- Do you think I don't know that?

456
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:38,238
Sure, time armor's cool.

457
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,399
It's not very practical, is it?

458
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:43,646
You can only get one
person into time armor.

459
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,644
Look how many people you
can get into my time pod.

460
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:47,977
- Yeah, I guess.

461
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:53,015
(whooshing)

462
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,968
- Time bomb!

463
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,051
Hit the deck!

464
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:05,136
(bomb exploding)

465
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:11,485
(electricity crackling)

466
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:28,596
Blast.

467
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:30,007
We've lost him.

468
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:31,235
Prism, concentrate.

469
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:34,029
Try and get a fix on
the Nullifier component.

470
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:35,237
- [Josh] What's he doing?

471
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:37,493
- Well, Prism is something
you 20th century types

472
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:39,514
call a bloodhound.

473
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,680
For some reason I have yet to determine,

474
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,927
seems that Prism has a vital link with

475
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:45,424
the Nullifier component.

476
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,776
Whenever he gets close to a
piece of the alien device,

477
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,518
he begins to glow with colors.

478
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:51,351
Now...

479
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:55,469
Without Prism here I'd be totally unable

480
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:57,802
to pick up Zoetrope's trail.

481
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:02,117
- All right, come on.

482
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,551
- [Irwin 1138] What are you doing?

483
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,008
- I'm just making sure this isn't a dream.

484
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:06,841
Look, mister.

485
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:08,741
I've got to get out of here.

486
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,561
- Young man, I didn't ask you to intrude,

487
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,380
so you better make the best of it.

488
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,377
- I didn't ask you to
bring me along, either.

489
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,554
I demand you take me home.

490
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:17,790
- Take me home. (laughs)

491
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,923
Such petty concerns.

492
00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:22,152
I've got to catch Zoetrope
before it's too late.

493
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:23,880
- I don't believe this.

494
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,189
Look, I appreciate the need
to save the world and all,

495
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,560
but I think I'm in a little over my head.

496
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,953
Look, I'm not gonna be any help to you.

497
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,471
I'm only 14.

498
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,914
So just drive me back home
and I'll be out of your hair.

499
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:37,389
- Will you stop harping?

500
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:39,291
I can't go anywhere until
I get my time pod fixed.

501
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,997
And we're not going back anywhere.

502
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,394
After Zoetrope's mad hopping
through the time stream,

503
00:30:43,394 --> 00:30:45,811
your era will cease to exist.

504
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:50,203
- What are you talking about,
my era won't exist anymore?

505
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:51,286
You're crazy.

506
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:59,227
- Perhaps you'll believe me if you see it.

507
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,463
- [Josh] What's going on?

508
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:04,451
This isn't my home.

509
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,831
- [Irwin 1138] I'm afraid
you're wrong, young man.

510
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,331
That is your home.

511
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:12,079
- No, no, I don't believe you.

512
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,431
- You won't believe anything, will you?

513
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:14,681
Hmm, read that.

514
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,269
- September 14, 1994.

515
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:21,547
7:32:59am.

516
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:25,986
September 14th, 7:32am.

517
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:31,374
I'm supposed to be getting
up for school right now.

518
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:33,402
Duke Dunkington's supposed
to beat me up today

519
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:35,510
when I don't give him his homework.

520
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,913
- I'm sorry to tell you this, young man.

521
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:39,317
But the chaos caused by
Zoetrope's mad rampage

522
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:41,690
through the time stream
has altered history

523
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,523
in a somewhat catastrophic manner.

524
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,649
- Green Oaks, my house, my dad.

525
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,347
Oh, Beth Sullivan.

526
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:57,331
I never got the chance to
show her I wasn't weird.

527
00:31:57,331 --> 00:31:59,130
All right, Josh, come on.

528
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,963
Wake up.

529
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:00,796
You can do it.

530
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:01,898
Just, just wake up.

531
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:03,778
Where's that stupid alarm clock?

532
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:05,590
- Get ahold of yourself.

533
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,159
Our only chance now is to
track down Zoetrope 366

534
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,807
and put an end to his deadly
romp through the time stream

535
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,487
before he retrieves all
the Nullifier components

536
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,434
and puts an end to the universe.

537
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,767
- How will that help?

538
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,928
My universe is already destroyed.

539
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:22,215
How are we gonna get my
world back to the way it was?

540
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:23,912
The way it's supposed to be?

541
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,420
- I don't know.

542
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,999
But I assure you, it's
all very real, Joshua.

543
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,879
That is what Zoetrope called you.

544
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,118
- Yeah.

545
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,535
Yeah, Josh Kirby.

546
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,726
- Look, Joshua.

547
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,832
Let's not get off on the wrong foot.

548
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:46,605
I am Irwin 1138, one of
the most brilliant men

549
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:48,272
of the 21st century.

550
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,606
- One of the most.

551
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:53,606
- Well, second actually.

552
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,680
- Hmm, second.

553
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,422
Who's the first?

554
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:00,074
- You've already met him.

555
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:04,518
Ha, I'm afraid I have to admit
that young Zoetrope 366's

556
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:08,518
brainpower exceeds my own
by 8.6 cerebral grams.

557
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,616
- Ah, just my luck.

558
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,821
I had to hook up with the
second-most brilliant man

559
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:17,212
of the 21st century.

560
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,740
- No need to get personal, young man.

561
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,573
- I'm sorry.

562
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:24,534
I guess I was just upset about, you know.

563
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:27,633
Here, look, maybe if we drag Zoetrope back

564
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,431
the way he came, retracing
steps through time,

565
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:32,864
everything will go back
the way it was before

566
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:33,947
he showed up.

567
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:36,931
- It's impossible.

568
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,302
The time-displacement
postulate clearly states

569
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:41,370
that temporal events, once altered,

570
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,656
can never be returned
to their original state.

571
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,317
- Well who came up with that?

572
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,941
- [Irwin 1138] Well, I did, of course.

573
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:54,108
- Have you ever tested that
postulate outside a laboratory?

574
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,270
- Um, it's never been tested at all.

575
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:01,967
- Well, you've gotta admit,

576
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,744
there's still a chance.

577
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:07,538
Look, besides, you've gotta
find a way to put things back.

578
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,450
If the late 20th century
is this messed up,

579
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,133
the 25th century must be really screwed.

580
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:16,657
- Your primitive 20th century reasoning

581
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,729
is inescapable.

582
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:21,729
Perhaps there is a chance after all.

583
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:25,539
I hope you're prepared
to do battle, young man.

584
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,456
This will be a war through time,

585
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,567
and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners.

586
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:33,516
- All right, it's now or never.

587
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,349
Let's go.

588
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,990
(dramatic music)

589
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,179
- 1205 AD.

590
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:48,206
Prepare for the storm.

591
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,607
(engines rumbling)

592
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,956
(engines blasting)

593
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:04,788
(upbeat instrumental music)

594
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,558
(doors whirring)

595
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,191
- [Josh] So you're telling
me we're in medieval England?

596
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:17,191
Yeah, right.

597
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,417
Woah.

598
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:38,868
- Your sacrifice will not be forgotten,

599
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,260
good friend blacksmith.

600
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,535
Someday when William of
Dearborn can be restored

601
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:47,833
to his rightful throne,
all this may be over.

602
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,666
(Prism jabbering)

603
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,293
- How do you do that, Prism?

604
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,968
- Oh, it's some kind
of complex transference

605
00:35:55,968 --> 00:36:00,202
of matter particles from
one spacial zone to another.

606
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,752
- So in other words, you have no idea.

607
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:04,019
- Do you know, when I was your age,

608
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,303
what's that noise?

609
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,263
(whirring)

610
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:08,096
Ah.

611
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:15,476
Oh.

612
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:17,951
- Hey, are you okay?

613
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,868
- [Irwin 1138] Yes, oh.

614
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,830
- On your knees, slaver.

615
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,934
- Slaver?

616
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,434
We're not slavers.

617
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:33,416
- You spare me your lies, boy.

618
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:38,477
Send me back to my comrades
at the front immediately.

619
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:41,810
- Look, I would if I could, but I can't.

620
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,163
- Don't you realize I
could sever your puny head

621
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:48,242
from your narrow shoulders
in a millisecond?

622
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:50,175
- Now that wouldn't do
either of us any good

623
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,980
because I'd be dead
and you'd be stuck here

624
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,897
in 1205 AD.

625
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,672
- What year did you say it was?

626
00:36:58,672 --> 00:36:59,787
(Prism jabbering)

627
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,060
Ah!

628
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,257
Slaver beast, get away from me.

629
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,144
- Hold it right there.

630
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,450
Now listen to me.

631
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,236
First of all, you have
no reason to be mad at us

632
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:10,148
because we didn't bring you here.

633
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,593
Second of all, you're only
a few years older than me,

634
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,342
so don't call me boy.

635
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:16,170
My name is Josh Kirby.

636
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,253
- And I am Azabeth Siege.

637
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:22,049
- Take care of my horse.

638
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:26,150
See that my son Jamie grows up strong.

639
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:33,636
He likes a wormy apple now and then.

640
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:35,053
My horse, I mean.

641
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,342
(growling)

642
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:49,169
(leaves rustling)

643
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:17,502
- Uh, Irwin?

644
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:19,163
- Busy, Josh.

645
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,163
- No, Irwin.

646
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:22,797
- Look, Josh, I...

647
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:31,367
(screaming)

648
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:38,467
- [Azabeth] Take your hands
off me, you imbeciles.

649
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:41,717
- Josh, do you think they mean us harm?

650
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,854
- I'd say that's pretty much
an affirmative, Irwin 1138.

651
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:46,903
All right, would somebody please tell us

652
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:48,684
what's going on?

653
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:51,070
- You have that right.

654
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,070
We were to sacrifice one of our own,

655
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:57,028
drawn by lot.

656
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,954
A meal to give the baron's hungry dragon.

657
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:01,787
- Dragon?

658
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,468
Irwin, did he say dragon?

659
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,316
- Don't worry, Josh, Azabeth.

660
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:10,276
It's all just some kind of primitive myth.

661
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,419
There never were any
such things as dragons.

662
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:15,819
This must be just some
kind of medieval jest

663
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:17,441
played on strangers.

664
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,691
(laughing)

665
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:21,799
(deep rumbling)

666
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:22,682
- [Man] It's coming!

667
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:23,515
Let's go!

668
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:24,348
[Woman] Hurry!

669
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:25,218
- [Man] This way!

670
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:26,051
Wait!

671
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:29,972
(growling)

672
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:32,825
- Sorry about this lads and lady.

673
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:35,125
Thanks all the same.

674
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,614
- [Man] Come with me.

675
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:38,864
Hurry! Quickly!

676
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,698
(roaring)

677
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:44,025
- No such things as dragons, you said.

678
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:45,442
Then what's that?

679
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:49,916
- That's no dragon, Josh.

680
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,628
I can understand how these simple peasants

681
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:52,950
might think so.

682
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,783
It's, it's a dinosaur.

683
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:59,691
(roaring)

684
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,397
It must've been accidentally
transported here

685
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,306
in the wake of Dr. Zoetrope's escape

686
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:05,306
through the time stream.

687
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:08,806
- You know, I think it thinks we're lunch.

688
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,589
(roaring)

689
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:27,083
(soft instrumental music)

690
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,119
- Sire, the sacrificial
party has returned,

691
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,073
but the blacksmith has been spared.

692
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,364
Captured strangers are said
to be at this very moment

693
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:40,284
being sacrificed in his stead.

694
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,284
- Strangers?

695
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,690
What strangers?

696
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,049
(groaning)

697
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,602
- God, this isn't good, Irwin 1138.

698
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:53,331
- I'm inclined to agree with you, Joshua.

699
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,581
- If only I had my weapons.

700
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:59,593
(roaring)

701
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:13,988
- We must rescue them, mustn't we?

702
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,104
(roaring)

703
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,394
- Hey, who are you guys?

704
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:49,098
- I might ask you the same question.

705
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:51,583
(roaring)

706
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,787
(chomping)

707
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,704
- Bring me your weapon.

708
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,935
(chomping)

709
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,102
(roaring)

710
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,830
(dramatic music)

711
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,310
- Who are you?

712
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,245
- I'm Jolly Jack.

713
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:13,245
Who are you?

714
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,569
(chomping)

715
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:22,736
(roaring)

716
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:33,664
(groaning)

717
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,606
- Hide them in the blacksmith's hut.

718
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:37,439
- But Azabeth!

719
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,473
- No, we must run now,
boy, or we are lost, too.

720
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,760
- My stick, thank you.

721
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,677
Keep going!

722
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:47,609
(roaring)

723
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:54,213
- Take her.

724
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:05,960
- [Man] Good morning, Charles.

725
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,293
- [Man] Morning to you.

726
00:43:08,293 --> 00:43:11,002
(laughing)

727
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,511
- Jamie!

728
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,011
Ha, welcome gents.

729
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:18,314
I'm the blacksmith here in
our little piece of heaven.

730
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:20,706
And this is my son, Jamie.

731
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:21,769
Say hello, Jamie.

732
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,129
- Hello.

733
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:24,485
- Hi, I'm Josh.

734
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:25,831
And this is Irwin 1138.

735
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:27,755
- Hello, Jamie.

736
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:29,650
- I feel terrible about
what almost happened

737
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,287
to you today.

738
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:32,287
Really I do.

739
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:37,276
I offer you safe haven in my little shop

740
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:40,176
and if there's ever
anything I can do for you,

741
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:43,049
just let me know, all right?

742
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:44,216
- What's that?

743
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:46,395
- This?

744
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:48,298
This is--

745
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:52,045
- Good sirs, William of Dearborn requests

746
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,527
your presence in his hut.

747
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:55,172
He begs you come now if you please.

748
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:57,821
- William, that's the one who rescued us?

749
00:43:57,821 --> 00:43:58,960
- Great.

750
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,579
We've got to organize
another rescue, pronto.

751
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,741
One of our group's been captured by

752
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,594
the evil guy on the dinosaur,

753
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:07,050
or the ah, the dragon.

754
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,084
- The baron will decide if
there's to be any kind of...

755
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:11,351
- Rescue?

756
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:13,018
Out of the question.

757
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,113
- But why?

758
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,629
- You've stumbled into a situation

759
00:44:16,629 --> 00:44:19,122
you know nothing about, boy.

760
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:21,890
Why don't you both go
back where you came from?

761
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,263
Wherever that is.

762
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:24,926
- All right, it's true.

763
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:28,818
We're strangers, but our
friend needs our help.

764
00:44:28,818 --> 00:44:30,855
- We all need help.

765
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:33,272
Whether we could all find it.

766
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:38,125
- Hmm.

767
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:46,249
- You're puzzled, strangers.

768
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:50,462
- Well, a little clarification
would be welcome, yes.

769
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:54,454
- I am Theodore and you've
met our friend the blacksmith.

770
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:56,871
- Mmm, my name is Irwin 1138.

771
00:44:57,813 --> 00:44:59,396
This is Josh Kirby.

772
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:02,800
- Our leader, William of Dearborn,

773
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,695
was until recent times
the baron of this region.

774
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:11,117
- And a better lord and
leader no man ever had.

775
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:13,381
- But William's younger brother,

776
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:16,472
the evil Lord Henry,
treacherously betrayed him,

777
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:20,278
took over his lands, and
set himself up as baron.

778
00:45:20,278 --> 00:45:24,178
- And a more miserable jackal
of a man you'll never find.

779
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:26,019
- Why didn't William fight back?

780
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:26,892
- He did.

781
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,567
- We all did at first,

782
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,781
but the Lord Henry bought the cruel might

783
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:33,528
of a mercenary army to protect him.

784
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,442
And then the dragon came.

785
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,398
And to feed its hunger,

786
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:40,562
the Lord Henry demanded a
sacrifice to the great beast

787
00:45:40,562 --> 00:45:41,729
each new moon.

788
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:44,486
- Each new moon?

789
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:46,319
- That's once a month.

790
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:48,604
- I knew that.

791
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,893
- The dragon was the final straw.

792
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:54,975
It's terrible presence sapped
William's spirit to fight.

793
00:45:54,975 --> 00:45:57,194
If we don't feed the beast each new moon,

794
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:58,816
Henry has threatened to let it destroy

795
00:45:58,816 --> 00:46:01,540
the village and devour us all.

796
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,703
William dares not let that happen.

797
00:46:04,703 --> 00:46:06,120
So we do nothing.

798
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:10,098
Yeah, but you saved us.

799
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,159
William couldn't bear the
thought of responsibility

800
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,810
for your deaths too.

801
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,588
But now he worries that
there will come renewed

802
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:20,755
reprisals against the village
from he dragon Lord Henry.

803
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:24,150
(roaring)

804
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,846
(laughing)

805
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:29,216
- [Woman] You children come back here now.

806
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:32,216
(children laughing)

807
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:38,388
- Look at this.

808
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:40,221
- [Man] Come together.

809
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:47,678
(people conversing in background)

810
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:55,650
- [Henry] Damn my brother's eyes,

811
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,759
the gall to interfere with the sacrifice.

812
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:01,382
The royal dragon has
not been fed in weeks.

813
00:47:01,382 --> 00:47:03,566
His humor is most foul.

814
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,166
- Oh, baron.

815
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,196
Can thou tellest me
what is black and white,

816
00:47:07,196 --> 00:47:08,539
is black and white, is black and white,

817
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:10,204
and black and white?

818
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:14,371
- A similarly garbed clergyman
rolling down the hill.

819
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,074
- Oh, jester.

820
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:17,300
- [Jester] Sire.

821
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,643
- Have you eaten yet?

822
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:19,476
- [Jester] Yes.

823
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:20,348
Thank you, sire.

824
00:47:20,348 --> 00:47:21,358
(fingers snapping)

825
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:22,355
- [Henry] Good.

826
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,371
Then prepare to be eaten.

827
00:47:24,371 --> 00:47:25,267
Feed him to my dragon.

828
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,522
- Wait, wait.

829
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:29,772
Wouldst thou like to hear a dirty jest?

830
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:35,812
- You will pay for taking me prisoner,

831
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,145
you mongrel dog.

832
00:47:39,643 --> 00:47:42,528
(grunting)

833
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:43,361
- Will I?

834
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:50,233
(grunting)

835
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:08,565
(dramatic music)

836
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,440
- Unusual jewelry.

837
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,160
What if I take it?

838
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:17,737
- Then you would be a thief

839
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:19,481
as well as a coward.

840
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:21,731
(laughing)

841
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:26,586
- Have her bathed and scented.

842
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:28,681
Dressed in finery from
Lady Jennifer's wardrobe

843
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:31,507
and brought to my chambers
for supper this evening.

844
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:32,590
- Yes, Baron.

845
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:49,463
- Welcome back, my Lord.

846
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:51,796
- Ah, the lady of the house.

847
00:48:53,671 --> 00:48:55,791
- Well, I hope that is
what I am to you, my Lord.

848
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:58,201
- Yes, yes, I plucked you from the muck

849
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,248
of the village to be my consort.

850
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,077
When was it, Lady?

851
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:04,337
- 'Twas a year ago, my Lord.

852
00:49:04,337 --> 00:49:06,156
Surely you haven't forgotten.

853
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:07,904
- A year, you say?

854
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,987
I swear it feels like 10.

855
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,372
- Will you take supper tonight, my Lord?

856
00:49:16,372 --> 00:49:18,789
- I dine alone tonight, Lady.

857
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:23,858
Eat with your maids if
you must have company.

858
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:26,025
Send for the grand wizard.

859
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,508
(people talking in background)

860
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,553
- Announcing the grand wizard.

861
00:49:49,984 --> 00:49:52,734
(dramatic music)

862
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,377
- Greetings, royal alchemist.

863
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:06,402
(dramatic music)

864
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,715
- Greetings, sire.

865
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,208
For your collection.

866
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:25,542
- Splendid.

867
00:50:28,052 --> 00:50:30,233
What else have you been up to this day?

868
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:33,153
- Still endeavoring to change
lead into gold for you, sir,

869
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:34,664
though it may take awhile.

870
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,260
- Succeed and you shall
see how truly grateful

871
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,177
I can be, grand wizard.

872
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:41,763
But I did not send for
you to speak of this,

873
00:50:41,763 --> 00:50:43,725
but of another matter.

874
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:46,320
A matter of some newcomers.

875
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,377
- Newcomers, Lord?

876
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,279
- Yes, three of them.

877
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,275
I have one imprisoned in
the dungeon right now.

878
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:53,108
A girl.

879
00:50:54,576 --> 00:50:55,826
Most beautiful.

880
00:50:57,746 --> 00:50:59,163
Almost unearthly.

881
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,444
The other two, a boy and an old man,

882
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:08,228
with my dear brother
William down in the village.

883
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:11,465
They remind me of you somehow, wizard.

884
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:12,784
- Me, Lord?

885
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:13,617
- Yes.

886
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:17,634
Perhaps they are kinsman of yours?

887
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,732
- No, Lord.

888
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,027
I told you I was born right here.

889
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:27,003
- Yes, so you said when
first you came to us

890
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:30,670
to help us tame the
dragon with your device.

891
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,372
- I hope that I can
continue to be of service

892
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,629
to you, Lord Henry.

893
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:39,629
- So do I, grand wizard.

894
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:43,312
So do I.

895
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,488
- Well, well, well.

896
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:59,160
Azabeth Siege, all chained
up and no place to go.

897
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,577
- Zoetrope, you vile serpent.

898
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,616
- Tell me, when did you
arrive in this time?

899
00:52:05,616 --> 00:52:07,121
- I'll tell you nothing.

900
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:08,236
(laughing)

901
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:10,016
- Have Irwin 1138 and Josh Kirby been able

902
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:13,332
to locate the Nullifier component?

903
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:14,977
Answer me.

904
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:18,373
- Come a little closer
and you'll feel my answer.

905
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:19,206
- Ah, ah.

906
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:24,650
Foolish, foolish girl.

907
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,904
- How did you turn Prism against us?

908
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:28,737
(laughing)

909
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:30,784
- That was a simple matter of a mind plug.

910
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:33,010
I could implant one in you.

911
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,843
But I think I'll wait.

912
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:37,646
- We both know if you have Prism,

913
00:52:37,646 --> 00:52:41,050
you have a foolproof way to
locate the Nullifier component.

914
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,745
So why ask me?

915
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:45,020
- Well, unfortunately
one of the side effects

916
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,434
of the mind plug is little
Prism's mane of many colors

917
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:49,327
no longer functions.

918
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:53,494
But I will find the Nullifier
component, fear not.

919
00:52:55,974 --> 00:52:58,188
Enjoy your stay in the
dungeon, Azabeth Siege.

920
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:02,355
I have a feeling it's going
to be a very long one.

921
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,386
(Prism jabbering)

922
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,046
- You little devil.

923
00:53:19,224 --> 00:53:20,363
(glass breaking)

924
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,196
Stop that!

925
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:27,411
(Prism jabbering)

926
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,280
I know with the mind plug in you,

927
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,432
you can't remember your
friends, little one.

928
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:48,345
But they are here now and I must find

929
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:50,762
the Nullifier before they do.

930
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:56,644
The locator in my helmet was damaged

931
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:59,627
in the ride into this time.

932
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:00,460
Too bad.

933
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:07,861
I wonder.

934
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:11,966
It was putting the mind plug in that took

935
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:13,807
away your mane of many colors.

936
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:16,388
Perhaps if I take the mind plug out

937
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:18,221
it will bring it back.

938
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:23,273
(Prism jabbering)

939
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:24,106
Ha.

940
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:28,366
- [Prism] Ah.

941
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,199
Ow! Ah!

942
00:54:35,836 --> 00:54:38,669
(Prism jabbering)

943
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,225
- Ah, wonderful.

944
00:54:45,775 --> 00:54:47,942
You have given me an idea.

945
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:50,268
- Come on then.

946
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:51,101
Come on, boy.

947
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:51,934
Come on.

948
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,053
Get it.

949
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:14,090
(horse neighing)

950
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,757
- What's that, then?

951
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,606
- Uh, well that, that there is a,

952
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,387
that's a food storage
compartment is what that is.

953
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:29,182
Yeah, you put your food in there,

954
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:32,654
and then it doesn't get
spoiled or anything.

955
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:34,404
- You're an inventor?

956
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:36,209
- Yes.

957
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:38,091
Oh, yeah.

958
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:39,701
You could say that, yes.

959
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:41,481
- I'm an inventor, too.

960
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:42,929
(spitting)

961
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,944
See that pale with the
holes punched in it?

962
00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:49,104
Gives Beatrice a nice cool
shower in the heat of the day.

963
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:50,924
I invented that.

964
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:52,524
Keeps food from spoiling.

965
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:55,661
Why don't you just eat
the food before it spoils?

966
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,078
How does it work?

967
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,855
- Well, right now it doesn't.

968
00:56:00,855 --> 00:56:05,434
And we would like your help
to mend it, master blacksmith.

969
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:07,430
- Oh, it's the least I can do.

970
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,391
Bring it here, gents.

971
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:11,224
- Right, I'll untie it.

972
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:12,724
You bring it here.

973
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,150
(dramatic music)

974
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:24,749
(roaring)

975
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,153
(Prism jabbering)

976
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:45,642
- We will find the Nullifier if we have to

977
00:56:45,642 --> 00:56:49,225
walk the entire baroning,
my little friend.

978
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:53,252
(Prism jabbering)

979
00:56:54,223 --> 00:56:55,056
- Wizards.

980
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,373
- [Irwin 1138] Try the left.

981
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:01,676
(pod creaking)

982
00:57:01,676 --> 00:57:02,509
Darn it.

983
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:05,837
Oh.

984
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:06,670
No good.

985
00:57:08,612 --> 00:57:12,695
I'll have to disassemble
the coaxial interocator.

986
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,964
- You know, I think the
blacksmith's starting

987
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:23,843
to wonder about us.

988
00:57:23,843 --> 00:57:25,639
- As long as he doesn't
start tinkering around

989
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:26,556
on his own.

990
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:30,465
- Well, he's keeping pretty
busy with that slingshot.

991
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:31,298
- Mmm.

992
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:32,316
- It's a birthday surprise for Jamie,

993
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:34,197
so don't tell him.

994
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:37,318
I only wonder if we should tell.

995
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:39,585
- What? The truth?

996
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,276
Not unless he asks us.

997
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:43,763
Look, he's our friend and he trusts us.

998
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:45,596
That's enough for now.

999
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:51,129
(grunting)

1000
00:57:51,129 --> 00:57:52,415
- In you go, girly.

1001
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:54,508
Get in the little bath, top neither.

1002
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:55,589
- Why have you brought me here?

1003
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:57,161
- The baron wants you bathed and dressed

1004
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:59,293
to supper with him tonight, that's why.

1005
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:00,335
Though for the life of me,

1006
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:01,673
I can't see what you've got to offer

1007
00:58:01,673 --> 00:58:03,347
that the Lady Jennifer ain't.

1008
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:04,534
- Who is this Lady Jennifer?

1009
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:05,927
- The baron's lady, that's who.

1010
00:58:05,927 --> 00:58:07,399
Well, she's gonna like you being here,

1011
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:08,563
I can tell you that.

1012
00:58:08,563 --> 00:58:11,808
Still, ours is not to reason why.

1013
00:58:11,808 --> 00:58:14,116
Now, off with your knickers.

1014
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:14,970
- My what?

1015
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,458
- Your knickers, your
tops and bottoms, love.

1016
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:20,002
- I will not be stripped of my uniform.

1017
00:58:20,002 --> 00:58:22,154
- Oh, yes, you will, me fine girl.

1018
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:26,720
You'll either do it yourself
or I'll do it for ya.

1019
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,897
- All right, I shall undress myself,

1020
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:33,248
you slime serpent from the
poison rivers of Amdor.

1021
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:35,901
- Oh, no use insulting me, deary.

1022
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:40,136
Just rolls off me like water
off a duck's ass, it does.

1023
00:58:40,136 --> 00:58:41,948
Now you get them queer-lookin' things off

1024
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,813
and I'll be back with somethin' pretty

1025
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:45,813
for you to put on later.

1026
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:02,988
- What's wrong, Josh?

1027
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:06,012
- Our friend Azabeth was captured by your

1028
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:07,512
dragon Lord Henry.

1029
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,006
We've gotta find a way to rescue her.

1030
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,202
But William and everyone
else say it's impossible.

1031
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:17,093
That there's no defense
against Henry's T-Rex,

1032
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,487
or dragon, that is.

1033
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:21,315
- I know where there's another dragon.

1034
00:59:21,315 --> 00:59:24,918
- Azabeth doesn't know,
but I care a lot about her.

1035
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:27,001
We can't just do nothing.

1036
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,128
What did you just say?

1037
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:33,029
- I know where there's another dragon.

1038
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:34,223
Suppose to be, anyway.

1039
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:35,574
- Another dragon?

1040
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:37,158
Are you serious?

1041
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:39,825
Oh, oh, I've gotta find William.

1042
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:52,995
(suspenseful music)

1043
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:11,359
- How's the water, little lady?

1044
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,639
Fine, I hope.

1045
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,154
All right then, put these on when you're

1046
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,259
through with your bath.

1047
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:18,259
- Then what?

1048
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,914
- Then you sit here and
wait until the baron

1049
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:24,081
calls for ya, that's what.

1050
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,660
(suspenseful music)

1051
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:47,031
- Put that down.

1052
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:47,864
- [Azabeth] Who are you?

1053
01:00:47,864 --> 01:00:48,780
- Never mind who I am.

1054
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,308
That is my dress and I said put it down.

1055
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:52,855
- [Azabeth] You're the
Lady Jennifer, aren't you?

1056
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:54,778
- How dare you even speak my name,

1057
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:56,195
you common trash.

1058
01:00:57,183 --> 01:00:59,433
(grunting)

1059
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,733
Get off me!

1060
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:08,186
Get off me this instant!

1061
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,019
- Stop!

1062
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:11,024
Stop or I will have to apply a sleep lock

1063
01:01:11,024 --> 01:01:12,075
and I warn you,

1064
01:01:12,075 --> 01:01:14,415
waking from a sleep lock is not pleasant.

1065
01:01:14,415 --> 01:01:15,559
- The baron is mine.

1066
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,392
He is mine.

1067
01:01:16,392 --> 01:01:17,237
Do you understand?

1068
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:19,574
- You think I wish to
take the baron for myself?

1069
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:20,730
- Ah, don't try to deny it.

1070
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,652
I know you do.

1071
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,169
- [Azabeth] But I swear I do not.

1072
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:24,002
- Ha, liar.

1073
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:26,178
- Even if I wanted to,
the codes of Kang are

1074
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:27,905
quite specific about the danger,

1075
01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:29,621
the 17th in particular.

1076
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,806
Whosoever takes another woman's man

1077
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:33,968
does keep close watch on her own.

1078
01:01:33,968 --> 01:01:36,608
- Codes, Kang, I know nothing of these.

1079
01:01:36,608 --> 01:01:39,266
You're just trying to confuse me.

1080
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:42,473
- If I let you up, will you quit?

1081
01:01:42,473 --> 01:01:43,306
- Yes.

1082
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:45,514
- Jennifer, listen to me.

1083
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:46,797
- Lady Jennifer.

1084
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:48,525
- Lady Jennifer, all I want,

1085
01:01:48,525 --> 01:01:50,012
all I want is to escape this castle

1086
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:51,846
and return to my friends.

1087
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:54,110
- Well, I can tell you that's
not all the baron wants.

1088
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,214
- I care not what that man wants.

1089
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:59,030
- Ah, you say that now, but wait.

1090
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,476
He fancies you.

1091
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:02,397
Yes, he will try to woo you.

1092
01:02:02,397 --> 01:02:04,907
And he can be quite persuasive.

1093
01:02:04,907 --> 01:02:07,195
- What is this wooing?

1094
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:09,406
- What is to woo?

1095
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:11,844
To win thy desired one's heart.

1096
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:14,289
To make the tender advance.

1097
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:17,021
- I am my own woman and I cannot be wooed

1098
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:19,071
as you say unless I wish to be,

1099
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:21,071
and I do not wish to be.

1100
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,062
- Ah, yes.

1101
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:26,401
I was much as you in the beginning.

1102
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,940
But Henry is, he's quite forceful.

1103
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,107
And I saw quickly it was better
to give in than to fight.

1104
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:39,712
- It's a shame you've
had to give into any man.

1105
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,281
- Oh.

1106
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:42,191
- Jennifer, wait.

1107
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,503
(door closing)

1108
01:02:44,503 --> 01:02:46,670
(sighing)

1109
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:51,208
- Don't you see?

1110
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,691
It's a chance, at least.

1111
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:55,937
I mean, if another dragon does exist,

1112
01:02:55,937 --> 01:02:57,319
it might be possible to use it to win back

1113
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:00,188
your crown and rescue my friend.

1114
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:02,314
- I, too, have heard reports
of this other dragon,

1115
01:03:02,314 --> 01:03:04,518
Josh Kirby, but no one has yet seen it.

1116
01:03:04,518 --> 01:03:05,935
I repeat, no one.

1117
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,250
- So what?

1118
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,062
I mean, maybe it's shy or something.

1119
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:14,096
But if it does exist,

1120
01:03:14,096 --> 01:03:16,796
wouldn't you want to know about it?

1121
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:20,637
All right, do you want your
castle and stuff back or not?

1122
01:03:20,637 --> 01:03:22,366
- Take care, boy.

1123
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,682
You tread heavily.

1124
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:26,765
- Hey, whatever it takes.

1125
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:30,547
Our friend is in trouble,

1126
01:03:30,547 --> 01:03:33,547
and if you won't go, I'll go myself.

1127
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,417
- All right.

1128
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:46,561
Theodore, organize a search
party with Jolly Jack.

1129
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:50,311
A hunting we will go,
it seems, for a dragon.

1130
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:53,525
- All right, excellent.

1131
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,330
- Which shall it be, dresser?

1132
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,713
The black or the red?

1133
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:04,546
- Black.

1134
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,819
Black does suit you, Baron.

1135
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:09,004
- It is true.

1136
01:04:09,004 --> 01:04:10,805
Black is my color.

1137
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,887
Yet I feel the red will
make a certain emotion

1138
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:18,286
of mine clear to the maid
we captured this morning.

1139
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:20,897
- Yes, I see your point.

1140
01:04:20,897 --> 01:04:23,976
The red then, and good luck, sire.

1141
01:04:23,976 --> 01:04:26,836
- I don't need luck, dolt.

1142
01:04:26,836 --> 01:04:30,419
I have charm, looks,
money, land, a castle,

1143
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:34,528
and a dragon.

1144
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,149
- Yes, sire.

1145
01:04:44,035 --> 01:04:46,174
- Good day, your ladyship.

1146
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,591
- Who says it is?

1147
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,512
(knocking)

1148
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:53,345
- Come.

1149
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:56,442
- It is only me, my Lord.

1150
01:04:56,442 --> 01:04:58,292
- Oh, rapture.

1151
01:04:58,292 --> 01:04:59,125
Leave us.

1152
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:04,865
What can I do for you now, madam.

1153
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:07,945
- Oh, and why do you speak
to me so formal, my Lord.

1154
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,058
- Formally, Lady.

1155
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:11,085
- I beg pardon?

1156
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:11,938
- Formally.

1157
01:05:11,938 --> 01:05:15,462
When will you learn to
speak the king's English?

1158
01:05:15,462 --> 01:05:17,990
- I've taken lessons as you wish, my Lord.

1159
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,678
- I should think that
tutors would have greater

1160
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:21,595
success with my dragon.

1161
01:05:22,749 --> 01:05:24,931
- When will this cease?

1162
01:05:24,931 --> 01:05:26,706
- When will what cease?

1163
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:28,501
- These, these insults.

1164
01:05:28,501 --> 01:05:29,334
These barbs.

1165
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:30,825
They cut so deeply.

1166
01:05:30,825 --> 01:05:32,674
These cruelty marks that I have not earned

1167
01:05:32,674 --> 01:05:34,401
and do not deserve.

1168
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:37,284
- 'Tis the way I always
speak to you, Lady.

1169
01:05:37,284 --> 01:05:39,367
I know not what you mean.

1170
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:44,709
- 'Tis that barbarian wench, isn't it?

1171
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,642
- Which barbarian wench?

1172
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:50,085
- Don't play innocent with
me, Henry of Dearborn.

1173
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:53,360
You're having her dressed right now

1174
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,693
and in my own gown, no less.

1175
01:05:56,824 --> 01:05:57,657
Oh, Henry.

1176
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,352
Aren't I good enough for you?

1177
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:03,116
I once was, you know.

1178
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:06,525
- Don't press me on that point, Lady.

1179
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:10,030
You may get an answer
you don't wish to hear.

1180
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,204
- I will not tolerate this.

1181
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:13,177
I will not.

1182
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,679
- No?

1183
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,511
I think you will.

1184
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:18,671
I remind you, Lady Jennifer,

1185
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:20,233
that you are here by my good graces

1186
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:22,739
and my good graces alone.

1187
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:24,186
If you don't want to
be back in the village

1188
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:27,085
churning butter with the
other peasant maidens,

1189
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:28,835
you will kindly cease your complaining of

1190
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:31,817
treatment by me and
occupy yourself in some

1191
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:33,400
productive fashion.

1192
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,107
Do I make myself clear?

1193
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,708
- Yes, Baron.

1194
01:06:43,563 --> 01:06:44,563
Quite clear.

1195
01:06:47,226 --> 01:06:50,226
(suspenseful music)

1196
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,959
- Does anyone know where we are?

1197
01:07:00,959 --> 01:07:03,053
We could get lost this way.

1198
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:04,423
- Fear not, Theodore.

1199
01:07:04,423 --> 01:07:06,584
We won't get lost.

1200
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:10,342
- I might ask, if we come
upon the great beast,

1201
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:11,759
what is our plan?

1202
01:07:17,987 --> 01:07:20,154
- The Nullifier component.

1203
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:25,976
- Yes, Josh Kirby, what is our plan?

1204
01:07:25,976 --> 01:07:26,809
- Plan?

1205
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:31,574
I, uh, I don't really have a plan.

1206
01:07:35,879 --> 01:07:38,129
(growling)

1207
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:49,652
(roaring)

1208
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,926
- Will it charge?

1209
01:08:04,926 --> 01:08:06,176
- I'm not sure.

1210
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,057
Theodore, do you still have that apple?

1211
01:08:12,865 --> 01:08:13,698
Thanks.

1212
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:18,299
(chewing)

1213
01:08:19,814 --> 01:08:22,464
All right, all right,
everybody look around.

1214
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:25,297
Fruits, just anything we can find.

1215
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,977
All right, go.

1216
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:38,286
(footsteps thumping)

1217
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:50,746
- He's following you, Josh.

1218
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:52,663
- Yeah, must be hungry.

1219
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:55,381
That's a break for us.

1220
01:08:58,186 --> 01:09:01,608
- How do we know it
won't eat one of us next?

1221
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:04,166
- Because it only eats
fruits and vegetables.

1222
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:08,249
That's the kind of dinosaur,
er, dragon, this is.

1223
01:09:10,075 --> 01:09:13,826
- How do you know so much about
these creatures, Josh Kirby?

1224
01:09:13,826 --> 01:09:15,983
- I study them in school.

1225
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:17,320
- Really?

1226
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,549
I must hear more about this progressive

1227
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:20,132
land you come from.

1228
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,543
- Yeah, sure, anytime,

1229
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:28,858
- You were right.

1230
01:09:28,858 --> 01:09:30,727
There was another dragon.

1231
01:09:30,727 --> 01:09:33,066
I owe you an apology.

1232
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,480
- Nah, skip it.

1233
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,986
Now maybe now you'll
consider my other idea.

1234
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:38,591
- That we should launch an assault against

1235
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,543
the castle and my brother
with the aid of this creature?

1236
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:44,343
- We could take him, I know we could.

1237
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:45,843
- I'm not so sure.

1238
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:48,971
(chewing)

1239
01:09:49,987 --> 01:09:52,551
- Right, Theodore, will
you lend me your saddle?

1240
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:55,634
- You're not gonna saddle this beast?

1241
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:59,289
- Saddle and ride, your highness.

1242
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,561
(dramatic music)

1243
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,760
(roaring)

1244
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:36,910
- These are for you from
Lord Henry himself, no less.

1245
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:39,493
Ah, well, aren't you a picture?

1246
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:44,648
(chuckles)

1247
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:45,981
Who'd a guessed?

1248
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,532
- What am I doing?

1249
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:04,767
This is what I think of
your flowers, Lord Henry.

1250
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,874
- The wench has fire in her.

1251
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:33,542
I like it.

1252
01:11:39,448 --> 01:11:41,373
- How are the repairs
on the time pod coming?

1253
01:11:41,373 --> 01:11:43,231
- Well, overall quite well considering

1254
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:45,615
the primitive time period we're in.

1255
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:47,600
We should be fully operational by tomorrow

1256
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,621
morning, I hope.

1257
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,907
- Well, I found something
other than a dinosaur.

1258
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,740
- What?

1259
01:11:53,696 --> 01:11:56,172
- An impression in the
ground that looked exactly

1260
01:11:56,172 --> 01:11:58,594
like a Nullifier component.

1261
01:11:58,594 --> 01:12:00,111
- But not the Nullifier itself.

1262
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:01,558
Did you see it?

1263
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:03,055
- No.

1264
01:12:03,055 --> 01:12:06,203
- Oh, well at least we know
it's around here somewhere.

1265
01:12:06,203 --> 01:12:08,534
- Yeah, well I'm really
worried about Azabeth.

1266
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:11,832
- Oh, I share your concern, Joshua.

1267
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:14,267
- Well, now William has another dinosaur.

1268
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:15,990
He's agreed to take a rescue vote at

1269
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,915
the council meeting tonight.

1270
01:12:17,915 --> 01:12:20,246
- If we could infiltrate the castle.

1271
01:12:20,246 --> 01:12:22,939
- We could rescue Azabeth, get Prism back,

1272
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:26,261
and locate the Nullifier
component all at the same time.

1273
01:12:26,261 --> 01:12:27,951
- That's my thought exactly.

1274
01:12:27,951 --> 01:12:29,649
- Put her there.

1275
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,316
- Thank you, Joshua.

1276
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:38,451
- Order, order gentlemen, please.

1277
01:12:47,018 --> 01:12:50,198
- I have asked you all
here tonight to determine

1278
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:52,531
what you, my subjects loyal,

1279
01:12:53,714 --> 01:12:55,548
would have me do about
the tyranny we have all

1280
01:12:55,548 --> 01:12:57,307
been living under this past winter.

1281
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:58,769
- [Woman] Oh, yes.

1282
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:00,265
- We are joined tonight
by the two strangers

1283
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:02,295
in our midst without whom I dare say

1284
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,778
we would not be having
this council meeting.

1285
01:13:04,778 --> 01:13:08,128
Thanks to Josh Kirby, we
now have a dragon of our own

1286
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:12,045
to defend against the
predations of my brother.

1287
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:16,840
But is to defend all that we wish to do?

1288
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:20,454
- No.

1289
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:24,065
- For some time I have
despaired of doing anything

1290
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:25,740
about the terrible conditions
under which we have

1291
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,993
been forced to live,

1292
01:13:26,993 --> 01:13:30,110
but now I feel new hope
that we can overcome

1293
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:33,770
adversity and have life
once again as it was before.

1294
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,855
And so I ask you, my loyal friends,

1295
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:39,366
are you with me in a
push against the castle

1296
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:41,437
and Henry of Dearborn?

1297
01:13:41,437 --> 01:13:44,020
If so, let me hear it from you.

1298
01:13:47,781 --> 01:13:51,948
(villagers talking amongst themselves)

1299
01:13:56,882 --> 01:13:59,799
- Lord, I'm just a poor blacksmith,

1300
01:14:04,036 --> 01:14:08,203
but I say what is life under
the yoke of oppression.

1301
01:14:10,898 --> 01:14:15,132
No life at all, if you want
to know the truth of it.

1302
01:14:15,132 --> 01:14:18,715
I say we take back what
was yours and ours.

1303
01:14:21,893 --> 01:14:23,143
I say we fight!

1304
01:14:24,254 --> 01:14:26,904
- Let's show William of
Dearborn how we feel, men.

1305
01:14:26,904 --> 01:14:28,164
Who will fight tomorrow?

1306
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,589
Call it out.

1307
01:14:29,589 --> 01:14:30,451
- I will!

1308
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:31,284
- I will!

1309
01:14:31,284 --> 01:14:32,117
- Yeah!

1310
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:35,200
(villagers shouting)

1311
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:41,067
(triumphant instrumental music)

1312
01:14:55,978 --> 01:14:56,811
- Ah.

1313
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:06,498
(knocking)

1314
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:08,200
Enter.

1315
01:15:11,993 --> 01:15:13,645
- I bring the prisoner, Lord.

1316
01:15:13,645 --> 01:15:16,634
- Not the prisoner, dresser.

1317
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:18,051
The Lady Azabeth.

1318
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,394
- The Lady Azabeth.

1319
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:25,835
- Thank you, dresser.

1320
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:27,085
You can go now.

1321
01:15:28,261 --> 01:15:31,158
I shan't be needing you
anymore this evening.

1322
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:32,991
- [Dresser] Very good.

1323
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:38,445
- The gown suits you, Lady Azabeth.

1324
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,842
- Keep your titles, Baron.

1325
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,236
My name is Azabeth Siege,

1326
01:15:44,236 --> 01:15:46,499
and garments such as this are only meant

1327
01:15:46,499 --> 01:15:48,651
for the pleasure of the male.

1328
01:15:48,651 --> 01:15:50,855
As yet another form of
his sexual oppression

1329
01:15:50,855 --> 01:15:53,022
against the female gender.

1330
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:57,598
- What is this sexual oppression?

1331
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:01,412
I've not heard of it.

1332
01:16:01,412 --> 01:16:05,579
- For one so ignorant, you
practice it well enough.

1333
01:16:06,573 --> 01:16:07,406
- What?

1334
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:09,147
- Nothing.

1335
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,314
May I eat now?

1336
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:12,925
- Of course.

1337
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:14,475
You're hungry.

1338
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:15,932
The bill of fare in my dungeon leaves

1339
01:16:15,932 --> 01:16:17,636
much to be desired.

1340
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:18,969
So they tell me.

1341
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:21,387
Try the wine.

1342
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:23,634
From the finest cellar in all the region.

1343
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:24,467
(laughing)

1344
01:16:24,467 --> 01:16:27,550
- Your brother's cellar, so they say.

1345
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:29,970
- Do they?

1346
01:16:32,122 --> 01:16:33,639
Well, they're wrong.

1347
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:36,806
My wine, my cellar, and now my vinery.

1348
01:16:40,718 --> 01:16:44,218
And a Baron, you know, needs its baroness.

1349
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:53,567
- Then it is good you have Lady Jennifer.

1350
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,041
- Yes.

1351
01:16:58,355 --> 01:17:01,123
Let's be frank with one another, shall we?

1352
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:04,040
I find you very beautiful, Azabeth.

1353
01:17:05,571 --> 01:17:07,654
- Thank you for the meal.

1354
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:09,358
Goodnight.

1355
01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:14,993
- [Henry] Where do you think you're going?

1356
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,910
- Back to my room, I...

1357
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,342
Back to the dungeon.

1358
01:17:22,665 --> 01:17:24,748
- A distinct possibility,

1359
01:17:26,294 --> 01:17:29,627
unless you begin to show some gratitude.

1360
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,459
- I already thanked you for the meal.

1361
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:34,983
What more could you possibly want?

1362
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,157
- Don't toy with me, wench.

1363
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:38,823
You know what I want.

1364
01:17:38,823 --> 01:17:41,990
- Why, Baron, whatever could you mean?

1365
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:48,426
Is that gratitude enough for you?

1366
01:17:52,499 --> 01:17:53,332
- Guards!

1367
01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:56,245
Guards! Guards!

1368
01:18:00,496 --> 01:18:02,663
The courtyard, you idiots.

1369
01:18:03,734 --> 01:18:06,484
(dramatic music)

1370
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,615
(screaming)

1371
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:46,233
(kick smacking)

1372
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:51,000
(swords clanking)

1373
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,173
(screaming)

1374
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:58,781
- Return her to the dungeon.

1375
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:02,672
Wake the royal executioner.

1376
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,009
She dies on the chopping block

1377
01:19:04,009 --> 01:19:05,259
in the morning.

1378
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:10,359
(metal clanging)

1379
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,372
- What's all the commotion?

1380
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,127
- Young Josh Kirby has
found another dragon

1381
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:23,145
after all, Father.

1382
01:19:23,145 --> 01:19:24,510
Come and see.

1383
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,510
- [Blacksmith] Charlie, I like this.

1384
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:32,594
(roaring)

1385
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:50,451
(dramatic music)

1386
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:55,842
- [Narrator] On the next chapter of

1387
01:19:55,842 --> 01:19:57,925
Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

1388
01:20:00,218 --> 01:20:02,528
- I bring a message from Azabeth Siege.

1389
01:20:02,528 --> 01:20:03,682
- [Josh] Where is she?

1390
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:05,690
- She's being held in
Lord Henry's dungeon.

1391
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,573
Henry has ordered her execution at dawn.

1392
01:20:07,573 --> 01:20:10,592
- [Henry] Let the execution begin.

1393
01:20:10,592 --> 01:20:12,104
- Just tell her we'll be there,

1394
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:14,179
and tell her not to worry.

1395
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:17,512
- Let's not keep the lady waiting, gent.

1396
01:20:18,492 --> 01:20:19,980
- Attack!

1397
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,313
(screaming)

1398
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:27,336
(swords clanging)

1399
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,047
(roaring)

1400
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:36,739
- Josh Kirby.

1401
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:39,116
- Is the baron's alchemist a tall, dark,

1402
01:20:39,116 --> 01:20:41,881
brooding man with a little creature

1403
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:43,782
that follows him wherever he goes?

1404
01:20:43,782 --> 01:20:47,914
- Yes, the royal alchemist
Zoetrope is such a man.

1405
01:20:47,914 --> 01:20:50,514
- [Dr. Zoetrope] The Nullifier
component must be in here.

1406
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:52,647
You're no match for me, Josh Kirby.

1407
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,397
Put that weapon down.

1408
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,094
- Ah!

1409
01:20:57,094 --> 01:21:00,011
- [Irwin 1138] Next stop, 70379 AD.

1410
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,584
(screaming)

1411
01:21:05,584 --> 01:21:07,061
- Well, what was that thing?

1412
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:08,995
I thought we were still on earth.

1413
01:21:08,995 --> 01:21:11,671
- We are still on earth, Josh,

1414
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:13,416
but the earth of the far future.

1415
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:14,499
- [All] Woah!

1416
01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:20,216
- Irwin, look!

1417
01:21:20,216 --> 01:21:21,746
- Incredible.

1418
01:21:21,746 --> 01:21:25,913
The child has a collection
of time-displaced humans.

1419
01:21:26,954 --> 01:21:31,134
- He's forcing us to
fight for his amusement.

1420
01:21:31,134 --> 01:21:32,051
- En garde!

1421
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:36,128
(swords clanging)

1422
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:41,463
- Come on, you big bully.

1423
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,177
Catch me if you can.

1424
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:44,960
- Listen to me, boy.

1425
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,346
There are forces at work here
which you cannot understand.

1426
01:21:47,346 --> 01:21:48,614
- No, I'll never help you.

1427
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:52,462
- Then you've sealed your
own doom, Josh Kirby.

1428
01:21:52,462 --> 01:21:56,122
(electric static)

1429
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:58,988
(train horn blowing)

1430
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:02,062
- In other words, we're up
a creek without a paddle.

1431
01:22:02,062 --> 01:22:05,729
(upbeat instrumental music)

1432
01:25:57,067 --> 01:25:59,900
(MultiCom Jingle)
