00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,244
...Come on, Jake.
...Slow down!

...Hurry up, Jake!
...Melanie!

5
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,792
I gotta get home.
My mom's gonna kill me.

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,377
Wow, did you see that?

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,047
1,001... 1,002...

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,508
...Well, answer the question!
...No!

9
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,427
No, you won't answer,
or no, you won't marry me?

10
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,221
Jake Perry,
I'm 10 years old.

11
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,056
I got too much to live for.

12
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,100
...[Lightning crashes]
...Ahh!

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,396
Not that way, you dolt!
Come on!

14
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,444
...Wow!
...Cool!

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,488
It's hot.
Don't touch it.

16
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,448
We'll be safe here.

17
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,783
Says who?

18
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,076
Everybody.

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,248
Lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,377
Why would you want to
marry me for anyhow?

21
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,755
So I can kiss you
any time I want.

22

Woman:
I need more coffee, guys.

25
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,335
I'm gonna switch...
It's a warning!

26
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,629
Oh, my God.

27
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,967
...Hey.
...Hi.

28
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,054
You know,
that accent of yours

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,680
is a whole lot thicker
when you're dreaming.

30
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,474
...[Laughter]
...[Sighs]

31
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,476
All right, how come
y'all let me sleep?

32
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,311
Oh, calm down.
It was 5 minutes.

33
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,146
What did I say?

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,690
We're all getting big, fat
raises when you become somebody.

35
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,192
[Light laughter]

36
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,986
Oh, did they kill
Badgley Mishka!

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,155
Okay, laugh now, but
tomorrow it could be us.

38
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,033
Not us... you.
I just make the coffee.

39
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,785
Thank you.

40
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,043

like I'm fallin' #

[Breathes deeply]
Andrew!

59
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,789
There's a rose for every moment
I thought of you last night.

60
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,208
God, you must be exhausted.

61
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,752
Listen, knock 'em dead.
I'll see you at the show.

62

...It's gonna be great.

63

I love you.

# Weekend come...
it's your song, song, song #

69
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,436
Okay, people,
we are officially late!

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,771
Pan: Melanie!

71
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,813
Yes?!

72
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,149
This top is supposed
to be neon aubergine,

73
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,276
but it's all wrong!
It's all wrong!

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,237
Okay, don't panic.
That's my job.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,197
Um... okay.
Put her on after Anoke.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,950
The third light cue is yellow.
She'll look eggplant.

77
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,328
Pan, uh, the reason it's all
wrong is it's on backwards.

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,330
[Effeminately] Ooh,
Miss Vixen, I'm scared of you.

79
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,458
Frederick, what are you doing
here? You're the competition.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,461
Competition? Please! Our
design's for plumes and pearls,

81
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,214
and nothing is going to come
between me and my protege.

82
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,466
And this is, after all,
all about me.

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,845
Oh, I love this. Stella
McCartney's gonna kill herself.

84
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,764
Then why do I feel like
I'm in Times Square buck naked?

85
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,724
Baby doll, you're
gonna be just fine.

86
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,477
Seven years ago, you were this
debutante off the plantation,

87
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,771
and now you're
my steel magnolia...

88
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,147
with her very own show.

89
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,608
Okay, get out of here
before you make me cry.

90
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,944
Bonne chance!

91
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,410
Big smile!
Great! Thank you!

# The waves keep on crashin'
on me for some reason #

93
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,373
Good to see you.

94
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,208
Secretary Hennings,

95
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,960
do you have a moment
for a few questions?

96
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,296
Andrew, are you excited
about the show?

97
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,381
Uh, of course,
I'm very excited.

98
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,508
Did you get to
see the models?

99
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,926
The models? Why, uh...

100
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,053
Please tell me
he has a flaw somewhere.

101
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,515
He asked me to go to
Ireland for Christmas.

102
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,602
He's gonna ask you
a lot more than that.

103
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,729
...You think so?
...Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,272
...Hey, let's go!
...Let's do this!

105
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,066
All right, we gotta go.
Places, everyone!

106
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,735
...Come on, let's go, line up.
...Have a good show.

107
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,738
Okay, no smiles,
no smiles, just smirks!

108
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,407
# Keep on dancin' #

109
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,997
# You hold me like you should,
so I'm gonna keep on dancin' #

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,834
# Keep on dancin' #

111
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:23,884
Ohh!

112
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,719
Honey!

113
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,554
...[Shrieks]
...Oh, congratulations.

114
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,390
You're amazing.
Those flowers were insane.

115
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,267
Oh, well, I just want
this day to be perfect.

116
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,936
[Sighs] Oh, God, honey,
what if they hate me?

117
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,063
Oh, they're critics, Mel.
They hate themselves.

118
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,397
That's easy for you to say.

119
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,107
I wasn't born with
that thick Hennings skin.

120
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,069
No, you weren't, and that
is what I love about you.

121
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,529
Mmm.

122
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,531
Ah, honey, I'm sorry, I got
a meeting in the Bronx.

123
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,033
But you go and enjoy, and
I'll see you later. Okay?

124
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,702
Oh, and, hey, we've got that
thing tonight at Lincoln Center.

125
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,371
What thing?

126
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,997
Fund-raiser thing.

127
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,417
[Sighs] Right, the thing...
with your mother.

128
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,794
That's tonight.

129
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,087
I'm afraid so.

130
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,129
Okay.

131
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,632
I am so proud of you.

132
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,093
Thank you.

133
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,219
...Okay?
...I love you.

134
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,929
I love you, too.
Congratulations.

135
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,434
[Horn honks]

136
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,908
His meeting's running
a little late.

137
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,661
He told me to take you inside
so you wouldn't have to wait.

138
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,996
Where are we?

139
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,166
[Horn honks]

140
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,252
...I'm so tired, Jimmy.
...Yeah.

141
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,670
I've just had it.

142
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,132
Well... he shouldn't be
too long.

143
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,010
Miss Carmichael,
won't you come in?

144
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,938
So... have you made a decision?

145
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,190
A-bout what?

146
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,524
Ireland.

147
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,653
Ireland, honey, [Scoffs]
that's four months from now.

148
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,780
I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

149
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,991
I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

150
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,534
For Christmas?

151
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:16,163
Andrew, are you on
some sort of medication?

152
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,833
What's going on?
Where are we?

153
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,397
[Gasps] Oh, my God.

154
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,692
O-Oh, my God.

155
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,075
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,536
Melanie Carmichael...

157
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,704
will you marry me?

158
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,916
Are you sure?

159
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,585
I mean, a-a-are
you really sure?

160
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,587
Because if you're not sure, we
could just go back to the car.

161
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,256
...Mel, Mel, Mel, Mel...
...It's only been 8 months.

162
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,132
You know I never do
anything rash.

163
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,176
And I usually never
ask a question

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,928
I don't already know
the answer to,

165
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,599
so... at the risk of
being rejected twice,

166
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,601
I'm gonna ask you again.

167
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,440
Will you marry me?

168
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,444
Yes!

169
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,446
Yes! Yes!

170
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,447
[Both laugh]

171
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,156
Yes!

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,246
Pick one.

173
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,805
Mayor, just one shot!
One shot!

174
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,348
Can you comment on
the Watson bill?

175
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,850
Over here, Mayor, please!
Over here!

176
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,477
Thank you.
Where is he?

177
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,770
He's running late.

178
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,522
No doubt thanks to
that Carbuncle girl.

179
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,982
Carmichael...
designer, Southern.

180
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,233
Right, whatever.

181
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,943
Right here, Mayor!

182
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,528
...Please, Mayor!
...Miss Mayor, over here!

183
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,988
Your Honor,
how do you answer those

184
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,948
who are opposed to
the street-improvement project

185
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,575
you put before
the city council today?

186
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,494
I suggest they take a drive on
some of the streets in Brooklyn.

187
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,456
Maybe they'll disappear
into a pothole.

188
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,083
Your son's relationship
with Melanie Carmichael...

189
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,669
sources say they're engaged.
Do you have a comment?

190
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,632
Trust me, if my son were
engaged, I'd have a comment.

191
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,677
I thought you were tired.

192
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,430
Jimmy, can you excuse us
for a second?

193
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,598
[Chuckles]

194
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,268
I've been planning
this for weeks.

195
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,355
I knew your show would be great,
and tonight is perfect.

196
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,399
Oh, God, I can't wait to see
the look on my mother's face.

197
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,485
Come on,
let's call your parents.

198
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,694
No!

199
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,071
l-I mean...
[Chuckles nervously]

200
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,948
n-not right this second.

201
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,325
What I mean is, uh...

202
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,993
Honey, would you
mind terribly

203
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,538
if we just kept this to
ourselves for a few days?

204
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,832
Mel, it's gonna come out
sooner or later.

205
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,918
No, l-I know,
I know, but, um,

206
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,420
it's just, I haven't seen
my folks in about 7 years,

207
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:14,883
and I just feel like I should
probably tell them in person.

208
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,218
Of course.

209
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,890
And, um... l-I think
I should do it alone.

210
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,685
Mel, I'm gonna have to
meet them eventually.

211
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,396
l-I know, I know, and
they will love you...

212
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,564
eventually.

213
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,068
Is it because
I'm a Yankee?

214
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,113
Well, that...
and a Democrat.

215
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,703
Okay... mum's the word.

216
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,163
...No one will know.
...Thank you.

217
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,837
Secretary Hennings,
will you comment...

218
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
Secretary Hennings...

219
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,382
Okay. [Laughs]

220
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,800
Hello.

221
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,097
Why haven't you told your
mother you're engaged?

222
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,724
Have you thought
about children?

223
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,768
I'm sorry we're late.

224
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,563
That shade of lipstick does
nothing for you. What kept you?

225
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,106
Oh, it's none of your business.

226
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,233
Ah, you know I hate surprises.
What's going on?

227
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,777
Oh, Tom, always a pleasure.
Good to see you.

228
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,571
...Melanie, darling.
...Hi, Your Honor.

229
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,906
So good to see you.

230
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,533
Look at you... always
the belle of the ball.

231
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,577
I hear very good things
about your new line.

232
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,329
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

233
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,206
Always a pleasure.

234
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,252
Um...

235
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,087
...Andrew?
...Yes?

236
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,422
Seems Melanie is wearing
a skating rink

237
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,007
on a very important finger.

238
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,052
Um, Your Honor, I'd
really like to keep it...

239
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,554
Oh, my God,
you're engaged?!

240
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,932
[Indistinct shouting]

241
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,225
Quiet.

242
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,117
Tabatha: Bloody hell, Mel,
I'm your first New York friend,

243
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,787
and I have to read about it
with 12 million other people!

244
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,830
Sorry, honey,
she just grabbed my hand.

245
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,165
What was I supposed to do?

246
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,667
I know...
we read all about it.

247
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,460
...So, did you cry?
...Wouldn't you?

248
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,963
One man for the rest of my life?
I'd bawl my bloody eyes out.

249
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,507
So why don't you meet us?
We're just around the corner.

250
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,009
[Sighs] Can't.

251
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,345
I'm in Alabama.

252
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh... my God.

253
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,935
Yeah.

254
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,742
[Birds chirping]

255
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,412
[Barks]

256
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,917
[Barks]

257
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:42,132
[Barking slowly]

258
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,017
Aw, he's loud,
but he don't bite.

259
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
Come on, shut up, hound!

260
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,686
Lie down.

261
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,939
Go on, stay.

262
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,274
Now, how can I help you?

263
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,444
Well, for starters, you can get
your stubborn ass down here

264
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,946
and give me a divorce.

265
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,951
...[Thud]
...[Groans]

266
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,702
[Sighs] Come on,
Jake, I mean it.

267
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,120
The joke's over.

268
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,081
Let's just finish this.
I've got a plane to catch.

269
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,378
You're shittin' me, right?

270
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,964
You know, I've never actually
understood that expression,

271
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,966
but, no,
I'm not "shitting" you.

272
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,427
Look, it's even got
these idiot-proof tabs

273
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,595
to make it easy.

274
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,848
There's one copy for me,
one copy for you,

275
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,641
and one copy
for the lawyers.

276
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,769
[Exhales sharply]

277
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,273
What? Speak!

278
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,274
[Slow barking resumes]

279
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,944
You show up here
after 7 years

280
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,447
without so much as a "Hey,
there, Jake, remember me...

281
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,658
your wife?"

282
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,786
Or a "Hi, honey.
Lookin' good.

283
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,830
How's the family?"

284
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,748
You expect me to tell you
you look good?

285
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,168
Did they run out of soap down at
the Piggly Wiggly since I left?

286
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,294
[Slow barking continues]

287
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,088
They laugh at that up north
or wherever it is you been?

288
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,798
You knew where I was.

289
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,176
And don't even pretend you spent
all this time missing me.

290
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,011
Oh, I missed you,
all right.

291
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,763
But at this range,
my aim is bound to improve.

292
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,807
Is that a threat?

293
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,310
I've got a lawyer
who charges $350 an hour.

294
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,146
He billed me every time
you sent these papers back.

295
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,190
Well, I'm glad to see
you finally got the message.

296
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,108
...Shut up, Bear!
...Shut up, Bryant!

297
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,986
[Barks, groans]

298
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,864
What happened to Bear?

299
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,450
He died.

300
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,118
You weren't here.

301
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,954
What are you doing?!

302
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,414
Leavin'. You done it.

303
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,833
You should recognize
the gesture.

304
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,170
Could we just try to keep this
as civilized as possible?

305
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,797
Please sign these papers
so I can go home.

306
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,508
What do you know from home?

307
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,552
Hell, I bet your folks don't
even know you're in town.

308
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,179
That's my business.

309
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,390
Honey, those people are
the only family you got.

310
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,808
Don't you "honey" me,
honey!

311
00:16:56,892 --> 00:17:00,020
Get your butt back in that car,
you drive over and see 'em,

312
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,689
and then maybe we'll talk.

313

[Screen door slams]

314
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,777
Jake! You dumb, stubborn,
redneck hick!

315
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,112
The only reason you
won't sign these papers

316
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,405
is 'cause I want you to!

317
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,533
Wrong! The only reason
I ain't signin'

318
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,703
is 'cause you've turned into
some hoity-toity Yankee bitch,

319
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:20,332
and I'd like nothin' better
right now than to piss you off!

Unh!

What are you doin' with
Mose Plydell's plane anyhow?!

323
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,225
That's my business!

324
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,394
...Fine!
...Fine!

[Sighs]

330
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,350
Next time you lock somebody out,

331
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,437
make sure they don't know
where the spare key's hidden.

332
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:27,441
Well, see, that's the thing
about Hide-A-Keys...

333
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,445
it'd be nice if your wife
told you where it was!

334
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,614
I'm not your wife, Jake.

335
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,533
I'm just the first girl

336
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,619
that climbed
in the back of your truck.

337
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,291
But you're right...
I have changed.

338
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,919
I don't even know
that girl anymore.

00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,879
Why would my son
do this to me?

349
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,923
Maybe he, um, loves her.

350
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,049
Oh, please!

351
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,051
This is classic rebound.

352
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,720
He's still wounded from...
who was his last girlfriend?

353
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,515
Whitney Truesdale,
lawyer, San Francisco.

354
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,934
Yeah, well, there was
a match made in Heaven...

355
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:48,272
society, political family,
California...

356
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,691
all those electoral votes.

357
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,026
Get Andrew on the phone.

358
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,572
Since we have a small window
for the Secretary of Housing,

359
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,157
please hold your questions
until after the presentation.

360
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,701
Gentlemen.

361
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,411
Did you see the look
on my mom's face?

362
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,079
I thought her head
was going to explode.

363
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,455
Yeah, what did she say?

364
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,416
That I should date women
like Melanie, not marry them.

365
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,043
...That's harsh.
...That's Mom.

366
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,628
...Thank you.
...Thanks a lot.

367
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,463
We hope to have
the Bronx Children's Hospital

368
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,424
...open by fall 2003.
...[Cellphone ringing]

369
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,843
Oh, speak of the devil.
Hello?

370
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,596
So, have you two lovebirds
set a date?

371
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,139
I'm pleading the Fifth.

372
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,433
Okay, fine, just try to keep
your secrets. I dare you.

373
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,435
Oh, at least you sound like
you're in a better mood.

374
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,312
My approval rating
went up 2 points.

375
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,939
It seems the public likes
being reminded I am a mother.

376
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,441
God, always running for office.

377
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,736
I'm only thinking of you.
Say, um...

378
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,405
do you happen to have
the Carmichaels' number

379
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,741
down there in Greenville?

380
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,577
I thought perhaps
I should introduce myself.

381
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,746
I would like to meet them first,
if you don't mind.

382
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,582
You do realize the press
is going to be all over this.

383
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,417
Happy couples don't sell.

384
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:54,004
So if there are any skeletons
in her closet, Andrew,

385
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,964
we need to know about them.

386
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,051
[Indistinct talking
on police radio]

387
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,137
You make clothes, right?

388
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,973
I design them.
There's a big difference.

389
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,476
Did you design anything
with stripes?

390
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,437
...[Knock on door]
...You called the sheriff?!

391
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:14,107
You know that old bastard
hates me!

392
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,734
For good reason!

393
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:20,239
Well, hell's bells, if
it ain't Felony Melanie.

394
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,407
Wade!

395
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,620
Hot damn, girl,
do we miss you around here!

396
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,122
Hey, I think I saw poor, old
Fuzz just the other day.

397
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,832
Oh, God,
you had to bring that up.

398
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,626
I can't believe
you're the sheriff!

399
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,670
Yep, I get to frisk pretty
little things like you all day

400
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,255
and get paid for it.

401
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,173
Wade, can you try and be
a little more professional?

402
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,758
We got us a crime suspect here.

403
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,928
Now, Melanie, you can't just go
breaking into people's houses.

404
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,014
I didn't break in, Wade.
I used a key...

405
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,266
my key.

406
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,019
Well, it still ain't
your house, darlin'.

407
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,521
I'm gonna have to
escort you out.

408
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,356
Use the cuffs, Wade, please?

409
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,609
If you get him to sign these,
I'll let you run me out of town.

410
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,819
Now, that's none
of your concern.

411
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,445
Well, what do we got here?

412
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,285
...A bill of divorcement?
...Mm-hmm.

413
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,370
Hell, boy, I thought you said
you took care of this.

414
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,705
And I thought I had.

415
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,164
Obviously not.

416
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,500
Well, if you two are still
married, it's her house, too.

417
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,170
This here ain't nothin'
but a domestic dispute.

418
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,005
He didn't hit you, did he?

419
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,049
If he took a swing at you,
I'll take him in right now.

420
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,177
We take that stuff
pretty serious nowadays.

421
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,559
No, Wade,
Jake's never hit me.

422
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,853
You know what?

423
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,230
I don't have a single
childhood memory

424
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,357
that doesn't have
you two in it.

425
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,402
And that includes the night
I lit my ass on fire. Remember?

426
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,361
Wade...

427
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:44,323
Memory Lane is closed.

428
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,035
Ah, boy, you two got a whole lot
of catchin' up to do...

429
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,995
so I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

430
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,830
Man, I set you up with
your wife. You owe me one!

431
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,207
Why won't you just
sign the papers?!

432
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,708
Hey, there is
nothin' I can do.

433
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,921
The law is the law,
and she has done nothin' wrong.

434
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,507
I suppose shoplifting steaks
at Winn-Dixie's okay.

435
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,218
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

436
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,886
I took 'em back,
and you know it!

437
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,264
You remember that vandalism out
at the stockyard? Totally her!

438
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,558
Like I could tip a cow
by myself.

439
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,893
Hmm.

440
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,688
Wade... isn't there
some outstanding warrant

441
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,441
for whoever dumped your mama's
tractor in the fishpond?

442
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:20,526
[Gasps]

443
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,070
[Sighs deeply]

444
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,575
We only have 10 of these, and
it's gonna be gone for good.

445
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,786
So if you are loving
this monster...

446
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,580
...[Snoring]
...[Telephone rings]

447
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,249
We have eight only?

448
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,501
If I knew how to say that in
Italian, I would, but I don't.

449
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,211
Um, if you love this...

450
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:42,422
9: 15? Honestly.

451
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,424
Who could be callin'
at this hour?

452
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,760
Hello?

453
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,470
Hel-lo?

454
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,597
Melanie: Hey, Mama.

455
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,808
Melanie? Is that you?

456
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,852
Oh, it's so late.
Are you all right?

457
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,896
I, uh... um...

458
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,898
I just thought
I'd surprise you.

459
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,402
Well, this certainly is a fine
surprise, hearing from you...

460
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,988
you know,
being such a busy girl and all.

461
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,739
Of course, I call people

462
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,909
while I'm doin' the dishes
or shellin' peas.

463
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,996
Oprah calls it
"multitasking."

464
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,748
Mama, the call
isn't the surprise.

465
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,916
l-I'm in town.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,294
Oh, Lord, love a duck!
Ha!

467
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,630
Oh, my baby girl
has finally come home.

468
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,340
Earl, she's in town.

469
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,217
Earl: You gonna repeat
everything she says?

470
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,469
...If you are, get off my chair.
...Mama...

471
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,221
I'm just sittin' here, is all.

472
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,639
What happened to the sound?

473
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,225
I turned it down
so I could hear the phone ring.

474
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,477
...Mama!
...What, are you a clairvoyant?

475
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,605
It was so loud,
I couldn't hear myself think.

476
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,941
...Mama...
...They could have heard it
at Joe and Lurlynn's house.

477
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,776
...Hello?
...I only get 3 minutes.

478
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,988
Oh, honey, you didn't need
to call, then. Just come on by.

479
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,157
Uh... well, that's the thing.

480
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,619
I was sorta hoping
Daddy could come get me.

481
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,541
Earl: So, what put you
in jail this time?

482
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,544
Melanie: Jake and
his big, fat mouth.

483
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,672
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

484
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,799
Yeah, kinda like that
weddin' I paid for, huh?

485
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,135
I would hardly call that
a wedding.

486
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,512
Boy was nervous.

487
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,806
He was still drunk
from the night before.

488
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,308
Can you blame him?

489
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,227
Yes, I can!

490
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,479
I went to the reception
by myself with puke

491
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,565
all down my dress while he slept
it off in the Travelodge,

492
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,526
and you're still
siding with that...

493
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,611
I'm not sidin' with anybody.

494
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,779
...[Sighs]
...[Sighs]

495
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,030
The boy's changed, is all.

496
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,282
Can we just
not talk about Jake, okay?

497
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,035
l-I know he's the son you never
had, but I'm your only daughter,

498
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,205
and maybe you want to know
what's new with me.

499
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,416
[Sighs] Okay, shoot.

500
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,128
I met somebody...

501
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,507
and he's quite a catch.

502
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,844
H-He's really a great guy.

503
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,055
And I'm happy... really.

504
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,061
Come to Mama, sugar!

505
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,523
Hey, Mama.

506
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:08,610
Oh, good land of the livin',
you are skin and bones.

507
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,698
Well, don't I get a smile?

508
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,867
I know you got one
in there somewhere.

509
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,744
Come on, come on, let's not
let all the bought air out.

510
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,086
Well, are you hungry, sweetie?

511
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,463
Do you want me to reheat you
some chicken-fried steak?

512
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,048
Oh, no, Mama, I'm fine.

513
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,425
Sweetie, you look tired.

514
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,468
Are you tired?
Oh, you know what?

515
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,263
Maybe it's the way
you're wearing your hair now.

516
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,141
[Sighs]

00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,939
Where is the Hide-A-Key?!

688
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:28,235
I had the sweetest chat with
Wade's mama about her tractor.

689
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,406
Nice to see you got
your accent back.

690
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,951
Oh, I stumbled across
a few things today.

691
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,119
Holy shit!

692
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,288
What happened to the stove?!

693
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:42,207
Oh, and where are
them little magnets

694
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,710
I had over here, huh?!

695
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,216
What the hell is this...
chick food?

696
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,928
Light beer... less calories.

697
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,513
I tried to pick out
a new bed,

698
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,974
but have you been to
the Sit 'n Sleep lately?

699
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:02,269
Yuck. I'll just have to order
something from New York.

700
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,730
Whatever blows
your dress up, darlin'.

701
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,274
You go right ahead
and spend your money.

702
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,901
Oh, but, darlin'...

703
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,111
I thought you said we should
think of it as...

704
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,571
our money.

705
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,577
Just a guess,

706
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,996
but I'm thinking the words
"joint checking"

707
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,207
are flashing in your head
right now.

708
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:32,633
How much did you take?

709
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,468
All of it.

710
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:35,969
Son of a bitch!

711
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,931
You want a wife,
you got a wife.

712
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,099
And what are you doing
with all that cash?

713
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,143
Why don't you invest it?
Don't you know anything?!

714
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,978
I know if you don't get out
of this house right now...

715
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,481
Sign the papers, and
I'll give it all back.

716
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:48,482
...Fine!
...Fine!

717
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,067
Give me the pen.

718
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,154
Hold on. What are you doing
with all that cash saved up?

719
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,989
And since when did you
quit the tire factory?

720
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,033
You're not doing anything
illegal, are you, Jake?!

721
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,327
Maybe I am. So what?

722
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,912
I don't ask you about
your boyfriend,

723
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,665
you keep your nose
out of my life... deal?

724
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,170
Who told you?

725
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:14,341
Honey, just 'cause I talk slow
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

726
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,809
Look, Jake...

727
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:27,855
Nobody finds their soul mate
when they're 10 years old.

728
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:33,735
Yeah, I guess.

729
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:36,280
I mean, where's
the fun in that, right?

730
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:53,213
I can't believe you kept
this thing all these years.

731
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,883
Mm-hmm.

732
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,094
Most people don't know that
lightning does that to sand.

733
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:02,890
Oh, hey, Mel,
you know what?

734
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,099
[Chuckles]

735
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,310
I just remembered
I got myself a hot date.

736
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,979
You don't mind if I have
my lawyer take a look at these.

737
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,105
What?!

738
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,942
Hell, I'm just a
simple country boy.

739
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:17,112
There's words in there
I can't even pronounce.

740
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,781
You might be takin' me to
the cleaners for all I know.

741
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,575
The cleaners? You?

742
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,203
Say, what did this set
you back, anyhow?

743
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,621
More than you
make in a month.

744
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,706
Just sign the damn papers!

745
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,001
Nah...

746
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,462
But...
thanks for stoppin' by.

747
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,091
Oh! God.

748
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:47,351
# Bright lights, big city #

[Cellphone rings]

752
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,491
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

753
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,618
Andrew:
Are you sitting down?

754
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,078
Melanie: Why? Bad news?

755
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,872
Just picked up the "New York"
magazine, and I quote,

756
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,499
"That cool breath
of fresh air

757
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,626

758
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,463
"was the soon-to-be household
name of Melanie Carmichael.

759
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,967
Fashion insiders have labeled
her 'the next big one."'

760
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,218
[Gasps]

761
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,680
Oh, my God,
"the next big one"?

762
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,517
Oh, God, honey, I needed that
almost as much as I need you.

763
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,019
What is that noise?

764
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,814
[Sighs]
The sound of my past.

765
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:34,982
Have fun.

766
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,817
[Giggles] Okay, bye.

Batten down the hatches,

773
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,169
Trouble done just walked
back into my life,

774
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,005
disguised as my favorite
daughter-in-law!

775
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:02,509
Honey, drive that pretty face
over here and give me a hug! Oh!

776
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,970
Soon-to-be
ex-daughter-in-law.

777
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,723
Ooh, whoo!
Who's the lucky guy?

778
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,308
His name is Andrew.

779
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:10,809
He's in politics.

780
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,978
Well, you got my vote.

781
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,397
Good to see you,
baby girl.

782
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,691
Hey, you give this lady
whatever she wants.

783
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,068
...I'll catch up with you later.
...All right.

784
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:27,492
I'll have a Gray Goose martini,
two olives, dirty. Thanks.

785
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,578
# Well... #

786
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,372
Oh... my... God!

787
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,584
Melanie?!

00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,919
Lurlynn?

789
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,922
Yes! Oh, my God!

790
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,757
L-Look at you,
all fancy.

791
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,885
You look like you just
stepped out of a magazine.

792
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,931
Oh, well, thank you.
Um, look at you.

793
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,599
You have a baby...

794
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,100
in a bar.

795
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,936
Hell, I got three
more at home.

796
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,939
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

797
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,399
...[Baby gurgles]
...Right.

798
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,736
I almost bought that exact same
top the other day.

799
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,447
But Clinton'd kill me
if I spent 30 bucks

800
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,908
on a sweater thing.

801
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,870
Ah, that Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doin'.

802
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,747
Actually, it's mine.

803
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,291
Bergdorf's just picked it up.

804
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,463
I design clothes now.

805
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,424
Oh, mmm, now that
you mention it,

806
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:27,761
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I heard that. [Chuckles]

807
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,888
...[Cheers and applause]
...So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

808
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,228
Mind if I join you?

809
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,314
Actually, we do.

810
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,275
You must be Jake's hot date.

811
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,776
I'm Starr.

812
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,529
Hi, I'm Melanie, Jake's
snotty Yankee-bitch wife,

813
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,072
whom he refuses to divorce,

814
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,408
even though
I'm engaged to another man.

815
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,785
Hot dog, Jake, look at
the size of that thing.

816
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,245
...Honey?
...Huh?

817
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,998
Why don't you get us
a couple drinks, all right?

818
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,624
Okay. [Giggles]

819
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,421
Is that a martini?

820
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:07,801
Not "me and her" us.
"You and l" us.

821
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,188
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

822
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,522
Is that what you want...

823
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:23,192
to be humiliated in front
of all of your friends?

824
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:26,278
Oh, come on, Mel,
we were your friends, too.

825
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,324
Well, looky, looky there!

826
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,825
Well, well, well,

827
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,703
if it isn't the two
groomsmen of the apocalypse.

828
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,166
...Hey, Eldon!
...Yep?

829
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,126
Are you hungry?!

830
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,753
Starved!

831
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,838
No, no, no!
No, don't you dare!

832
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,840
I could use a Melanie
sandwich!

833
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,718
Just seems like old times,
doesn't it?

834
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:50,844
Get off me!

835
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,179
Ugh!

836
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,474
No, not like old times,
all right?

837
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,351
Times have changed.

838
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:00,270
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,

839
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,731
and no more Melanie
corn dog, all right?

840
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,858
...Sure... sorry.
...Just playin' with you.

841
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,151
Come on, guys,
just grab a stick.

842
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,361
Let's play some pool,
all right?

843
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,487
And if you can't find a cue,

844
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,531
just pull the one
shoved up her ass.

845
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,658
[Laughter,
cheers and applause]

846
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:21,500
Eldon, you're still wearing
that same old stupid hat.

847
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,877
Well, I... just about
got it broken in.

848
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,171
Now, you sit your
bony ass down there

849
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,423
and watch and see me
teach Jake here

850
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,050
how to lose at pool.

851
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,220
Well, see, that's the thing.

852
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,848
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl...

853
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,516
am I, Jake?

854
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,237
Woman: Come on, now,
Bobby Ray, you got it.

855
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,281
[Drunkenly] Bobby Ray...

856
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,783
...[Laughs]
...[Laughs, snorts]

857
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:58,704
Don't blow this one,
okay?

858
00:42:58,787 --> 00:42:59,955
All right, baby?

859
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,957
You can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk,

860
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,543

are you going to divorce
this girl or what?

864
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,555
Well, she waited 7 years.

865
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,558
A couple more days
won't kill her...

866
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,767
unfortunately.

867
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,061

make a difference.

868
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,521

Hey, hey, let her think
whatever she wants, Clinton.

871
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,238
She made up her mind
about me a long time ago.

872
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:34,948

00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,959
Okay, Jake,
it's you and Mel.

878
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:47,294
Clutch time, man.

879
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,129
It's just like
state playoffs.

880
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,756
We're down by 6,
7 seconds to go.

How could I forget?

885
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,686
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

Why don't you just go
public with that shit?

Oh, come on.

889
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:14,029
It's not like anybody can
keep a secret around here...

891

Now, what did I
ever do to you?

892
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,827
You never did anything
to me, darlin'...

the matter with you?

...What do you mean?
...Oh, she's just unhappy.

897
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:30,921
Well, of course,
I would be, too,

called me "less than mediocre."

go to a gay bar?!

I mean, how do you people live
like this, anyway?

All right, that's it,
that's it. Come on.

915
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,942
Did you know that there's
a great, big world out there?

916
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:37,404
It has absolutely nothin'
to do with chitlins

00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,794
I'm... I'm here
to see Bobby Ray.

1036
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:08,879
[Cannon fires]

1037
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,172
...Oh.
...Yee-haw!

1038
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,633
If he's alive,
he's out back.

1039
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:14,468
Come on.

1040
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:18,805
They're out here somewhere.
Watch your step.

1041
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:26,813
Bobby Ray?

1042
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,899
Bobby Ray: Melanie?!

1043
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,484
Don't move!

1044
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,819
Yee-haw!

1045
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,655
[Cannonball whirring]

1046
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,160
Hot damn!

1047
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:42,829
Hold your fire, sir.
I'll be right back.

1048
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:49,002
We weren't aimin' for ya,

1049
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:51,463
but I doubt I would have
gone to your funeral.

1050
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:57,553
I guess I wouldn't blame you.

1051
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:04,768
Forgotten how beautiful
this place was.

1052
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:08,063
Guess it doesn't take much
to forget a lot of things.

1053
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,440
Bobby Ray,
it's not like that.

1054
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,985
You know what? I'll tell
you what it's not like.

1055
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:16,697
It's not like Jake's the only
one that you run out on.

1056
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,368
I'm so sorry I outed you.

1057
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:25,914
I guess I figured
if I was pointing at you,

1058
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:30,085
then... nobody would
see through me.

1059
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:34,464
Bobby Ray,
I can't find the fuse!

1060
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:42,723
I should go
before he kills himself.

1061
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,482
Bye.

1062
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:05,913
Afternoon.

1063
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:07,581
Can I help you?

1064
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:09,625
Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

1065
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:13,629
Ho-ho, boy,
am I glad to see you.

1066
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,088
I'll tell you, it's, uh...

1067
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:19,259
definitely, uh,
another world down here.

1068
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,928
Uh, did you say
the "Post"?

1069
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:22,471
Yes, I did.
l-I was hoping

1070
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:24,389
to get an interview
with you and your family...

1071
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:27,267
maybe, um, a few pictures
if you don't mind?

1072
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:30,187
No.
I mean, uh, yes, I do...

1073
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,188
mind.

1074
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,481
They're not here.

1075
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,733
Oh... wow.

1076
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:36,818
This is just
as you described it.

1077
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:40,697
It must have been amazing,
huh, growing up here?

1078
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:42,449
Like a fantasy.

1079
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:46,203
Would you mind if I take
a quick look inside?

1080
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,704
Actually,
I'm on my way out.

1081
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:49,623
I'll come back, then.

1082
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:51,542
Uh, uh, okay,
but just a peek.

1083
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,626
[Chuckles]

1084
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,464
This is it...
home sweet home.

1085
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:58,799
Wow!

1086
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,509
How old is this place?

1087
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:01,885
Uh...

1088
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:06,181
it was built by my, uh,
great-great-great-grandfather,

1089
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,808
Charles Carmichael,
in 1853.

1090
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:11,728
Oh, boy, I bet you slid down
this banister a time or two.

1091
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:12,771
Oh.

1092
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:17,025
And over here we have
the, um...

1093
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:19,486
[Maid humming]

1094
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:21,989
...kitchen, but who hasn't
seen one of those?

1095
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,156
Let's start over here.

1096
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,703
[Door knob rattles]

1097
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:29,913
[Humming continues]

1098
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:31,498
[Gasps] Oh.

1099
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,210
[Humming continues]

1100
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,882
[Whispering] Now, this is
my favorite room.

1101
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:44,928
It was part of the, um,
Underground Railroad.

1102
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,431
[Whispering]
Why are we whispering?

1103
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:50,309
The whole place
is haunted...

1104
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:55,647
by ghosts of, um,
the Civil War soldiers.

1105
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:00,402
[Door hinges creak]

1106
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,199
[Creaking]

1107
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,288
Jake! [Muttering]
...buttons.

1108
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,916
No wonder we lost the war.

1109
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,295
Was that one of 'em?

1110
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,215
Melanie?

1111
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,884
What are you doin'
in a closet?

1112
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:26,428
Hi. Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

1113
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,723
Miss Carmichael is just showing
me around the plantation.

1114
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:35,229
Uh, Mr. Lowenstein is writing
a piece on the family,

1115
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,524
you know, since I'm marrying
the mayor's son and all.

1116
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:41,235
I had no idea.
Isn't that something?

1117
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:44,112
Yeah.

1118
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,451
Well, a plantation by any
other name is just a farm.

1119
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:51,870
But it does roll off the tongue
a little sweeter, doesn't it?

1120
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:53,080
Huh.

1121
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:57,167
Well, I do believe Miss Melanie
forgot her manners.

1122
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,087
I'm Bobby Ray...
her cousin.

1123
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,130
[Sighs]

1124
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:03,590
Charmed.

1125
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,137
See, when the Yankees
marched through Alabama,

1126
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,890
they tried to destroy
our metal-formin' capabilities

1127
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:14,601
by placin' barrels of powder
underneath the anvils.

1128
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:16,436
Of course,
all that managed to do

1129
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,647
was blow 'em sky-high
for a few seconds.

1130
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,316
So... in honor
of that act of stupidity,

1131
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,279
we all... we get together to
re-create it for the tourists.

1132
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,830
...[Cannon fires]
...Aah!

1133
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,416
...Yee-haw!
...What the hell was that?!

1134
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:38,458
[Cannonball whirring]

1135
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,378
Hey, Grandpa!
This here's Barry!

1136
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:44,047
He's doin' an article
on Melanie's weddin'!

1137
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:47,134
Never heard of her.

1138
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,352
Thanks!

1139
00:57:57,436 --> 00:58:00,689
[Tires screeching]

1140
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:04,985
Well, aren't you
just a big, fat liar.

1141
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:07,029
Bobby Ray!

1142
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:08,488
Oh, go back to New York.

1143
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:09,823
[Both laugh]

1144
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:17,956
# If fear's
what makes us decide #

1145
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,169
# Our future journey #

1146
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:25,005
# Well, I'm not along
for a life #

1147
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:26,715
# I'm not along for a life #

1148
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:28,967
# 'Cause I'm still yearning #

1149
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:34,932
# l-l-I am falling down #

1150
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,267
# Try and stop me #

1151
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:43,023
# It feels so good
to hit the ground #

1152
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,400
# You can watch me #

1153
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,362
# I fall right on my face #

1154
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:53,158
# It's an uphill human race #

1155
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:58,580
# And l-I am falling down #

1156
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:01,583
Hmm. Hello.

1157
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,086
I'm sorry about what I said.

1158
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:05,462
Really sorry.

1159
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,714
Melanie, forget it.

1160
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,092
Boy:
She was not sharing.

1161
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:13,387
Okay, y'all, you need
to eat and be quiet.

1162
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,264
We're gonna have us
a little visit.

1163
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:17,099
# Ye-a, ye-a, ye-a, yeah #

1164
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:23,897
# Oh, l-l-I am falling down #

1165
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,358
# Try and stop me #

1166
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:29,403
# It feels so good
to hit the ground #

1167
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:32,781
You know, he went up there.

1168
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,242
Who?

1169
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:38,078
Jake? When?

1170
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,331
About a year after you left.

1171
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:45,085
He doesn't know I know,
but Clinton let it slip once.

1172
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,670
Jake was in New York?

1173
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,630
He told Clinton he'd never
seen anything like it.

1174
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,424
He realized straight off

1175
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:54,428
he'd need more than
an apology to win you back.

1176
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:58,265
He needed to conquer
the world first.

1177
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,142
He's been tryin' ever since.

1178
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:03,437
That's why he kept
sending the papers back.

1179
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:05,731
Yeah.

1180
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:10,444
Hmm. It's funny
how things don't work out.

1181
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:11,445
[Baby gurgles]

1182
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,281
It's funny how they do.

1183
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,582
[Cheers and applause]

1184
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:33,008
# Now, listen here #

1185
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:36,303
# Well, I tried to tell you,
baby #

1186
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,764
# But that don't make
no sense #

1187
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:42,226
# Now you got me, baby #

1188
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,144
# Up against that fence #

1189
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:48,815
...# Ain't that a shame? #
...# Shame #

1190
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,026
# Shame, shame
the way you do #

1191
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:53,820
Man: Ha-ha! Ha!

1192
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:59,535
Hey, look who I found
hangin' out by the parkin' lot.

1193
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,036
Hesitant to join us.

1194
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,247
# Shame, shame,
shame on you #

1195
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,290
Jake: Anybody think
of anything in here

1196
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,668
that, uh, might bother
Bobby Ray?

1197
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,379
...Uh, Clinton's breath?
...Ha!

1198
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,132
You still the same Bobby Ray
from last night?

1199
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:16,343
Last time I checked,
yeah.

1200
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:19,763
Well, then, I'm gonna
buy you a drink.

1201
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:22,391
Well, you're really not
my type, I mean...

1202
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,978
[Laughter]

1203
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,442
Oh, honey, you...
you drink that from the top.

1204
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:35,988
I'm just lookin' to see who
makes this Deep South Glass.

1205
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:38,031
I wonder if you can get it

Hey, Jake,
Mel would like to know

1208
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:45,873
where she can find some of
that snooty-faluty glass.

1209
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,416
Why ask me?

1210
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,418
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because you're...

Jake...

1216
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,442
When was the last time you
pushed me around the floor?

1217
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:15,527

Well, Ms. Taylor,
I'd be honored.

Come on, Mel,
get on out here!

I ain't as clumsy as I look.
She just can't keep time.

1223

You might have to
prove that to me.

Sorry it took me so long.

I would have come sooner

went pear-shaped...

you never left my side.

Yeah.

having fun out there tonight.

and...

this fits, too.

one or the other?

and wings, Mel.

for the winter.

out there sometimes.

rollin' in.

I had a dream about it
the other night.

You ever wonder
what would have happened

1291

if we hadn't have gotten
pregnant?

1294

let me get this out
before I can't.

1295
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:42,062
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

1296
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:45,899
And it took me a while
to realize

1297
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:49,736
it would have been
your only adventure.

1298

knew better, huh?

1301
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,004
relieved.

1302
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:15,012
And all of a sudden, I just...
needed a different life.

1303
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,394

for yourself.

1304
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,688

I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our weddin'.

1306

gonna go better for ya.

is all.

the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

about it, Mama?!

He hasn't done
anything wrong!

1317
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,188
He hasn't done anything right
either!

1318
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,190
I can't believe I'm even
having this argument!

1319
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,192
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

1320

a second chance, so please

end up like me! Damn it!

1329
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,758
Now, you need to stay as far
away from here as you can.

with being you, Mama?

deserve better, that's all.

01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:09,264
I'm just, uh, talkin'
to Mel's fiance here.

1380
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,767
Wonder if you might know
where she is.

1381
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,644
Andrew Hennings.
You must be...

1382
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:18,690
l-I'm Bobby Ray...
her, uh, cousin?

1383
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:22,486
I see you've already met
Jake... her, uh...

1384
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,530
...Other cousin.
...[Laughs]

1385
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:27,282
Family! God, it's great
to meet you both.

1386
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,284
I think Melanie said
somethin' last night

1387
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:30,786
about, uh, visitin'
her daddy

1388
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,579
u-up at the...
up at the battlefield.

1389
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,915
...The battlefield?
...You know us Southerners.

1390
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,583
I mean, the minute
the Confederacy died,

1391
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:37,960
it became a moral issue.

1392
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:42,256
Come on, I'll, uh, I'll
give you a ride up there.

1393
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:45,259
That's great. Thank you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

1394
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:52,766
# What this world needs
is a few more rednecks #

1395
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,685
# So people ain't afraid
to take a stand #

1396
01:13:54,768 --> 01:13:58,772
So, who's...
Melanie... Smooter?

1397
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,066
Local hero around here.

1398
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:02,943
Why is that?

1399
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,278
She blew up the bank.

1400
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,613
And that made her a hero?

1401
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:10,826
Well, notorious, anyway.
She was 10.

1402
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,160
Oh.

1403
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:16,456
Fortunately, nobody was hurt...
except, maybe, the cat.

1404
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:18,667
What cat?

1405
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,253
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

1406
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:24,131
She blew up a cat?

1407
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,550
...He was scheduled to die.
...From dynamite?

1408
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,136
The vet said it had cancer,

1409
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,181
so Eldon thought it'd be put
in one of those chambers,

1410
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,933
you know, the ones
that suck their lungs out.

1411
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,811
Little Mel, she couldn't bear
the thought of that.

1412
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:40,314
She, uh, she wanted
somethin' more humane.

1413
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,316
Yeah, sure.

1414
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:45,527
So, they were doing some
blastin' out by the new highway.

1415
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:48,697
So, we, uh, we took
old Fuzz up there,

1416
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,157
taped him up.

1417
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:53,702
Used about 30 feet of fuse
just to be on the safe side,

1418
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:55,537
said our prayers,
and ran like hell.

1419
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,497
Of course.

1420
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:59,499
So, there we were,
sittin' in Virgie's Diner,

1421
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,085
feelin' pretty blue.

1422
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:04,171
When Mel looks up and sees
that damn cat,

1423
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:07,382
trottin' down the road,
searchin' for Eldon.

1424
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,843
No shit.

1425
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,678
Yeah, and we
would have caught him, too,

1426
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,932
but once that fuse hit his tail,
boom, he took off like a shot.

1427
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:16,391
And into the bank.

1428
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:19,019
Well... the theory is,

1429
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:21,104
he probably wriggled loose
from the explosive.

1430
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:24,566
'Cause, uh, people still
see him from time to time,

1431
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,360
scorched tail and all.

1432
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:29,696
He's a little skittish
around humans.

1433
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:32,199
That's quite a story.

1434
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:34,368
She was quite a girl.

1435
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:37,287
# A little less talk
and a little more action #

1436
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,289
Whatever happened to her?

1437
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,707
# And a few more rednecks... #

1438
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:44,002
Oh, you know...
wound up pregnant,

1439
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:48,090
married some loser
right out of high school.

1440
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:53,554
[Trumpet playing "Taps"]

1441
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:08,193
["Taps" ends]

1442
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:11,280
[Whistling,
cheers and applause]

1443
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,001
Are you surprised?

1444
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:29,298
What are you doing here?

1445
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,508
Well, I came to deliver
your fiance.

1446
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:32,843
I think
she was talking to me.

1447
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:33,969
Jake...

1448
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:35,679
Must be exhaustin'.

1449
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:36,680
...What?
...What?

1450
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:38,223
Livin' a lie.

1451
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:39,516
What's he talking about?

1452
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:43,979
You and I are in love
with two different people.

1453
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:52,362
Is he a second cousin?

1454
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:55,282
He's my husband.

1455
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,491
Your what?

1456
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,576
I mean my ex-husband.

1457
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,119
You married your cousin?!

1458
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:01,955
No, I came down here
to finalize my divorce.

1459
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,499
Hey, darlin',
thought that was you.

1460
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,795
Must be your new someone.

1461
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,299
Earl Smooter...
glad to meet ya.

1462
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:17,846
Melanie Smooter.

1463
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:21,642
Andrew, wait.

1464
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,310
Wait!

1465
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,313
Andrew! Wait!

1466
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:27,314
I just...

1467
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:28,524
Please.

1468
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:30,484
Let me try
and explain myself!

1469
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,528
You don't understand!

1470
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:34,988
This is not
who I am anymore!

1471
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,032
Look, I don't know who you are
or what else you lied about,

1472
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,534
but I know one thing...

1473
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:42,246
there is a Lear Jet
in Mobile, and I am on it.

1474
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,583
[Sighs]

1475
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,184
I know you're thinkin'

1476
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:07,020
I spoiled things good
this time.

1477
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:10,774
Oh, hon, don't go accusin' me
of thinkin'.

1478
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,986
I ain't done
anything of the sort.

1479
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:17,030
Anyway, spoiled's in the eye
of the beholder...

1480
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,158
...like these plums here.

1481
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:24,037
Some people might
call them "spoiled"...

1482
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,375
but I think that, um,
these almost-ruined ones

1483
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:31,378
sometimes make
the sweetest jam.

1484
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,257
Do you need any help?

1485
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,969
It was kind of fun,

1486
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:41,305
seeing Daddy up there,
surrendering.

1487
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,348
Yeah.

1488
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,226
He sure does have
a flair for the dramatic.

1489
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:49,396
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

1490
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,358
Hey, y'all.

1491
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,736
Look who I found
walkin' down l-58.

1492
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,613
Hi.

1493
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,532
Hi.

1494
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,829
I thought you'd be
halfway to New York by now.

1495
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:08,916
So did I.

1496
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:12,336
Ooh, if I'd known
company was comin',

1497
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,588
I'd have put on the dog.

1498
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:17,925
This is my mama.

1499
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,302
Hi.

1500
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,262
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

1501
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:24,431
[Scoffs] Oh.

1502
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:27,100
And my dad...
you... you already met him.

1503
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:28,310
Yeah.

1504
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:33,106
And this is our home.

1505
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,651
This is where I grew up.

1506
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,279
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you both.

1507
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,657
I'm... Andrew Hennings...

1508
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,951
Melanie's fiance...

1509
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:48,664
well... that is... if...
if she'll still have me.

1510
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:56,755
Look, Mel...

1511
01:19:56,797 --> 01:20:00,259
I really don't care
what happened down here.

1512
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,261
So... you have a past.

1513
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:04,304
I mean, who doesn't?

1514
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,812
What I need to know

1515
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:15,524
is if there is a place for me
in your future.

1516
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:20,529
Oh, good Lord.
That is the sweetest thing.

1517
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,532
Well, go on.

1518
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:32,708
Oh! Hello, New York City!

1519
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,169
Woman, what the hell
you gassin' about?

1520
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:37,629
Well, sir...

1521
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,798
my mother happens to be
the mayor up there,

1522
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,842
and, uh, she'd like
nothing better

1523
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,344
than a big, snazzy
New York wedding.

1524
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:48,891
Well, uh...

1525
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:51,435
yeah, I suppose
I can take off work.

1526
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:56,857
Andrew, I, um...
actually, I was thinking,

1527
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,942
maybe we could have
the wedding here.

1528
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:02,863
Here.

1529
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:05,199
In my hometown.

1530
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,452
Look, Mel, if you're worried
about the money, don't.

1531
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,954
It's not about
the money, Andrew...

1532
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,247
not down here.

1533
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,920
You know...
a lot of people

1534
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,507
are expecting us
to get married in the city,

1535
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,884
but I think a nice,
quiet, country wedding

1536
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,093
is just the ticket.

1537
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:29,097
Earl...

1538
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,724
Pearl, if you...
if you folks could

1539
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:33,185
take care
of the rehearsal dinner,

1540
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:36,104
I'd really like
to take care of the rest.

1541
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,732
Well, I think
we could cover that.

1542
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:41,944
Heck. [Chuckles]

1543
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:45,322
How many times does
your only daughter get married?

1544
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:48,075
[Chuckling]

1545
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:53,080
Other than before.

1546
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:54,831
Felony Melanie?

1547
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,083
She was never convicted.

1548
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,292
Oh-ho.

1549
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,253
I don't know
which is worse...

1550
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,964
child cat killer
or sons of the Confederacy.

1551
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,050
What would you suggest I do...
dump her for being poor?

1552
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,010
You're supposed to be
a Democrat, remember?

1553
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,054
There is nothing wrong
with being poor.

1554
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,681
I get elected by poor people,

1555
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,641
and I'm a big enough person
to commend her

1556
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,768
for making something of herself.

1557
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:16,854
What upsets me
is that she lied to you.

1558
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:19,398
So what? She was ashamed
of her background.

1559
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,317
Who hasn't been embarrassed by
their parents at one point?

1560
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:25,112
I'm going to assume that
was a rhetorical question.

1561
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:26,947
Assume away.

1562
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:32,119
[Sighs] No one is going to
change my mind about this...

1563
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,371
not you, not the media,
not anyone.

1564
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:37,457
Fine...

1565
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:40,627
but admit it...
I was right.

1566
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:43,255
Yes... you were right.

1567
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,925
There is a wedding
in your future,

1568
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:48,844
whether you like it or not.

1569
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,390
And how, exactly,
does Little Miss Alabama

1570
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,601
plan to accommodate
500 people?

1571
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:57,644
I suppose she has connections
at the jail.

1572
01:22:57,728 --> 01:22:59,396
Well, there are
several excellent choices...

1573
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:02,900
the Travelodge,
Days Inn, a Motel 6,

1574
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:04,860
oh, and
the Golden Cherry Motel,

1575
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,153
where we will be.

1576
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:08,405
Laugh now,
but if this gets out...

1577
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:09,448
It won't.

1578
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:12,367
The press expects
the Plaza in June.

1579
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,502
# Something's #

1580
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:25,422
# Been creepin' into my head #

1581
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:27,883
# Turnin' my thoughts #

1582
01:23:27,966 --> 01:23:34,097
...[Telephone ringing]
...# Into a dizzy red #

1583
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,766
Now, let's talk
about your wedding.

1584
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:37,392
This place is gorgeous,

1585
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:39,853
and we can control
the security.

1586
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:41,396
...[Ringing continues]
...The Carmichael plantation?

1587
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,358
It did inspire your identity,
did it not?

1588
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:46,568
...You thought of everything.
...Yeah, well, I always do.

1589
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:48,403
Been great.
Keep in touch.

1590
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,989
# Now you have come #

1591
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:54,785
...[Ringing continues]
...# To get some lofty role #

1592
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:59,039
# Oh, you got me walkin'
backwards #

1593
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:02,251
# You got me thinkin'
sideways #

1594
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:06,046
# You got me talkin' circles #

1595
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:09,758
# You got me losin' my way #

1596
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:13,470
# You got me crossin'
every line #

1597
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:15,430
[Ringing continues]

1598
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:20,394
# You got me just in #

1599
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:22,521
# Time #

1600
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:23,605
[Ringing stops]

1601
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:29,027
...You guys remember the sheik.
...Yeah.

1602
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,320
Well, he proposed to me,

1603
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,739
and I think I loved him,
despite his billions.

1604
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:34,449
Then why didn't you say
"yes"?

1605
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:36,618
Because I hesitated
long enough to realize

1606
01:24:36,702 --> 01:24:39,288
my head and my heart were saying
two different things.

1607
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,248
...It's this way.
...Yeah.

1608
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,749
Well, it's a big decision.

1609
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,835
Well, it's supposed to be
the easiest one you ever make.

1610
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:46,086
Wasn't it?

1611
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,674
Hey, Tabby, this is it...

1612
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:53,218
this is the stuff
I was telling you about.

1613
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:55,596
"Deep South Glass."

1614
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,432
Oh, yes. Let's.

1615
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,293
What's the matter?

1616
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:27,544
Oh, my God.

1617
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:33,133
Do we know...

1618
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:34,843
Mo'?

1619
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:45,604
Mel?

1620
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,633
Wow. Look at these.

1621
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:17,553
It's what happens to sand
when it's struck by lightning.

1622
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:19,221
She's pulling your dick.

1623
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:22,182
No, really.
I've seen it.

1624
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,351
You just have to dig it up.

1625
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:25,894
Huh.

1626
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,031
Oh, hey, Bryant.

1627
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:39,199
Friend of yours?

1628
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,879
Hey.

1629
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:53,881
Hey.

1630
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:56,592
I saw him first.

1631
01:26:56,675 --> 01:27:00,637
I, uh...
think he's already taken.

1632
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:05,434
I, um...

1633
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:07,603
I tried to call you
a couple of times.

1634
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,647
Listen, since you're here,

1635
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:12,649
you and your friends should,
you know, look around,

1636
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:14,401
and have some lunch.

1637
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,612
Y'all should sit
on the deck. It's nice.

1638
01:27:17,988 --> 01:27:19,406
Jake...

1639
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:27,331
Come on, Bryant,
let's, uh...

1640
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:29,291
let's leave this lady alone.

1641
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,669
Come on.

1642
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:38,383
Come on, boy.

1643
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,139
Yes, sir.
Can we help you?

1644
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:48,477
l-I'm... I'm looking
for a Melanie Carmichael.

1645
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,104
Anybody here
recognize that name?

1646
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,439
Man: No.

1647
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,942
What business
you got with her?

1648
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,319
I'm afraid
that's a private matter.

1649
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,487
[Chuckles]

1650
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,822
Well, then, I'm afraid
we can't help you.

1651
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:13,961
Damn reporters.

1652
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,713
Like the first ant
at a picnic.

1653
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:18,298
Mm-hmm.

1654
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:22,678
Now... this one here's
from Louisiana.

1655
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:25,430
See? It's got
a little alligator on top.

1656
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:28,183
How sweet. I can see where
your daughter gets her taste.

1657
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:29,268
Ohh.

1658
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:32,604

[Sighs]

1660
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:37,776
This is one of those disasters
waiting to happen.

1661
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:40,487
You know, one of the big ones
that only cockroaches survive.

1662
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:41,989
It's going to be fine.

1663
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:43,323

One down...
7 million to go.

1667
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:57,171
Careful.

1668
01:28:57,254 --> 01:28:58,922
You just smashed
the state bird of Alabama.

1669
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,174
...Ohh!
...[Laughs]

1670

Hi!

1672
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:05,345
...Well, finally.
...Hi! How are you?!

1673
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,097
...Hey, buddy.
...Hello, sir.

1674
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,558
Well, I can see
why Melanie is so adorable.

1675
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:11,101
...I'm so happy to be here.
...Hey!

such a mess, Mrs. Hennings...

No, no, no, no, no...
don't you dare. It's "Kate."

1682
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:22,529
You know, I've been
tryin' to get Earl

1683
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:25,449
to weed these shrubberies
and repaint the trim.

1684
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:26,783
And... oh, my God,

1685
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:29,745
Iook how pretty she is,
Earl.

1686
01:29:29,828 --> 01:29:32,206
Yeah, I'll bet Kate
could use a drink.

1687
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:33,957
Kate could, indeed.

1688
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,792
...[Chuckling]
...Well, just come right on in.

1689
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:36,919
I've got some fried pickles,

...Yum!

getting my house painted, too.

i-it's a lovely chair,
Earl.

1694

Earl: Yeah, but to get
the full effect,

1695
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:50,265
you got to pull
this here handle.

1696
01:29:50,349 --> 01:29:51,850
Daddy, no!

1697
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:54,102

your drink, Kate, and watch.

I'm not on that list,

1712

but I've got some urgent
business with the bride.

1713

Not today, you don't.
Trooper?

1714
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,099
All right, sir, let's get it
turned around here.

1715

01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,464
Yeah, I heard mention of it
a time or two.

1725
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:08,093
I sure hope
this weather cooperates.

1726
01:31:08,177 --> 01:31:11,096
It's supposed to be
a big one.

1727
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:12,639
...[Clanging]
...You know, Jake...

1728
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:18,437
You're my only son...
and I love you,

1729
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,606
but sometimes...

1730
01:31:20,647 --> 01:31:25,569
you are too much
like your daddy.

1731
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:28,155
She made her decision,
Mama.

1732
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:34,036
For somebody who's been holdin'
onto somethin' so hard,

1733
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,996
you're pretty quick
to let it go.

1734
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,084
You know,
I can't control her

1735
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:43,504
any more than
I can control the weather.

1736
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,352
It's just nerves.

1737
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:00,854
You're doin'
the right thing.

1738
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:03,482
Am I?

1739
01:32:05,442 --> 01:32:08,070
When I married
your daddy...

1740
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:11,240
oh, Lord, but I was
a fool for that man.

1741
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:13,825
I couldn't put one foot
in front of the other.

1742
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:15,953
I remember standin' there,
thinkin',

1743
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:20,207
"Oh, preacher, hurry up
before he changes his mind."

1744
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:22,543
[Laughing]
Look where it got me.

1745
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:23,752
[Inhales deeply]

1746
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:26,338
Sometimes
that man makes me so mad,

1747
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,298
I could just wring his neck.

1748
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:29,842
But you still love him.

1749
01:32:29,925 --> 01:32:31,426
God knows I do.

1750
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:34,888
[Laughing]
And only he knows why.

1751
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,807
Mama... I think I...

1752
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:41,687
He can give you a life
that we never dreamed of.

1753
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,564
And he adores you.

1754
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,693
[Thunder rumbling]

1755
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:49,278
He does, doesn't he?

1756
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,614

["Here Comes the Bride" plays]

1758
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:27,024
Well, even if he is a Yankee,
at least he's sober.

1759
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:28,233

1760
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:30,027

01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,987
...Get him!
...Ms. Carmichael!

1762
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,071
Get back here!

Mr. Buford?

Ugh!
Get your hands off me!

1768
01:33:43,123 --> 01:33:44,791
Wait! Let him go.

1769
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,047
Melanie?

Mr. Buford,
he signed the papers.

01:33:58,138 --> 01:33:59,640
What are you doing here?

1775
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:08,649
He did... you didn't.

1776
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:11,902
What?

1777
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:18,534
You mean I'm still married?

Well,
not unless you want to be.

Oh, for God's sakes,
Melanie.

1781
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,917
I thought
you took care of this.

1782
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,669
It's an honest mistake,
Andrew.

1783
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,296
Well, then, can we fix it
before we all get soaked?

1784
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,465
Does anybody have a pen?

You don't want
to marry me.

I don't?

You see, the truth is...

1801
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:49,791
I gave my heart away
a long time ago...

My whole heart...

1803
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:55,923
and I never really
got it back.

And l-I don't even know
what else to say,

1805

1808
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:12,314
And you shouldn't want
to marry me.

Wow. [Chuckles]

1810
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:24,117

is what this feels like.

That's it?!

You're just gonna
let her humiliate you

about an old husband?!

I have never met anyone
so manipulative,

so deceitful!

trying to be honest.

the future President
of the United States

1827
01:37:32,144 --> 01:37:35,522
to be dumped at the altar
by some psycho Daisy Mae!

Uh, there... there's no need
for name-callin', now.

Now, she spoke her piece,
and that's all there is to it.

Oh, go back
to your double-wide

1833

Why didn't you tell me
you came to New York?

somethin' of myself.

Melanie?

I don't even think
you know.

You're the first boy
I ever kissed, Jake,

1864

to be the last.

had our chance.

married to me for, anyhow?

this time?
