1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,480
Willie Grimes reprimanded
and ready for the...

2
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Go on, get out of it.

3
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
I thought I'd remain sober for the day.

4
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,440
[Voices overlapping]

5
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Oh, that's sharp.

6
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
That's a very close shave, indeed.

7
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,999
I've changed my mind.

8
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,439
I'll be off, then.

9
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,479
I've an appointment
with Oswald Mitchells.

10
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,399
I've changed my mind.

11
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,799
Little buggers.

12
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,759
You bastards.

13
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,519
[All yelling]

14
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,319
Serve that blade up, mate.

15
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,199
I don't think it's quite my size.

16
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,119
It's a little tight around the neck.

17
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,559
Lop his bleedin' head off.

18
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,279
I'll see you in hell, you bollocks.

19
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,199
Fuck you, Grimes.

20
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,159
As for you.

21
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,879
[Spits]

22
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,759
[All shouting indistinctly]

23
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:20,078
In the basket.

24
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:49,078
Father.

25
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,117
Thank God.

26
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,957
Ow!

27
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,277
I didn't do anything.

28
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,077
Get me out of this thing.

29
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,035
Mr. Blake.

30
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:02,995
Mr. Arthur Blake.

31
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,115
Yes.

32
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,955
Body snatching.

33
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,155
Hmm.

34
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:16,275
It is my duty to write, for
the purpose of announcement

35
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,875
and later for printing,
your final words.

36
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:24,955
Eh, so that others drawn
to the wayside may, uh...

37
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,795
take heed in your cries of
guilt and pleas for forgiveness.

38
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,874
It is also my duty to inform you

39
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,994
that you are to be
executed by way of, uh...

40
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,114
beheading.

41
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,474
For a lifetime spent in
the despicable pursuit

42
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:40,794
of grave robbing and murder...

43
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,274
[murmuring]

44
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,474
Well, all this really means
is that you're a dead man,

45
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:47,554
and I'm here to make you say sorry.

46
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:50,354
You'd be after my
gallows speech, then.

47
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,354
By hook or by crook.

48
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,754
Did you get a speech
out of old Willie

49
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:55,834
before they chopped off his head?

50
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:59,234
It would have been nice to
have a chat with your friend,

51
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,114
maybe extrapolate a
story or two from him,

52
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:05,233
but, well, sadly, that was not to be.

53
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:09,473
Do you have anything to say
for yourself before they, uh...

54
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,473
[chopping noise]

55
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,753
Well, I suppose you
wouldn't believe me

56
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,793
if I told you I was innocent.

57
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,393
Innocent?

58
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,953
Of murder, that is.

59
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:22,513
The despicable grave robbing
part sounds about right.

60
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,473
Well, that's a new one.

61
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,913
Why don't I have a chat
with the executioner

62
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,393
and may... maybe get you a pardon, like?

63
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,233
All I know is this.

64
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:31,153
I woke up in the morning,
the coppers were at my door.

65
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,273
And get this.

66
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:34,233
They followed a fresh
trail of body parts

67
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:38,592
that led all the way from
the station to my house.

68
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,592
As if I'd be that stupid.

69
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,112
The same thing happened to Willie.

70
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,992
Fresh trail of body
parts that led all the way

71
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,032
from the station to his doorstep.

72
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,432
And then they called us murderers.

73
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:48,512
Bollocks.

74
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:49,552
We were set up.

75
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,152
Not a murderer, then.

76
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,152
Nope.

77
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,352
- Grave robber?
- Yep.

78
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,152
Bloody good one too.

79
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,432
Would you mind shining a light

80
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,312
on what it was that
made you so exceptional?

81
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,072
I'm not sure I want to
go down that road, Father.

82
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,232
You know, when I look
back on it now, it seems...

83
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:09,072
Well, I'm not sure you
would believe a word of it.

84
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,751
Besides, I have a terrible memory.

85
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,431
Eh, you'd be surprised what a
man of the cloth might believe.

86
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,311
You think this might
help with your memory?

87
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,631
It... it might.

88
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,351
Here's to the late, great Willie Grimes.

89
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:37,231
Oh, you'll be seeing him
very soon, Mr. Blake, very soon.

90
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:39,831
Aye, that I will.

91
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:42,511
I suppose we have some
time to kill, Father?

92
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,110
Eh, Francis Duffy.

93
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,430
Father Francis Duffy.

94
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,430
And you have exactly five hours to kill.

95
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,590
I'll tell you what, Father.

96
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,110
You keep this whiskey here flowing,

97
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,470
we'll have ourselves a little chat.

98
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,590
Well, that's a fair trade then.

99
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,190
So tell me,

100
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,270
how did you start out
in your life of crime?

101
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,510
Well, I suppose I'd
have to go back a bit,

102
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,670
back to when I first met Willie.

103
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,630
Willie got me into the trade.

104
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,710
I was his apprentice.

105
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,630
You see, it was body
snatching or the streets for me

106
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,670
and my ma, my little brother.

107
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,269
Are you frightened?

108
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,389
Of course you is.

109
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,669
I remember the first job I pulled.

110
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,229
Nearly shit myself, didn't I?

111
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,149
With me old man it was.

112
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,109
Miserable bastard.

113
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,109
So what brought you down
to the Fortune of War, then?

114
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,788
My mom told me to go
there and talk to Ronnie.

115
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,268
When I got there, he gave me an ale

116
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,948
and said I was gonna
meet you here tonight.

117
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,308
You might keep me on.

118
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:58,628
Who's your Ma, then?

119
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,388
Mary Blake.

120
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,788
She works down at the food lane.

121
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,948
Selling things.

122
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:07,388
Ah, things.

123
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:08,588
If I can get a job,

124
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,748
she says she could stay
home with me little brother.

125
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:13,668
He's only a baby.

126
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:19,908
Fucking single grave, isn't it?

127
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:27,187
Now, you watch old Willie
and see how the job gets done.

128
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,987
You want that hole narrow.

129
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,107
Don't make it too wide neither.

130
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:12,426
Now, what I want for
you is to get down there

131
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:16,106
and smack a hole in the lid of that box.

132
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,066
The coffin?

133
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,146
Yeah, the coffin.

134
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,266
Come on now, boy, get on with it.

135
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,185
You done yet?

136
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,465
Me hands are bleeding.

137
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:52,785
Oh, give it some.

138
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:55,305
Don't stop till you hack through it.

139
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,584
I'm going to be sick.

140
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,304
Now stomp on the lid a
bit so's you can reach in.

141
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,784
What you want to do
is, you take this rope,

142
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:15,224
tie it round to whatever
it is that's down there.

143
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:21,984
Good lad.

144
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,624
All right, now get out of
it while I take a butchers.

145
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,544
Wow, that's some tight hold on that.

146
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:37,463
[Grunting]

147
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,343
Give us a hand with this shroud.

148
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,503
See, that's the one thing we don't take.

149
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,663
You could be done for nicking that.

150
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,783
You don't know her, do ya?

151
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,943
Well, do ya?

152
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,023
It was Mrs. Tulley.

153
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,863
She lives around from me Ma.

154
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,182
Well, not anymore she doesn't.

155
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,942
You'll be wanting a stronger stomach

156
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:17,062
if you're gonna get into this
line of business, you would.

157
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,862
Which way now?

158
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,022
Here, boy.

159
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,022
You deserve a drink.

160
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:34,542
What is it?

161
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:38,142
It's good stuff...

162
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:41,102
and you've earned it.

163
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,821
Now take some.

164
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,261
Oop.

165
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:46,341
Get that for me, will you?

166
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,021
I found it.

167
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,581
Why did he not strike you down?

168
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:07,221
He didn't have the heart, Father.

169
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,221
Like I said, Willie wasn't a murderer.

170
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,661
You know, underneath
all that dirt and grime,

171
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:14,301
you'll find more dirt and grime,

172
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,260
and then underneath all that,

173
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,180
you'll find that Willie
has a heart of gold.

174
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,260
Had, Mr. Blake.

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,060
Had a heart of gold.

176
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,980
Your friend is no longer with us.

177
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,260
Oh, yeah, had a heart of gold.

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,860
Mm-hmm.

179
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,220
So he took me on as his apprentice,

180
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,180
and for better or worse,

181
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,980
that was the start of my life of crime.

182
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,420
And how long did you
remain under his employ?

183
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,500
On and off over the years.

184
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,260
Sometimes I employed him.

185
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,380
Mainly though we were under the
thumb of one Dr. Vernon Quint.

186
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Quint.

187
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,779
Yeah, he was a fiend.

188
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,259
Had Willie and I slaving for years,

189
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,179
blackmailing us with the law
if we didn't deliver the goods.

190
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:00,339
And he had you ransacking
the graveyards for him, eh?

191
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,219
Were you free to snatch as you pleased?

192
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,299
Not really.

193
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,379
I mean, the coppers could be
bought off from time to time,

194
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,819
but the relatives,
they were out for blood.

195
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:11,179
We had to think on our feet,
look elsewhere for corpses.

196
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,339
Go on, give her a little poke.

197
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,178
She had a wooden leg,
hollow in the middle.

198
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:29,698
She used to tie it with a
string and play it like a fiddle.

199
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,178
She'd fiddle in the hall;
she'd fiddle in the alleyway.

200
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:37,418
She didn't give a damn, for
she had to fiddle anyway.

201
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,698
Here you go lads, get them into you.

202
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:39,698
Oh, yeah, very good.

203
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,538
Thanks, Maisey, here's to Kathleen.

204
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,178
Lord have mercy on her soul.

205
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,298
A hard life.

206
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:46,218
Some would say she's
off to a better place.

207
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,778
Hard life?

208
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,778
Hard living more like.

209
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:53,818
Ah, but look at the beautiful
corpse she left behind.

210
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,617
It was the pleurisy got her in the end.

211
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:59,057
Expecting many guests, Maisey?

212
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,817
No, she didn't leave many
friends behind her, Tommy,

213
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,297
and we couldn't afford
the O'Casey mourners.

214
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,497
Terribly expensive.

215
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,657
[Knocks on door]

216
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,057
Oh.

217
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,577
Excuse me, gentlemen.

218
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,137
Maybe I spoke too soon.

219
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:14,657
Friends indeed.

220
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:15,857
You're only here for the drink.

221
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:16,857
Feck off, you.

222
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:17,897
She was an awful woman.

223
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,137
An old whore, if you ask me.

224
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:23,857
Now, lads, this is Arthur.

225
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,657
Kathleen's sister's son.

226
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,617
Oh.

227
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:27,937
She was a lovely woman, son.

228
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,136
A terrible day, son.

229
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,256
Me ma sends her love.

230
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,416
Would you like a cup of tea, dear?

231
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,056
Can I see me auntie?

232
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,536
Go ahead, son.

233
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:40,456
Sure she's only just asleep.

234
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:46,016
Asleep with the Lord.

235
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,336
Dead.

236
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,336
She's dead, son.

237
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,536
Dead.

238
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:02,855
[Crying]

239
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,575
Ah, there now, son, save your tears.

240
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,935
Sure she's at rest now.

241
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,655
Oh, there, there.

242
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,255
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

243
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:16,175
Sure I'll have one if
there is one going, Maisey.

244
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,335
There's that cake too, Maisey.

245
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,455
Go on, go on, son.

246
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,215
Let it out of you.

247
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:24,295
Can I have a minute alone with her...

248
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,055
to say good-bye?

249
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,135
I want to whisper her a prayer.

250
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,535
So she'll get to the Lord sooner.

251
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:32,655
Come on.

252
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,335
Let... let's leave the
boy alone with his aunt.

253
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,615
You two can help me in the pantry.

254
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,094
We'll fix you a nice cup of tea, son.

255
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,734
I'll only be a minute.

256
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,654
Open the door, son.

257
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,614
I think he's locked us in.

258
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,414
The little bastard's snuffin' her.

259
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,374
Willie.

260
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:07,414
They're on to me!

261
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,533
Come on, toss it down.

262
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,933
You feckin' little bastard.

263
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,973
I wring your bloody neck
when I get a hold of ya.

264
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,293
I'll box your ears in when I get you,

265
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,293
do you hear me?

266
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,333
You little toe rag.

267
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,653
Get back here.

268
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:25,533
Ha ha.

269
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,133
I'm very proud of you, lad.

270
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,693
Willie, I think it's time
we talk about my salary.

271
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,213
Oh, what about it?

272
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,973
Well, I think it's time I had one.

273
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,053
Ha!

274
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,973
We'll take that
sentiment down to the pub.

275
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,293
Arthur Blake.

276
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,253
When will you be making an
honest woman out of me, then?

277
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,533
Ah, go on, you old brasser.

278
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:42,852
You come back with your earnings,

279
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,772
and I'll show you a brasser.

280
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:45,852
Willie.

281
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:48,252
I think it's time we
talk about my salary, now.

282
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,452
[Laughs]

283
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:54,372
[Animal howling]

284
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,692
Oh, shut up.

285
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:02,692
It's not even a full moon.

286
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:05,852
[Voices overlapping]

287
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,252
You'll have the mick
brigade after yous now.

288
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,212
After who?

289
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:14,492
Nobody saw me, Ronnie.

290
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,211
It was all the young blackguard's doing.

291
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,771
Yeah well, there'd be no Burke

292
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,091
without the little Hare over here.

293
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,651
You two are getting a reputation.

294
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,331
You need to lie low for a while.

295
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,771
Oh, we had to do it.

296
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,211
That ornament Dr. Quint had us
between a rock and a hard place.

297
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,171
And now we can't get near
the cemeteries no more.

298
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:32,571
He's threatening the law if
we don't keep up deliveries.

299
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,171
He's got you by the bollocks, then.

300
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,211
Bastard.

301
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,891
I'll drink to the end of him.

302
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:44,091
You know, I hear he plays
each corpse a tune on his fiddle

303
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,171
before he gets stuck in.

304
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,570
Enough of Quint.

305
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,570
Sever all ties, that's what I say.

306
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,250
Speak of the devil.

307
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,050
Evening, doctor.

308
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,050
Gentlemen.

309
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,089
A port, Ronnie, and
two ales for my friends.

310
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,809
It's very kind of you, boss.

311
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,969
That's what friends are for, Willie.

312
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,809
Wonderful catch last night, boys.

313
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,169
But I must admit I am curious

314
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,289
as to why it was such a
fresh and clean specimen.

315
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,849
Ah, well, nothing too untoward boss,

316
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,289
snatched it from a wake, so we did.

317
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:48,409
One must be creative in these times.

318
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,169
Advancing medicine is
what you two are doing.

319
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,609
History will be very kind, gentlemen.

320
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,009
As will I.

321
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,688
But I am afraid this
is not a social visit.

322
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,128
My practice is in dire need, gentlemen.

323
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:01,248
Ah.

324
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,648
Well, the thing is,

325
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,448
things have been a
bit slow lately, boss.

326
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:06,808
What kind of weak fool are you?

327
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,568
There's a perfect specimen
standing right beside you.

328
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:12,848
He helps me out.

329
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,248
He's earned his keep in this world.

330
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,728
I need more corpses,
and I need them now.

331
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,528
I don't care where they come from,

332
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,448
and if you two can't get them for me,

333
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,128
I'll hire Murphy and his men,

334
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,128
and I'll have two fresh
corpses on my table

335
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,808
by the end of the week.

336
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,967
Swine.

337
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,407
He'll be the death of us.

338
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,687
Stiffed us with the bill too.

339
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,887
I have filth on you two,

340
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,047
enough to see you hanged,
drawn, and quartered.

341
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,047
I need them fresher.

342
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,687
Get rid of this stale thing

343
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,287
and bring me something worthwhile.

344
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:55,647
I need more corpses, more corpses.

345
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,287
I need more corpses.

346
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:00,127
The stink of that
corpse is almost as foul

347
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,247
as the two of you.

348
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,126
Get me fresh specimens immediately,

349
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,686
or there will be trouble.

350
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,406
That's how it was for years.

351
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:14,406
Slaving away for Quint,
making sure he was happy.

352
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,566
Meanwhile, we weren't making a penny.

353
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,006
On the bread line, we were.

354
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,886
A hard slog.

355
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:25,206
One job though, one
job changed all that.

356
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:28,886
One job turned us from
body snatchers into ghouls.

357
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:30,846
Ghouls?

358
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,166
Ghouls.

359
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,606
A body snatcher will steal the dead,

360
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,605
but a ghoul will steal just
about anything, dead or other.

361
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,005
Time was when a corpse didn't do much,

362
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,765
just laid there.

363
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:41,925
Not so anymore.

364
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,405
Well, I mean, surely to God,

365
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:48,765
a corpse is a corpse is a corpse.

366
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,165
What harm is one to anyone?

367
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:54,205
Plenty, if it has a good mind to.

368
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,365
I see.

369
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,125
No, you don't.

370
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,965
I think I do.

371
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,725
Father, if I've learned
anything over the years,

372
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:08,085
it's that you never,
ever trust a corpse.

373
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,404
I had hoped to be
hearing these tales today.

374
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:17,604
When I first heard that the
snatchers Grimes and Blake

375
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:20,884
had been reprimanded, I
rushed here to meet with you.

376
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:21,924
You've heard of us, then?

377
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,004
Oh, your reputation precedes you

378
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,044
in certain circles.

379
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,484
Occult circles.

380
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:28,844
You have some knowledge
of the occult, then.

381
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:31,164
Things that go...

382
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:32,244
[Loud thump]

383
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,804
In the night, yes.

384
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:35,084
Yes.

385
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:36,844
When I first heard the stories,

386
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:39,124
I thought they were
the stuff of nonsense.

387
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:41,564
But lately I've come to accept them,

388
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,523
and I actively pursue the tellers.

389
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,123
Unfortunately, my time
with them is brief.

390
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:49,123
In fact, you'd be dead right
now if it wasn't for me.

391
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,003
Is that so?

392
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:52,083
Oh, yeah.

393
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,003
I paid the executioner
for our time together.

394
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:57,123
Is this the first
time you've paid someone

395
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,643
to be alone with a man, Father?

396
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:07,883
You're not looking too
funny right now Mr. Blake.

397
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:18,002
Willie Grimes.

398
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,482
Willie Grimes introduced you

399
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,642
to the underbelly of
the resurrection trade.

400
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:27,082
Well, not so much as introduced me,

401
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,162
more as stumbled upon it with me.

402
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:44,202
Ronnie put us onto this job.

403
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,722
Out on the moors, it was,

404
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,402
right in the middle of nowhere.

405
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:52,601
Took us ages to find it.

406
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,401
But it was worth the effort.

407
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,881
Right, it's ready.

408
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,761
You can unearth the thing.

409
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,601
I'm wrecked.

410
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,161
You're getting old.

411
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,681
I'm getting hungry.

412
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,921
Me too.

413
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,121
I hate this.

414
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:19,161
Backbreaking work, and all
we ever are is famished.

415
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:20,841
And broke.

416
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,880
If that rotten bastard Quint
was a little less miserable,

417
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,880
things might be different.

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,400
We should do him in.

419
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
Ah, he's too well connected.

420
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Besides, that's a mug's game.

421
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Still, I'm hungry enough,

422
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
I could eat that corpse over there.

423
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
What you got there?

424
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,400
Sandwich.

425
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
A what which?

426
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,760
Sandwich.

427
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
It's food.

428
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,320
Food.

429
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,160
Two lumps of bread with
something in the middle.

430
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
It's genius.

431
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,160
Ah, it's queer.

432
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,360
No, it's all right.

433
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,600
You can put anything inside.

434
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,520
What's in it?

435
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,159
Uh, looks like...

436
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,319
Like?

437
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,639
Looks like it tastes
better than it looks.

438
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,199
How did you afford one?

439
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,839
- I nicked it.
- Arthur.

440
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:08,879
What?

441
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,279
I'll pay them back when I'm flush.

442
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,239
I fancy a bite.

443
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,599
Give it here.

444
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,919
I'll tell you what.

445
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,799
I'll share it with you for
a few glugs of your whiskey.

446
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,839
Done.

447
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:38,478
Bloody hell.

448
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:39,718
You were hungry.

449
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:41,198
You're not having any of mine.

450
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:50,478
What I don't get is
why they buried a corpse

451
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:51,478
outside of a graveyard.

452
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:54,598
Suicide most likely.

453
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,878
Idiot clergy probably
excommunicated them,

454
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,318
so there was nowhere else to bury them.

455
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:02,238
Why at a crossroads?

456
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:04,037
Gob shite superstition.

457
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,837
So's if the spirit rises,

458
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,117
it'll not know which way is which

459
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:08,837
and wander about the place lost.

460
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:09,997
Which way is which.

461
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,477
Which sandwich is which.

462
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:13,277
Boy, get at it, come on.

463
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:15,277
All right, you moody so and so.

464
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,237
Willie?

465
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:29,917
What?

466
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,677
Look at this.

467
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,357
What, we don't know her, do we?

468
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,796
Oh, that's odd.

469
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,156
Look at its eyes.

470
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:44,956
Maybe we should just leave it.

471
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:45,956
No.

472
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,596
Have that bastard Quint on our tails?

473
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:50,796
It's a perfectly good piece.

474
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:53,436
What's that around her neck?

475
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:55,756
That's... that's garlic.

476
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,716
Ronnie's got that stuff
all over the Fortune of War.

477
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:00,436
Keep things away from the place.

478
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,156
Garlic?

479
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,156
It's stinky.

480
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,155
Don't do that.

481
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,355
That's there for a reason.

482
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,355
Gob shite superstition, Willie.

483
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,435
Who would do a thing like that?

484
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:17,995
I don't know, but I'm glad they did.

485
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:20,195
This piece will put us in
good standing with Quint.

486
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:24,595
Pull it out.

487
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:25,675
No way, mate.

488
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,675
I dare you.

489
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,795
No way, I say.

490
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:35,675
You're out of your head.

491
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:37,155
Help me.

492
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,435
Come on, help me.

493
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,994
Come on.

494
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,994
Let's get the corpse in the cart.

495
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:03,234
Oh, look at this mess.

496
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:06,074
What we need is a new cart, Arthur.

497
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,474
Something roomy.

498
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,354
How are we even gonna
fit the corpse in there?

499
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,193
Willie.

500
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,433
Let's get the hell out of here.

501
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:29,953
Maybe she wasn't dead.

502
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,473
Not exactly alive neither.

503
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,473
Un...

504
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:33,473
Dead.

Bollocks, shite.

507
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:38,953
What do you like, Grimes?

508
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,633
What do you like?

509
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,953
Hey, do you hear that?

517
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:17,672

I think it's gone.

525
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,070
Why did you have to hit me?

526
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,030
It was all on you.

527

528
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,310
Ow.

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,390
Look.

Ah, you're bleeding.

531
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,470
You keep away from me.

532
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,590

How should I know?

537
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,510
I think it's getting lighter.

Yeah.

00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:58,189
[Chuckles]

550
00:30:58,229 --> 00:30:59,269
What are you doing?

551
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,829
- Watch this.
- What are you doing?

552
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:04,188
[Shrieking]

553
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,428
Oy, you mad bastard,
come on let's go.

554
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:07,388
Leave it.

555
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:10,948
[Shrieking]

556
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:12,868
- [Laughs]
- Don't do that.

557
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:14,948
Don't, you mad bastard,
don't do that, don't.

558
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:16,028
Come on, let's go, Willie.

559
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:16,988
Let's go; I wanna go.

560
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,508
I've got an idea.

561
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:54,267
[Playing mournful violin music]

562
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:39,106
Thank you for your
sacrifice, my child.

563
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:54,105
[Screaming]

564
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,145
After that job, we were
never bothered by Quint again,

565
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,505
and we struck gold with the undead.

566
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,945
We realized that people
would pay ten times as much

567
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,505
for your more unusual corpse.

568
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,265
And the jobs kept finding us.

569
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,305
It was as if we opened
the door to another world

570
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,385
and got a sniff of it,

571
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,104
or it got a sniff of us.

572
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,384
Came across a whole many
of things after that.

573
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:27,264
So trafficking the undead
was more lucrative, eh?

574
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,544
Absolutely.

575
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:30,264
That's where the real money was.

576
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:32,904
That's how it was for a while
for me and old Willie Grimes,

577
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:38,024
making good money snatching all
sorts of things dead, undead.

578
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:41,224
And, uh, who paid you?

579
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:42,664
A select few.

580
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,864
Those who realize the potential.

581
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:46,704
Of course, it didn't
always go according to plan.

582
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:49,103
There were times when we'd go to
the trouble of unearthing things

583
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:51,063
only to have them stolen from us.

584
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,503
Snatched by a rival gang.

585
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,943
Sometimes at knifepoint.

586
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:57,183
Rival gangs.

587
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,663
Right bunch of
conniving swines they were.

588
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,943
You see, Willie and I,

589
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:03,823
we were more your kind
of happy-go-lucky types.

590
00:34:03,863 --> 00:34:05,303
But, you know, some people took things

591
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,743
a little bit more seriously.

592
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,703
Some of them were real creeps.

593
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:11,063
Such as?

594
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,503
We had run-ins with a crowd of lunatics

595
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,183
called the House of Murphy.

596
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:20,663
Ah, the famed House of Murphy.

597
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:27,422
I've heard many stories about
Cornelius Murphy and his gang.

598
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,302
Hated us they did.

599
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,982
You see, we'd like to get in
and out the yards unnoticed.

600
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:34,902
But they would make this
big song and dance out of it.

601
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:39,662
He made us look like a
right bunch of amateurs.

602
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,262
You have any recent encounters
with the House of Murphy?

603
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:46,942
Yeah, unfortunately, yes.

604
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,182
But let me tell you about this one time.

605
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,742
Strangest job I ever pulled.

606
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:54,062
It was most bloody peculiar.

607
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:59,061
You know, if you were to
drop down dead right now,

608
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:02,301
I would sling you in that
cart and call it a night.

609
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:06,021
You wouldn't get a penny
for my whisky-logged corpse.

610
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:09,301
Hey, if I croak before you
do, feel free to make a penny.

611
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,421
I won't hear of it.

612
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,221
It's not proper.

613
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:14,741
Would you really try to sell me off?

614
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,661
I might.

615
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,261
The bloody cheek.

616
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,901
Do you like my new cart?

617
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:22,981
It's quality.

618
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,061
Very modern.

619
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,461
Thought I might do a bit
of shite shoveling with it.

620
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,821
You know, running after the horses,

621
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:30,740
collecting their shite
to sell for compost.

622
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,540
Well, it's good money, and it's legal.

623
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,780
Hugo Fortune got me onto it.

624
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,700
Mind you, I haven't bothered yet.

625
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,660
Are you interested?

626
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,140
I could loan you out the cart.

627
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,860
No chance.

628
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,980
So what did Ronnie say
about this piece, then?

629
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,620
He said there's a corpse out here

630
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,380
that not only won't jump
up and try to kill us,

631
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,700
it'll fetch us a small fortune as well.

632
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,100
That's a bit curious, isn't it?

633
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,660
[Loud crash]

634
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,940
Bollocks.

635
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Oh, fuck you, Grimes.

636
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,060
"Quality," what a piece of shite.

637
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,779
[Laughs]

638
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,379
Get the shovels.

639
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,619
It's frozen.

640
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,019
What?

641
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,939
The ground.

642
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,099
It's frozen.

643
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,819
That's gonna take
all night to dig out.

644
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:27,699
Why is it frozen?

645
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:28,699
Nowhere else is.

646
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:35,379
Well, if whatever it is
that's down there is frozen,

647
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,978
then I'm a happy man.

648
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,098
'Cause if it's frozen,

649
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:39,538
it won't be jumping about the place

650
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:40,578
trying to murder us.

651
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:42,898
I suppose.

652
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,298
It's a bit unusual.

653
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:48,058
Ah, yes, Arthur, it's curious.

654
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,578
All right, I'll start it.

655
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,778
You can finish it.

658
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:17,457
Ah.

[Yawning]

660
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,496
[Coughing]

661
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:54,656
Looks like a child's coffin.

662
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,456
Do they want the box and all?

663
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:02,256
Yeah, they said not
to even try to open it.

664
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,416
I'm not carrying that thing back.

665
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,856
It's freezing.

666
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,576
Well, we should smash it open.

667
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:11,416
Oh, fetch more if we don't.

668
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,496
Ow.

669
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,296
Oh, that hurt.

670
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,615
Hey, give us your knife.

671
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:24,055
If I can wedge this in.

672
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,735
I'm telling you, be careful.

673
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:31,375
Ow, ow, my fingers, freezing over.

674
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:35,055
Let's just kick it back.

675
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:40,455
No, no, no, let's
wrap it and carry it.

676
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:41,575
Wrap it with what?

677
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,735
Ah, it's heavy.

678
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,215
That's no child in there.

679
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,695
It's heavy.

680
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:03,494
Look at that.

681
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:06,774
What do you reckon that is?

682
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:07,934
Don't know.

683
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,334
Never seen anything like it.

684
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:14,214
It's not moving, is it?

685
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:18,854
No.

686
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:21,174
Could be from Dotsie's,

687
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:22,933
you know, the circus?

688
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,893
Could be a little freak from Dotsie's.

689
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,573
I don't think so.

690
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,693
I don't think that thing is
from anywhere near Dotsie's.

691
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,613
Look at the size of its head.

692
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:39,773
Well, be easier to move now.

693
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,733
It's not as cold as it was in the box.

694
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,653
All right. All right.

695
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:52,053
Let's get out of here.

696
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,493
Come on.

697
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:57,572
Good evening to you, gentlemen.

698
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,332
Now, if you don't mind terribly,

699
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,692
you'll be dropping that
corpse off for me now.

700
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,372
Willie, do you know this asshole?

701
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:07,412
[Laughs]

702
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,172
Cornelius, don't mind the young fellow.

703
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,572
He's a little fresh around the ears.

704
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:13,532
Hand that there over now, boy.

705
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:16,852
Arthur meet Cornelius Murphy.

706
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:20,132
Now, be a pet and hand
him over the whatsit.

707
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,812
Having a laugh, aren't you?

708
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,572
I'd listen to your boss if
you want to live past tonight.

709
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:28,332
That's a good lad.

710
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:31,291
Now pass it along.

711
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:34,571
Don't be stupid, Arthur.

712
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:35,891
Do as the gentleman says.

713
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,531
I'll explain later.

714
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:46,651
On the ground there.

715
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,771
Do it.

716
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,291
Afraid I can't do that.

717
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:52,971
You see, this took us
a few hours to dig up.

718
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:55,531
Now that we've got it, I
don't want to give it back.

719
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,651
Drop it and live.

720
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,651
Drop the corpse.

721
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,810

[Low pulsing sound]

723
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,970
What?

724
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,290
Oh, my head.

725
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,650
I admire your pluck, lad.

726
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,289
When you're through fumblin'
about cemeteries with this fool,

727
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,409
come and call on the House of Murphy.

728
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:44,529
Somebody snatched our snatchins.

729
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,569
I think I'm in the
wrong line of business.

730
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:50,569
I'm all light-headed.

731
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,969
How did they manage it?

732
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,329
Hey, who did you say that was again?

733
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:59,089
That was Cornelius Murphy,
and you're lucky to be alive.

734
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,209
I think he just offered me a job.

735
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:03,689
What and leave a
good thing like this?

736
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,089
No.

737
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:09,608
He seemed a little
bit too intense to me.

738
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:12,808
So Fortune of War?

739
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:15,088
Oh, aye.

740
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:16,408
I'm flat broke though.

741
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:18,248
Yeah, me too.

742
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,648
I got this new bird, though.

743
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:20,968
She might have a couple of quid.

744
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:24,688
Ah, good for you, son.

745
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:28,368
Some jobs were harder than others.

746
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:30,728
We went hungry at times,

747
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:33,928
but mainly we made off
with whatever we snatched.

748
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,968
But you, uh...

749
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,368
you took him up on his offer, Murphy.

750
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:38,488
No.

751
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:39,728
But I considered it.

752
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,168
There were no flies on him,

753
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,247
and if there were,
they were paying rent.

754
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:46,767
But you crossed paths again?

755
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:47,847
Oh, aye.

756
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,367
Well, Willie and I had
it in for the snobs.

757
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,847
They thought they were better than us.

758
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:54,527
When was... when was the
last time you crossed paths?

759
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,887
Not too long ago, but here.

760
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:57,807
Let me tell you about the time
I teamed up with The Whistler.

761
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,247
Hoo.

762
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,327
Uh, Mr. Blake.

763
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:01,687
He was a slippery bollocks.

764
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,527
What about The Wrinkler?

765
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:04,567
I have a million stories.

766
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,767
I knew all the snatchers.
- Mr. Blake!

767
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,527
If we had the time,

768
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,687
I'd love to hear all
your lovely stories,

769
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:16,526
but time is of the essence.

770
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,806
Now I would like to hear
about the House of Murphy.

771
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,846
Why?

772
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:20,926
They're a gang of assholes.

773
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,406
I'm bored talking about them.

774
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:23,726
Got what they deserved.

775
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,686
What did they get?

776
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,446
Eh?

777
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:30,846
Look.

778
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:34,606
I would love to finish my
chapter on the House of Murphy.

779
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,726
Now, tell me about Cornelius.

780
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,246
Fair enough.

781
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,486
Let me see.

782
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:49,925
Mad bastard from a long
line of mad bastards,

783
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:52,485
not much of a sense of humor,

784
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:55,085
believed to be in league with Lucifer.

785
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,845
Was he now?

786
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,245
And what about his gang?

787
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,165
Well, old Cornelius and his gang

788
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,725
had a knack for snatching the undead.

789
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:05,205
They took it very personally.

790
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,205
It's a family business with them.

791
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,525
His father was the real mastermind,

792
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,485
had Cornelius and his gang
doing all his dirty work,

793
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,125
supposed to be a right evil bastard.

794
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,805
Anyway, Willie and I were
told to stay clear of them,

795
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:19,205
and we did mainly.

796
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,245
That's how it was for years.

797
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,485
We kept our head above water.

798
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,084
Ronnie helped us out by
keeping his ear to the ground.

799
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,924
We even took on an
apprentice, Fanny Bryers.

800
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:32,004
One point, she was a wrecker.

801
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:35,684
A wrecker?

802
00:44:35,724 --> 00:44:38,564
Oh, she would lure
ships onto the rocks

803
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:39,724
and scavenge the wreckage.

804
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:42,644
[People screaming]

805
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:46,404
But she got bored of that

806
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:49,484
and had aspirations of being a snatcher.

807
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:52,324
Fanny Bryers, hmm.

808
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:55,803
Lovely, lovely Fanny Bryers.

809
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:56,883
Lovely.

810
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:58,203
Did you here that, Willie?

811
00:44:58,243 --> 00:44:59,283
Arthur says I'm lovely.

812
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:02,643
Well, he must be drunk,
you boozy old slapper.

813
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:05,323
Oh, shove off, you.

814
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:06,443
I am lovely.

815
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:07,723
You are lovely.

816
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:08,763
You are.

817
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,603
Don't you even listen to him.

818
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:11,923
Oh!

819
00:45:11,963 --> 00:45:15,203
You should be ashamed of your selves.

820
00:45:15,243 --> 00:45:17,163
Here it is.

821
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:18,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

822
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:20,403
That's mine.

823
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:21,483
Ready? Ready?

824
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:22,643
Are you ready, Mr. Grimes?

825
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:23,723
Right, wait a minute.

826
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,963
When I finish this pint,

827
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,843
I'm gonna put the
empty glass on me head,

828
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:29,322
and that's when you two go for it.

829
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:31,162
Right, then?

830
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,362
Okay, here we go.

831
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:35,602
[Indistinct muttering[

832
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:40,602
It's very sexy.

833
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:45,162
# Says my aul wan to your aul wan #

834
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:46,802
# will you come to the Waxies dargle? #

835
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:48,282
# Says your aul wan to my aul wan #

836
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:50,042
# Sure, I haven't got a farthing #

837
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,322
# Just been down to Monto town #

838
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:53,202
# to see uncle McArdle #

839
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:55,482
# But he wouldn't give me half a crown #

840
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:57,162
# for to go to the Waxies dargle #

841
00:45:57,202 --> 00:45:58,202
# What'll you have? #

842
00:45:58,242 --> 00:45:59,242
# I'll have a pint #

843
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:00,482
# I'll have a pint with you, sir #

844
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:02,761
# And if one of us doesn't order soon #

845
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,561
# We'll get chucked out of the boozer #

846
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:07,441
[exuberant Irish music]

847
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,881
# I'll have a pint with you, sir #

848
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:14,281
# And if one of us doesn't order soon #

849
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,241
# We'll get chucked out of the boozer #

850
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,321
[raucous cheering]

851
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:23,081
It's a bleedin' draw.

852
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:24,121
Robbed I was.

853
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,121
I was robbed.

854
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,161
Ha!

855
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,201
I'm catching up with you, old man.

856
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,201
I was robbed of that.

857
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,561
Come here.

858
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,001
You'll have him
the next time, Arthur.

859
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,081
Yeah, I will.

860
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:37,280
I'll have you next time.

861
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,800
Can you two talk business?

862
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,440
Sober as a judge, mate.

863
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,200
You remember Maisey O'Connell?

864
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,920
I'll box your ears in when I get you.

865
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,160
Do you hear me?

866
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,320
A friend of the family.

867
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,560
Is she still not talking to you?

868
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,640
No.

869
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,800
Neither is me family.

870
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,960
She's in here the other night.

871
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,560
She's got a new job
working at the old mortuary,

872
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,000
you know, the place that handles

873
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,960
a lot of the old walking stiff trade.

874
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,320
It's her first night on the job,

875
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,359
and no one had told her about
their more unusual shipments.

876
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,839
What did she come across?

877
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,919
Well, she wouldn't say,

878
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,359
so I filled the aul wan so
full of booze she couldn't walk.

879
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:20,199
I called her a carriage.

880
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,039
I closed the place down.

881
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,799
There's no love nor money

882
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,239
could drag me back to
that place ever again.

883
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,439
Yes, dear.

884
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,239
Get in.

885
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,759
And me with me nerves.

886
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:38,079
So terrified she
was with what she saw,

887
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,199
she insists I ride with her.

888
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,759
You had a bad day, Maisey?

889
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,798
What was that?

890
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,318
A... a bad day, Maisey.

891
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:47,638
Ah.

892
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:51,198
Lantern Jesus, for a moment there

893
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:54,918
I thought I dreamt up the whole thing.

894
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:59,038
Oh, I never want to go
back to that place again.

895
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:02,278
You sure you might not
feel different in the morning?

896
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,438
It's off to the house
of the Lord in the morning.

897
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:11,358
'Twas pure and simple
evil I met up with.

898
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:14,198
Was it something hideous and awful?

899
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:15,477
You can talk to me, Maisey.

900
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,957
I'm a good listener.

901
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:21,757
What did you see today?

902
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:24,757
The living dead.

903
00:48:24,797 --> 00:48:26,477
Bingo.

904
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,477
Lovely.

905
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:29,877
Yeah, the woman was mortified,

906
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,997
said she was expecting
a shipment that morning.

907
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,557
Shipment was to arrive by
boat, but the boat crashed,

908
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:36,957
somewhere off of Langols Island.

909
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,917
Only one of three boxes was recovered.

910
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,917
What was in the box?

911
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,677
Took me ages to prize open the box.

912
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,037
And I'm only an old woman,

913
00:48:48,077 --> 00:48:50,316
and there was nobody else about.

914
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:52,076
Ah, but you got it open.

915
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:55,756
Oh, I opened it, all right.

916
00:49:03,756 --> 00:49:06,636
[Screaming]

917
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:16,356
Brilliant.

918
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,155
That's very funny, Ronnie.

919
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:25,195
Yous two are terrible.

920
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,435
The poor woman.

921
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:29,235
So how'd she get away, Ron?

922
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:32,395
Oh, it had the grip on me.

923
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,955
'Twas the unholy grasp of Satan.

924
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:40,635
I looked into its dead, black eyes,

925
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:45,075
and I could see meself
screaming back at meself.

926
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:50,715
Oh, I thought I was dead for sure.

927
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:55,634
Jesus, Maisey, you're
lucky to be alive.

928
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:58,234
It was horrible,

929
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,594
the pale, spidery thing.

930
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,514
If it hadn't been
for my cross and chain,

931
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:12,954
he would have had me guts for garters.

932
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:16,754
A cross, eh?

933
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,154
A good thing in all
the rest never arrived.

934
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:23,074
Expecting two more we were,

935
00:50:23,114 --> 00:50:27,034
but word has it they got lost at sea.

936
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:31,993
And now they tell me they got
washed up on Langols Island

937
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:35,233
and have to be retrieved.

938
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:38,673
Well, I want nothing more to do with it.

939
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:42,233
It seems a few "surgeons"
believe these things

940
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,153
may be the key to immortality.

941
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:45,353
That's why they're so desperate

942
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,553
to get their hands on these corpses.

943
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:48,633
Immortality?

944
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,513
Well, who's off to
Langols Island, then?

945
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:52,193
Who's with old Willie?

946
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:53,473
Easy pickings.

947
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:55,393
Nice little earner, boys.

948
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:57,033
We'll need a what you may call it,

949
00:50:57,073 --> 00:50:58,393
a crustafix.

950
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,553
A crucifix, love.

951
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:02,472
Yeah, well, there's just
one problem, boys and girls.

952
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,672
Ah, no worries, Ronnie.

953
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:05,832
Name your percentage.

954
00:51:05,872 --> 00:51:07,472
Yeah, well, it is
a tiny little slice,

955
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,592
but that's not the problem.

956
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:13,152
They've, uh, hired somebody to
help them pick up the pieces.

957
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:14,392
Who?

958
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:17,112
It seems the mortuary has
called on the House of Murphy

959
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:18,752
to help them out.

960
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:25,872
That's that, then.

961
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:28,152
Bollocks.

962
00:51:28,192 --> 00:51:29,312
What's the House of Murphy?

963
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,392
Not what, who.

964
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:33,152
It's a vicious gang of body snatchers

965
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:34,552
that I don't want to cross.

966
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,191
We'd be fools to try, Willie.

967
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,671
Now, they can't be all that bad.

968
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,271
Let me tell you something
about the House of Murphy.

969
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,751
First of all, there's
the big wig himself,

970
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,071
Samuel Murphy, Sam the Spider.

971
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,151
Keeps himself well out of sight.

972
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,191
They call him the Spider

973
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,151
because he likes to play
with his victims for hours

974
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:54,151
before killing them.

975
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:55,511
They say once he's ready to kill,

976
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,791
he uses a three-clawed
hook to gauge out the eyes

977
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:00,951
and the tongues of his victims.

978
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:03,831
Then there's his son, Cornelius Murphy.

979
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:08,031
One of the meanest bastards
I've ever met, alive or dead.

980
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,310
Rumor has it he's a corpse grinder,

981
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,390
grinds the bones from
the coffins he's nicked

982
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,390
and sniffs them.

983
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,030
He can smell out the dead
before they're even cold.

984
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,630
Valentine Kelly,
Murphy's right-hand man,

985
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,870
so to speak.

986
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,990
They say she got her name

987
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,350
after she was almost burned to death

988
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,670
by a lover on Valentine's Day.

989
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,670
Her face is so twisted and deformed

990
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,590
that she keeps it hidden except
for those she's about to kill.

991
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,509
Then there's the Bulger.

992
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:45,029
You couldn't find a more loyal servant.

993
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:47,789
Murphy saved him from
being beaten to death once.

994
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,469
Left with no teeth,

995
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:53,869
Murphy had a dentist of sorts
graft dog teeth onto his gums.

996
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,509
Bulger owes him everything.

997
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:59,149
You're all cowards.

998
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,389
There's money to be
made in Langols Island.

999
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,829
That's enough to keep
us all happy and lovely

1000
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:05,469
for a really long time.

1001
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,789
You lot are telling me you're afraid.

1002
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:08,829
In a word, yes.

1003
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:09,909
Yes.

1004
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:11,029
Yeah, looks like it.

1005
00:53:11,069 --> 00:53:13,469
This lot can't be any worse
than what's in those boxes.

1006
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:14,669
Fanny, forget it.

1007
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:20,148
I'm sticking to the cemeteries.

1008
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:21,268
Lads.

1009
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:26,028
Remember, you are our apprentice,

1010
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:27,908
not our partner.

1011
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:29,668
You got to reign it in a little, love.

1012
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:32,908
Thanks, Ronnie, but no thanks.

1013
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:35,308
Yeah, well, maybe it's for the best.

1014
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:38,108
Just thought I'd give
you lads a heads-up.

1015
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,188
Murphy and his lot,

1016
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,268
they won't be on the island
till tomorrow morning.

1017
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,627
There'll be other jobs, Fanny.

1018
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:23,306
When?

1019
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:25,026
There won't be other jobs like this one.

1020
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:26,626
If we're afraid of
crossin' a few knackers

1021
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,666
like this Murphy's lot.

1022
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:30,706
This one could've set us up for a while,

1023
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,706
gave us enough money to enjoy life,

1024
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:36,666
take me down to the Sinister
Duck once in a while,

1025
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:37,746
live it up,

1026
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:41,306
instead of going to that old
kip every night of the week.

1027
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:44,346
What about our dream of
doing better for ourselves?

1028
00:54:44,386 --> 00:54:45,426
You be careful of dreams, Fanny.

1029
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:47,186
They'll lead you down a garden path

1030
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,226
and into a ditch before you know it.

1031
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:50,186
The Fortune of War,

1032
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,746
filled with people who
followed their dreams.

1033
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,106
Look what they got to.

1034
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:54,946
Willie's right,

1035
00:54:54,986 --> 00:54:56,825
keep chipping away at the smaller jobs,

1036
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:58,905
everything else will fall into place.

1037
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:00,665
Willie Grimes.

1038
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:01,985
What about him?

1039
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:04,025
If you had any backbone,
you'd be out on your own

1040
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:06,065
instead of letting that
old drunk lean on you.

1041
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:08,145
He's a drunken old coward,
and he's dragging you down.

1042
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,185
That's not fair.

1043
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:10,225
Willie and I go back a long way.

1044
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,625
You'd be on that island if you
weren't listening to his fears.

1045
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:16,345
We could be on and
off before anyone else.

1046
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:18,185
There'd be no trouble.

1047
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:19,225
It'll end badly,

1048
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:20,505
and it'll end with a lot of blood.

1049
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,105
You don't know what
these people are like.

1050
00:55:22,145 --> 00:55:23,665
This is your first job.

1051
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:25,545
Took me years to get it down.

1052
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:27,305
Willie's right.

1053
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:28,624
You have to earn your keep

1054
00:55:28,664 --> 00:55:30,464
before you tackle a big job like this.

1055
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,744
If we're gonna make it
anywhere in this world,

1056
00:55:33,784 --> 00:55:35,664
we got to stand up for ourselves.

1057
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:37,824
This Cornelius and his
dad can't be all that bad.

1058
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:40,144
No one's that mean.

1059
00:55:43,264 --> 00:55:45,264
When Cornelius was five,

1060
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:49,584
his mother gave him one
of them clockwork toys.

1061
00:55:59,344 --> 00:56:00,784
He loved it.

1062
00:56:00,864 --> 00:56:03,303
He was always playing with
it, always winding it up.

1063
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:07,183
His father stomped on it.

1064
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,183
He just crushed it.

1065
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:14,143
Then there was the time
when little Cornelius

1066
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:16,103
found a baby chick.

1067
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:18,223
Called it Pappy, fed it,

1068
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:22,343
you know, took a shine to it.

1069
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:30,903
His dad crushed the life out of it.

1070
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,223
Poor little Pappy,

1071
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:36,622
all spread out on the floor like that.

1072
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:41,702
Then his mother buys him a rabbit.

1073
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:43,382
This time Cornelius is determined

1074
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:45,942
not to let his old man harm the animal.

1075
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:49,862
At age five, he strangles
it and partially devours it,

1076
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:51,862
just so his old man can't get to it.

1077
00:56:55,142 --> 00:56:57,422
He's a born and bred merciless killer

1078
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,222
trained not to care about life or death.

1079
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:01,582
It's a different league.

1080
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,142
Feck this.

1081
00:57:03,182 --> 00:57:04,502
I'm off to Langols Island.

1082
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,102
I can take care of meself.

1083
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:10,461
And if you and that poxy
Willie Grimes are too scared,

1084
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:11,981
then I'll see you down at the pub later.

1085
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:14,021
You can't go on your own.

1086
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:21,421
Well, then get up out
of bed and come with me.

1087
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:22,901
We need this job, Arthur.

1088
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,141
I'm sick of being broke.

1089
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:26,061
There's good money
coming to us, Fanny.

1090
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:28,021
There'll be no trouble.

1091
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:29,901
Please, Arthur.

1092
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:31,181
We can do this.

1093
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:32,301
What are you doing?

1094
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:35,061
I'll make it worth your while.

1095
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:37,621
It'll end badly.

1096
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,661
Fanny?

1097
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:41,381
Arthur.

1098
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,140
Fanny.

1099
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,260
Forget it.

1100
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,740
There's no way I'm going to the island,

1101
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,780
and that's the last word of it.

1102
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,780
Must be out of our bleeding minds,

1103
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,340
out here at this hour of the night.

1104
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,580
Letting a woman tell you what to do.

1105
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:19,859
Yeah, well, you'll
be thanking me tonight

1106
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:21,099
when we've made a
killing off of this lot.

1107
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:22,979
A killing.

1108
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:24,459
That's what I'm afraid of.

1109
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:26,379
Oh, shut up, Willie.

1110
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:27,459
We're out here now.

1111
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:30,419
We may as well make the most of it.

1112
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:31,579
I can't see a thing in this fog.

1113
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,019
How far is the island?

1114
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,459
Ought to be there by morning
if we don't hit rocks or worse.

1115
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:39,539
Worse?

1116
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:41,299
There are things
swimming around in this sea

1117
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:43,219
that you don't want to come across.

1118
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,619
Have you been out here before?

1119
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,979
No.

1120
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:49,298
Only ever heard the stories.

1121
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:53,218
Me da used to go fishing out here.

1122
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:54,258
Yeah, my little brother and I

1123
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,858
used to watch him from the summit.

1124
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:58,218
That's a really nice memory, Arthur.

1125
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:03,498
There was this one time

1126
00:59:03,538 --> 00:59:06,258
he was coming back in to land.

1127
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:09,618
The water all around
him started bubbling up,

1128
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,258
and then we saw it.

1129
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:18,258
A black mist it was,
surrounding my old man's boat.

1130
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:24,217
Something hidden inside sucked
him down to a watery grave.

1131
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:27,457
[Chuckles]

1132
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,177
Yes, that's a... that's
a lovely memory, Arthur.

1133
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:34,777
Ah, he was all right, he was.

1134
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:36,297
Never laid a hand on us neither.

1135
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:37,377
A hard worker too.

1136
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:41,937
Bloody fool to be
fishing in these waters.

1137
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,417
True.

1138
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:47,257
So we have a few hours on
Murphy and his men, right?

1139
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,857
Ronnie said they wouldn't
be here by morning.

1140
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:53,017
Get the crates, get
the hell out of there.

1141
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,057
No trouble, right, Willie?

1142
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:57,416
That's fine by me.

1143
00:59:57,456 --> 00:59:58,816
Did you bring your crucifix?

1144
01:00:04,536 --> 01:00:08,816
Of course.

1145
01:00:08,816 --> 01:00:09,776
Whoopsie daisey.

1146
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:17,256
[Low roaring sound]

1147
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:22,576
Did you hear that?

1148
01:00:22,616 --> 01:00:24,096
Aye.

1149
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:26,896
What was it?

1150
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:31,815
Arthur's old fella coming
back to give him a clatter.

1151
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:37,095
There's worse things out here
than running into my old dad.

1152
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:38,895
I hate these waters.

1153
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,255
It's eerie.

1154
01:00:43,295 --> 01:00:47,015
I suggest we keep our
mouths closed from here on in.

1155
01:00:47,055 --> 01:00:50,455
Wake me up when we get there.

1156
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:52,935
Must be out of our bleeding minds.

1157
01:00:54,895 --> 01:00:57,775
[Thunder rumbling]

1158
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:50,213
[Roaring]

1159
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:07,213
Excuse me.

1160
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:09,772
Could you keep the noise down, please?

1161
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:12,732
Or I'll cut your bleeding head off.

1162
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,692
What are we gonna do now?

1163
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:31,332
No killing, you said, no trouble.

1164
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,772
We was gonna knock him out with this.

1165
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:35,172
And have him get up and kill us?

1166
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:36,492
You must be daft.

1167
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:37,972
You have no idea
what you've just done.

1168
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:39,692
They've cornered the
market for too long.

1169
01:02:39,692 --> 01:02:40,732
This is our time.

1170
01:02:40,772 --> 01:02:41,772
We're going to be rich.

1171
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:43,371
You stupid cow.

1172
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,651
Willie, just get the
crates side by side.

1173
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,051
Just do it now.

1174
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:50,971
Listen, you,

1175
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,371
I've done foolish things in my life,

1176
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:55,011
but I have never put anyone
in harm's way to make a profit.

1177
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,211
And what you've done here...

1178
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,251
You.

1179
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,331
We go now, with her or without her.

1180
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,131
We may as well get
what we came here for.

1181
01:03:03,171 --> 01:03:05,011
Arthur, have you lost your balls?

1182
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:06,891
No, but look, it's right here.

1183
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:09,291
Listen, if we go now,
we can still go unnoticed.

1184
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,851
Yeah, and empty-handed.

1185
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,531
You don't get it at all, do you?

1186
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:15,250
If we stay here, we're as good as dead.

1187
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,410
He wasn't so hard, was he?

1188
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,170
Come on.

1189
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,610
We don't have all day.

1190
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,770
Not everyone is the boss of me.

1191
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,970
Hey, come on.

1192
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,370
Let's just get it over with.

1193
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,890
Willie.

1194
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,610
Willie!

1195
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,530
What now?

1196
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,530
Get the yokes out of the
crate and into the cage.

1197
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:50,689
I suppose they're just gonna line up

1198
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:52,529
and waltz in there of their own accord.

1199
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:54,969
Hey, look at this.

1200
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,369
What are we supposed to do with that?

1201
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,609
Put it in their mouths.

1202
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:01,529
Stop 'em from biting us.

1203
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:02,689
Look, we'll open up the crates.

1204
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:04,609
When they jump out, we'll
shove this in their mouth.

1205
01:04:04,689 --> 01:04:05,689
Put 'em in the cage.

1206
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:08,009
We'll fill up the cage,
anchor the cage to the boat,

1207
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,129
drag 'em back to the mainland.

1208
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:11,089
Won't they drown?

1209
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:14,729
[Laughter]

1210
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:15,769
Come on, boys.

1211
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:17,489
There's nothing to worry about.

1212
01:04:21,729 --> 01:04:23,088
You got it?

1213
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:24,928
Ready? Careful.

1214
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:27,328
All right.

1215
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,328
What's happening?

1216
01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:36,768
It's horrible.

1217
01:04:36,808 --> 01:04:37,808
Arthur?

1218
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:40,288
There's a foot in here.

1219
01:04:40,328 --> 01:04:42,368
Very bloody odd.

1220
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:45,328
A foot.

1221
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:48,088
That's not gonna
fetch much at market,

1222
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:49,368
is it Willie?

1223
01:04:49,408 --> 01:04:51,368
A foot?

1224
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:52,488
Bloody hell.

1225
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:54,008
Hmm.

1226
01:04:54,048 --> 01:04:56,927
[Loud crash]

1227
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:59,007
[Snarling]

1228
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,727
Hmph.

1229
01:05:16,007 --> 01:05:17,567
[Roars]

1230
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:30,526
Get it off me!

1231
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:32,606
Darling.

1232
01:05:32,646 --> 01:05:35,646
I got it!

1233
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:36,806
Get him off me!

1234
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:39,726
[Screaming]

1235
01:05:42,926 --> 01:05:44,966
Get him still!

01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:58,846
[Snarling]

1237
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:05,845
You okay?

1238
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:07,525
What's it bloody well look like?

1239
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:08,805
[Laughs]

1240
01:06:08,805 --> 01:06:10,485
What the bleeding
hell are you laughing at?

1241
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:11,525
That thing nearly killed me.

1242
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:13,125
It called you darling,
did you hear that?

1243
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:15,365
I think you've got a
new friend there, Willie.

1244
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:16,925
What if I got infected?

1245
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:18,405
What if I'm... what if I'm infected?

1246
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:19,965
What if I turn into one of those things?

1247
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:20,965
Come on, calm down.

1248
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:22,125
It's just... let's have a look.

1249
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:23,805
Looky there.

1250
01:06:23,845 --> 01:06:24,805
[Laughs]

1251
01:06:24,845 --> 01:06:26,285
Oh, go on, laugh it up.

1252
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:28,805
Well, you know, it's pretty...

1253
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:29,805
[wet thud]

1254
01:06:37,924 --> 01:06:43,164
One, two, three, four, and five.

1255
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:46,444
I reckon that's five
dead I'm selling tonight.

1256
01:06:49,564 --> 01:06:51,644
Go on, get out of it.

1257
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:53,564
I blame all of this on you, Arthur.

1258
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,604
Me?

1259
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:55,644
No one dragged you here.

1260
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,844
You and that Fanny have ruined me.

1261
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,604
That bite has me all peculiar.

1262
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:02,604
Don't bring poor old Fanny into it.

1263
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,604
What are we gonna do now?

1264
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:06,324
I have a backup plan.

1265
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:11,523
No.

1266
01:07:11,563 --> 01:07:13,723
Ha.

1267
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,363
Bugger this.

1268
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:17,123
Excuse me, Mr. Murphy.

1269
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:21,763
Perhaps we can come to
some sort of arrangement?

1270
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:25,563
I like the arrangement
we have now, Arthur Blake.

1271
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:28,283
You tied to that cage,

1272
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:31,403
as I strap it to me boat
and drag you along the seabed

1273
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:33,723
for the journey home.

1274
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,563
I just thought you
might need an extra man

1275
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,883
now that you're down Mr. Bulger and all.

1276
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:40,483
I'd rather sell your wet corpse.

1277
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,522
Arthur, you weasel.

1278
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,482
Just go along with me.

1279
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,762
A rat leaving a sinking ship, is it?

1280
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:51,402
That's the one.

1281
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,122
Very honorable.

1282
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:57,042
Now, where was the honor in
trying to rob me of me loot

1283
01:07:57,082 --> 01:07:59,242
and going and killing
my good mate Bulger?

1284
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:05,242
Oh, well, it wasn't really the
intention, you see, Cornelius.

1285
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:06,882
We was just trying to
make a few quid is all.

1286
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:17,681
Tell me, Mr. Blake,
do you like your trade?

1287
01:08:19,321 --> 01:08:20,961
I suppose so.

1288
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:22,721
It's a bit messy, isn't it?

1289
01:08:22,721 --> 01:08:23,841
Well, let me tell you.

1290
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:28,761
I love this trade, Mr. Blake.

1291
01:08:30,121 --> 01:08:33,921
And I come from a very
long line of ghouls.

1292
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:40,281
So you see, I take a great
deal of pride in what I do.

1293
01:08:41,761 --> 01:08:46,721
So when a sleveen like
yourself comes along

1294
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:49,640
and thinks he can cross me,

1295
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,240
well, then,

1296
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,680
that's when I get angry, Mr. Blake.

1297
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,640
And Grimes...

1298
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,960
you should have known better.

1299
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,960
Whoa, now, Cornelius,
don't be like that.

1300
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,040
I was just along for the salt air.

1301
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,000
Valentine.

1302
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,760
Why don't you show 'em your face.

1303
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,119
[All screaming]

1304
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,319
Oh, Willie!

1305
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,999
[Roaring]

1306
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:55,278
[Screaming]

1307
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:56,278
Willie! Willie!

1308
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:25,598
[Screaming]

1309
01:10:27,998 --> 01:10:29,437
Let's go, let's go.

1310
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:38,197
[Screaming]

1311
01:11:00,837 --> 01:11:03,196
Are you two gonna kiss and make up?

1312
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:04,716
'Cause I don't want a ruckus in here,

1313
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:07,996
not before midnight.

1314
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:14,076
What're you looking at?

1315
01:11:15,796 --> 01:11:18,476
You was gonna turn
your back on old Willie.

1316
01:11:20,396 --> 01:11:21,996
No, I was just saying that.

1317
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:23,036
I had a plan.

1318
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,956
A plan.

1319
01:11:24,956 --> 01:11:27,196
You was all set to
join the House of Murphy

1320
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:28,636
and forget about me.

1321
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,396
Me, who taught you everything.

1322
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:31,836
Well, I had to say something.

1323
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:32,916
What do you want from me?

1324
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:36,115
Very, very disappointed
in you, Arthur.

1325
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:37,195
Oh, you're disappointed?

1326
01:11:37,235 --> 01:11:38,355
- Yeah.
- Well, likewise.

1327
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:39,795
And what about poor old Fanny?

1328
01:11:39,835 --> 01:11:40,835
Hmph, Fanny.

1329
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:41,875
[Chuckles]

1330
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:42,955
That daft cow.

1331
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:44,035
She got what she deserved.

1332
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:45,555
Is that all you can say?

1333
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:47,235
Well, it was all her idea.

1334
01:11:47,275 --> 01:11:48,275
Or was it?

1335
01:11:48,315 --> 01:11:50,555
You know, she always
said you were a coward.

1336
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:52,595
She said I should go it alone.

1337
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:54,155
Well, you are going it alone, mate.

1338
01:11:54,195 --> 01:11:56,115
Enough is enough.

1339
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:57,235
Fine.

1340
01:11:58,395 --> 01:11:59,875
Great, good riddance.

1341
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:00,915
Fine, then.

1342
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:02,595
You know, I'll probably do a
lot better on my own, I think.

1343
01:12:02,635 --> 01:12:03,635
- Fine.
- Get out!

1344
01:12:03,675 --> 01:12:04,715
- Fine.
- Get out.

1345
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:05,755
Fine.

1346
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:06,835
Good night, sir.

1347
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,914
Get the fuck out of my bar.

1348
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:16,954
And that's how me and Willie left it,

1349
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:19,994
arguing like a pair of old women.

1350
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:23,194
What a way to end one
of the great friendships.

1351
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:26,194
A week went by, here I am.

1352
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:32,074
But you killed Cornelius Murphy?

1353
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,834
Not my style, Father.

1354
01:12:35,874 --> 01:12:38,474
Well, then it was Grimes
that struck him down.

1355
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:40,834
It was Fanny that did the killing.

1356
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:43,033
We just left Cornelius
and Valentine to it.

1357
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,033
So you just left him to die?

1358
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,633
Oh, aye.

1359
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:56,153
Now here I am, an innocent
man waiting for the guillotine.

1360
01:12:56,193 --> 01:12:59,193
Oh, none of us is
innocent, Mr. Blake.

1361
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:04,873
And I've listened to
your tales, and you're...

1362
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,433
you're far from innocent.

1363
01:13:07,473 --> 01:13:10,113
In fact, I think the
guillotine is too good for you.

1364
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:15,192
Grimes was lucky to have avoided me.

1365
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:23,672
Well...

1366
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:26,472
it's very nice to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Murphy.

1367
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,832
You must be a little
disappointed in your son.

1368
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:38,592
All that training,

1369
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:40,272
and he gets struck down by two commoners

1370
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:43,832
like Grimes and myself.

1371
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:45,992
You're not common, Mr. Blake.

1372
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:49,071
In fact, you're quite rare.

1373
01:13:53,351 --> 01:13:54,831
It's not every day you meet someone

1374
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:57,911
who's about to spend the
rest of their days in agony.

1375
01:13:57,911 --> 01:13:58,951
You best hurry up so.

1376
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:01,871
I'll be under the
blade in a few minutes.

1377
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:03,311
No.

1378
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:06,111
You won't be seeing the guillotine.

1379
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:07,631
You're not as lucky as your friend.

1380
01:14:09,351 --> 01:14:11,151
I've made other arrangements for you.

1381
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,151
You little bastard.

1382
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,991
You do not disrespect
the House of Murphy.

1383
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:20,031
Do you hear me?

1384
01:14:20,071 --> 01:14:21,990
You little bastard!

1385
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:26,030
This is how it ends, Arthur Blake.

1386
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,070
You pup.

1387
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,110
You little pup.

1388
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,710
This is how it ends for you.

1389
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,350
I'll open you!

1390
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,670
Do it, then.

1391
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,750
Do it!

1392
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,230
Your son was an awful prick.

1393
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,270
A prick.

1394
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,630
You little bastard.

1395
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,630
You little bastard!

1396
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,430
Oy!

1397
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:57,269
- Willie.
- Arthur.

1398
01:14:58,149 --> 01:15:00,189
You're undead.

1399
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,709
That bite on the island
has me all supernatural.

1400
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,269
It took me ages to find me head.

1401
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:06,789
It's a... it's a bit disconcerting.

1402
01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:10,789
Well, I thought he had me there.

1403
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:19,189
Oh, he cut you up something horrible.

1404
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:23,429
Well, it's great to see you.

1405
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:24,949
I thought you were
sick of the sight of me.

1406
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:27,469
Ah, no bother.

1407
01:15:29,348 --> 01:15:30,508
You look like shite, Willie.

1408
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:35,468
Oh.

1409
01:15:35,508 --> 01:15:36,948
Well, it's a good thing I went first,

1410
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:40,628
or else you'd be a dead man.

1411
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:42,308
There you go.

1412
01:15:42,348 --> 01:15:43,788
Ah, here we are.

1413
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:45,508
Oh, that's one I owe you.

1414
01:15:45,548 --> 01:15:46,868
[Laughing]

1415
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:49,468
Fancy him, coming after us.

1416
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:50,868
Yeah, I know.

1417
01:15:50,908 --> 01:15:52,148
Said he was a priest.

1418
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,388
Had me going there for a while.

1419
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:54,348
Mad bastard.

1420
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:57,748
Well, he'd fetch us
a few quid, you reckon?

1421
01:15:58,548 --> 01:16:00,068
Let's get out of here.

1422
01:16:00,108 --> 01:16:01,068
Ooh.

1423
01:16:02,707 --> 01:16:04,587
Hey, that's mad, you being undead.

1424
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:06,587
Oh, uh, are you any good at sewing?

1425
01:16:06,627 --> 01:16:07,627
Ha.

1426
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:09,067
So you're like a cat, then?

1427
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,187
Nine lives.

1428
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:12,427
Oh, I figure it
will keep on happening.

1429
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,987
But here's what we should do.

1430
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,187
We should go down to Langols Island

1431
01:16:16,227 --> 01:16:17,427
and find one of them yokes

1432
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,667
and have it take a
little nibble out of you.

1433
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:20,707
No, thanks.

1434
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:22,467
Oh, it's the best thing
that ever happened...

1435
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:23,827
Whoa.

1436
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:25,107
You okay?

1437
01:16:25,107 --> 01:16:27,307
I tell you what, I'll think about it.

1438
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:30,067
Hey, you're not gonna get all
cannibalistic on me, are you?

1439
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:32,227
Ah, no.

1440
01:16:32,267 --> 01:16:34,107
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1441
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:36,586
Mind you...

1442
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,466
I am feeling a bit peckish.

1443
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:39,826
I'll take you down to The Fortune,

1444
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:40,866
get you some supper.

1445
01:16:40,906 --> 01:16:43,746
Oh, it's a different
kind of hunger, Arthur.

1446
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:45,866
Oh, aye?

1447
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:48,186
I'm ravenous, Arthur.

1448
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:49,226
Me?

1449
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:50,306
Give us a nibble.

1450
01:16:50,346 --> 01:16:51,666
No, no, get away from me.

1451
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,626
Don't come near me.
