1
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,651
Over there! Look!

2
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,620
Dwight?

3
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,281
Dwight, don't. Don't.

4
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,420
Hey, asshole!

5
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,293
What are ya, nuts?
The cap's not orange enough for ya?

6
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,524
Get out of these woods!

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,161
I got a right to hunt here.
I got a permit.

8
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,829
If the guy's got a permit...

9
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,497
- Jesus.
- Get out!

10
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,039
Let's go.

11
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,678
That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather...

12
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,812
accent on "step."

13
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,720
He's a lawyer by profession...

14
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,726
but spends most of his time as head
of the Friends of Fish and Wildlife...

15
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,354
an extremist pro-mammal group
here in Vermont.

16
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,597
Almost all of its members,
male and female, look just like Dwight.

17
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,070
My real dad died in a motorcycle wreck
when I was six.

18
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,940
Two years later, Mom hooked up
with Mr. Personality here.

19
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,479
It has not been a barrel of laughs.

20
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,594
There was a certain poignancy,
though, about today's hunting party.

21
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,903
It was my last evening at home.

22
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,908
Tomorrow I was off to New York
to begin my first year...

23
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,308
at New York University Film School.

24
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,238
A freshman.
That was me.

25
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,557
My farewell dinner was a typically
raucous and hilarious affair...

26
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,362
full of warm, good feelings.

27
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,892
That should cover it.

28
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,429
Afterwards, Dwight gave me $600
in spending money...

29
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,237
- Thank you.
- And extended a hearty handshake.

30
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,206
- Where's the subway, please?
- That'd be downstairs.

31
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,647
- That way?
- Right.

32
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,308
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,064
Sorry.

34
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,542
Forget about it.
He's out like a light.

35
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,306
It's the shame of the cities.

36
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,813
- Are you all right? Nothing broken?
- I'm okay.

37
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,049
- That was some nasty spill you took.
- I'm okay.

38
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,551
You sure?

39
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,020
Can I give you a hand
with those bags?

40
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,023
No, thanks.
I'm fine.

41
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,817
You're a smart kid.

42
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,327
Rule number one:

43
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,887
Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person...

44
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,899
and can verify
that he's been bonded.

45
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,231
- Great. Thanks a lot.
- I happen to be bonded...

46
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,237
which is your good fortune.

47
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,175
- Ignore her.
- Get away from me!

48
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,542
"Who's this stranger?"
You're asking yourself.

49
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,447
It's Victor Ray, general manager
of the Victor Ray Car Service.

50
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,678
You're on your way to college?

51
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,085
- Yeah. New York University.
- Good school.

52
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,591
Thanks. I thought I knew where
the subway was. Do you know?

53
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,459
- Yeah, but you don't want the subway.
- Yes, I do. I want the subway.

54
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,963
- Okay. It's over there.
- Thanks.

55
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,159
Let's go!

56
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,570
Kid, in New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,165
A: People who make
a billion dollars a day...

58
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,336
and get laid in some tower
every night.

59
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,815
B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

60
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,182
And C: Guys like me,
the glue of society.

61
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,780
We go, forget about it.
All hell's gonna break loose.

62
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,850
- You mean rich against poor.
- We're on the brink. It's seething.

63
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,225
Come with your Uncle Vic.

64
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,529
For $65 you get an air-conditioned ride
and total peace of mind.

65
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,536
I can't afford that.

66
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,631
That's the new rate. I could take you
for the old rate, which is 50.

67
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,676
It's outta my league.

68
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,677
How much can you go for?

69
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,237
- Go for? I don't know.
- Say 40, which for me is charity.

70
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,875
It's impossible. No.
Ten dollars I can manage.

71
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,118
Ten dollars?

72
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,214
For complete delivery and security
in a mint-condition Bonneville?

73
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,350
- I gotta eat too!
- I can't do better.

74
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,088
It's okay. Listen...

75
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,426
I'll walk or take a bus.

76
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,089
All right, ten bucks.

77
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,364
Come on. I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

78
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,201
Promise you won't tell anybody
I took you for ten.

79
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,333
- Word gets out, I'm finished.
- I won't tell a soul.

80
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,377
Okay. Follow me.

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,107
I'm parked down the street
in a reserved spot.

82
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,614
Let's go.

83
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,048
- Watch out!
- Jesus!

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,484
Watch out!
Suicide attempt, right?

85
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,923
It's bigger than I had imagined.

86
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,518
That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

87
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,393
Don't get me wrong.
There's tremendous things in Queens.

88
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,799
Go to the trunk, kid. It opens
electronically from the inside.

89
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,101
Take everything. You'd be surprised how
many people, excited to be in New York...

90
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,570
Hey! Whoa!

91
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,771
Stop! Stop the car! Stop!

92
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,450
Stop the car, please!

93
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,599
I had been in New York for 19 minutes
and 11 seconds...

94
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,600
and I was already ruined.

95
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,309
Action.

96
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,407
The roommate enters.

97
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,645
Come on in. Come on.
Don't be afraid.

98
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,517
That's it. Come right in.

99
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,455
I'm holding you
in what we call a medium shot.

100
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,619
- A really lovely shot. Very cinematic.
- Listen my name is...

101
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,026
A little confused.

102
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,725
I like it.
It sells.

103
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,496
You think in front of the camera.
Very good. I like that in my actors.

104
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,562
- I'm moving in now.
- Hi. Is this the right room?

105
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,535
Cut.

106
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,468
That's a wrap.
Check it, kids.

107
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,814
- Kellogg?
- Yeah. You're?

108
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,645
Steve Bushak.

109
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,584
- How do you do?
- Really nice to meet you.

110
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,686
I should go
to the police now.

111
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,751
Clark, Kojak is a fictional character.

112
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,262
- Don't involve the police.
- I'm just a victim.

113
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,365
Clark, everybody in this city
is a victim.

114
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,471
Welcome to New York.

115
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,068
Well...

116
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,113
I'm deeply moved.

117
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,715
Sir, I understand your position.
I'm just...

118
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,445
You cannot function
in Introduction to Film...

119
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,783
without owning
Fleeber's Viewpoints in Cinema...

120
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,119
and Selected Readings
in Cinema by...

121
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,783
Fleeber.

122
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,157
I know. Those are your books.
I want to buy them...

123
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,628
They're not to be thought of
as my books.

124
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,632
They are required
and essential reading...

125
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,601
as are the dozen other books
which you must own...

126
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,967
and which will cost you $700.

127
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,869
Off we're
gonna shuffle

128
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,843
Shuffle off to Buffalo

129
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,380
To Niagara in the sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,848
And the wheels go slow

131
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,342
Off we're gonna shuffle

132
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,580
Shuffle off to Buffalo

133
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,122
I'm doing a paper entitled
And the Wheels Go Slow...

134
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,595
Form and Function
in 42nd Street."

135
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:36,124
Oh. That would be
a very interesting idea.

136
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,569
- Take a musical like that...
- I suggest you call home for money.

137
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,073
No, that won't work.
My stepfather won't help...

138
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,234
This is out of Dickens.

139
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,837
You're robbed by a street urchin.
You have a wicked stepfather.

140
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,437
I don't know what to say.

141
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,544
I'm just trying to explain
that I can't get books now.

142
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,418
I'm your faculty advisor,
not your caseworker.

143
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,017
I'm only interested in your academic
career, and may I say candidly...

144
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,756
that you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

145
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,099
Well, I'm sorry,
but being new to New York and...

146
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,837
Excuse me.

147
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,980
I have to leave now.

148
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,393
Excuse me.

149
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,940
Hey, wait up!

150
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,209
Stop him!
Wait!

151
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,729
Watch it!

152
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,731
Bye-bye.

153
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,337
I want my money
and my stuff now!

154
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,702
My money and my clothes,
or I call the cops.

155
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,678
I know who you are.
Enough with this crap!

156
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,446
Where's my stuff?

157
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,920
Upstairs. Give me a hand
with the wagon, would you?

158
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,820
You must be joking.

159
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,620
Hey, the party's over.

160
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,628
I victimized you in a moment
of weakness, and now justice is done.

161
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,459
So give me a hand.

162
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,562
You have my money?
Do you hear me?

163
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,767
Watch your step, kid.
The floors are wet.

164
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,310
If you don't give me
the money immediately...

165
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,814
I would love nothing
more than to do just that.

166
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,077
However...

167
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,085
here we run into
an awkward moment.

168
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,255
Tragically...

169
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,257
I suffer from a gambling problem.

170
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,386
I placed a wager on a horse.

171
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,990
You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

172
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,500
In retrospect, I'm not sure
it actually was a horse.

173
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,935
Oh, God.

174
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,098
I swear,
it was a responsible bet.

175
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,201
It was a four-to-one shot.
We took a beating.

176
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,008
The good news is I still got
most of your clothes here.

177
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,810
I'm going to the police now.

178
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,216
Why are we talking about the police?
You're in college. I'm a working man.

179
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,221
This has nothing to do
with the police.

180
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,156
Robbery is still a crime
in New York, is it not?

181
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,388
- It's not legal.
- It depends on the circumstances.

182
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,522
Bullshit.

183
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,499
What if I got you a job?
An unbelievable opportunity.

184
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,002
Oh, yeah.
You're just the guy.

185
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,231
I'm serious.
In fact...

186
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,240
No, no.
Forget about it.

187
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,244
What?

188
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,250
It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

189
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,487
What is it?

190
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,185
I shouldn't even
offer you this job...

191
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,523
but you put me
in such an awkward position...

192
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,859
between my terrible
feelings of guilt towards you...

193
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,625
and my family obligations.

194
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,190
I don't know
what you're talking about.

195
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,136
I'm talking about offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

196
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,039
It'd be perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours. Big money.

197
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:41,546
My sister's gonna kill me.
She's gonna blow my brains out.

198
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,646
What kind of work is it?
Stealing cars?

199
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,550
Hey, if you're gonna be
a cynic here...

200
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
You expect me to trust you after you
drive away with everything I own?

201
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,693
You don't have to do anything.

202
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,198
I'm just giving you a choice is all.

203
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,064
But if you want to make
some serious money...

204
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,593
be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

205
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,941
120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

206
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,345
Yeah. You'll be working
for my uncle Carmine. A great man.

207
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,251
He's the smart one
in the family.

208
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,122
Hey, look who's here.
Don't be shy, Clark. Come right in.

209
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,131
I wasn't sure
if this was the place.

210
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,429
This is it.
The best neighborhood in New York.

211
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,494
My uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

212
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,704
Over there at the desk.
That's him.

213
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,807
- He's your uncle?
- Yeah. Look, do me a favor.

214
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,818
Don't say anything
about my gambling...

215
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,820
or I'll catch a beating.

216
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,022
I said, How are you doing?"

217
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,031
- Very well," he says.
- Hello there.

218
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,660
Lorenzo, this is my good friend Clark
from Kansas.

219
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,670
Vermont.

220
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,271
"My heart is filled
with much happiness...

221
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,333
in meeting you,"
he says.

222
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,448
God Almighty.

223
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,020
You're thinking about
the resemblance, right?

224
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,114
- I can't believe it.
- He's the real thing.

225
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,457
When they saw him,
they based the movie.

226
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,895
So is he like a Mafia guy?

227
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,834
No, no. Local businessman.
Importer. That's it.

228
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,428
- What a kisser, huh?
- Unbelievable.

229
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,679
Clark, this is my uncle,
Carmine Sabatini.

230
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,443
Uncle Carmine, this is Clark...

231
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,247
- Hey, you never told me your last name.
- Kellogg.

232
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,287
- Just like the cereal.
- Yeah.

233
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,384
Like the breakfast cereal.

234
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,725
- Your resemblance to the Godf...
- Clark, have a seat.

235
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,731
Pull up a chair.

236
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,733
Thank you.

237
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,174
How'd you like a nut?

238
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,675
No, thank you.

239
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,678
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

240
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,847
Did you ever try Italian coffee?

241
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,619
How would you like
to try a little taste?

242
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,020
Yeah. Why not?

243
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,583
- Good.
- None for me, Uncle Carmine.

244
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,128
Lorenzo.

245
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,632
Two espressos," he says.

246
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,097
You know, that picture
on the wall back there...

247
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,105
that wouldn't
by any chance be Mussolini?

248
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,871
It ain't Tony Bennett.

249
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,905
Some of the older members
of the club...

250
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,711
just...
I don't know...

251
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,412
They keep it up there
for sentiment.

252
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,682
- Sentiment?
- Yeah, you know, the old days.

253
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,918
For the old days.
For good or for bad.

254
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,119
It'd be like, for you,
I suppose...

255
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,219
a picture of the Beatles.

256
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,093
Yeah. The Beatles.

257
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,326
They're actually
before my time.

258
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,335
Well, whatever.
You understand.

259
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,337
Sure. It's not
for political reasons...

260
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,635
that you keep the picture up.

261
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,676
It's not political.

262
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,904
No, it's definitely
not political.

263
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,539
My nephew tells me
you're from Kansas.

264
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,449
Vermont.

265
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,076
Vermont.

266
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,314
Six of one, half a dozen
of the other.

267
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,357
You know,
the most important thing is...

268
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,018
we're all Americans.

269
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,528
- That's right.
- Yes, that's right.

270
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,425
Ah, good, Lorenzo.
Thank you.

271
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,402
- "Thank you,' he says.
- I know.

272
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,632
Now, this is real Italian coffee.

273
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,939
It's not like regular coffee.
It's...

274
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,502
You know what I mean?

275
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,210
It's a little strong, so we gotta
put a little sugar in here.

276
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,219
It cuts the...

277
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,881
It cuts the strength of it,
you know.

278
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,789
Maybe a little more,
that's all.

279
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,553
All right.
Drink it right down.

280
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,222
One gulp.

281
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,305
Puts hair on your chest.

282
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,405
Did my nephew
explain this job to you?

283
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,416
No. No, not really.

284
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,946
It would be best for you to explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

285
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,783
This is not complicated...

286
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,588
but it has to be done right.

287
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,687
- You know, like all things.
- Sure.

288
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,665
Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.,
outside the club...

289
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,930
is gonna be parked a, uh, car.

290
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,030
- What was that?
- Sedan Deville.

291
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,366
That's a type of Cadillac.
A Cadillac?

292
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,812
Yeah, this is
a type of Cadillac.

293
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,875
Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

294
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,978
There you're going
to pick up a package...

295
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:01,253
addressed to Larry London.

296
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,489
You deliver this package
to Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

297
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,292
That's it.

298
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,230
How far is that?
All day?

299
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,325
That shouldn't take you
more than three hours...

300
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,233
the whole trip,
back and forth.

301
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,932
That depends on the traffic.

302
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,634
- Right.
- Then again, you never know.

303
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,074
You could breeze
out there in no time...

304
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,079
or you could wind up
bumper-to-bumper for three hours...

305
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,081
sitting with your dick
in your hand.

306
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,948
Anyway, that's why I need someone
who can use their head...

307
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,485
that's not gonna get upset, nervous...
no matter what happens.

308
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,225
- Understand?
- Right. I understand that.

309
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,033
For this service,
I'm gonna pay you $500.

310
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,030
Five hundred dollars?

311
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,104
Now you see why
my sister's so pissed?

312
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,270
I mean angry,
besides herself.

313
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,873
You're gonna pull in
a grand a week, at least.

314
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,746
- $1,000 a week?
- Yeah.

315
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,310
I'm gonna need
two trips a week, minimum.

316
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:08,155
And then, of course,
if things get busy, maybe even more.

317
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,724
Jesus. I hadn't thought
of that much money.

318
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,702
I don't know.

319
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,973
- You don't know what?
- Now, wait. Just hold on.

320
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,102
Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

321
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,411
He's trying to understand
what the nature of this job is.

322
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,043
What are your thoughts
on this, Kent?

323
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,815
- Clark.
- Sorry. Clark.

324
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,660
I have to ask you something.

325
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,594
I dont want you
to take it wrong.

326
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,897
No, no, no.
Anything. Go ahead.

327
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,197
I smell a rat.

328
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,337
You smell a rat?

329
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,904
He smells a rat.

330
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,507
That's right.

331
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,882
You know why
you smell a rat?

332
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,584
Because God gave you a brain,
that's why.

333
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,491
Because you're asking yourself...

334
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:21,294
What is this?
A man will pay me $500 a trip...

335
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,334
to go pick up
a package and deliver it."

336
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,771
- Is this what you're thinking?
- That's right. That's what I'm feeling.

337
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,330
Well, this is natural.
Natural.

338
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,274
Great.
So then you understand.

339
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,144
Oh, sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

340
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,420
Give me your hand.

341
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:56,123
- You know what this is?
- You mean taking my hand?

342
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,136
We call this
the hand of friendship.

343
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,263
We?

344
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,864
Clark, you dont know
what this is...

345
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,934
the hand of friendship
from my uncle Carmine.

346
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,708
I want you to take
this opportunity.

347
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,114
Totally legitimate work
for $1,000 a week...

348
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,210
and I know you're not gonna
disappoint me.

349
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,522
I don't see
how I could say no.

350
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,263
This is not a yes.

351
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,960
I want to hear yes.

352
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,511
Yes.

353
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,849
Good.

354
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,146
That's good. Now I'm happy.
I'm so happy.

355
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,589
But I don't know
why I'm so happy. That's good.

356
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,455
Come on.

357
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,461
Everybody up.

358
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,361
I want you to come to my house
in Queens tonight.

359
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,903
- He's gonna...
- Yeah. Pick up the keys.

360
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,905
I'll give you directions.

361
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,201
You know...

362
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,836
I have such good feelings
about you.

363
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,845
I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

364
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,421
I never had a son.

365
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,459
For fifteen years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

366
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,869
Never.

367
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,208
Senator.

368
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,649
We're both part
of the same hypocrisy.

369
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,018
But never think
it applies to my family.

370
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,391
All right.

371
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,226
Some people have to play little games.

372
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,064
You play yours.

373
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:18,135
Let's say that you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.

374
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,110
But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

375
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,908
And one more thing.

376
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,415
Don't you contact me again.
Ever.

377
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,214
From now on,
you deal with Turnbull.

378
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,319
Senator.

379
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,087
You can have my answer now
if you like.

380
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,096
My offer is this: Nothing.

381
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,632
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

382
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,261
which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

383
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,566
Senator.

384
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,543
My offer is this: Nothing."

385
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:58,208
In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal...

386
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:03,311
that there is no separation
between politics and gangsterism.

387
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:08,018
Now, in the Fleeber treatise,
"Guns and Provolone"...

388
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,890
what point is made
about the similarities...

389
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,225
between Karl Marx's
Das Kapital...

390
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,528
Immanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...

391
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,161
and the Lake Tahoe scene
from Godfather II, Mr. Kellogg?

392
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,670
Sir.

393
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,107
You haven't read
the Fleeber piece?

394
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:29,510
- Well...
- You need tutoring from Mr. Bushak?

395
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,811
No, sir.

396
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,511
Perhaps Mr. Bushak would enjoy
helping you prepare...

397
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,554
a five-page answer
to my question...

398
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,181
which I want on my desk
by noon tomorrow.

399
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,918
Mr. Glassman.

400
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,051
In an evolving society...

401
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,255
violence and Narcissism
replace ra...

402
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,763
Shut up!

403
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,564
I hate this guy.

404
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,379
You're Clark.

405
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,082
Yes, I'm Clark.

406
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,354
I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

407
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,452
Oh. I didn't know
that he had a daughter, only.

408
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,327
He does.
I'm her.

409
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,195
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

410
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,245
This is quite a house.
It's very European.

411
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,477
Can I get you something
to drink? Beer? Sprite?

412
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,485
Oh, no, thanks.

413
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,355
Jesus, look at that.

414
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,755
Wow. What a job they did.

415
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,060
- Job?
- Copying job. Yeah.

416
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,760
Down to the little cracks
and everything.

417
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,099
This isn't a copy.
This is it.

418
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,503
- Right.
- I'm very serious.

419
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,337
This has to be a copy, okay?

420
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,106
Do you remember
about ten years ago...

421
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,114
the original toured the country?

422
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,913
- It did?
- They brought it over from the Louvre.

423
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,387
- Who?
- I don't know who. They.'

424
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,687
It was in the United States
is my point.

425
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,694
And?

426
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,293
And it stayed here.

427
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,196
The one they shipped back to Paris...

428
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,258
the one behind
all that thick glass...

429
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,600
that all the tourists
take the pictures of...

430
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,195
that's the copy.

431
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,333
My dad thought
it was just awful...

432
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,810
such a masterpiece
behind all that thick glass.

433
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,906
And he had such a special feeling
for it...

434
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,110
his whole life.

435
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,085
Sort of an obsession, really.

436
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,486
So he ripped off the Mona Lisa?

437
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,786
The day it arrived here...

438
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,827
I was, like, nine.

439
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,489
My dad unwrapped it
outta this huge crate.

440
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:04,024
There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

441
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,833
And suddenly,
there it was.

442
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,034
And he turned to me...

443
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,043
I'll never forget this.

444
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,342
And he said...

445
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,178
Now I'm happy, sugar.

446
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,547
Now I got the Mona Lisa."

447
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,918
It's safe here in Queens?

448
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,365
People don't steal things
from my father.

449
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,301
- They don't?
- No.

450
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,932
Mona Lisa

451
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,171
Men have named you

452
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,008
You want to dance?

453
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,071
- Here?
- Here.

454
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,282
- It's kind of hot.
- Take your sweater off.

455
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,988
For that Mona Lisa strangeness

456
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,897
In your smile

457
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,528
Do you smile to tempt a lover

458
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,767
Mona Lisa

459
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,673
Or is this your way

460
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,907
To hide a broken heart

461
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,609
Many dreams

462
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:30,711
Have been brought to your doorstep

463
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,884
So my dad tells me
you're from Nebraska.

464
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,154
Vermont.

465
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,253
So what do you think
of New York?

466
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,958
I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.

467
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,967
I'm going on pure instinct.

468
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,998
Well, that's what you're
supposed to do in New York.

469
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,046
Is your father
in the house now?

470
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,521
No.

471
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,388
He's in the Bronx
at some meeting.

472
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,598
Aunt Angelina.

473
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,168
My head's killing me.
I gotta go to bed.

474
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,799
Aunt Angelina, this is Clark.
Remember, Dad mentioned?

475
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,072
- Who?
- Clark, the boy working for Dad.

476
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:31,104
I'm going to bed, watch Jeopardy.
You come up, Tina?

477
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,151
After Clark leaves.

478
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,708
Good night, Aunt Angelina.

479
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,381
Yeah, yeah. Night.

480
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,054
Dad's sister.

481
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,652
She moved in when my mother died.
I was four.

482
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,390
I was six.

483
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,365
- Your mom?
- No, my dad.

484
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,130
But it's never the same.

485
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,433
No, but what can you do?

486
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,700
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

487
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,445
I'll get you the keys to the car.

488
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,347
I'm a sophomore at the College
of the Sacred Virgin.

489
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,614
Don't laugh. Next year
I'm switching to Harvard.

490
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,850
Harvard?
Jesus, that's really something.

491
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,189
I didn't even bother applying there
with my grades in high school.

492
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,387
Not that they were terrible.

493
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,297
My grades are nothing special...
about a B-minus.

494
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,562
So how did you get in?

495
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,468
- Your boards must have been monsters.
- Oh, it's Dad.

496
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,665
He called Harvard
and said I wanted to go...

497
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,835
and they said,
Oh. Sure."

498
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,310
Wait a minute. Are we talking
about the same Harvard?

499
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,974
The one that's in
Cambridge, Massachusetts?

500
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,075
Of course.
Harvard needs my dad, you know.

501
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,620
They don't want strikes
by the janitors...

502
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,020
or if they want the laundry done
and the gardening...

503
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,615
All those great
old trees and lawns.

504
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,629
But he's an importer.
Right?

505
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,358
It's great meeting you, Clark.

506
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,926
A guy from Vermont,
real American, New Englandy."

507
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,633
Hold on. He's an importer.
Just tell me.

508
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,471
He's an importer, yes.

509
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,139
An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

510
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,978
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

511
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,246
What am I picking up
at the airport?

512
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,045
Hint: It's pretty big.

513
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,421
- Bring someone to help you out.
- But what is it?

514
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,427
If Dad didn't tell you,
I can't really.

515
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,019
It's not going to be...

516
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,624
like, a dead guy in a box
or something, is it?

517
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,204
What an imagination!

518
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,173
You're so unbelievably cute.

519
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,180
I can't wait to see you again.
I could just eat you up.

520
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,487
Good luck tomorrow.

521
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,471
You boys need me?

522
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,042
Are you Leo?

523
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,603
- I am Big Leo.
- It just says Leo.

524
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,945
We are the same,
Leo and Big Leo.

525
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,881
You're synonymous.

526
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,352
That's right.

527
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,555
- Okay. Come with me.
- You don't bring it out?

528
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,964
No.
Not this I don't.

529
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,608
"Not this I don't."

530
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,618
- Remember those words.
- Not very encouraging.

531
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,690
Here it is.
All yours.

532
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,693
It arrived this morning
on the red-eye from Borneo.

533
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,766
I'm gonna puke my guts out.

534
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,565
- What is it?
- A lizard.

535
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,573
That thing is a lizard?

536
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,166
Yeah. They call it
the Komodo dragon.

537
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,541
Makes its home
in Indonesia, Sumatra...

538
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,773
Komodo Island,
in point of fact.

539
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,908
By the way, tell Mr. Sabatini...

540
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,919
this cost him an extra eight bills
to get through.

541
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:34,253
- Excuse me?
- Just tell him. He'II understand.

542
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:39,194
- Sign here by the "X," recipient.
- That's me.

543
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,026
That's you.
You're the recipient.

544
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,801
Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

545
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,770
They got to have a lot of fresh air.
The gills or something.

546
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,830
He doesn't have any gills.

547
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:55,072
Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

548
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,047
And make sure you
get a seat belt on him.

549
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,140
If he jumps on you...

550
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,154
you got major troubles.

551
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,121
Down boy.

552
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,685
- It's not a dog.
- Yeah. You know what?

553
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,733
We got to pick him up.

554
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,292
- Pick him up.
- Yeah.

555
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,964
- With what?
- With our hands. Here.

556
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,701
It's not that bad, you know that?

557
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,573
I agreed to help, but I'm not
putting my life in danger...

558
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:31,979
- Help me out here.
- I'm sorry, but I refuse to handle it.

559
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,517
- I'm not trained.
- He's going under the truck.

560
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,519
All right.

561
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,449
- Get the door.
- You locked it, genius.

562
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,459
Right.

563
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,722
Will you take him?
Just take him for a second.

564
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,732
You're the recipient.

565
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,937
Hurry. If he stains me,
I'm gonna be pissed.

566
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,874
Could you take
any longer with this?

567
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,877
Okay. All right.

568
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,911
Okay, now, you go around
and get in the other side.

569
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,321
Major trouble.

570
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,327
We got to put
the seat belt on him.

571
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,196
- You're joking.
- No, I am not joking.

572
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,134
This is obviously precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

573
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,034
Come on.

574
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,665
- Whoa, whoa. What seat belt?
- Put him in this one.

575
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,709
Okay. Got it.
Seat belt.

576
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,370
Get this under his armpit.

577
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,439
- What armpit?
- This is a lizard armpit. Put it in.

578
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,851
That lizard armpit.
I see. I didn't realize.

579
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,855
You know...

580
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,695
- I think he's okay.
- Let's go.

581
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,641
Happy as a clam.

582
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,342
I'm dying. Close the window.
Turn on the air conditioner.

583
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,576
- He said to leave them open.
- Who? Haystack Calhoun?

584
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,142
What is he, a zoologist?
I'll take full responsibility.

585
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,687
All right.

586
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,461
I told you he'd throw up.

587
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,167
My apologies.
I got to open the window. The stench!

588
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,172
It's murder.

589
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,243
Feeling better?
Tummy ache all gone?

590
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,150
- God, it stinks in here.
- I can't stand it.

591
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,152
We got to wash it out.
Pull over.

592
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,619
All right.

593
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,964
Excuse me.
Hello?

594
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,625
I need some water.
A hose.

595
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,465
Around the corner.
Help yourself.

596
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,334
Thanks.
It's this way.

597
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,340
It's around the back.

598
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,411
He went under a car.

599
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,039
You go that way.

600
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,608
Will the owner of the reptile
please report to the information booth.

601
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,351
Will the owner of the reptile...

602
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,394
- Don't panic.
- What if I can't find him?

603
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,863
Look. Leave the country.
Five, ten years, you come back.

604
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,400
You're kidding?
I'm serious!

605
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,485
Security to Concourse B.

606
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,151
Security to Concourse B immediately.

607
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,292
Okay. Go.

608
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,094
Will the owner of the reptile
report to information.

609
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,966
Slowly.

610
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,972
I'm losing him.

611
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,043
Hey. Hold it. Yes.

612
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,581
I'm really afraid now.

613
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,011
Mr. London?

614
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,312
Edward?

615
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,111
Oh, look!

616
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,813
It's here.
Finally.

617
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,523
Are you Edward?

618
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:25,221
I am.
Oh, what a beautiful specimen!

619
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,669
Has this bad boy been swimming?

620
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,500
Gee. We wouldn't know.
We came right from the airport.

621
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,803
They just love swimming pools.

622
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,810
But... chlorine.

623
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,014
I told him
he is very disobedient dragon.

624
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,615
For joke.

625
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,258
It's a good joke.
It's very unusual.

626
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,955
Well, without humor,
what do we have?

627
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,644
Beautiful, yes?

628
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,647
This is like a zoo?

629
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,649
This is like a zoo.

630
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,186
Can you believe this?

631
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,192
So do you, like,
exhibit rare animals?

632
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,692
On occasion.

633
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,690
Who are these boys?

634
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:44,003
Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

635
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,470
Young men,
this is Mr. Larry London.

636
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,411
Mr. London,
I'm Clark Kellogg.

637
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:59,115
Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

638
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,257
Well, I realize that, sir.
Yes, we are two boys.

639
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,319
As you quite rightly point out.

640
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:12,158
However, since I'm
somewhat new to the area...

641
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:15,865
and this parcel...
this particular parcel was quite bulky.

642
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,702
So at the suggestion of Tina...

643
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:26,210
The beautiful Tina.

644
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,615
Yes, the beautiful Tina.

645
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:34,315
Again, sir, if there was any
misunderstanding, I apologize.

646
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:38,851
Carmine said one boy,
and here are two.

647
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,431
Ya gotta like this guy.

648
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,761
Smells like basil.

649
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,034
Very good.

650
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,838
A cream basil sauce.

651
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,471
So you're actually a chef.

652
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,481
I wasn't clear what you did.

653
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,276
And now you'll get your money.

654
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,352
The money...

655
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,949
The money is conveyed...

656
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,018
in a brown paper bag.

657
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,535
Not very attractive, I know.

658
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,935
That's fine, sir.

659
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,168
If it is in your nature to count it,
I will not be offended.

660
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,040
That won't be necessary.

661
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,579
I certainly trust you
and Mr. Sabatini.

662
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,257
That means
my heart swims in blood."

663
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,028
I believe that's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentlemen.

664
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,129
Something is way off.
Way off.

665
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,712
How are you, darling?
How's New York?

666
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,843
Oh, well, I miss you too,
like crazy.

667
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,254
At the risk of sounding like,
you know, a mother.

668
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,316
No, he's asleep,
thank God. Why?

669
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,694
Well, the thing is,
I got this job.

670
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,960
Will you listen?
New York is unbelievably expensive.

671
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,400
I had to.

672
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,404
Well...

673
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,599
it mostly involved driving.

674
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,608
And...

675
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,405
picking up this reptile.

676
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,311
What kind of a reptile?
Clark, I don't...

677
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,781
It's a Komodo dragon.

678
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,251
Who? Komodo dragon?
I never heard of it.

679
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,254
Would you look it up?

680
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,392
What?

681
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,864
- Komodo. Is that with a "K"?
- Right.

682
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,434
Koalamundi."

683
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,372
Kodiak."
Komodo dragon." Here we go.

684
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,207
Latin name is
Varanus komodoensis.

685
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,338
Main prey are
deer and wild pig.

686
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:15,511
There are seven dragons
in zoos outside Indonesia."

687
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,315
- Oh, my God.
- What?

688
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,049
- Oh, Clark!
- What?

689
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,320
Chances for survival
are considered hopeless."

690
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,623
Clark, it's an endangered species.
