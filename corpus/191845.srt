1
00:01:58,808 --> 00:01:59,968
Mingo!

2
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,477
There he is!

3
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,679
-l see him !
-Come on!

4
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:37,512
-Lookit, l`m bleeding.
-Give me my money.

5
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:40,482
-What about my money?
-You ruined my clothes.

6
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,882
That`s sixteen dollars.

7
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:49,384
This is your dog?

8
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,859
Friend of mine, man.

9
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,124
You give me money.
l want my money.

10
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,188
Get off, man.

11
00:02:58,368 --> 00:02:59,960
l just want my dog.

12
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,197
What about my taxi?

13
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,330
Yo, fuck your taxi, man.

14
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:12,578
You finished?

15
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,759
Come on.

16
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,041
Well, l`m late.

17
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,284
You ever see a burial at sea?

18
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,518
They take a guy...

19
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:58,755
and they wrap him up
in sailcloth.

20
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,662
They sew him up
with a five-inch shell...

21
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:03,825
so it goes down,
down the deep six.

22
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,767
You know what l mean?

23
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,599
Poor Mingo.

24
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:08,797
Jeez.

25
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,939
You have to dig so deep?

26
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,372
Let`s hope somebody digs for me
this deep when l`m gone.

27
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,825
A whole week
after D-day Okinawa...

28
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:34,193
we didn`t have one solid meal.

29
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,722
Evey time, you know,
they`d blow us to go to chow--

30
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,031
Not a goddamn thing here.

31
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,765
We`re halfway down the ladder,
you know, and...

32
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:46,006
l`m hungy, God damn it!

33
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:49,102
-l can tell you that.
-We got to eat soon, man.

34
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:50,510
Look at this dump.

35
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,744
People are becoming
goddamn rabbits.

36
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,581
Goddamn.
People don`t eat meat anymore.

37
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,644
We got to get something to eat.

38
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,987
All that complaining
ain`t making shit better, man.

39
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,219
We got to get food.

40
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,124
l got a gun.

41
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:10,828
Come over here, man.

42
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,232
What kind of gun is this?
A Toka...

43
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,133
A gun is a gun, you know.

44
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,297
They--they kill people.

45
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,273
Check the barrel
and don`t point it at me.

46
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,832
What the fuck
are you talking about?

47
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,174
The first thing you do
when you find a gun...

48
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,543
is to check the barrel.

49
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,810
You fire this, you know...

50
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,874
and the barrel`s clogged...

51
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,578
it`ll blow up in your hand.

52
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,713
-Don`t fuck around with that.
-What the fuck you doing?

53
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,555
l can get twenty bucks for this
with or without bullets.

54
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,788
Don`t wory about it.
Forget it ever came up.

55
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:39,954
Food.

56
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,623
Forget this trash here, man.

57
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:44,155
l know where we can get
some real food, Hank.

58
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,997
Yeah, l know
where some real food is.

59
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,167
Just don`t tell me any more
of them fucking stories.

60
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,037
You know l don`t chicken out...

61
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,138
but l got a funny feeling
about this.

62
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:00,411
Come on, Hank, you just got
to trust me, all right?

63
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,078
l know what l`m doing.
Just stay right here.

64
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,677
You`re a fool.

65
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,814
They got watchdogs
all over the place.

66
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,881
l`ve known this dog
longer than l`ve known you.

67
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,325
You never listen to me.

68
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:15,089
Hey, Hank,
what do you know about this?

69
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,726
Come here, dog.

70
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:21,260
Yeah, l told you.

71
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:24,273
Hey, we got enough
for lots of folks!

72
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:26,605
Well, l finally caught your ass.

73
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:29,669
We`re just hungy.
Give us a break, will you?

74
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,202
We`ll give it back!

75
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:34,114
lt`s already contaminated
with your filth.

76
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,515
Somebody`s going to pay.

77
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,111
Leave the old man alone!

78
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,620
Pulling a gun on me, huh?

79
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,355
You going to hurt me?

80
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,992
Hurt you? No, l`m not going
to hurt you at all.

81
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,592
l`m going to kill me
somebody tonight.

82
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,799
You`re right.
Somebody`s going to die tonight.

83
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,368
Yeah.
lt`s going to be you...

84
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:07,008
maybe all of us.
Let`s all die.

85
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,484
You`re a crazy motherfucker.

86
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,647
l`ll take this stick and ram it
up your ass, make a popsicle.

87
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,657
You ain`t shit.
You like beating up old people?

88
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:18,320
l can clock you in the head.
Let`s go see the devil.

89
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,124
Would you like that?

90
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,631
Man, get the fuck out of here!

91
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,565
Hey, man, you crazy!

92
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,933
And don`t come back, you hear?

93
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,374
l handled that.
Hop the fence and get the meat.

94
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,674
Aw, go fuck yourself.

95
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,947
Aw, shit.

96
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:13,347
We want to thank you, mister.

97
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,112
Want help with the fire?

98
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,311
No, that`s all right.

99
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,184
l say something wrong?

100
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,386
lt ain`t your fault.

101
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:34,134
Now, look, what`s done is done.

102
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,502
Blaming yourself for
what happened two years ago...

103
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,200
won`t change a damn thing.

104
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,402
-Finished?
-No, just starting.

105
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:44,004
l`m going to get you
on your feet again.

106
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,744
Ain`t nobody ever going to give
a break to nobody like me.

107
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:51,311
Fuck `em all,
and give yourself one, too.

108
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:54,187
lt`s up to you to get your life
back on track again...

109
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,747
not nobody else.

110
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,659
No matter what l do, somebody`s
going to knock me down.

111
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:02,096
Don`t let `em. Once you get
your confidence back...

112
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:04,622
you fight them
with eveything you got...

113
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,135
to hold on with.
l mean eveything.

114
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,401
You got all this philosophy.
What happened to you?

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,567
Aw, shit.

116
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:15,634
Last time l was on track...

117
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:17,737
l was still a virgin.

118
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,341
All this food seems to be going
to your head.

119
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,181
You getting sentimental, man.

120
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,349
God`s still constipated.

121
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:07,889
Get up, Hank.

122
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,699
Shit.

123
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,464
Another fucked-up day.

124
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,404
Get up, Hank!

125
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,613
Oh, man.

126
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:34,919
You can`t die on me, Hank.

127
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,815
l`ll take one of those bags.

128
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,223
Oh, there`s my buddy, huh?

129
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,726
When did you get out of jail?

130
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,420
Here. God bless you.
You take care of yourself.

131
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,465
Hey, hey, hey!
Don`t you want a free lunch?

132
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,970
No such thing.

133
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,767
Hey, wait!

134
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,637
l only want to help you.

135
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,211
Oh, shit.

136
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,714
What`s wrong with you, man?
Get up!

137
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,290
-Hey, get the fuck off me!
-l`m tying to help you.

138
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,424
-l don`t want your help!
-Don`t kill yourself!

139
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,402
-l`ve been through rough times.
-Like what, your Jacuzzi broke?

140
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:30,098
-There`s always another way out.
-Like what?

141
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,697
Like letting someone help you.

142
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,436
Why the fuck
would you want to help me?

143
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:36,502
Because life
has been good to me.

144
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,012
l saw you and thought...

145
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:41,676
it`s a chance for me
to make a difference to someone.

146
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:44,584
Why don`t you save that shit
for somebody who gives a fuck?

147
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:49,053
Look, man, you`re young,
you know? You`re healthy.

148
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,718
You seem intelligent.

149
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,886
Why would you want
to kill yourself?

150
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:55,227
Maybe l like choosing
when l die.

151
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:57,425
Don`t you have family,
people who care?

152
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,264
l had a wife and a kid,
and they`re dead.

153
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,965
-lsn`t there anyone else?
-No!

154
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,905
l find that hard to believe!

155
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:08,206
l don`t want anybody
to care about me.

156
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,678
l don`t want to be responsible
for anybody else`s feelings.

157
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:12,374
l`m through with this shit.

158
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,145
Hey, let me ask you something!

159
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:18,176
lf someone offered you
a good job...

160
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,688
something that would be
a real opportunity...

161
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:21,883
would you be interested?

162
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,655
OK.

163
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,791
Well, if you ever want
to look me up...

164
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,064
l`m at the Seventh Street
Mission evey Thursday.

165
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:39,067
Yo, hold up, man.

166
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,737
What kind of job
are you talking about?

167
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:44,837
My business partner and l...

168
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,077
need someone to help us
as a survival guide...

169
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:50,244
with our hunts
in the wilderness.

170
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,049
l don`t know shit about that.

171
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,248
With my recommendation...

172
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:56,452
you`ll have a decent chance
of getting the job.

173
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,722
-The pay is good.
-What kind of pay?

174
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,422
How much money exactly, man?

175
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,294
Just go down there.

176
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:04,492
Talk to this man.

177
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,296
His name`s Burns.

178
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,565
You`ll find out eveything
you need to know.

179
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:07,759
Can l help you?

180
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:09,958
Mason.

181
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,263
My partner.

182
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,667
He`s such a...

183
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,728
humanitarian.

184
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,103
Why don`t you come in, please?

185
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,880
Sit down.

186
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,462
No offense, but...

187
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,897
you don`t look like
much of a hunter to me.

188
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:56,236
l was just getting ready to say
the same thing about you.

189
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:57,768
l`ve already got the job.

190
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,894
How many cigarettes
do you smoke in a day?

191
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,023
As many as l can get.

192
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:19,533
l appreciate you coming in...

193
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,629
but the job needs someone
with, uh...

194
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:24,934
endurance.

195
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,773
l`m afraid your lungs
couldn`t handle it.

196
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:31,041
That`s it?

197
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,604
Just that quick?

198
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:36,675
Come on, man, l need this job.
l got endurance.

199
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:39,119
That`s one of those running
things over there, right?

200
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,248
Turn that on.
Put me on it.

201
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,917
l`ll show you some endurance.

202
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,990
Keep this up for half an hour,
l`ll give you twenty bucks.

203
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,199
For twenty bucks,
l`ll run to fucking Alaska.

204
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,362
Never thought you`d make it.

205
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:29,471
Never underestimate a man
who ain`t got nothing to lose.

206
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,473
Evey man`s
got something to lose.

207
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,973
Look, just `cause
you got a lot of money...

208
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,944
don`t think you know evey man.

209
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:42,182
So, how do l get ahold of you
if l need you?

210
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,286
Best hotel in town.

211
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,084
Man, twenty-five years ago...

212
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,493
l married this woman,
this black woman--

213
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,523
voluptuous, pretty,
hair slick on her head.

214
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,298
Six months later,
all that shit was null and void.

215
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,498
l`d get home.

216
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,166
Son would say, ""Get out of bed.""

217
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,175
l get on out the bed--

218
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,767
Boy, who you done robbed?

219
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:12,212
Just give me a room--one
with a TV that works this time.

220
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:14,375
You must want
the presidential suite.

221
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,077
l just want what l pay for.

222
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:25,220
Hey, before you get in that bed,
you wash your nasty ass, boy!

223
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,320
You make sure you wash
your nasty ass!

224
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,158
l get to the kitchen, right?

225
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,169
Mr. Overland
goes to the kitchen...

226
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,068
bitch right behind him.

227
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,599
Son of a bitch.

228
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:11,732
Go away. l got the room
till twelve o`clock.

229
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,696
l thought you wanted a job.

230
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,506
You cut your hair.

231
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,949
l like to stay in style.

232
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:32,684
How`d you get the burns?

233
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:35,121
Playing with matches, all right?

234
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:36,556
No shit?

235
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:43,030
l got you some clothes.
They should pretty much fit you.

236
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,758
How in the fuck
would you know what fit me?

237
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:48,099
Trust me. l`ve been doing this
a long time.

238
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:52,699
l ain`t doing nothing
unless the money`s right.

239
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:59,274
We`ll give you a couple of days
to get into the hang of things.

240
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,549
Food and lodging,
we`ll take care of it.

241
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,677
We`ll start you off
on five hundred dollars a week.

242
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,888
Here`s a two-hundred-dollar
advance.

243
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,720
lt`s money.

244
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,159
lf you do well...

245
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:15,356
we may give you a raise.

246
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,494
l`ll be outside.

247
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:26,169
l spent quite some time
in third world countries.

248
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,167
lt changed my point of view.

249
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,304
lt`s a clichÈ to say
that life was cheap there...

250
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:34,008
but life was way beyond cheap.

251
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,247
l`m glad l got this job,
but l don`t understand...

252
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,551
what it is about hunting animals
that gets you off.

253
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,079
lt`s not about killing.

254
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:45,020
lt`s not about death.

255
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,028
lt`s about life.

256
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:48,996
You tell that to the animal.

257
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,191
The animal knows it, too.

258
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:55,169
This is going to be quite
a learning experience for you.

259
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,501
Whatever, man, whatever.

260
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:59,666
As long as l`m getting paid,
l could give a fuck.

261
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,700
Where is Hell`s Canyon, anyway?

262
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,363
Where are we at right now?

263
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,232
We just crossed
the Oregon border.

264
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,448
This is some remote shit, man.

265
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,550
This is way out
in the fucking boondocks.

266
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,925
Yeah, but it`s beautiful.

267
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,589
lt`s just the way we like it.

268
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,997
lt has great hunting, too.

269
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:00,126
Why hunt a pig, though?

270
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,227
This doesn`t look like something
you`d want to kill.

271
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:04,603
We`re not hunting Frank.

272
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,631
He`s our special guest.

273
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:41,602
Propane goes into the cabin.

274
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:45,812
Bring some beer from the fridge
while you`re in there.

275
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,108
All right.

276
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,641
OK, Frank,
let`s get out of here.

277
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,251
Good. Good, good.

278
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:57,391
Watch it.
He`s pretty nasty.

279
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,494
Wait till he gets here.

280
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:05,226
Come on, Frank!

281
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,922
Shit.

282
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,485
Goddamn.

283
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:41,468
Shit, l wonder what`s in there.

284
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,368
Beer.

285
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,685
Well, Mr. Burns.

286
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,217
-Hello, Doc.
-Nice to be here.

287
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,457
-Doc Hawkins.
-Good to see you.

288
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,126
This is my son Derrick.

289
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:14,328
This your first hunt?

290
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,269
l`ve been hunting
since l was twelve.

291
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:18,397
Not like this one, he hasn`t.

292
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:22,036
Meet Griffin, the oil man
l was telling you about.

293
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,237
Glad you could make it.

294
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,409
You sure about this one?

295
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:28,143
-l`m sure.
-Has he got courage?

296
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,610
Gentlemen,
l would like you to meet...

297
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:33,814
our new hunting guide Mason.

298
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:37,920
Mason,
this is Mr. Wolfe, Senior...

299
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,257
one of the most feared men
on Wall Street.

300
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:43,128
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-lt`s a pleasure to meet you.

301
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,463
-His son, Wolfe, Junior.
-How you doing, Junior?

302
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,161
Derrick.

303
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:49,466
And Dr. Hawkins.

304
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:50,698
How you doing, Mr. Hawkins?

305
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:51,933
You know where you`re going?

306
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:54,032
-Nice watch.
-Thank you.

307
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:55,873
This is Griffin.

308
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,208
Nice to meet you, Mr. Griffin.

309
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:02,406
Gentlemen,
l hope you all brought your...

310
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,443
appetites.

311
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:06,920
What are we having, a pachyderm?

312
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:08,115
Right this way.

313
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,251
Big pig.

314
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,590
Oh, man.

315
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:13,889
lt`s a good thing
you didn`t eat on the plane.

316
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,260
Outstanding.

317
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,360
-All right.
-My God.

318
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,892
Gentlemen...

319
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,563
l`d like to propose a toast...

320
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:26,406
to Doc Hawkins...

321
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:28,432
who provided us
with the initial inspiration...

322
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:30,172
for these hunts of ours.

323
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:31,679
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

324
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:33,442
Each man out here...

325
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,750
will experience
the animal within himself...

326
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:38,979
so embrace it.

327
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:41,912
Don`t deny it.

328
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:44,050
Allow yourself to feel
the purity...

329
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:46,322
of your primal essence.

330
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:47,828
lt`s God`s gift to man.

331
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:50,058
Here`s a toast to the hunters...

332
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,957
and a prayer for the hunted.

333
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,161
-Amen.
-Amen.

334
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,228
Well done.

335
00:26:57,272 --> 00:26:58,637
-All right.
-Let`s eat.

336
00:26:58,673 --> 00:26:59,901
Drink and be mery.

337
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,871
Would you pass me the carrots?

338
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:05,072
Carrots coming up.

339
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:07,675
Air mail.

340
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,914
You don`t really look
like a doctor to me.

341
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,681
l`m a psychiatrist.

342
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,986
-A shrink?
-Does that surprise you?

343
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:17,514
You don`t look like
the kind of person...

344
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,652
fucked-up rich people
give money to...

345
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,355
to tell all their personal shit.

346
00:27:22,697 --> 00:27:24,164
l work for the company.

347
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,666
That`s the ClA.

348
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:29,801
l know these two gentlemen`s
personal shit completely.

349
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:32,136
Yeah, Doc thought, uh...

350
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:34,870
hunting would be good therapy
for us when we retired.

351
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:37,110
Let me get this straight.

352
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,080
You kill animals,
and that`s therapy?

353
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,948
-lt works.
-Hey, it works for me.

354
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:45,578
That`s the stupidest shit
l ever heard...

355
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,951
but it`s cool.
lt`s your thing.

356
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:49,513
Take your time.
Enjoy yourselves.

357
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:50,752
l am.

358
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:54,091
Life`s true pleasures
are so unpredictable.

359
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,393
l say, cherish the moment...

360
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,666
for what it is.

361
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:00,895
Observe your food...

362
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:03,900
smell it...

363
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:05,099
touch it...

364
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:08,172
put your mind into it...

365
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,768
and then when
you`re finally ready...

366
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,146
consume it...slowly.

367
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,714
You do it your way,
l`ll do it mine.

368
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,014
How in the hell...

369
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:22,581
did you become
such a ter-fucking-rific chef?

370
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:25,923
We don`t believe
in the average processed food.

371
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:28,452
We hand-pick carefully.

372
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:30,487
Cole`s the real expert.

373
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,894
There`s a poem.

374
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,060
Yeats wrote it.

375
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:38,903
Could you tell that this meat
would be this glorious...

376
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,168
while the boar
was still breathing?

377
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,176
l was pretty sure about it.

378
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,609
Well done.

379
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:45,903
How could you tell?

380
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:48,245
Well, it takes
some experience, but...

381
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,677
you learn what to look for.

382
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,048
You consider the, uh...

383
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:56,856
the animal`s age...

384
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,291
what condition it`s in...

385
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:00,784
its hair...

386
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:01,989
lts musculature...

387
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:04,326
how it was raised.

388
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,061
You can pretty much tell.

389
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,131
What do you think?

390
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,299
lt`s all right.
l like this.

391
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:14,740
Four-fifty a bottle.

392
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:19,146
$4.50? l should`ve been drinking
this shit a long time ago.

393
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,704
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

394
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,010
Don`t waste it.

395
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:27,019
l could live off that
for three months.

396
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:30,320
Well, you don`t want to drink
too much, anyway...

397
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,189
`cause you don`t want
to be slow tomorrow.

398
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,156
No, indeed.

399
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:38,658
You`re missing the best part,
Mr. Mason.

400
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,994
When you`re eating the flesh
from the pig...

401
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:43,998
look into his little beady eyes.

402
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,998
That way,
you will be devouring his soul.

403
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:52,874
Sometimes you even scare me.

404
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,074
Good.

405
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:04,655
Have a cigar, kid.

406
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,456
l want you to tell me...

407
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:09,456
where this came from.

408
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,725
Are you ready?

409
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,167
Hey, can l bum a cigarette
off you?

410
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,198
Take the whole pack.

411
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,900
l just want one.

412
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,670
l`m offering you
more than just one.

413
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,007
l only want one.

414
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:25,444
Well, then the rest
are going to go to waste.

415
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,038
Look here.

416
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:38,517
lf you got something
to say to me, just say it.

417
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,891
Where you from?

418
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:41,088
All over.

419
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,022
How old are you?

420
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:46,124
Thirty-two. lf you want to know
my pants size, ask him.

421
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,761
Come on, Mason. He`s only tying
to get to know you.

422
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,203
l don`t like people
getting in my personal shit.

423
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,332
He`s been looking at me all day.

424
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,640
Mr. Mason,
have you ever killed anything?

425
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,809
-What?
-My wife and kids.

426
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:02,708
-You sack of shit!
-John! John!

427
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,184
-You son of a bitch.
-Take it outside.

428
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:07,882
You`re fucking mine tomorrow,
you sack of shit!

429
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:10,549
What`s up with that dude?

430
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,220
He lost his daughter
a couple of months ago.

431
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:17,889
You didn`t kill your family,
did you?

432
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,065
How did that make you feel?

433
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:27,268
l came in my fucking pants.

434
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:35,182
l know more about you
than you think, Mason.

435
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,011
You probably do...

436
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,419
but l don`t know shit about you.

437
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:43,447
Ask me anything you want.

438
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:46,892
How`d you get that
fucked-up scar under your eye?

439
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,127
l refer to that as my birthmark.

440
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,466
On my eighth birthday, my father
brought me a bulldog--

441
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,471
a fat little bulldog.

442
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,905
l named him Prince Heny Stout.

443
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:01,533
He was strong.

444
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:02,975
He would chase my pet turkey.

445
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:05,479
He would chase squirrels
up the tree.

446
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:07,481
l trained him, raised him...

447
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,415
fed him, groomed him.

448
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:10,816
l loved that dog.

449
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:13,978
More than anything in the world,
l loved that dog.

450
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:17,616
My father gave me a handful
of chery bombs and M-80s...

451
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,526
and said, ""You`re gonna train
this dog to be a protector.""

452
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:24,157
So l got behind
a little dummy my dad built...

453
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:27,168
and l tossed these chery bombs
and M-80s at the dog.

454
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:32,064
After a while, he`d get angy
and come at the dummy.

455
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:34,865
He`d rip it apart.

456
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,774
Head was off.
Shirt was gone.

457
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,210
So, thirteen years old,
birthday time.

458
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:43,809
Got me a twelve-gauge shotgun.

459
00:32:43,852 --> 00:32:45,342
We`re goin` huntin`.

460
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:46,683
l was so excited.

461
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:48,917
We went out in the clearing
in the woods.

462
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:51,517
My dad laid our guns down
and said...

463
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,993
""Son, today you`re going to
learn to control your emotions.""

464
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,765
""You`re going to do things
some men are unwilling to do.""

465
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,434
`"Follow me.""

466
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:05,030
We went around a clump of trees.
There`s a little corral.

467
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:06,301
There`s Prince Heny Stout...

468
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:08,036
chained
in the middle of the corral.

469
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,144
My dad took out a pocketful
of chery bombs...

470
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,079
put `em in my hand, and said,
""Get in the corral.

471
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:16,914
""Light those chery bombs
and throw `em at the Prince.""

472
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,283
`"You`re gonna face manhood.

473
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,481
You`re gonna fight that dog
to the death.""

474
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:24,924
""He`s gonna kill you,
or you`re gonna kill him.""

475
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,155
`"Now!""

476
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,000
He was on me.

477
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:38,903
He was on me like flies on shit.

478
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,542
l had no chance.

479
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:45,375
l got my arm up
between his teeth and my neck.

480
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:47,779
Went down in the mud,
rolled over.

481
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:50,409
That dog
is fightin` and bitin`...

482
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,715
and l`m screamin` and cyin`,
grabbin` him around the head.

483
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:55,951
l stand up and fall
with my weight on him...

484
00:33:58,726 --> 00:33:59,886
hear his neck break.

485
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:02,956
He`s dead.

486
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:06,295
He`s not breathin`.

487
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:09,394
He`s not...yelpin`,
he`s not bitin`...

488
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:10,961
and l`m covered with blood.

489
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:15,068
l stand up.
l wipe the blood off.

490
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:19,007
l lick it.

491
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:21,072
My dad says,
`"Welcome to manhood.""

492
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:27,254
That`s why this is a birthmark.

493
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:37,356
Do your patients
know about this stoy?

494
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:40,697
No, but you do.

495
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,348
Turkey?

496
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:56,543
-Good work, Derrick.
-Here`s to the turkeys, Mason.

497
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,186
Well...

498
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:09,423
this is your room.

499
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:15,399
Mr. Burns,
l really want to thank you.

500
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,000
l know.

501
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,836
l`ll tell you
about the job tomorrow.

502
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:21,034
Good night.

503
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:36,917
Well, Hank...

504
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,219
l`m on my feet.

505
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:34,410
Once upon a time...

506
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:36,314
there were six little hunters.

507
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,343
Rise and shine, Mason.

508
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,782
Yo, what the fuck`s up, Cole?

509
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,650
Get up.
Put your shit on.

510
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:47,820
This ain`t funny!

511
00:36:47,862 --> 00:36:50,831
Shut the fuck up
and put that shit on!

512
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,564
We`d like to play a game.

513
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:56,696
lt`s vey simple.

514
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:00,406
You see, the hunt begins now.

515
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:03,300
We`re the hunters...

516
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:04,504
and you`re the hunted.

517
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,608
You leave here now...

518
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,673
with a head start
of as long as it takes us...

519
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:13,744
to eat
a nice, leisurely breakfast.

520
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:17,383
lf you make it
to civilization, you live.

521
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:19,120
lf you don`t...

522
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,185
maybe God will have mercy.

523
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,328
Bitch!

524
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,232
-Here he is.
-Let the games begin.

525
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,240
You son of a bitch...

526
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:38,677
l want you so bad,
l can taste it.

527
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:40,847
Let me get the door.

528
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,349
Let me get the door for you.

529
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:44,715
Get out!

530
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:46,242
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

531
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,513
Get out of here,
you stinking motherfucker.

532
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,452
Run.

533
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,928
Yo, Burns, what the fuck?

534
00:37:58,032 --> 00:37:59,465
He`s going to chase his nuts.

535
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:05,137
Pace yourself!

536
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:08,865
l enjoy fucking with them.
Don`t you?

537
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,676
What excites me is breaking
his neck with my bare hands.

538
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:16,046
That`s fine, doctor,
but l assure you...

539
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,779
l intend to shoot that
son of a bitch myself first.

540
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,981
He better last long enough
to make it a challenge.

541
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:23,354
Trust me, he will.

542
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:24,881
Wait a second, Dad.

543
00:38:24,926 --> 00:38:26,257
We won`t hunt him, will we?

544
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:27,852
Keep your voice down.

545
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:30,056
No, no, no.
He`s a human being.

546
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,030
He`s a homeless piece of shit.
He`s nothing.

547
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:34,295
He`s less than nothing.

548
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:36,701
Fuck that.
l won`t take any part in this.

549
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:44,105
You`re too much
like your mother.

550
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:48,949
l brought you out here to learn
something about yourself.

551
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:51,975
l spent fifty thousand dollars
for you to learn a lesson...

552
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:55,381
to develop an instinct
you don`t have...

553
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:58,515
and l`ll be damned
if you`re not going to learn it.

554
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:04,431
Don`t disappoint me, Derrick.

555
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,361
Now, come on.

556
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:08,663
Let`s have some breakfast.

557
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:29,949
You know, the only thing
l miss up here...

558
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,156
is the sports page.

559
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,499
l`m so used to getting up...

560
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,660
having my morning coffee...

561
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:43,499
and opening up the sports page.

562
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,031
l don`t read newspapers anymore.

563
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,542
They`re like the mirror
of the world`s ugliness.

564
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,241
l like beautiful things.

565
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:57,913
-l`m ready to go.
-Relax, Doc.

566
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,146
Digest your food.

567
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,153
We`re wasting time.

568
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:01,552
Give him more time.

569
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:04,318
Think of it as foreplay.

570
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,923
Never mind foreplay.
l`m talking about--

571
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:11,855
Prince Heny Stout.
Remember the rules.

572
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:17,994
l feel something special
about this.

573
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,337
lt`s going to be
so much more special...

574
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,841
when you finally nail him.

575
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:33,020
Eat some eggs.
You`ll feel better.

576
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:34,316
Eat. Eat.

577
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,317
l`m not hungy.

578
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:38,723
l beg your pardon?

579
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:40,420
l said l`m not hungy.

580
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:42,554
Oh. Terrific.

581
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:44,690
l`ll tell you what--

582
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,199
l`ll pull a switcheroonie here.

583
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:49,763
l hope this is not going to be
a problem.

584
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:52,699
lt won`t be.

585
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:58,142
You`ll be OK.

586
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,510
Dad, l can`t do this.

587
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:05,945
Yes, you can.

588
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:15,061
A thousand dollars
says my son`ll draw first blood.

589
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:17,690
One, two, three.

590
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,791
You made yourself
three thousand dollars, Derrick.

591
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,014
Damn, l wish
l`d never started smoking.

592
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:39,046
All right.

593
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:40,451
Let`s get the turkey.

594
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:58,166
You believe it? They always
start out the same way.

595
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,436
Shit.

596
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:12,579
God, what a beautiful day!

597
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,458
Don`t you see his tracks?

598
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:22,360
Stevie Wonder
could follow these tracks.

599
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:36,172
You`re mine, Mason!

600
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,610
l want you!

601
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:40,840
Oh, God.

602
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:42,815
l got something.

603
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,579
l see something.

604
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:45,846
Give me a bearing.

605
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:47,251
Right up here.

606
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:48,687
Two o`clock.
Three o`clock.

607
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:50,623
That`s a mule deer, Griffin.

608
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,754
Listen, you jackass.

609
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:58,993
lf l tell you l see something,
you can piss on a fire--

610
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:02,992
Mr. Griffin, why don`t you
stop talking about it...

611
00:43:03,037 --> 00:43:04,629
and show us where it is?

612
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:06,264
Well, all right.

613
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:07,740
All right.
Over here.

614
00:43:27,428 --> 00:43:28,588
l don`t see anything.

615
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:40,533
Come on!

616
00:43:52,653 --> 00:43:54,518
What are you doing?

617
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:56,284
Griffin, there`s no one there.

618
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,624
Think.

619
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:07,059
l saw him.

620
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,432
l fucking saw him !

621
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:12,165
Well...

622
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,341
l saw Mason.
l just saw Mason.

623
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:19,744
He just shot and killed
four trees.

624
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,940
Let`s go take a look.

625
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:23,040
You laid them out.
They`re dead.

626
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,243
No one`s there.

627
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:31,484
Think.

628
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:00,614
Guns.
There`s got to be some guns.

629
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,021
There`s got to be guns.

630
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,595
You know what l`m thinking?

631
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:19,267
None of them
has ever done that before.

632
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:20,466
Done what?

633
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:22,942
l think he`s gone back
to the cabin.

634
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:24,342
He`s figured something out.

635
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:25,538
Let`s go.

636
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:38,117
Guns.

637
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,270
Them sick motherfuckers.

638
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:21,257
ClA bullshit.

639
00:46:21,302 --> 00:46:23,327
My motherfucking ass.

640
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,804
l`ll show you motherfuckers
therapy.

641
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:36,809
Shit.

642
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:46,820
l`ll look over here.

643
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:50,087
Five thousand, he`s upstairs.

644
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,291
l`m coming for you, Mason.

645
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,698
Here l come, Mason.

646
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,404
Get ready, Mason.

647
00:46:58,439 --> 00:46:59,838
What`s that smell?

648
00:47:00,574 --> 00:47:02,769
-Oh, no. He set us up.
-Eveybody out!

649
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:07,447
Wolfe, get out!

650
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:11,047
God damn it!
Derrick, run!

651
00:47:14,254 --> 00:47:15,949
We`re going bare hands.

652
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,291
l`m sending you back
to your wife and kid...

653
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,193
you piece of dog shit.

654
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:30,603
Get me the fuck out of here!

655
00:47:32,573 --> 00:47:33,733
Help!

656
00:47:40,914 --> 00:47:42,711
What a punt.

657
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,547
Dad, do you read me?

658
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:48,848
Get back here!

659
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:51,319
Dad, where are you?

660
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,921
Dad, l`m coming!

661
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:57,421
Dad, come on.

662
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:00,429
Dad, put your arms around me.

663
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:01,661
Come on!
Let`s go!

664
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:05,164
Having fun yet?

665
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:07,935
Come on, Mason.

666
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:09,602
Get up.

667
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,916
Let`s get him out!

668
00:48:22,956 --> 00:48:24,981
Help me get him out!

669
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:26,185
Give me your hand.

670
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:35,826
Come on.

671
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:37,029
Where`s Mason?

672
00:48:39,706 --> 00:48:40,866
Come here.

673
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:45,035
l like my meat rare.

674
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:55,578
Ty well-done, bitch.

675
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:12,971
Derrick,
hury up with that water.

676
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:21,579
l found this.

677
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:23,674
No sign of Hawkins.

678
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:26,350
-What happened to Hawkins?
-He`s histoy.

679
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:29,415
Oh, my God.

680
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:33,425
You`re not still
going to hunt him, are you?

681
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:35,921
The hell we`re not.

682
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:39,698
Hasn`t this shit
gone far enough?

683
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:42,463
This is where
it gets interesting.

684
00:49:42,503 --> 00:49:44,130
He must have been
out here somewhere.

685
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,399
You didn`t see him, did you?

686
00:49:50,344 --> 00:49:52,471
Answer the man, Derrick.

687
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:54,944
Look...

688
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:58,850
you just saved your dad`s life.

689
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:02,221
You should be proud of yourself.

690
00:50:02,256 --> 00:50:04,383
Which way did he go?

691
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:06,085
You know, he killed Hawkins...

692
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:08,494
and he nearly killed me.

693
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,630
That way.

694
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:22,375
Let`s go!

695
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:23,569
Let it burn.

696
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:42,655
Oh, shit.
Ain`t this a bitch?

697
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:45,187
l`m not going to hurt you.

698
00:50:45,232 --> 00:50:48,292
You ain`t going to hurt me.
You have a nice day, OK?

699
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:50,701
l`ll get the fuck
out your woods, OK?

700
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:52,398
Just cool out. Chill.

701
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:54,407
Nice wolf.
Cool, cool, cool.

702
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:00,271
Stay right there.

703
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:27,967
Oh, shit.

704
00:51:40,187 --> 00:51:42,018
-There he is!
-Out of my way. l got him.

705
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:51,590
Oh, shit!

706
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,172
You took my shot, Senior.

707
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:04,637
Don`t ever take my shot again.

708
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:06,202
What is that, a threat?

709
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:07,736
He nearly killed me, not you.

710
00:52:08,649 --> 00:52:10,674
Just don`t take my shot.

711
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:12,048
Or fucking what?

712
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:20,025
Be careful.
Watch yourself.

713
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,551
Let the fuck go of me.
Let me go, son!

714
00:52:27,134 --> 00:52:28,658
l`m going to have to put
a bullet in his ass.

715
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:29,930
l see that now.

716
00:52:58,432 --> 00:52:59,592
Shit.

717
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:23,949
lf he survived the river...

718
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,185
there`s only one place
he can get out.

719
00:53:44,077 --> 00:53:45,806
Ha. Still dy.

720
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:07,729
All right, gentlemen...

721
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:09,360
we`ll go on foot from here.

722
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:10,563
Dismount.

723
00:54:17,344 --> 00:54:18,470
He ain`t far now, Senior.

724
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:20,503
No, he isn`t.

725
00:54:27,821 --> 00:54:29,288
Do you smell that?

726
00:54:29,322 --> 00:54:31,415
That idiot`s
smoking a cigarette.

727
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,776
We`ve been had.

728
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:25,971
Let me see.

729
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:34,547
A tree smoking a cigarette.

730
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:40,189
l told you this guy was good.
You didn`t believe me, did you?

731
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:43,389
See, l know how to pick them.

732
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:56,033
Sack of shit.

733
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,289
Griffin, talk to me.

734
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,863
Can you hear me?

735
00:56:18,899 --> 00:56:20,298
Come in.

736
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,664
Griffin, do you copy?

737
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:23,464
Shut the fuck up.

738
00:56:23,503 --> 00:56:25,130
Motherfucker.

739
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:30,705
Griffin, your position, please.

740
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:39,242
Griffin, come in.

741
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:48,419
Griffin, talk to me.

742
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:49,826
lf you`re lost...

743
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:52,431
l`ll guide you home.

744
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,891
Burns, Burns, you hear me?

745
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:02,369
l wouldn`t mind talking
to Griffin.

746
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:05,901
He can`t come to the phone.
Know what l`m saying?

747
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:08,511
Mason, you`re a sack of shit.

748
00:57:08,548 --> 00:57:09,845
Let me talk to Griffin.

749
00:57:09,883 --> 00:57:12,579
Fuck what you want, Burns.
About what l want right now.

750
00:57:15,021 --> 00:57:16,249
l want you, Burns.

751
00:57:17,857 --> 00:57:19,324
What did l do?

752
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,485
l got Griffin tied up...

753
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:23,121
and you ain`t never going
to find him.

754
00:57:23,163 --> 00:57:24,960
l want you and only you.

755
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:27,728
Fly me back to the city.

756
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,564
After that,
l`ll tell you where he is.

757
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,767
Otherwise, l`ll kill him.

758
00:57:33,073 --> 00:57:34,267
Let me sleep on it.

759
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:37,974
You know, Mason...

760
00:57:38,011 --> 00:57:39,603
you know why
we`re going to find you?

761
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:44,412
`Cause l can smell
your stinking ass from here.

762
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:47,887
Yo, fuck you, Cole,
you punk sellout motherfucker.

763
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:51,516
You`re going to do it my way...

764
00:57:51,558 --> 00:57:52,957
or your man`s going to be dead.

765
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:04,797
Wake up.

766
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,538
Your friends
don`t give two shits about you.

767
00:58:10,644 --> 00:58:13,636
Shut the fuck up, or l`ll bust
you in your motherfucking head.

768
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:16,040
Listen.

769
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,312
Burns ain`t going to come
looking for you.

770
00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:20,046
By now you should know...

771
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:22,987
he don`t give a fuck
about shit but himself.

772
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:25,924
Just shut up,
and l`ll take this thing off.

773
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,090
`Cause l`ll kill you.
l don`t want to...

774
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:30,323
but l`ll kill your ass.

775
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:31,523
Shut up.

776
00:58:43,977 --> 00:58:45,308
l ain`t going to scream
no more...

777
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:49,643
but if you are going
to kill me...

778
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,914
stop being
such a chickenshit bitch...

779
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:54,249
and pull the fucking trigger.

780
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:56,221
Maybe l`m just having some fun.

781
00:58:58,591 --> 00:58:59,956
Of course you are.

782
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:02,120
That`s your kind.

783
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:05,131
You the motherfuckers
been tying to kill people.

784
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:07,133
Then why don`t you do
what we do...

785
00:59:08,735 --> 00:59:10,202
and pull that fucking trigger?

786
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:13,131
Go ahead.

787
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:15,133
Pull it.

788
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,739
Look at Sirius--the dog star.

789
00:59:51,945 --> 00:59:54,175
Yeah. You think
we`ll find Mason tomorrow?

790
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:58,744
l know where he is.

791
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:01,818
Yeah, sure you do.
Where is he?

792
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:06,084
Over there.

793
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:09,955
Take a look.

794
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:13,596
The little hole in the mountain.

795
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:19,598
We`ll have him
sit up all night waiting...

796
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:22,005
then we`ll surprise him at dawn.

797
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,076
How`s that grub?

798
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:33,713
Pretty good?

799
01:00:33,753 --> 01:00:35,220
Pretty tasty?

800
01:00:35,255 --> 01:00:36,552
Good.

801
01:00:37,457 --> 01:00:40,017
Enjoy it, asshole.
lt`s going to be your last.

802
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:43,794
You ain`t in no position
to be threatening me, cowboy.

803
01:00:45,698 --> 01:00:47,359
l ain`t even
threatening you, son...

804
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:51,564
`cause as soon as you find
the balls to take care of me...

805
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:53,936
you ain`t never going to make it
out of here alive, anyway.

806
01:00:55,308 --> 01:00:56,468
God.

807
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:00,205
What`s up?

808
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:03,712
Big, tough cowboy,
you scared of a few little bugs?

809
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,342
Ain`t never slept on the ground?

810
01:01:05,385 --> 01:01:08,411
l sleep in a bed, shithead,
not like an animal.

811
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:10,854
Sleeping on the ground
don`t mean you`re an animal.

812
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,118
lt means you`re poor.

813
01:01:12,158 --> 01:01:13,318
Maybe.

814
01:01:14,527 --> 01:01:16,290
That may be...

815
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:17,489
but you, Mason...

816
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:19,592
are a waste.

817
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:21,395
Know what?
l`m tired of you.

818
01:01:21,434 --> 01:01:23,026
What if l took this gun...

819
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:25,333
and blow
your motherfucking brains out?

820
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,101
You`d bleed just like me.
Then you`d understand.

821
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:30,075
l don`t care about my life
anymore.

822
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:32,202
Don`t you understand?

823
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:34,110
l don`t give a shit!

824
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:35,580
l don`t care!

825
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:52,024
That`s crazy.

826
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:59,561
Someone like you...

827
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:01,039
just like you...

828
01:02:02,742 --> 01:02:04,710
followed my daughter
to school one day.

829
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,445
The police report said that...

830
01:02:10,884 --> 01:02:13,910
she tried to get away from him.

831
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,283
Nobody had ever caught him...

832
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,781
and for all l know...

833
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:21,293
it was you.

834
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:22,988
Ain`t that a bitch?

835
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:25,463
You got a personal problem...

836
01:02:25,498 --> 01:02:27,523
and it ain`t got jack shit
to do with me.

837
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:29,467
You said you fucking killed--

838
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:31,094
You don`t know shit about me.

839
01:02:41,848 --> 01:02:43,645
l was a mechanic, all right?

840
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:48,147
l used to work like a fucking
dog, night and day.

841
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:52,452
l had a wife,
and l had a newborn kid.

842
01:02:54,894 --> 01:02:57,294
We lived
in a fucked-up part of town.

843
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,820
That`s where poor people live.

844
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:01,527
l was, like, the manager
of this building.

845
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:04,661
That`s the only way
l could stay there for free.

846
01:03:04,704 --> 01:03:07,172
Had to work around the place,
you know what l`m saying?

847
01:03:08,474 --> 01:03:11,409
The place was--should`ve
been fucking condemned.

848
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:16,809
l used to go to the city
all the time...

849
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,874
and told them
they had to get shit together.

850
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:20,909
The place wasn`t safe.

851
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:24,348
They didn`t give a fuck.

852
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,585
They don`t give a fuck about
people who live in the ghetto.

853
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:31,756
l told my girl l was going
to get around to it, you know?

854
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,430
The place was a firetrap.

855
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:40,664
So one day l come home late...

856
01:03:40,707 --> 01:03:42,800
and l see this commotion
out in the street...

857
01:03:45,411 --> 01:03:46,810
and l`m looking...

858
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:49,974
and l notice
this ain`t where l live...

859
01:03:50,016 --> 01:03:52,507
but at the same time,
it was my building...

860
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:54,349
but l`m saying
it`s not my building...

861
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:57,182
but it was.

862
01:03:57,223 --> 01:03:58,656
l ran inside.

863
01:03:58,691 --> 01:04:02,024
By the time l got in there,
my wife and kids was dead.

864
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:10,663
l could`ve...

865
01:04:10,703 --> 01:04:14,298
l kept putting off
fixing that place, man.

866
01:04:16,442 --> 01:04:18,307
l just kept putting it off.

867
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,479
You said that you killed them.

868
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:27,350
They`re dead, ain`t they?

869
01:04:53,546 --> 01:04:54,706
Hold your fire!

870
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,647
For Christ`s sake,
hold your fire.

871
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,178
Where is he?

872
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:04,985
Who do l look like to you,
Hary fucking Houdini?

873
01:05:05,024 --> 01:05:06,787
l don`t know where he is.

874
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:12,624
Y`all leave me any water?

875
01:05:12,665 --> 01:05:13,859
Yeah, on my ATV.

876
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:16,592
-Here?
-Yeah. Last one.

877
01:05:18,471 --> 01:05:20,405
What time did Mason leave you?

878
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,032
Burns, l truly have no idea.

879
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:24,606
You don`t know much, do you?

880
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:25,975
Maybe not.

881
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:27,172
You hungy?

882
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:30,542
Can l take two?

883
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:34,849
l`ll tell you what l do know.
l`m out of here.

884
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:37,685
l`m going back where l belong.
l`m going home.

885
01:05:37,723 --> 01:05:40,385
-No, you`re not.
-Oh, yeah, l am.

886
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:43,456
Lookit, Doc Hawkins is dead.

887
01:05:43,496 --> 01:05:45,521
He ain`t never coming back...

888
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:48,557
and Mason could`ve killed me
last night, but he didn`t.

889
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:49,727
Gotta let him go.

890
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:52,465
Mr. Griffin,
you know we can`t do that.

891
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:54,370
What are you afraid of?

892
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:56,671
You think
he`ll go to the authorities?

893
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:58,472
You`ll never hear
from him again.

894
01:05:58,511 --> 01:05:59,876
He`s probably right.

895
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:02,938
We`re not taking any chances.
Are you crazy?

896
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:06,882
-Think about this.
-l have.

897
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,147
No, you haven`t.

898
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:10,415
Well, look at all of you.

899
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:13,382
Listen once.
l`m going to say it once.

900
01:06:15,428 --> 01:06:16,827
l ain`t going out with you
no more.

901
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:18,660
l`m through.

902
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:21,258
lf l can`t stop you,
l can`t stop you...

903
01:06:22,435 --> 01:06:23,595
but l`m going home.

904
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,735
You stupid Texas cowboy,
you stop it right there.

905
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,103
Or what?

906
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:36,137
What, you`re going to shoot me
in the back?

907
01:06:42,555 --> 01:06:43,715
l lied.

908
01:06:48,594 --> 01:06:50,755
Dad! Dad! Do something!

909
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:53,291
You son of a--

910
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:55,960
Mr. Wolfe, we`re all
in this together, remember?

911
01:06:56,002 --> 01:06:57,128
That`s the agreement.

912
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,365
Just like a family--
nobody ever gets away.

913
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:00,497
lsn`t that right?

914
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:02,701
That`s right.

915
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:05,006
We`re all in this together.

916
01:07:08,948 --> 01:07:10,677
-Stop whining.
-That`s enough.

917
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:12,979
-Little punk.
-You all right?

918
01:07:15,755 --> 01:07:17,120
Take a deep breath.

919
01:07:17,156 --> 01:07:18,316
Now, listen.

920
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:20,915
Now it`s more than just Mason.

921
01:07:22,328 --> 01:07:24,193
Hawkins and Griffin--

922
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,529
they were real people
who counted in the real world.

923
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,262
l`m as real as they were,
asshole.

924
01:07:29,302 --> 01:07:31,099
You`re nothing, Mason.

925
01:07:33,306 --> 01:07:36,605
lt`s such a beautiful day
out here, Mason.

926
01:07:36,642 --> 01:07:38,610
Perfect day for hunting.

927
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:39,770
Where do you think he is?

928
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:42,337
lt`s down to you three of you
and the boy.

929
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:45,942
l got my own gun.
My odds are getting better.

930
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:49,477
Your odds don`t mean anything
out here, Mason.

931
01:07:49,522 --> 01:07:52,184
What matters
is if you win or lo--

932
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,451
That wasn`t even close!

933
01:07:56,495 --> 01:07:58,725
You never shot
a big bore before?

934
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:01,028
Yo, Cole, your mama`s up here.

935
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,831
l`m tired of this faggot.
Let`s get his ass.

936
01:08:03,869 --> 01:08:05,029
Damn.

937
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:39,861
He thinks we won`t follow him
in the water.

938
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:41,065
Well, which way?

939
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:44,169
Let`s get wet.

940
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:06,862
We could fish in this.

941
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:30,613
Shit.

942
01:09:30,656 --> 01:09:31,816
Something`s not--

943
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:34,787
Something`s not right
about this.

944
01:09:42,168 --> 01:09:43,328
l don`t like this.

945
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:24,298
There he is!

946
01:10:24,343 --> 01:10:25,640
Get him !
Get him !

947
01:10:34,787 --> 01:10:37,051
Keep it going.

948
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:43,519
Gotcha now.

949
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:57,602
You ain`t--
you ain`t the last pick.

950
01:10:57,643 --> 01:10:59,907
Oh, damn.

951
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:01,742
He ain`t the last pick.

952
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,138
What happened?

953
01:11:18,197 --> 01:11:21,223
Relax. You`re OK.

954
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:23,326
-Next year.
-Shut up.

955
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:25,599
Next year, we got to bring--

956
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:27,162
We got to bring more pigs.

957
01:11:27,206 --> 01:11:29,572
We got to bring the girls up
next time.

958
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,536
Somebody...

959
01:11:32,578 --> 01:11:33,738
Walter.

960
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:38,315
We`re going to have
to put you to bed.

961
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:12,176
Derrick, l`m sory.

962
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:14,111
lt wasn`t supposed to be
like this.

963
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:15,875
What was it supposed to be like?

964
01:13:16,782 --> 01:13:18,147
Like back at the cabin.

965
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:20,151
When you saved me,
l was so proud of you.

966
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:26,287
l`ll help you find Mason,
maybe even kill him dead...

967
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,125
but know one thing.

968
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:31,254
lf we get through this shit...

969
01:13:31,297 --> 01:13:34,698
l will never forget this,
because l am not like you.

970
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:00,688
Shit.

971
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:01,886
Damn.

972
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,007
What the hell`s he shooting at?

973
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:19,010
l don`t care.
Come on.

974
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:27,715
Three left.
lt`s gotta work.

975
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:29,414
Come on.

976
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:58,315
That son of a bitch.

977
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:02,079
What do we do now?

978
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:03,884
Go after him.
What do you think?

979
01:15:03,922 --> 01:15:05,082
Afraid of heights?

980
01:15:07,393 --> 01:15:08,553
Good.

981
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:12,723
Bastard.

982
01:15:23,108 --> 01:15:24,632
-You stay here, Derrick.
-Fuck you, Dad.

983
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:34,980
Way to go, Derrick.

984
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:38,656
You`re doing good, son.

985
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:56,399
Behind you!

986
01:15:56,442 --> 01:15:57,773
He`s behind us!

987
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:00,142
Derrick, look out!

988
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:01,806
Dad! Help me!

989
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:03,610
l can`t hold on!

990
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,242
l`m coming.

991
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:08,819
Help, Dad!

992
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,685
l`m coming.
Hang on.

993
01:16:10,723 --> 01:16:12,520
Don`t let me fall!
Dad, help!

994
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:14,583
l`m slipping!

995
01:16:14,626 --> 01:16:15,786
Don`t let go, Derrick.

996
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:17,386
Help, l`m slipping!

997
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:32,139
Mr. Wolfe, Senior.

998
01:16:34,012 --> 01:16:37,709
Let`s get the son of a bitch
who did this.

999
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,149
That goddamn son of a bitch.

1000
01:16:40,152 --> 01:16:41,380
He`s mine.

1001
01:16:59,505 --> 01:17:01,063
lt didn`t go in.

1002
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:02,937
Give him to me!

1003
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:12,009
Shit!

1004
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:30,093
Shit.

1005
01:17:30,135 --> 01:17:32,330
We can`t get him from here.

1006
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:33,531
We`ll have to go down.

1007
01:17:40,445 --> 01:17:42,504
l hope he`s not dead.

1008
01:18:47,613 --> 01:18:49,240
You son of a bitch!

1009
01:18:51,383 --> 01:18:53,817
Show yourself,
you son of a bitch!

1010
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:01,259
Mr. Wolfe, don`t lose your head.

1011
01:19:01,293 --> 01:19:02,726
That`s exactly what he wants.

1012
01:19:02,761 --> 01:19:05,252
l didn`t hear you.
What did you say?

1013
01:19:05,297 --> 01:19:06,423
Go ahead.

1014
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:07,625
You going to kill me?

1015
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:10,724
Nice move.

1016
01:19:12,404 --> 01:19:14,372
Let me tell you
what we`re going to do.

1017
01:19:16,508 --> 01:19:17,998
lt`s going to be dark soon.

1018
01:19:19,111 --> 01:19:21,944
We`ll wait and sit.

1019
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,073
He wants us.
He wants us bad.

1020
01:19:25,017 --> 01:19:27,542
We`ll let him come to us.

1021
01:19:27,586 --> 01:19:28,746
Sound...

1022
01:19:29,821 --> 01:19:30,947
is the key.

1023
01:19:30,989 --> 01:19:32,752
Be still.

1024
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:33,985
Be patient.

1025
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:37,152
Be a fucking hunter.

1026
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,094
After l kill Mason...

1027
01:19:49,675 --> 01:19:50,835
we`ll settle up.

1028
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:54,203
That`ll be...nice.

1029
01:20:00,118 --> 01:20:01,278
l`ll be over here.

1030
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:05,315
Remember...

1031
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:07,985
careful what you shoot at.

1032
01:21:56,868 --> 01:21:58,130
What--

1033
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,715
l know you`re out there, Mason.

1034
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:15,810
Don`t be afraid, Mason.

1035
01:22:16,822 --> 01:22:17,982
Come up here like a man!

1036
01:22:19,424 --> 01:22:20,914
Look, Mason, l got no gun.

1037
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:35,438
God damn it!

1038
01:22:39,277 --> 01:22:41,370
l don`t need this fuckin` gun!

1039
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,915
Come on, Mason!

1040
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,975
Show your fuckin` self!

1041
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:38,859
You can`t hurt me
because you`re nothing.

1042
01:23:38,904 --> 01:23:41,532
You`re a maggot.
You`re a worm !

1043
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,202
You`re nothing!

1044
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:45,766
Die! Die!

1045
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,334
Fuck that!

1046
01:24:57,415 --> 01:24:59,576
-Burn, baby.
-Shit.

1047
01:25:09,294 --> 01:25:11,057
Forgive me, Father.

1048
01:27:08,146 --> 01:27:10,842
You`ve reached the offices
of Hell`s Canyon Outfitters.

1049
01:27:10,882 --> 01:27:13,112
Please leave your message
after the beep.

1050
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:16,220
Hello.

1051
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:18,552
This is Melinda Wolfe
calling again.

1052
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,821
l left a message yesterday,
but nobody returned my call.

1053
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,589
l still haven`t heard
from my husband and son...

1054
01:27:23,628 --> 01:27:26,188
and l am starting to wory.

1055
01:27:26,231 --> 01:27:30,361
Please get back to me as soon
as possible. Thank you.

1056
01:28:59,557 --> 01:29:01,889
Excuse me, Father.

1057
01:29:01,926 --> 01:29:04,087
God bless you, child.

1058
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,565
Could you spare a little change?

1059
01:29:10,602 --> 01:29:11,864
l`m homeless.

1060
01:29:11,903 --> 01:29:13,097
Get lost.

1061
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:16,563
Stupid asshole.

1062
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:49,334
Hey, Father Burns.

1063
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:30,980
Ah, shit!

1064
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:35,917
How does that feel, huh?

1065
01:30:37,922 --> 01:30:40,083
No mercy, eh, Mason?

1066
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:09,917
Holy May...

1067
01:31:09,954 --> 01:31:11,353
mother of God...

1068
01:31:11,389 --> 01:31:13,186
pray for us sinners!

1069
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,118
Shit!

1070
01:31:23,368 --> 01:31:25,063
How the fuck
does this feel, Burns?

1071
01:31:25,103 --> 01:31:26,900
All your punk-ass friends
are dead now!

1072
01:31:26,938 --> 01:31:29,168
How the fuck does this feel now?

1073
01:31:31,843 --> 01:31:35,370
This...is the moment
we`ve been waiting for.

1074
01:31:40,785 --> 01:31:41,945
Do it.

1075
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:45,348
Finish the game.

1076
01:31:53,064 --> 01:31:54,224
Please.

1077
01:31:56,768 --> 01:31:57,928
Bang!

1078
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:00,996
Game`s over.

1079
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:38,335
Lucky me.

1080
01:32:40,912 --> 01:32:43,506
There`s something you should
always do when you find a gun.

1081
01:32:43,548 --> 01:32:44,708
Say good-bye.

1082
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:56,291
Always check the barrel.
