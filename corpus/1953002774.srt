Well, we might as well get right down to it.

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,354
I have given 50 years to the law.

I've seen a lot and
I've gotten too old to keep secrets.

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,475
Here at Howard University,
we were taught one simple idea.

5
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,032
The law is a weapon
if you know how to use it.

6
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,556
I was here during the Depression,
class of 1933.

7
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,637
I see you've got this
fancy auditorium here now.

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,194
Well, we had an old
three-story brownstone with no heat.

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,031
Nobody knew what
air conditioning was back then.

12
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,478
I would take the train over from Baltimore
every morning, arrive at Union Station.

13
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,714
Some days I'd walk past
the United States Capitol on my way to class.

14
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,677
They call Baltimore, "Up South."

15
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,639
That's just below what
we used to call the Smith & Wesson line.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,953
Baltimore is where slaves ran to, when they
escaped from plantations in the Deep South.

18
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,396
Which may have something
to do with why I was born there.

19
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,031
Now, my uncle Fearless,
used to tell me about my great-grandfather

20
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,836
who was called Thorney Good.

21
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,952
Seems, as a boy,
he was a tracker for a big-game hunter

22
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,951
in the toughest part of the Congo.

23
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,272
And this big-game hunter brought my
great-grandfather to eastern Maryland

24
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,756
as a slave. He hated being a slave now.

25
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,551
Thorney Good became so hard to handle.
The big-game hunter got fed up.

26
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,279
He said, "Look, I brought
you over here myself...

27
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,989
"So I don't guess I can
shoot you like you deserve.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,154
And you know, that was the only time
that the big-game hunter

33
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,674
didn't get an argument from Thorney Good.

34
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,673
But, he came back years later.
He bought land right next door.

35
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,311
So he could torment the big-game hunter
for the rest of his life.

plunks herself right down on the spot.

taking a seat in a whites-only coach

to what the Justices wrote.

"The Fourteenth Amendment could not
have been intended to enforce social equality.

that come from being segregated

"chooses to put that construction on it."

104

Now, what did that mean?

105
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,393
It meant that it was now legal
for any state to pass Jim Crow laws

106
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,640
that forced negroes to accept
"separate but equal" facilities.

He had blond hair and blue eyes and...

Sometimes people mistook him
for a white man. He was the most

even when we were discussing the weather.

he became interested in the law.

His hobby was to go downtown

124
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,276
and sit in the back of the courthouse.
Some days he would carry me with him.

125
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,592

he would knock back a few shots of whiskey

in front of white people!"

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,228
Yeah, and they were free
to select the membership of the club.

500
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,754
And the T exas courts agreed with them.

501
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,389
But, one year later, just one year later,

502
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,359
the Supreme Court of the United States
agreed to hear our appeal in the case.

503
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,910
The case was called Smith v. Allwright.

504
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,870
I called Buster the morning
the decision came down, April 3, 1944.

505
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,430
8-to-1, honey, for us! That's right.

506
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,432
Now, you know, Buster.
She just burst into tears.

507
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,988
Now listen to what the Justices wrote.

508
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,156
"It is unconstitutional

509
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,119
"for a political party to limit
its voters to white people

510
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,875
"because it endorses and enforces

511
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,355
"discrimination against negroes."

512
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,912
You know what happened next?

513
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,872
The negroes got dressed up
in their Sunday best

514
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,951
just to register to vote.

515
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,279
It was a hundred degrees out!
They were standing in a long line.

516
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,234
A white couple attempted to push past them.

517
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,997
A negro woman holding a parasol
turned to them and said,

518
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,230
"You seem to be in a hurry.

519
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,230
"Well, you just go right on ahead.

520
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,235
"We've been waiting a long time.
We don't mind waiting a little bit longer."

521
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,757
You see, I knew that our victory

522
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,749
in the voting case was the beginning
of real progress, real progress, mind you.

523
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,958
Because, let's face it, without the ballot

524
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,996
a man is not a citizen.

525
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,599
But, you know, I also knew something else.

526
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,638
The ballot doesn't mean much
without a first-class education.

527
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,590
Now, you know, people used to say
that the reason that white people

528
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,116
didn't want to open up the schoolhouse door
is 'cause it leads straight

529
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,872
to the bedroom door.

530
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,511
Now, do I need to tell you that that other door
has been open for a mighty long time?

531
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,477
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

532
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,878
Back in Baltimore, I used to watch kids
playing ball in the streets together.

533
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,679
They'd separate to go to school.
They'd come out of school.

534
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,716
They'd play ball in the streets together.

535
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,998
It made me wonder, well, why do
they have to be separated at school?

536
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,071
See I came to believe

537
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,675
that children sitting alongside one another
learning in the same classroom,

538
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,149
that was the best hope for our country.

539
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,518
That's when I decided to go down
to Clarendon County, South Carolina.

540
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,591
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

541
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,355
I'm gonna tell you the cold truth now.

542
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,078
Every time I got on a train headed down
South, I didn't know if I was coming back.

543
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,470
They didn't have a welcome mat
for Negro lawyers.

544
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,918
I would take the Capitol Limited
from New York down here to D.C.

545
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,675
I'd change to a "colored car"
for the rest of the trip.

546
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,274
And in Southern cities and towns

547
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,478
I would ride in the back of streetcars,
and be just as quiet as a mouse.

548
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,199
I would eat in colored cafes.

549
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,598
You know they had me sleeping
in a different house every night.

550
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,549
And I would always try to get the bedroom
that was farthest from the window.

551
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,030
'Cause I never wanted anyone to know
and, I mean, anyone.

552
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,791
Sometimes I'd lay in bed at night sweating,

553
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,555
wondering if I was ever going to see
Buster or New York again.

554
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,632
I could just, you know,
picture my dead body laid out somewhere.

555
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,311
I'll tell you a story.

556
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,758
One time we were defending two negroes
on a murder charge in a race riot

557
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,755
in Columbia, Tennessee,
right near the birthplace of The Ku Klux Klan.

558
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,435
Now, the word was out
that if we even tried to sleep in that town,

559
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,953
they'd kill us.

560
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,830
So, we drive 45 miles every night to Nashville.

561
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,151
So, one night, we're leaving town
just after sunset.

562
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,994
I spot, oh, three, four state police cars.

563
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,710
They pull us over.
They say they have a warrant to search us.

564
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,711
I'm at the wheel.

565
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,156
The sheriff says,
"Okay, boys, check out the trunk."

566
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,750
I tell my people, say,
"Don't let them plant something on us."

567
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,876
Well, it was a dry county.

568
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,349
And lawyers,
everybody knows lawyers are gonna drink.

569
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,115
But, believe it or not,
we didn't have any whiskey in the car.

570
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,715
The sheriff says, "Search this nigger lawyer."
I say, "You have a warrant to search me?"

571
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,633
He says, "No." I say, "Then, the answer is no."

572
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,395
He says, "Oh, you must be the one.
Get out the car."

573
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,392
I say, "What for?" He says, "Drunken driving."

574
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,596
I say, "I haven't had a drink in 24 hours."

575
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,509
They shove me into a police car

576
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,478
between two beefy deputies
holding shotguns.

577
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,152
They drive off.

578
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,360
Suddenly the car turns off the road, starts
heading through the woods towards the river.

579
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,398
We come to a place where there's
a bunch of men standing around a big tree

580
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,359
with a rope hanging over it.
They fixin' to do some lynching.

581
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,039
All of a sudden,
the car with my friend shows up.

582
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,035
So these two deputies, they get cold feet.
They turn around.

583
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,796
They drive me back to town.
The streets are completely empty.

584
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,075
Hell, everybody's down by the river.

"The magistrate's in that building
over yonder. You go ahead on."

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,672
He say, "Well, we got this
here boy for drunken driving."

594
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,954

He says, "Do you want to take my test?"

596
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,439
I said, "Well, what's your test?"

597
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,717
He said, "I'm a teetotaler,

Clarendon County, South Carolina.

619
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,032
Now, the superintendent
of schools down there

620
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,749
had refused to provide a bus
for the Scotts Branch School.

621
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,192
It was a little one-room schoolhouse.
We called them doghouse schools.

622
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,035
Harry Briggs was a garage mechanic,
who fought during World War II.

623
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,477
His 7 -year-old son had to walk
five miles to school every day.

624
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,239
So, Harry Briggs filed a complaint

625

charging the school district with violating
his son's right to an equal education.

626
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,550
The very next day,
the garage owner fired Harry Briggs

627
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,073
and we took on the case.

628
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,430
Now, our case simply asked for

629
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,876
separate but equal school facilities,

630
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,796
but a judge called Waties Waring...

631
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,549
Judge Waties Waring, rare Southern maverick.

632
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,358
He surprised us.

633
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,238
He challenged us to argue the larger question.

634
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,714
Were South Carolina's segregated schools
legal under the Constitution?

635
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,994
You see Judge Waring had forced our hand.

636
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,594
So, now, instead of taking on
one little school board,

637
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,478
we were challenging the sovereign state
of South Carolina.

638
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,832
The governor of South Carolina,
James F. Byrnes said,

639
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,516
he would spend millions to improve
negro schools, but he would never integrate.

640
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,955
This took us to a three-judge court
in Charleston,

641
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,790
where we would have to prove
that segregation actually did harm our clients.

642
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,755
We brought Dr. Kenneth Clark,

643
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,432
a social psychologist from New York,
down to Clarendon County.

644
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,354
He got off the train with these.

645
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,433
Dr. Clark went to the Scotts Branch School
carrying a court order and the two dolls.

646
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,559
"T ell me, son, what color is this doll?

647
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,550
"And what color is this doll?

00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,111
"Which doll looks most like you?

"Which doll would you like to play with?

"Which doll do you like the most?

"Which doll don't you like?"

Your Honors,

653
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,032
Dr. Kenneth Clark has testified that
when negro children were asked to choose

654
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,588
between the white doll and the brown doll,

655
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,514
and to say which doll was nice, 65 % said,

656
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,238
the white doll was the nice doll.

657
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,357
70% said the brown doll was bad.

658
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,192
Every one of our tests shows
an unmistakable preference

659
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,432
for the white doll
and a rejection of the brown doll.

660
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,470
This overwhelmingly suggests
segregation has a detrimental effect

661
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,189
on the personality development
of negro children.

662
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,559
They, like other human beings,

more time to make schools equal.

was going to save America.

00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,472
"If it's a girl, we'll still name him Thurgood."

831
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,915
So, we went back to New York
to await the decision.

832
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,879
And, while Chief Justice Vinson
and the others weighed our case,

833
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,110
outside, pressure mounted.

834
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,475
Some governors came right out, said that,

835
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,872
they would resist any order
to integrate their schools.

836
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,637
So, people began to say, "Well,
what if the Supreme Court issues an opinion,

837
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,473
"and states refuse to obey?

838
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,713
"You know, the Supreme Court
doesn't have an army."

839
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,828
Now, you know how, um,

840
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,478
we negroes claim to have a sixth sense?

841
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,794
We can detect whether or not
a white person is for us or against us.

842
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,032
(AU DIENCE LAUGHING)

843
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,870
Anyway, my sixth sense told me,
that Chief Justice Vinson was my enemy.

844
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,958
See, you have to understand,

845
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,915
all during this time,

846
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,959
our offices at the legal defense fund
are fighting discrimination,

847
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,109
wherever they can find it.

848
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,112
I had a big file called "soldier trouble." Oh...

849
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,108
We had gotten complaints from Korea,

850
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,913
about the treatment of negro soldiers
serving under General MacArthur.

851
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,150
You remember General Douglas MacArthur?

00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,028
"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

854
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,959
You might not know this.

855
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,995
Uh, during World War II,

856
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,833
negro soldiers were assigned
to segregated units,

857
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,070
commanded by white officers.

858
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,799
And, um, after the war,

859
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,996
President Truman
made a lot of people very unhappy.

860
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,119
He signed an executive order
that desegregated all the armed forces.

861
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,237
General MacArthur just never
got around to obeying It.

862
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,357
So, we had reports that,

863
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,796
39 negro soldiers from the 24th Infantry,

864
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,112
had been court-martialed
for cowardice, disobeying orders.

865
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,829
And three of them had been
sentenced to life imprisonment

866
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,316
in trials lasting less than 10 minutes.

867
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,279
So, the NAACP decided
I should go out to Korea.

868
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,353
I don't know.
I guess, they thought I was expendable.

869
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,115
When I applied for a passport, I found out

870
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,636
that General MacArthur
had been calling the FBI,

871
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,837
had asked for information about my sex life,

872
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,673
what he referred to as my
"Communist affiliations."

873
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,431
I got the passport.

874
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,149
But, the General and I
weren't off to a good start.

875
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,074
Now, I knew men in the 24th Infantry.

876
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,995
Men, like Lieutenant Leon Gilbert,
who had two bronze stars,

877
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,119
had led his 35 men up a hill,
called Bloody Ridge, three times.

878
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,118
He lost 30 of them.

879
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,679
A white captain ordered him to go back up
the hill with the surviving men.

880
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,912
He said, "Sir, if I can't take that hill with 35,
I'll never take it with four."

881
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,914
Well, four nights later,
Lieutenant Gilbert was court-martialed

882
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,673
and sentenced to death by firing squad.

883
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,515
So now, um, I finally
get to MacArthur's headquarters in Japan.

884
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,672
He comes in wearing a chest full of medals,
sunglasses.

885
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,833
He says, "Marshall.
You ought to get over to Korea,

886
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,478
"get a look at some combat."

See, I knew he thought I was expendable.

I get to Korea. I'm riding in a Jeep
with my escort, Colonel D. D. Martin.

I finish my investigation.

896
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,395
I go back to MacArthur.

897
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,435
I remind him that the
United States Navy has integrated,

898
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,195
I also tell him it only took the Air Force
one day to end discrimination.

899
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,794
They gave an order. It happened.

900
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,549
He tells me, "Well, at such time
as I find negroes, who are qualified.

"They'll be integrated, and not before."

01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,193
"Yes, sir, General, it was delightful.

it was time for me to go.

Everyone knows that.

to fight and die overseas,
for freedoms they've never known at home.

and re-argue the case.

John W. Davis let everyone know, that
this was his swan song, his final argument.

998

on the faces of the nine Justices.

When he finished,
the old man had tears in his eyes.

And, so did one or two of the Justices.

1031
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,632
May it please the court?
As I understand the position,

1032
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,075
of the distinguished defense counsel,

1033
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,715
his justification for segregation
in South Carolina is,

1034
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,872
one, that they all just got together,

1035
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,308
and decided amongst themselves
that it is best for the races to be separated.

1036
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,835
And, two, that segregation
has existed for over a century.

1037
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,037
Neither argument, to my mind, is any good.

1038
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,636
The negroes who are forced to submit

1039
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,713
to segregation are all American citizens,

1040
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,395
who, by accident of birth,
are a different color.

1041
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:54,315
Color makes no difference
insofar as this court is concerned.

1042
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,910
The Fourteenth Amendment
was put into our Constitution,

1043

after a bloody civil war.

1044
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,990
The duty of enforcing it,
is placed upon this court,

1045
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,191
to make sure that the states
disregard little pet feelings about race.

1046

is guaranteed 12 years of education.

1047
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,959
There is no way you can
repay lost school years.

1048

But they say, "Leave it to the states
until they work it out."

1049
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:27,394
The only way, this court can decide this case,

1050
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:32,112
in opposition to our position,
is to find, for some reason,

1051
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,511
that negroes are inferior
to all other human beings.

1052
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,759
No one will stand up
in this court and say that,

1053
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,195
because they would have to justify it.

1054
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,915
Only one thing can justify
continued segregation.

1055
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,797
That is a determination,

1056
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,519
that the people who were once
held in slavery,

1057
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,195
be kept as near to that condition
as is possible.

1058
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,794
And now is the time, we submit,

1059
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,309
that the court make it clear,

1060
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:11,430
that that is not what the Constitution
of the United States stands for.

Chief Justice Warren.

1065
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,159
He was a politician who'd never
served on a court before, so

1066
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,555
his judicial philosophy was unknown.

1067
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,036
I did find out later
that during the court's deliberations,

1068
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,796
Chief Justice Warren
made some trips to visit Civil War battlefields.

a negro who served during World War II,

1070
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,431
drove him out to Gettysburg.

1071
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:54,231
Warren contemplated the graves, looked at
the monument with Lincoln's simple words.

1072
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,153
Warren stopped at a Virginia inn for the night.

1073
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,119
In the morning, he woke,
he saw his car parked under a tree,

1074
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,954
saw his chauffeur sleeping in the back seat.
He woke him.

20 miles of here, where I can get a room."

was adopted,

1091
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,231
or even to 1896,
when Plessy v. Ferguson was written.

1092
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,878

in the light

We believe, unanimously, that it does.

We conclude that in the
field of public education,

1102
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,948
the doctrine of
"separate but equal" has no place.

1103

Therefore, we hold that
the plaintiffs are deprived

guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Eventually, I was able to pour myself
back into my work.

1157
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,713
You see, the resistance to the school case,

1158
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,554
meant that we had to pull up our socks.

1159
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,835
Go into courtrooms all over the South.

1160
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,513
See, the decision gave us a precedent.

1161
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,910
We had our foot in the door.
Now, equal means integrated.

1162
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,390
We could challenge segregation in

1163
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,871
Iibraries, and restaurants,

1164
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,837
and public toilets.

1165
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,552
See, when I was growing up, in Baltimore,

1166
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,236
there were very few public toilets
for colored people.

1167
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,079
So, when you felt something,

1168
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,237
the best you could do was hop
on the trolley for home and hope.

1169
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,634
I remember one day, I got off the trolley,

1170
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:37,076
only made it as far
as the front door of our house.

1171
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,477
You never forget something like that.

1172
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,350
All of these things, they happened too late
for my mother and my daddy.

1173
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,633
But, those old,
"White Only" signs in Baltimore

1174
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,438
were finally coming down.

1175
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:02,273
Well now, I'd say,
it's about five years after the Brown case.

1176
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,188
And, I finally decide it's time for me
to stop traveling 100,000 miles a year.

1177
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,710
You know, it's time for me
to go into a big law firm.

1178
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,439
You know, do something
that I had never managed to do.

1179
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,636
Make myself a bunch of money.

1180
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,032
I'd started seeing Cecilia Suyat,
who worked in our office.

1181
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,231
Cissy had a sense of humor
that really kept me in line.

1182
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,719
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1183
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,391
Soon, we married.

1184
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:33,473
And before too long,
she made me a very happy man.

1185
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,189
Along came Thurgood, Jr. He was a boy.

1186
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,111
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1187
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,109
And, uh, our other son, John.

1188
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,070
Oh, so now I get a phone call

1189
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,675
from the new,
Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

1190
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,479
Tells me that President Kennedy has decided,

1191
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,358
to make me a judge on
The Federal Court of Appeals,

1192
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,192
second highest court in the country.

1193
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,391
Now people call me a liar when I say this,

1194
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,869
but when I was a young lawyer,
back in Baltimore,

1195
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,873
my highest aim was to
become a county magistrate.

1196
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,509
You know, just like that little
teetotaler back in T ennessee.

1197
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,752
You know, back then, there were only two
negro judges in the entire country.

1198
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,149
That's right. So...

1199
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,917
The chief judge on the Federal Court
of Appeals, he made my, uh,

1200
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,912
my swearing in,
in New York a nice deal, nice deal.

1201
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,470
Organized a group photograph
with all the other judges.

1202
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,472
And uh, well, just before everyone arrived,

1203
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,552
the photographer
took a test shot and blew a fuse.

1204
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,629
(FUSE BLOWS)

1205
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,631
So, I come in a few minutes later.

1206
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,632
There are people milling around
in the dark, you know.

1207
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:48,840
This flustered secretary spots me.
She says, "Oh, thank God, the electrician!"

1208
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,759
"Lady, you must be crazy,

1209
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,276
"if you think a colored man could
become an electrician in New York City."

1210
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,078
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1211
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:09,236
Well, at first, you know,
I was the, uh, the low man on the court,

1212
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,635
dealing with the least interesting cases.

1213
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,756
Uh, like taxes and corporate law, and

1214
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,196
I would get all the
Wall Street securities cases,

1215
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,272
'cause the other judges
owned stock and had conflicts of interest.

1216
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,158
I used to say, "How nice for you boys to have

1217
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,074
"a poor man on the bench
to handle all this stuff for you."

1218
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,513
But, let the record show,

1219
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,115
I wrote 98 majority opinions.

1220
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,795
Not a one of them was overturned
by the Supreme Court.

1221
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,676
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1222
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,473
So, one day, I'm sitting
in the, uh, judges' dining room.

1223
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,869
Bailiff comes in, "Judge, Judge!"

1224
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,793
"Fred, I told you not to bother me
while I'm eating."

1225
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,235
"But Judge,
the president wants to talk to you."

1226
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,072
"The president of what?"

1227
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,030
"The President of the United States, LBJ."

1228
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:12,353
"Judge Marshall, I want you to be
the Solicitor General of the United States."

1229
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,119
"Thank you, Mr. President.
That is a great honor...

1230
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,078
"I'd like some time to talk it over
with Mrs. Marshall."

1231
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,196
"Take as much time as you need."

1232
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,553
The next day, I get to the office.

1233
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,757
The phone rings. It's Lyndon Johnson.

1234
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,355
"Mr. President,
I thought you said I'd have some time."

1235
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,873
"You had time!"

1236
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,029
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1237
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,237
"Well, number one, sir,
it's a salary loss of $5,000."

1238
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,639
"I know that."

1239
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,712
"Number two, sir, I'd be giving up
a lifetime job on the court."

1240
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,789
"I know that."

1241
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,677
"And finally, sir, I haven't got any money."

1242
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,958
"I know that, too. I've got your income tax
report sitting right here in front of me."

1243
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,592
And then, right over the phone,
LBJ took me by the ears.

1244
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,390
"Thurgood, I want people to go
into the Supreme Court building,

1245
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,631
"and see a black man standing there

1246
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,030
"in the Solicitor's cutaway coat
and ask the question,

1247
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,237
"'Who is that negro up there?'"

1248
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,552
"And hear the answer,

1249
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:19,156
"'He is the Solicitor General
of the United States.'"

1250
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,913
Well, by the time LBJ got finished with me,

1251
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,958
I was ashamed I hadn't volunteered.

1252
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,638
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1253
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,950
So, Cissy and the boys,
we moved back down here to Washington.

1254
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,116
It looked like this old,
Pullman dining car waiter from Baltimore,

1255
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:45,239
was about to become
the highest-ranking negro,

1256
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,154
ever to serve in the
United States Government. (CHUCKLES)

1257
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,230
Now, there had been some
rumors that if a vacancy

1258
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,232
came up on the Supreme Court,
that LBJ might appoint me.

1259
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,351
But, the politicians were telling Johnson,

1260
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,113
"His putting a negro on that court,

1261
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,993
"oh, that would cost him
the South in the '68 election."

1262
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,350
So, the night that Justice Tom Clark resigned,

1263
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,954
we all went to a party in his honor.

1264
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,716
President pulled me aside
and said, "Don't expect the job."

1265
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,355
Well, that put me back on my heels, you know.

1266
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,352
Well, I wanted that job. I thought I'd earned It.

1267
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:27,593
But, I figured some no-good, sons of bitches
had stoked up LBJ, you know, with rumors

1268
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,035
about me, and booze, and women.

1269
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,638
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1270
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,158
Anyway, the next morning,
he calls me over to the Oval Office.

1271
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,794
I figure, to tell me
why he's not appointing me.

1272
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,476
He says "You know, Thurgood,
I'm going to put you on the Supreme Court."

1273
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,879
"Thank you, Mr. President."

1274
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,678
"Have you told Cissy yet?"

1275
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,479
"Well, how could I tell her?
I didn't know anything.

1276
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,152
"Oh, she'll be shocked."

1277
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:01,677
"Well, God damn it, let's get her on the
speaker phone. We'll break the news!"

1278
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,156
So, before you know it,
LBJ's got Cissy on speaker phone.

1279
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,993
I say, "Hi, honey." She says, "Hi, Thurgood.

1280
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,389
"Did we get the Supreme Court appointment?"

1281
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,391
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1282
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,753
Well, you never heard a man laugh like LBJ.

1283
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,993
He says, "Well, Thurgood,
I guess our friendship's about busted up now.

1284
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,435
"I don't reckon, I'll be seeing you much."

1285
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,392
"Well, Mr. President, you know,

1286
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,950
"Justice Tom Clark stayed
best friends with President Truman,

1287
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,556
"even after he voted against
the president's wishes."

1288
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,996
"Clark really socked it
to Truman in that steel case.

1289
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,914
"I would have no hesitation,
socking it to you."

1290
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,954
He just stared at me.
"You mean you'd do that to me?"

1291
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,793
"You bet!"

1292
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,316
And then he shook my hand,

1293
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,189
said, "Well, I'm glad
we understand each other."

1294
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:05,073
Oh, you have to understand,
these were tough political times.

1295
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,713
LBJ was twisting senators' arms
to get me confirmed.

1296
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,028
It got nasty.

1297
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,550
The vote was 69 for me, 11 against.

1298
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:18,679
Johnson convinced
20 Southern Democrats not to vote at all.

1299
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:22,036
So, they could, you know,
cover their asses in the next election.

1300
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,351
Then, he called me. He said, "Well...

1301
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,591
"Congratulations, Mr. Justice Marshall.

1302
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:32,235
"But, goddamn, the hell you caused me!

1303
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,198
"I have never been through so much hell."

1304
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,835
"Well, Mr. President,
it was your idea, it wasn't mine."

1305
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,109
Oh...

1306
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:51,310
I was sworn in,
in the Rose Garden of The White House,

1307
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,153
by my good friend,

1308
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,949
Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black,

1309
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,874
a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.

1310
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:18,353
And, you know,
I would wear this robe for nearly 25 years.

1311
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,110
Now the life of a justice,

1312
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:29,797
well, it, it's far different from the, uh,
the hurly-burly of the courtroom.

1313
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,555
You know, tell you God's truth.

1314
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,790
I missed the action at first.

1315
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:41,273
Well, you know, you hear cases,
you read briefs, you, uh, think.

1316
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,354
You sit in conference
with the other eight Justices,

1317
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,796
the most secret and private of all gatherings.

1318
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,516
And then, you think some more.
And, you write.

1319
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,110
I wrote opinions in 322 cases.

1320
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,275
You know, sitting on that bench,

1321
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,550
uh, listening to cases being argued,

1322
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,519
my mind would often drift back
to the sounds of those

1323
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,478
prisoners in the
Northwest Baltimore Police Station.

1324
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,599
You see, this is why I did
everything in my power to protect

1325
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,116
the civil rights of every American citizen.

1326
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:27,832
See, I say that the death penalty
is cruel and unusual punishment,

1327
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,115
which is prohibited
by the Eighth Amendment.

1328
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,670
They say it's a deterrent.

1329
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,557
Well, hell, if it was really a deterrent,

1330
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,958
there never would have been
a second execution after the first one.

1331
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,828
I mean, as a defense attorney,
I fought hard to get innocent men

1332
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,388
Iife imprisonment,
instead of the gas chamber,

1333
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,837
this left time for new evidence and appeals.

1334
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,152
I was the only one on the court
who'd ever tried a murder case.

1335
01:29:55,240 --> 01:30:00,268
I had seen too many poor,
innocent defendants just sentenced to death.

1336
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,599
You know, think about this.

1337
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:07,913
There are 70 countries in the world
that forbid capital punishment.

1338
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,992
Wouldn't America
pay herself the highest tribute,

1339
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,908
by recognizing the humanity
of her fellow human beings,

1340
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,912
settling for life imprisonment without parole?

1341
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,155
On the Warren court,
we put a stop to all executions in 1967,

1342
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,629
and then Nixon was elected.

1343
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:32,157
He was able to appoint
four justices in just four years.

1344
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,636
So, the executions started all over again.

1345
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,509
I was writing a dissent
in every capital punishment case

1346
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,670
that came before us. But, by that time,

1347
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,274
all the other judges
had grown so close together,

1348
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,351
they were all peeing through the same quill.

1349
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,358
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1350
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,788
Oh, I left instructions for my clerks
to wake me at any hour,

1351
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,235
if a request for a stay
of execution came through.

1352
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,950
I also told them, I said, "Look,
if I die, prop me up, keep on voting."

1353
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,712
(LAUGHING)

1354
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,473
And, you know, I am for gun control,
complete gun control.

1355
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:13,680
I don't see why a private citizen,

1356
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,151
has to, uh, carry a pistol or a machine gun.

1357
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,673
I don't see it.

1358
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,312
You know, during the school case,

1359
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,472
we had a lot of mean phone calls.

1360
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,393
One time, the Chief of Police
of New York called me up.

1361
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,234
Invited me out for a drink. He said,
"Thurgood, we're worried about you."

1362
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,515
Handed me a little package
wrapped up as a gift.

1363
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,639
I open it up.
There was a.32 inside with some ammunition.

1364
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,029
(LAUGHS) I hand it right back to him.
I say, "Chief,

1365
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,398
"my weapon is the law.
I just have to do the best I can with that."

1366
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,358
You see, I wrote opinions
based on the First Amendment.

1367
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:57,399
And I believe, that whatever justifications
there may be for, um,

1368
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,357
regulating obscenities,

1369
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,389
it does not extend
into the privacy of one's own home.

1370
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,874
If the First Amendment
means anything, it means,

1371
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,036
no state has any business,

1372
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,511
uh, telling a man, sitting alone
in his own home, what books he can read,

1373
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,556
what films he can watch.

1374
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,550
Our constitutional heritage,

1375
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:25,909
rebels at the thought of giving government
the power to control men's minds.

1376
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,229
You know, we had to screen some
pornographic movies on one of those cases.

1377
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,038
Oh, that was a fun assignment.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1379
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,916
You know, when it ended,
I turned to the Chief Justice.

1380
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,879
I say, "Did you learn anything new from that?
I didn't."

1381

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1382
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:54,317
You know, when you're appointed
to the Supreme Court, it's a lifetime job,

1383
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,949
and presidents love to make
Supreme Court appointments.

1384
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:01,237
They can't do that now,
unless there's an empty seat.

1385
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,198
Now, in the spring of 1970,
I came down with a,

1386
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,397
a bad case of pneumonia,
you know, a bad case of pneumonia.

1387
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,631
Had to go into Bethesda Naval Hospital.

1388
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,553
Well, word had gotten out
that I was much sicker than people realized.

1389
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,677
Well, a few weeks later, I was feeling better.

He said, "President Nixon."

1400
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,959
Uh, you know, during the, uh,
Reagan years, a lot of people

1401
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,837
wanted me off the court.

Uh, too liberal, too tipsy.

01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,793
Well, I'd tell them that I had
accepted a lifetime appointment.

about my being too soft on our boys.

1412
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,677

for anything I did."

01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:36,398
and she discovers that
there is only one empty seat left,

1481
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,632
and it is right next to this negro.

1482
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:46,272
So, she sits down in this one empty seat.

1483
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,358
And, you know,
finally she can't take it any longer.

1484
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,479
She yells out, "Niggers! Niggers! Niggers!"

1485
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:05,396
And, the negro leaps up and says,
"Where? Where? Where?"

1486
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,556

1487
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:28,794
Say... Oh, our country?

1488
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,758
Well, our, our country, uh...

1489
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:38,470
You know, Langston Hughes, my classmate,

1490
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,278
he said it pretty well.

1491
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:47,793
"O, let America be America again--

1492
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,550
"The land that never has been yet--

1493
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,394
"And yet must be--

1494
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,314
"The land where every man is free.

1495
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:08,069
"The land that's mine--
the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, Me--

1496
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,318
"Whose sweat and blood,
whose faith and pain

1497
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,676
"Must bring back our mighty dream again.

1498
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,158
"O, yes,

1499
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,390
"I say it plain,

1500
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:25,439
"America never was America to me,

1501
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,637
"And yet I swear this oath--

1502
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:33,475
"America will be!"
