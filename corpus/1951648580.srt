1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The National Rifle Association
has produced a film

2
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600
which you are sure
to find of great interest.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
Let's look at it.

4
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,800
It was the morning
of April 20th, 1999.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
And it was pretty much like
any other morning in America.

6
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,400
The farmer did his chores,

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
the milkman
made his deliveries,

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,300
the president bombed
another country

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,600
whose name
we couldn't pronounce.

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,100
Out in Fargo, North Dakota,

11
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,800
Carry McWilliams
went on his morning walk.

12
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,800
Back in Michigan, Mrs. Hughes
welcomed her students

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
for another day of school.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,000
And out in a little town
in Colorado,

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,300
two boys went bowling

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
at six in the morning.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,700
Yes, it was a typical day
in the United States

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
of America.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,200
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,100
I'm here to open up an account.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, what type of account
would you like?

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,500
Um, I want the account where
I can, uh, get the free gun.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,500
I'd spotted an ad
in the local Michigan paper

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
that said if you opened an
account at North Country Bank,

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,500
- the bank would give you a gun.
- You do a CD

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
and we'll hand you a gun.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,500
We have a whole brochure here
that you can look at.

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,400
Once we do the background check
and everything,

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,100
- it's yours to go.
- Okay. Well, all right,

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
well, that's the account
I'd like to open.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
We have a vault, which
at all times we keep at least

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
- 500 firearms.
- Five-hundred of these,

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,100
- you have in your vault?
- In our vault.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Wow.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,300
We have to do
a background check.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,100
- At the bank here?
- At the bank,

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
which we are a licensed
firearm dealer.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Oh, you are? You're a bank
and a licensed firearm dealer.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
What do I put for "race"?
White or Caucasian or...?

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
- Caucasian.
- Caucasian.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,400
I knew you were gonna make me
spell the... Cau-ca-sian.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,000
- Is that right?
- Yes.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,300
I don't think that's the part
they're gonna be worried about.

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
"Have you ever been adjudicated
mentally defective

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,000
or have you ever been committed
to a mental institution?"

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,900
I've never been committed
to a mental institution.

48
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,400
What does that mean,

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,800
"Have I ever been adjudicated
mentally defective"?

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,300
It would be something
involved with a crime.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
So if I'm just normally mentally
defective but not criminal...

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
Yeah, exactly.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,800
- There you go, Mike.
- Okay. Thank you very much. Wow.

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,100
- I had one personally--
- That's a nice tension.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
It is and it's
a straight-shooter,

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,100
It's a straight-shooter,
let me tell ya.

57
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Wow. Sweet.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Well, here's my first question:
You think

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
it's a little dangerous,
handing out guns in a bank?

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,300
Ten-ho!

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Each gun makes lots
of battle sounds.

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Just press the trigger,
and listen.

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,500
That sounds like a gun battle.
Over there.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,100
- Is it real?
- Looks like real!

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,900
Hey, it sounds like real!

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Right! The Sound-O-Power
military and western rifles

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
by Marx!

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This was my first gun.

69
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,100
I couldn't wait to go outside
and shoot up the neighbourhood.

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,700
Those were the days.
"I was born

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
"in Michigan

72
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,100
"and I wish and wish again
that I was back

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,700
"in the town where I was born"

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
By the time I was a teenager,

75
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
I was such a good shot

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
I won the National
Rifle Association's

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,900
Marksman award.
You see,

78
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,800
I grew up in Michigan,

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,700
a gun-lover's paradise.

80
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,800
And so did this man,

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
the Oscar-winning actor
and president

82
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,300
of the National
Rifle Association,

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,200
Mr. Charlton Heston.

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,700
We come from a state
where everyone

85
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
loves to go hunting.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
- Hah.
- Even the dogs.

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,600
There were actually
two of the hunters at camp.

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,100
They thought
they'd get a few pictures

89
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
of the dog dressed up
as a hunter

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
to kind of just have some fun
around camp.

91
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
And one of the guys
had the idea that,

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,100
"Why don't we sling a rifle
on the dog's back

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,100
to make the pictures
a little more interesting.

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
The victim was kneeling down
in front of the dog

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
when the weapon slipped.

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,400
The one round went through
the victim's shin,

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
the right part of his shin,

98
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
and came out through
the back of his calf.

99
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,800
Was the dog hauled off for any
period of time by the police?

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
No, it wasn't. No.

101
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,500
Um, in Michigan,
the law basically states

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,000
that people can commit crimes
that animals

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,200
aren't some... form of,
uh, you know,

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,700
whatever that can
commit a crime.

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,200
An animal cannot commit a crime

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
or be charged with a crime
in this state.

107
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,900
- Exactly.
- Is it possible that the dog

108
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,600
- knew what it was doing?
- That, I don't know.

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,300
I really wouldn't be able
to tell you that.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
The dog was cute
dressed up as a hunter,

111
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,200
there's no doubt about it.
I mean, it was a funny picture,

112
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
um, you know, to look at.

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,500
It was... it was kind of neat.

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,300
Yup, this was the kind
of place I was from.

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,900
A box

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
- of 270s.
- Coming up.

117
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,300
- There you go.
- Perfect.

118
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,100
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

119
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,700
Sorry about that, sorry.

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
So I've been discharged.

121
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
You don't need no gun control.
You know what you need?

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
We need some bullet control.

123
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,000
We need to control the bullets,
that's right.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,700
I think all bullets
should cost $5,000.

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,200
$5,000 for a bullet.
You know why?

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,800
'Cause if a bullet cost $5,000,

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,200
there'd be no more
innocent bystanders.

128
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Every time

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
somebody get shot, people are,

130
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,000
"Damn, he must've
did something."

131
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,100
See, they put $50,000's worth
of bullets in his ass!"

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,600
And people'd think
before they killed somebody

133
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
for a bullet that cost $5,000!

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,900
"Man, I would blow
your fucking head off --

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
if I could afford it."

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm gonna get me another job,

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm gonna start saving some
money, and you a dead man.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,400
You better hope I can't
get no bullets on layaway.

139
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,700
Not far from where
Charlton Heston and I grew up

140
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,800
is a training ground
for the Michigan Militia.

141
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
Why do you use the bowling pins?

142
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,600
From a self-defence or
whatever tactical standpoint,

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
it's a small target,
which also represents

144
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,600
the vitals on a...
on a human being,

145
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,200
if you ever had to shoot at one.

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,000
The Michigan Militia
became known around the world

147
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,200
when, on April 19th, 1995,
two guys living in Michigan

148
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,900
who had attended
Militia meetings,

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols,

150
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,400
blew up the federal building

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,200
in Oklahoma City,

152
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,800
killing 168 people.

153
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
The Michigan Militia
wanted everyone to know

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,400
that they were nothing
like McVeigh and Nichols.

155
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,000
This is an American tradition.

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
It's an American responsibility
to be armed.

157
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,200
If you're not armed,
you're not responsible.

158
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Who's gonna defend your kids,
the cops?

159
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,900
The federal government?
No, none of them.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,600
It's your job
to defend you and yours.

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,400
If you don't do it,
you're in dereliction of duty,

162
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
as an American. Period.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We're here to let them
know we're here to help.

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,900
We're not the bogeymen
we're made out to be.

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,500
We're here to help and defend
the people of this country.

166
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,700
I'm sure you guys
are the kind of people

167
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,000
that people would like
to have as their neighbour.

168
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
If somebody's in need,
you're there to help them.

169
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,600
Pretty much. We're all normal
people. We all have regular jobs

170
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
and this is what we do
on our time.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
- What kind of a job do you have?
- I'm a draftsman.

172
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,700
- How about you?
- Unemployed right now.

173
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Frank, what do you do
for a living?

174
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,200
I work for
a heat trading company.

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
- I drive a truck for 'em.
- Okay. How about you?

176
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
- I'm a real-estate negotiator
- Real- estate negotiator!

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,400
White collar all the way.

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
You don't bring that with you,
though, do you,

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,100
when you're negotiating
the real estate?

180
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,800
No.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Where do you live,
in suburban--

182
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,800
- Westland.
- So what do you have

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,300
- in your home?
- Smith & Wesson 9-millimetre.

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,900
- Nine-millimetre?
- Yeah.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,300
- And how about you?
- With hollow points.

186
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,800
Twelve gage.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
- Twelve gage at home?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,800
- How about you?
- M-16.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,300
- At home?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
- At the ready.
- I don't agree with that,

191
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,300
'cause you gotta worry about
where your arms are going.

192
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,300
I know where they're gonna go
when I aim and shoot.

193
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Whose idea was the calendar?

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
That'd probably be Christian.

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
A picture's worth 1,000 words.
A) it demonstrates a level

196
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,200
of sophistication that you
wouldn't expect out of Militia;

197
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,000
B) you know,

198
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,400
- we're people too.
- Right.

199
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
And we have a lot of fun
with it.

200
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,900
- Right.
- There was a fundraiser.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
It showed, um, that we're not
so serious, you know.

202
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,600
We're not these conspiracy nuts
who wouldn't want our pictures

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,700
to get out. The idea...
it was a fundraiser, you know...

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
I've had guns, um...

205
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
pretty much since
I was old enough to...

206
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,300
to have them. And I learned
how to use them, um...

207
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,200
You're silly!

208
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,200
Uh, because being a female,
number one,

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,700
I felt it was important
to be able to protect myself

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
with the best means possible.

211
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,800
And one of those means
is having a gun.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,700
When a criminal
breaks into your house,

213
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,600
who's the first person
you're gonna call?

214
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,700
Most people will call the police
because they have guns.

215
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Cut out the middleman. Take care
of your own family yourself.

216
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,000
If you're not going to protect
your family, who is?

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
We're not racist,
we're not extremist,

218
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,600
we're not fundamentalist, we're
not terrorists or militants

219
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,400
- or other such nonsense.
- We're citizens.

220
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,900
We're just concerned citizens.
We have a desire

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,900
to fulfil our responsibilities
and duties as Americans,

222
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
and armed citizenry
is part of that.

223
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,700
- What do you grow here?
- Right now, there's tofu beans,

224
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,100
soy beans. Tofu-soy beans.

225
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,300
- You're a tofu farmer.
- Yeah. Yeah, food farmer.

226
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
- I'm a food farmer.
- Food.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
I grow food for people to eat.

228
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,600
No herbicides, no pesticides
on that stuff.

229
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,900
- Right. All natural.
- Right.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,300
- Yeah. Better.
- Certified organic.

231
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,200
- Uh-huh. Healthier.
- Yeah.

232
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,700
Basically, yeah.

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,100
This is James Nichols,
the brother of Terry Nichols.

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
James graduated from high
school the same year I did,

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,900
in the district next to mine.

236
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,600
On this farm
in Decker, Michigan,

237
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,200
McVeigh and the Nichols
brothers made practice bombs

238
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,100
before Oklahoma City.

239
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,500
Terry and James were both
arrested in connection

240
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,600
- to the bombing.
- U.S. attorneys

241
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,300
formally linked the Nichols
brothers of Michigan

242
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,400
with Oklahoma bomb suspect
Timothy McVeigh.

243
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
Officials charged James,
who was at the hearing,

244
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,100
and Terry, who was not,
with conspiring

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
to make and possess
small bombs.

246
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Terry Nichols was convicted
and received a life sentence.

247
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,800
Timothy McVeigh was executed.
But the feds

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
didn't have the goods on James,

249
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,900
- so the charges were dropped.
- I'm just glad

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,900
to be out and free,
so I can get on with my life.

251
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Did Timothy McVeigh
ever stay here?

252
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Yes. Yes. He stayed here
several times.

253
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,600
For the longest period, about
three months or so, I dunno.

254
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
But, uh, he was a nice guy.

255
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,100
- Decent guy?
- Oh, yeah.

256
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,500
They didn't find anything
on this farm.

257
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
As to what,

258
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,100
- bomb-making material?
- Any kind of explosives.

259
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,500
Uh, yeah, I had blasting caps,
dynamite blasting caps,

260
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,100
dynamite fuse, black powder,
you know?

261
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
For muzzle loaders and...
Sure.

262
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,900
Diesel fuel, fertilizer, but,
uh, that is normal farm stuff

263
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,200
that is no way connected
any way whatsoever to, uh,

264
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
the Oklahoma City bombing
or bomb making.

265
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,700
Them people - law enforcement,
if you wanna call 'em that -

266
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
were here and they were shaking
in their shoes.

267
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
They were physically shaking.
Scared to death.

268
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
Of?

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Because they thought this
was gonna be another Waco.

270
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,900
Because certain people...

271
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
namely my ex-wife
and other people,

272
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,200
said I'm a radical,
I'm a wild man,

273
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,900
I got a gun under every arm,
down every leg and every shoe,

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,400
every corner of the house.

275
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,300
You say anything to me,
I'll shoot ya.

276
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,500
If the people find out how
they've been ripped off

277
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,800
and... and enslaved in this
country by the government,

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,400
by the powers-to-be...

279
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,800
they will revolt, with anger,

280
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,200
with merciless anger.

281
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
There'll be blood
running in the streets.

282
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
When a government
turns tyrannical,

283
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,500
it is your duty to overthrow it.

284
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, why not use Gandhi's way?

285
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
He didn't have any guns,

286
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
and he beat the British empire.

287
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm not familiar with that.

288
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,100
Oscoda has a bad habit
of raising psychos.

289
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,500
Bad habit of it.

290
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
This is Brent.

291
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,100
And this is his buddy DJ.

292
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
They live in Oscoda, Michigan,

293
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,900
across the bay
from the Nichols farm.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,300
Eric Harris,

295
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
who would later go on
to commit the massacre

296
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
at Columbine High School
in Colorado,

297
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,000
spent part
of his childhood here.

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Eric lived on
the air-force base in Oscoda,

299
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,000
where his dad flew planes
during the Gulf War.

300
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,000
Twenty percent of all the bombs
dropped in that war

301
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
were from planes
that took off from Oscoda.

302
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,400
I asked Brent if he remembered
anything about Eric.

303
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,600
I never knew him,
but I knew of him.

304
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
He left here before I got here.
I've only lived here seven years

305
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
- off and on.
- He was about the same age

306
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,900
as you, so you must have people
in your class--

307
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,700
A friend of mine knows him,
he was in class with him.

308
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,600
He's lived here all his life.

309
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,300
I went to school with him
and it shocked me to hear it

310
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,100
on the news.

311
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,200
That especially a kid from here
would be doing that.

312
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,200
I didn't last too long
in high school.

313
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,700
I got kicked out,
I got expelled.

314
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,300
- Why was that?
- I had a run-in with a kid

315
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
one time and I pulled a weapon
on him, I pulled a gun on him.

316
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,300
- What kind of gun?
- Nine-millimetre.

317
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,700
I could've made a mess
out of that situation.

318
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,700
- Could've been worse.
- Could've been a lot worse.

319
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
- Could've been Eric Harris.
- It could've been.

320
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
- So they kicked you out?
- Yeah, they kicked me out

321
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,800
for 380 days or 165 days,
whatever a full school year is.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,700
For the longest time, that's
what my plan was, to move out

323
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,000
- to Colorado.
- Colorado?

324
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
'Cause I've got family
out there.

325
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
Matter of fact,
one of my uncles is a janitor

326
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,300
for Columbine School.

327
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

328
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
After Columbine,
what was it like here in Oscoda?

329
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
My name was second-highest
on the bomb list,

330
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,700
because of the reputation
you get in this town.

331
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,400
Why? You mean
they did a list of--

332
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
- Of suspects.
- Of students who potentially--

333
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
- Yeah.
- ...would call in a bomb threat

334
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
- after Columbine?
- Yes.

335
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,000
And you were number two
on the list?

336
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,900
I was second or third
on the list, yeah.

337
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,700
- Why is that?
- Because the whole fact is,

338
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,400
like I said, this town
really gets people down.

339
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,900
Yeah, but why
did they single you out?

340
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
- Because I was a troubled kid.
- You were in trouble in school?

341
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Oh, yeah.
Why did they put you

342
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,400
number two on their list,
after Columbine,

343
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,700
of the students
that could be a threat?

344
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
- Come on, there must be a reason.
- Well, okay. The thing is,

345
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,100
I have a thing, it's called
the "Anarchist Cookbook."

346
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,000
It shows you how to make bombs
and stuff like that.

347
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
If there's anything
that went wrong,

348
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,800
they're gonna come to me first.

349
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,300
- And I don't need that.
- Just 'cause you owned a copy

350
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,500
- of the book?
- Just because I own a copy--

351
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,500
- Never made a bomb yourself?
- No. Oh, I've made 'em.

352
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,600
It was nothing big; it wasn't
even as big as a pipe bomb.

353
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,200
It was just... some make it
like a little tennis- ball bomb

354
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,700
or something like that.

355
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,800
Out of the "Anarchist Cookbook,"
the latest thing I built...

356
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,700
I think, would have to be...
I think I made it, like,

357
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,500
about a good five-gallon drum
of napalm.

358
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
You know, homemade napalm.

359
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Kids knew that
you were doing this?

360
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
- Yeah.
- So you were number two, then,

361
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,400
- on the list.
- Right.

362
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,500
- Who was number one?
- I don't know.

363
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,200
They never told me that name.
Which kind of made me mad.

364
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,800
'Cause I didn't make it
to number one.

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
I know it's kind of silly,
but I guess

366
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,300
it'd been kind of an ego thing,
knowing that I was number one

367
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,000
at something in Oscoda, even
if it was a bomb-threat list.

368
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you believe it was right

369
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,300
to blow up the building
in Oklahoma City?

370
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,700
- I'm not saying you did it.
- No. No, no, no.

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
- I'm just saying: was it right?
- Why was it "blowed up"?

372
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,600
That's a good question. Why
was that building "blowed up"?

373
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,700
- And who blew it up?
- But if someone did it,

374
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
- it would be wrong.
- Yeah.

375
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
It is wrong to take the lives
of those people.

376
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah.

377
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,700
I use the pen. 'Cause the pen
is mightier than the sword.

378
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,300
But you always must keep a sword
handy, for when the pen fails.

379
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,600
I sleep with a .44 Magnum
under my pillow.

380
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,100
Come on...
That's what everyone says.

381
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
- Is that true?
- It's true.

382
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
- If we were to go--
- The whole world knows that.

383
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
...look under your pillow right
now, would we see a .44 Magnum?

384
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
- Yeah.
- Honestly?

385
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,200
Would you take us and show us?
Right now?

386
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,700
He took me into his bedroom,
but told the cameraman

387
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,500
to stay out. Sure enough,

388
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,800
there was a .44 Magnum
under his pillow.

389
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,000
There it is. Okay.
Is it loaded?

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Aye-yay-yay.

391
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,500
Okay. I believe you.

392
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,900
Don't do that!

393
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,700
- You put the gun to your head.
- I know!

394
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
- Jeez!
- I'm not gonna get hurt!

395
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,900
- This is loaded.
- It's loaded, it's safe.

396
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
You've got to pull the trigger,
pull the hammer and shoot it.

397
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,000
- Mm, put the hammer back.
- No one has a right to tell me

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,600
that I can't have it.
That is protected

399
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
- in our constitution.
- Where's it say a handgun

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,900
- is protected?
- No, gun. We should...

401
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,800
- Every citizen--
- It doesn't say "gun"!

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,700
- It says "arms."
- Arms. What is arms?

403
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,100
- Could be a nuclear weapon.
- It's not these-- That's right,

404
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,500
- it could be a nuclear weapon!
- You think you should have

405
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,000
the right to have weapons-grade
plutonium here on the farm?

406
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,500
We should be able
to have anything--

407
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,100
Should you have
weapons-grade plutonium?

408
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
- I don't want it.
- But should you have the right

409
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,900
- to have it if you did want it?
- That should be restricted.

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,500
Ah! Ah, so you do believe
in some restrictions.

411
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,500
Well, there's wackos out there.

412
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
"Happiness is a warm gun

413
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,700
- "Bang bang shoot shoot"
- The town of Virgin,

414
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,700
Utah, has passed a law requiring
all residents to own guns.

415
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,200
Cary McWilliams
proudly displays the target

416
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,600
he used to pass
his shooting test.

417
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
But the thing is,
he can't see it.

418
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
He's blind.

419
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,800
Cary has had a love affair
with guns

420
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
since he first got his hands
on an M-16 as a teenager.

421
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,300
I'm actually most comfortable
with assault rifles.

422
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,300
Woo-hoo!

423
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,100
This is a great place
to raise your children.

424
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,000
A really great place
to raise your kids.

425
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,800
Very close-knit community
we have here.

426
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,100
Everybody looks out
for everybody.

427
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
- Good people.
- Good people.

428
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,200
This just happens to be
a place where two young men

429
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
made very bad,
very wrong decisions.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,300
And there's been international
notoriety as a result of it.

431
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
Other than that,

432
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,800
I don't know that Littleton
is a lot different

433
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,500
than a whole lot
of other suburban communities.

434
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,900
Economic Development P.R. Video

435
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,900
Good morning, Mr. Edwards,
members of the board.

436
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
I'd like to report that
I've found the perfect location

437
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,700
for our new corporate office,
South Metro Denver.

438
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,600
You can see,

439
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
I don't need these.
Because South Metro Denver

440
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
has about the same amount
of sunshine and precipitation

441
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,500
as Southern California.
It's so incredible,

442
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,200
you're just gonna have
to see it for yourselves.

443
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,500
How's this look, Mr. Edwards?

444
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,500
Denny Fennel
Home Security Consultant

445
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
We're south of Denver,
in a community called Littleton,

446
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,100
and this house is pretty much

447
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,900
your average middle-class
suburban home.

448
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,600
The burglar or the rapist
is still here

449
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
in the neighbourhood somewhere.

450
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,900
And so citizens
sometimes think that...

451
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
I have people tell me
all the time--

452
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,600
Where exactly is the burglar
or rapist right now?

453
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,400
If I was to try and stab you
through this, right here,

454
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
you're gonna have to be
really close. Right?

455
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
And here's the bottom line
on this.

456
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
What if I had a spear?

457
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,200
Now, downstairs is where
the safe-room was constructed,

458
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
and this is a solid-core door,
a very heavy door.

459
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,400
And now, the criminal
has to break through this door,

460
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,100
so you've created
another barrier.

461
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,000
- An axe would do it.
- An axe would do it.

462
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,800
I think that Columbine
did a couple of things.

463
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,100
One is that it changed how
we talk. That's the first thing.

464
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,400
- How's that?
- Well, for instance,

465
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
if I say "Columbine,"
everybody knows what it means.

466
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,100
I don't have to explain to you
that Columbine...

467
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,900
- Is... What's wrong?
- Nothing, I just...

468
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,200
- What's wrong?
- I-- I just...

469
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,000
sometimes Columbine bothers me.
I'll be fine. Just a minute.

470
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,600
- That's okay, that's okay.
- Um...

471
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,900
There...
there's something, um...

472
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,400
something overwhelming about
that kind of... viciousness,

473
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,700
that kind of predatory action,
that kind of indiscriminate, uh,

474
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
killing.

475
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,300
World's Largest Weapons Maker

476
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
This facility,
where we're located right now...

477
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Evan McCollum
Lockheed Martin Public Relations

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and two other major facilities
where our employees work

479
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,400
are either in
or very near Littleton.

480
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
So we have over 5,000 employees
at these facilities,

481
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,100
quite a number of whom
live in Littleton,

482
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,900
many of whom have children who
attend Columbine High School.

483
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,900
I suppose in one way you could
say that what happened

484
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,300
at Columbine High School
is a microcosm, uh...

485
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,500
of what happens
throughout the world.

486
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,100
You know the signs
that we see around here,

487
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,900
the ones that say:
"We Are Columbine,"

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,600
is that how you,
Lockheed Martin, feels,

489
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,500
that you're the biggest employer
here in Littleton,

490
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,600
you're the biggest weapons-
maker? "We Are Columbine."

491
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,400
I think we probably
embody that spirit,

492
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
that, yeah, we're all members
of this community

493
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,300
and that it behoves us to help
one another and to reach out

494
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
to assist one another, yeah.

495
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
He told us that no one
in Littleton,

496
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,500
including the executives

497
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,000
at Lockheed, could figure out
why the boys at Columbine

498
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
had resorted to violence.

499
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Why would kids do this?

500
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,500
Uh, some of the root of that
probably has to do

501
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,500
with their anger
about various issues

502
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,000
and we became aware of a program

503
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
that provides
anger-management training.

504
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
And so we made
a $100,000 contribution

505
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,900
to the Jefferson County schools
to use this training

506
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,100
in the schools. We hope to help
both teachers and students

507
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,600
learn alternative ways
to deal with anger.

508
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,200
So you don't think our kids
say to themselves:

509
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
"Well, gee, Dad goes off

510
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,200
to the factory every day
and, you know,

511
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,100
he built missiles." These
are weapons of mass destruction.

512
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,100
What's the difference
between that mass destruction

513
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,000
and the mass destruction
over at Columbine High School?

514
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
I guess I don't see
that connection,

515
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,800
that specific connection,
because the missiles

516
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,000
that you're talking about were
built and designed to defend us

517
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,300
from somebody else who would be
aggressors against us.

518
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Societies and countries
and governments do things

519
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,500
that annoy one another.

520
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,200
But we have to learn
to deal with that annoyance

521
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,800
or that anger or that
frustration in appropriate ways.

522
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,700
We don't get irritated
with somebody

523
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,600
and just 'cause we're mad
at them, uh,

524
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,500
drop a bomb or shoot at them,
or fire a missile at them.

525
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh my goodness!
Oh my word!

526
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,300
Oh my word!

527
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
South of Denver in Littleton,
on the grounds

528
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,400
of the U.S. Air Force Academy,

529
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
there sits
an actual B-52 bomber.

530
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,000
The plaque underneath it
proudly proclaims

531
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,800
that this plane
killed Vietnamese people

532
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,700
on Christmas eve, 1972.

533
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,400
It was the largest bombing
campaign of the Vietnam War.

534
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,400
Just outside Denver
is Rocky Flats

535
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,400
the largest plutonium-
weapons-making factory

536
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,900
in the world,

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,500
and now a massive
radioactive dump.

538
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
A few miles away,
buried inside a mountain,

539
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,000
is NORAD, which oversees
our nuclear missiles,

540
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,700
many of which dot

541
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,500
the Colorado landscape.

542
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,200
And once a month, Lockheed
transports one of its rockets,

543
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,700
with its Pentagon payload,

544
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,300
through the streets
of Littleton,

545
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,700
passing nearby
Columbine High School

546
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
on its way to an air-force base

547
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,000
on the other side of Denver.

548
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,800
The rockets are transported
in the middle of the night,

549
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,400
while the children of Columbine
are asleep.

550
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Largest one day bombing by U.S.
in Kosovo war

551
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Twenty-two NATO missiles

552
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
fell on the village
of Bogutovac near Kraljevo.

553
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Deadly cargo was dropped
upon the residential part

554
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,500
of the village.

555
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,700
We're striking hard at Serbia's
machinery of repression,

556
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,500
while making
a deliberate effort

557
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
to minimize harm
to innocent people.

558
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,500
On the hit list were a local
hospital and primary school.

559
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,500
We all know there has been
a terrible shooting

560
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,700
at a high school
in Littleton, Colorado.

561
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,300
I hope the American people will
be praying for the students,

562
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,200
the parents and the teachers.

563
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,700
And we'll wait
for events to unfold

564
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,200
and then there'll be
more to say.

565
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Jefferson County, 911.

566
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
There's some boy at Columbine
High School, someone killed...

567
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
Do you know
if anybody's injured?

568
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
- Yes.
- They've got pipe bombs,

569
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,300
pipe bombs...

570
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,000
- You're shitting me.
- I'm not.

571
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,100
Student hit in the spine
at Columbine.

572
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,900
- Okay.
- We've got...

573
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,000
- He's shot in the head.
- He's shot in the head?

574
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,300
- Deputy cashier's office.
- We have automatic weapons,

575
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,900
- okay?
- Yes.

576
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,000
All right. Can you get us lots
and lots of paramedics?

577
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
- So he's still under an attack?
- Yes, sir, the school is.

578
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,000
We got a couple of kids
out in the hall that are shot,

579
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
so they're trying to get to
them. Do not let anybody else in

580
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,900
- until we tell them.
- Jefferson County 911.

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,600
Hi, it's Izzy Povich
at NBC News.

582
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
We're calling about
the school shooting.

583
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,300
We're on the air live
right now on MSNBC.

584
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,900
Can you-- Is that something
you could just, literally,

585
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,200
patch through to my desk,

586
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,800
or you could tell us on the air?
I could put you through

587
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,300
- right now--
- I understand that...

588
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,400
Now they said he's gone
to the library;

589
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,900
he stayed in the building.

590
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,100
He's gone into the library
and he's in the building.

591
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,300
Hi, this is Stephanie Gold
from Dateline. How you doing?

592
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,900
- Good, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

593
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,600
- I love your show.
- Oh, I'm so glad. Thank you.

594
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,200
- I watch it every night.
- Thank you.

595
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
- Jefferson County 911.
- Yes, I'm a teacher

596
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,400
at Columbine High School. There
is a shooter here with a gun.

597
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,300
- He just shot out a window.
- Has anybody been injured?

598
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,700
Yes! And the school
is in a panic

599
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,200
and I'm in the library.
I've got students down.

600
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,100
Under the tables, kids!

601
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,600
Heads under the tables!
I saw a student outside!

602
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,900
Okay,

603
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,800
I was on hall duty, I saw a gun!
"What's going on out there?!"

604
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
He turned the gun straight at us
and he shot, and my God,

605
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
the window went out.

606
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,900
The kid standing there with me,
I think he got hit.

607
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,400
We've got help on the way,
ma'am.

608
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,200
- Oh God!
- Stay on line with me.

609
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,900
Oh God!

610
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,400
I think he's shooting
in the library right now.

611
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,200
He's firing shots
from the library.

612
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
- Firing shots in the library.
- ...our way.

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,900
Do we need to leave?
Okay, hold on.

614
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,000
...inside the cafeteria

615
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm gonna have to try and get
outta here and call you back.

616
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,400
I called in before,
trying to find out

617
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,200
where I'm supposed to go
and they put me on hold

618
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,900
- for freaking ever!
- Hi, it's Wendy at CNN still.

619
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,000
Hi. We're just taking names
and numbers for the press.

620
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,700
Fox has somebody from
your office on now--

621
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,200
We've talked to
a bunch of people

622
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,900
and we can only do so many,

623
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,900
we got so many more calls
coming in.

624
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
I gotta get to my daughter
at Columbine.

625
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,800
I've been trying for an hour, I
can't get anywhere near there...

626
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Sir, okay, calm down, okay?

627
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,000
I think we're entitled
to information as parents

628
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,700
- on where our children are!
- We have a lot of units

629
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,300
- out there right now.
- I can't get anywhere near it.

630
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,300
I wanna find out

631
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,900
how to get in touch
with my daughter.

632
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,900
How do I get information
on my daughter?

633
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,900
I don't have that information
right now--

634
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,100
Why in the hell not?
It's been over an hour!

635
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,600
My son is Eric Harris,

636
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
and I'm afraid
that he might be involved

637
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,700
with the shooting
at Columbine High School.

638
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,700
Involved how?

639
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
He's a member of what they're
calling the "trench-coat mafia."

640
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,200
- Have you spoken to your son?
- No, I haven't.

641
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,500
- Have they picked up anybody yet?
- They're still looking

642
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,100
for suspects. Your son
is with who? What gang?

643
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,500
They call them the "trench-coat
mafia". I just heard that term

644
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
- on TV.
- Stay low, because if you try

645
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
to leave, I don't want you
to get shot.

646
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,200
Stay very low and quiet.

647
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,100
Low and quiet...

648
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Everybody just stay quiet.

649
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,400
When the shooting was over,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold

650
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,500
had killed 12 students
and one teacher.

651
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,800
Dozens of others were wounded
by the over-900 rounds of ammo

652
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that were fired. It is believed
that the guns that they used

653
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,600
were all legally purchased
at stores and gun shows.

654
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
And many of the bullets
were bought

655
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,200
at the Littleton K-Mart
just down the street.

656
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Harris's diary also detailed
ideas about hijacking

657
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,600
an airplane and crashing it
into New York City.

658
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Some may characterize that
as fantasy...

659
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,700
In the end, they turned
the guns on themselves.

660
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,000
And then he came
into the library,

661
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,700
shot everybody around me,
then put a gun to my head

662
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
and asked if we all wanted
to die and...

663
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,900
We started hearing shots
in the hall

664
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
and then they came in
and they all told us

665
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,100
to get under the desk
and we all got under the desk

666
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,200
and then they started coming in
the library and opening fire...

667
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,900
I just started screaming
and crying and telling them

668
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
not to shoot me.
And so he shot the girl,

669
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
he shot her in the head
in front of me.

670
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,700
Then he shot the black kid,
because he was black.

671
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,600
I have only five words for you:

672
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,300
From my cold, dead hands.

673
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,000
Just 10 days after
the Columbine killings,

674
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,500
despite the pleas

675
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,100
of a community in mourning,

676
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,400
Charlton Heston came to Denver
and held a large pro-gun rally

677
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
for the National
Rifle Association.

678
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

679
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,500
Thank you all

680
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,700
for coming and thank you for
supporting your organization.

681
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,900
I also want to applaud your
courage in coming here today.

682
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,400
I have a message
from the mayor,

683
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,300
Mr. Wellington Webb,
the mayor of Denver.

684
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,600
No, no, no, no, no.

685
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,900
He sent me this,

686
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,900
and it says: "Don't come here.
We don't want you here."

687
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,100
I said to the mayor,
"This is our country.

688
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,800
As Americans we're free
to travel wherever we want

689
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
in our broad land."

690
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,800
Don't come here?
We're already here.

691
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,500
I am here today...

692
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,200
because my son Daniel
would want me to be here today.

693
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,600
If my son Daniel
was not one of the victims,

694
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,600
he would be here with me today.

695
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,100
Something is wrong
in this country...

696
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,700
when a child...

697
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,400
can grab a gun...
grab a gun so easily...

698
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
and shoot a bullet...

699
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
into the middle of a child's
face, as my son experienced.

700
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,100
Something is wrong.

701
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,800
But the time has come
to come to understand

702
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,500
that a Tech-9 semi-automatic
30-bullet weapon

703
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,100
like that that killed my son,

704
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,600
is not used to kill deer.

705
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,300
It has no useful purpose.

706
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,700
It is time to address
this problem.

707
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,000
We have work to do,
hearts to heal,

708
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,900
evil to defeat
and a country to unite.

709
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
We may have differences, yes,

710
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,100
and we will again suffer tragedy
almost beyond description.

711
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,900
But when the sun sets
on Denver tonight,

712
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,000
and forever more, let it
always set on we the people,

713
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,000
secure in our land of the free
and home of the brave.

714
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,600
I, for one, plan to do my part.

715
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,200
Thank you.

716
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Or like when they had
their convention in Colorado,

717
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,000
a week, whatever,
the month after Columbine,

718
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,500
that was just stupid.
Just don't do that.

719
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
Of course you have "the right
to," but what are you doing?

720
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,100
Upsetting a whole city full of
people, why would you do that?

721
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,500
This is Matt Stone.
He grew up in Littleton

722
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,700
and has fond memories
of Columbine.

723
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,200
Yeah, Columbine,
it's just a crappy school

724
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,500
in the middle of a bunch
of crappy houses.

725
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,600
Matt and his friend
Trey Parker

726
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,300
found a way to take out

727
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,400
their anger of being different
in Littleton

728
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,400
and turn it not into carnage,
but into a cartoon.

729
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,800
"Just another Sunday morning
In my quiet...

730
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
"Mountain town"

731
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,500
"You can see your breath
Hanging in the air

732
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,400
"You see homeless people
But you just don't care

733
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,300
"It's a sea of smiles
In which we'd be glad to drown

734
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,900
"It's Sunday morning
In our quiet little

735
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
"White-bread redneck
mountain town"

736
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,100
Columbine is a normal
high school--

737
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
- Yeah.
- ...in a normal suburb--

738
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
- Yeah.
- ...you know, basically.

739
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
Yeah. Painfully, painfully,
painfully normal.

740
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Just absolutely, painfully,
horribly average.

741
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,400
Littleton in general is...

742
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,900
I remember being in sixth grade
and I...

743
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,400
had to take the math test
to get into Honors Math

744
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,400
in the seventh grade.
And they're, like,

745
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,700
"Don't screw this up.
Because if you screw this up,

746
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,900
you won't get into Honors Math
in seventh grade.

747
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,000
And if you don't get in
in seventh grade,

748
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,500
you won't in eighth grade,
then not in ninth grade.

749
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
And 10th and 11th grade
and you'll just die poor

750
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,400
and lonely."
And that's it, you know?

751
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,500
You believe, in high school -
and a lot of it is kids,

752
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,800
but the teachers and counsellors
and principals

753
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,400
don't help things.
They scare you into conforming

754
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,400
and doing good in school by
saying: "If you're a loser now,

755
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,300
you're gonna be a loser
forever."

756
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,600
So that with Eric and Dylan,
people called them "fag."

757
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,100
They're like, "You know what?

758
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,300
If I'm a fag,
now I'm a fag forever."

759
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,900
And you wish someone just
could've grabbed them and gone,

760
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,300
"Dude, high school's
not the end of...

761
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,100
A year, a year and a half,
was it? I don't even know.

762
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,900
- You just move out--
- No, no, they were two weeks

763
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,100
- away from graduation.
- Yeah, you're done.

764
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,600
It's amazing how fast you lose
touch with all those people.

765
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,600
They just beat it in your head
as early as sixth grade:

766
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,400
"Don't fuck up.
'Cause if you do,

767
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,100
you're gonna die poor
and lonely.

768
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
You don't want to do that."
You're, like, "Fuck,

769
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,600
whatever I am now,
I'm that forever." Of course,

770
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,900
it's completely opposite.
All the dorks in high school

771
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,700
go on to do great things
and all the really cool guys

772
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,600
are all living back in
Littleton as insurance agents.

773
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,500
Almost person to person,
it's completely that way.

774
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,800
If somebody
could've told them that,

775
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
maybe they would've
have done it, but...

776
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,300
I guess we'll never know
why they did it,

777
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
but one thing adults
should never forget:

778
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,000
It still sucks
being a teenager.

779
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,000
And it really sucks
going to school.

780
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,000
What's your view
on high school?

781
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,800
Uh, I love it.

782
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,400
Uh, I learn, I get picked on
by bastards who hate me,

783
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,000
and the principal's a dick.

784
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
All right.
What causes school violence?

785
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Uh... him.

786
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,800
- Him?
- Yeah.

787
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,800
Yes, and after Columbine,
it really sucked

788
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,500
being a student in America.

789
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,700
Since last spring's shooting,

790
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,900
at Columbine High,
schools nationwide

791
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,200
have extended
zero-tolerance policies,

792
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,000
suspending and expelling
students for all kinds

793
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,800
of behaviour considered unruly,

794
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,500
or warning signs
of violence to come.

795
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,400
This second-grader in Illinois
was suspended for 10 days

796
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,200
for bringing a nail clipper
to class

797
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,100
"That's a weapon,"
his school said.

798
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,300
An elementary school
suspended a first-grader

799
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,700
for pointing a chicken strip
at a teacher in the cafeteria.

800
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,500
The eight-year-old
was fooling around with a friend

801
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,500
at lunch last week when he
pointed a breaded-chicken finger

802
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
at a teacher and then said:
"Pow pow.

803
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,100
He pointed a folded piece
of paper shaped like a gun,

804
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,500
and told his classmates
he was going to kill them

805
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,800
during a game
of cops and robbers.

806
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,400
If this isn't a warning sign,
then what is it?

807
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,000
This Virginia high-school
student spent a month

808
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,600
out of classes,
originally sent home

809
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,500
- for dying his hair blue.
- A high-school honour student

810
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,800
from Michigan could be expelled
later today

811
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,400
in a school-board hearing.

812
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,500
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Hicks
wore a Scottish

813
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,900
bagpiper's outfit to his junior
prom that included

814
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,300
a plaid kilt, a feathered hat
and a traditional knife

815
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,100
known as a "skein dhu."

816
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,800
This T-shirt

817
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,800
landed a high-school student
in court.

818
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,700
She wanted to start
an anarchy club.

819
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,900
The little time-bombs
that are out there ticking,

820
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,900
waiting to go off. And there are
many of them in every community.

821
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,500
Students in at least seven
different states

822
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,200
have been suspended or arrested

823
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,500
for talking about or planning
plots of their own.

824
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,600
It's almost
like guerrilla warfare.

825
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,500
You don't know
from which direction

826
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,600
the enemy will be coming.

827
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,300
Having a well-conceived
and strictly enforced dress code

828
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,300
can dramatically improve
the safety of a school,

829
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,100
and can ensure a positive
learning environment

830
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,600
for everyone.

831
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,400
As this student's appearance
demonstrates,

832
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,200
having a lax policy about dress
makes it easy

833
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,100
for a student
to conceal a weapon

834
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,100
and makes it difficult
to identify intruders on campus.

835
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,900
A dress code can reduce
weapons violations,

836
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,500
relieve tensions between gangs,
reduce disciplinary infractions

837
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,700
and generally improve
the atmosphere of the school.

838
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,900
Our policy requires that
students tuck in their shirts,

839
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,500
making the beltline visible
at all times.

840
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Our students may not wear
baggy pants

841
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,200
or colours or insignias
that are commonly associated

842
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,100
with gang activity.

843
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,000
This policy
was a collaborative effort.

844
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,700
Yes, our children were indeed
something to fear.

845
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,100
They had turned
into little monsters.

846
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
But who was to blame?

847
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,900
All the experts had an answer.

848
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,600
Angry, heavy-metal subculture.

849
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,000
- Where were the parents?
- Violent movies.

850
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,900
- "South Park."
- Video games.

851
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,800
- Television.
- Entertainment.

852
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
- Satan.
- Cartoons.

853
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,900
- Films.
- Society.

854
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
- Toy guns.
- Drugs.

855
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,300
Shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.

856
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,300
Marilyn Manson.

857
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,100
Marilyn Manson has cancelled
the last five dates

858
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,600
of his U.S, tour out of respect
for those lost in Littleton.

859
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
But the singer
says artists like himself

860
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,200
are not the ones to blame.

861
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,000
This is perhaps
the sickest group ever promoted

862
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,800
by a mainstream record company.

863
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,100
"I'm not a slave

864
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,700
"to a god

865
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,500
"that doesn't exist"

866
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,500
After Columbine, it seemed

867
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,000
that the entire focus
on why the shootings occurred

868
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,400
was because the killers

869
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,700
listened to Marilyn Manson.

870
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Two years after Columbine,

871
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,100
Manson finally returned
to Denver.

872
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,100
The Oz Fest
at Mile High Stadium

873
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,400
brings shock-rocker Marilyn
Manson to Denver tomorrow.

874
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,400
There were protests
from the religious right.

875
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,100
But I thought I'd go
and talk with him myself.

876
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,600
When I was a kid growing up,
music was the escape.

877
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,600
That's the only thing

878
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,600
that had no judgements.
You can put on a record

879
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,100
and it's not gonna yell at you
for dressing the way you do.

880
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,900
It's gonna make you
feel better about it.

881
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,700
Some will be so brash
to ask if we believe

882
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
that all who hear Manson
tomorrow night

883
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,400
will go out
and commit violent acts.

884
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,500
The answer is "no."
But does everybody

885
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,700
who watches a Lexus ad
go and buy a Lexus?

886
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,000
No. But a few do.

887
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,400
I definitely can see
why they would pick me,

888
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,400
because I think it's easy
to throw my face on a TV,

889
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,600
because I'm, in the end,
sort of a poster boy for fear.

890
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,100
Because I represent
what everyone's afraid of,

891
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,500
because I do and say
what I want.

892
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,700
If Marilyn Manson can walk
into our town and promote hate,

893
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,600
violence, suicide,
death, drug use

894
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,700
and Columbine-like behaviour,

895
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,000
I can say, "Not without
a fight, you can't."

896
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,600
The two by-products of
that whole tragedy were, uh...

897
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,600
violence in entertainment
and gun control.

898
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,500
And how perfect that
that was the two things

899
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,700
that we were gonna talk about
with the upcoming election.

900
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,300
And also, then we forgot
about Monica Lewinsky

901
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,300
and we forgot about...

902
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,700
The president was shooting
bombs overseas,

903
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,600
yet I'm a bad guy because I sing
some rock'n'roll songs.

904
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,700
And who's a bigger influence,
the president or Marilyn Manson?

905
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,500
I'd like to think me, but I'm
gonna go with the president.

906
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,700
Do you know the day
that Columbine happened,

907
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,200
the United States dropped
more bombs on Kosovo

908
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,200
than any other time
during that war?

909
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,700
I do know that and I think
that's really ironic,

910
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,700
that nobody said, "Well, maybe
the president had an influence

911
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,800
on this violent behaviour.

912
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,200
Because that's not the way
the media wants to take it

913
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,300
and spin it
and turn it into fear.

914
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,300
'Cause then you're
watching television,

915
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,200
you're watching the news; you're
being pumped full of fear.

916
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,000
And there's floods,
there's AIDS, there's murder.

917
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,100
You cut to commercial,
buy the Acura, buy the Colgate.

918
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,100
If you have bad breath,
they're not gonna talk to you.

919
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,000
If you got pimples,
the girl's not gonna fuck you.

920
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,600
It's a campaign of fear
and consumption.

921
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
And that's what I think
that's it's all based on,

922
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,100
is the whole idea that:
keep everyone afraid,

923
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,100
and they'll consume.
And that's really as simple

924
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,500
- as it can be boiled down to.
- Right.

925
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,800
If you were to talk directly
to the kids at Columbine

926
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,700
and the people
in that community,

927
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,200
what would you say to them,
if they here right now?

928
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,300
I wouldn't say
a single word to them.

929
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,200
I would listen to what
they have to say.

930
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,100
And that's what no one did.

931
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,800
- I'm Nicole Shleif.
- And I'm Amanda Lamontagne.

932
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
- And you went to Columbine?
- Yes.

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,200
And you were with
Eric and Dylan?

934
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
- In their class?
- Yeah,

935
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,800
- we were in their bowling class.
- In their bowling class?

936
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,900
- Yes.
- What's bowling class?

937
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,000
Just an elective you can
take for a gym credit.

938
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,300
Where's the educational value
of this, though?

939
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,700
Um... I guess
there isn't really any.

940
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,800
No, there's not.

941
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,100
I learned how to bowl a lot
better, that's for sure.

942
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,300
What were Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold like?

943
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,400
- Weird.
- Yeah?

944
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,200
I mean, not very social.

945
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,300
I didn't really know
who they were.

946
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
Not very social, just
kinda kept to themselves.

947
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,400
How good a bowlers
were Eric and Dylan?

948
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,900
When we played them,

949
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,400
all I remember is they
were just, like, crazy.

950
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,100
- They would just chuck the ball.
- Chuck it down there.

951
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,800
Throw the ball down; didn't
really care how they bowled.

952
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,100
Yeah, they didn't really
care about their scores.

953
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,200
Deputy Sheriff Steve Davis - What were
the suspects doing the morning of attack?

954
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,900
I told you that I'd heard
that they were bowling;

955
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,800
that's the only thing
I'm aware of.

956
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,800
So did Dylan and Eric
show up that morning

957
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,000
and bowl two games
before moving on

958
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,000
to shoot up the school?

959
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,500
And did they just chuck
the balls down the lane?

960
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,600
Did this mean something?

961
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,700
Um, I guess they went
to their favourite class.

962
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,200
Why wasn't anyone
blaming bowling

963
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,600
for warping the minds
of Eric and Dylan

964
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,500
to commit their evil deeds?

965
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,900
Wasn't that just as plausible
as blaming Marilyn Manson?

966
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,900
After all,

967
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,000
it was apparently
the last thing they did

968
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,700
before the massacre.

969
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,600
But wait a minute. There's
lots of bowling going on

970
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,300
in other countries.

971
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,900
And don't they listen
to Marilyn Manson in Germany,

972
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,000
the home of sinister
Goth music?

973
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,300
Some Gothic festival.

974
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,800
Don't they watch the same
violent movies in France?

975
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,500
Most of the violent video
games are from Japan.

976
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,500
Many people in America believe

977
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,900
that it's the break-up
of the family unit

978
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,300
that's caused so many wayward
youth to turn to violence.

979
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,400
I'll save you the trouble.
I'll run away and kill myself!

980
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,900
How would you like that?
You can't keep me here!

981
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,500
But statistics show

982
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
that there are more
broken homes and divorce

983
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,700
in Great Britain
than in the U.S.

984
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,500
It's official:
Fergie's marriage has ended.

985
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,200
Liberals contend that it's all
the poverty we have in America

986
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,200
that causes all this violence.

987
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
But the unemployment rate
in Canada

988
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,400
is twice what it is here.
Of course, most people say

989
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,300
it's because we Americans
have a violent history,

990
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,700
a violent past.
Cowboys and Indians,

991
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,900
the Wild West,

992
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,900
a history of conquering
and bloodshed.

993
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,900
Well, if that's all
it takes to end up

994
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,300
with such a violent society

995
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,400
like we have in America,
how do you explain this?

996
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yet in spite of all this,

997
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,400
how many people are killed
by guns each year?

998
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,700
In Germany:

999
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,000
In France:

1000
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,300
In Canada:

1001
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
In the United Kingdom:

1002
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,100
In Australia:

1003
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,800
In Japan:

1004
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,600
In the United States:

1005
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,900
But that, to me, brings up
an important question:

1006
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,600
Then what is so different
about Americans?

1007
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,800
Tom Mauser
Father of Columbine victim

1008
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,200
Are we homicidal in nature?

1009
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,500
Because in Europe and Australia,

1010
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,100
most other free-world countries,
they don't have this.

1011
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,100
They don't have people who snap
and go on murderous rampages.

1012
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,200
Well, no, they're just like us.
They have the occasional person

1013
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,600
that snaps and kills
a lot of people.

1014
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,600
How about a British soccer riot?
Those aren't Quakers there,

1015
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,700
Every time that
I bring up comparisons

1016
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,800
with other free-world countries,
what I hear is:

1017
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,800
"Oh, our culture is so
different. We're so different."

1018
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And as you said, they have
violent video games,

1019
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,000
they have violent movies,
they have alienated youth,

1020
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,100
they - like us - don't have
prayer in schools.

1021
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,500
What is so radically different?
What is it about us?

1022
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,600
- What is it?
- What is it?

1023
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,600
- What is it?
- What is it?

1024
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,400
I don't know.

1025
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,600
Now, it's time for...

1026
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,900
Hi, boys and girls.
Ready to get started?

1027
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,000
Once upon a time, there were
these people in Europe

1028
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,200
called pilgrims and they were
afraid of being persecuted.

1029
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,400
So they all got in a boat
and sailed to the New World

1030
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,400
where they wouldn't have
to be scared ever again.

1031
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,400
- Oh, I'm so relaxed.
- I feel so much safer.

1032
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,600
But as soon as they arrived,
they were greeted by savages.

1033
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,700
- They got scared all over again.
- Injuns!

1034
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,700
So they killed them all.
Now, you'd think

1035
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,400
wiping out a race of people
would calm them down, but no.

1036
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,800
Instead, they started getting
frightened of each other.

1037
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,100
- Witch!
- So they burned witches.

1038
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,600
In 1775,

1039
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,500
they started killing the
British, so they could be free.

1040
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,400
And it worked.
But they still didn't feel safe.

1041
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,600
So they passed a 2nd amendment,
which said every white man

1042
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,200
- could keep his gun.
- I loves my gun, loves my gun.

1043
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,800
This brings us to
the genius idea of slavery.

1044
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,900
You see, boys and girls,
the white people back then

1045
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,300
were also afraid of doing any
work. So they went to Africa,

1046
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,700
kidnapped thousands of black
people, brought them to America,

1047
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,900
and forced them to work
very hard for no money.

1048
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,900
And I don't mean no money like:

1049
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,800
"I work at Wal-Mart
and make no money."

1050
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,200
I mean zero dollars.
Nothing, nada, zip.

1051
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,200
Doing it that way made the USA

1052
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,100
the richest country
in the world.

1053
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,100
So did having all that money
and free help

1054
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,100
calm the white people down? No
way. They got even more afraid.

1055
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,500
That's because after
200 years of slavery,

1056
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,000
the black people now outnumbered
the white people in many parts

1057
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,400
of the South. Well, you can
pretty much what came next.

1058
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,500
The slaves started rebelling.
There were uprisings

1059
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,300
and old masters' heads
got chopped off

1060
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,700
and when white people heard of
this, they were freaking out.

1061
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,700
They going: I want to live!

1062
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,700
Don't kill me, big black man.

1063
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,700
Well, just in the nick of time
came Samuel Colt, who,

1064
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,700
in 1836, invented the first
weapon ever that could be fired

1065
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,500
over and over without
having to reload.

1066
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,300
And all the settlers were like:
Yee-hah!

1067
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,500
But it was too late.
The North soon won the Civil War

1068
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,200
and the slaves were free to go
chop the old masters' heads off.

1069
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,500
Then everybody was like:
Oh, no, we're gonna die.

1070
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,100
But the freed slaves
took no revenge.

1071
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,600
They just wanted
to live in peace.

1072
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,400
But you couldn't convince
the white people of this.

1073
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,500
So they formed the Ku Klux Klan
and, in 1871,

1074
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,600
the same year the Klan became an
illegal terrorist organization,

1075
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,400
another group was founded:
the National Rifle Association.

1076
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,500
Soon, politicians passed
one of the first gun laws,

1077
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,900
making it illegal for any black
person to own one.

1078
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,600
It was a great year for America.
he KKK and the NRA.

1079
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,200
Of course, they had nothing
to do with each other;

1080
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,900
it was a coincidence. One group
legally promoted responsible

1081
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,600
gun ownership; the other shot
and lynched black people.

1082
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,300
That's the way it was till
1955, when a black woman

1083
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,400
broke the law by refusing to
move to the back of the bus.

1084
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,700
White people just couldn't
believe it.

1085
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,100
- Huh? Why won't she move?
- What's going on?

1086
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,600
Man, all hell broke loose.
Black people everywhere demanded

1087
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,000
their rights. White people had
a major, freaky-feel meltdown

1088
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,700
and they were all like:
Run away! Run away!

1089
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,900
And they did. They all ran
fleeing to the suburbs,

1090
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,500
where it was all white and safe
and clean. And they went out

1091
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,500
and bought a
quarter-of-a-billion guns.

1092
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,500
And put locks on their doors,
alarms in their houses,

1093
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,900
and gates around the
neighbourhoods.

1094
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,800
And finally, they were all safe
and secure and snug as a bug.

1095
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,900
And everyone lived
happily ever after.

1096
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,000
Because if you turn on
the evening news,

1097
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,100
America still seems
like a pretty scary place.

1098
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,100
Who is he? Is he dangerous?
What's he up to?

1099
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,600
What are you trying
to pull, man?

1100
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,200
Remember all the Y2Kscares?

1101
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,600
Weren't we told that our very
society was about to collapse

1102
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,300
because somebody forgot

1103
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,300
to type in a couple of digits
on the computer?

1104
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,800
There's gonna be mass
chaos and confusion.

1105
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,300
Tonight, the countdown begins.

1106
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,400
All day, store director
Rick Smith

1107
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,600
- watched consumers get Y2K ready.
- Batteries sell extremely well.

1108
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,500
The lamp oil, generators.

1109
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,800
After sending the country
into a panic,

1110
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,100
the clock struck midnight...

1111
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,900
And nothing happened.

1112
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,100
Or how about those killer bees

1113
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
that were going
to attack America?

1114
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,900
We're almost certain
they'll arrive this year.

1115
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,600
Schmidt expects the Africanized
bees to reach Texas this year,

1116
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,100
cross into Arizona in about
two to three years.

1117
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,600
He's concerned because the
killer bee is overly aggressive.

1118
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,200
They will follow you
for half a mile.

1119
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,800
The bees never came.

1120
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,300
Remember the first time
you heard

1121
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,200
that someone had hidden a razor
blade in an apple at Halloween?

1122
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,900
Before long,

1123
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,400
kids were not permitted to go
out in the dark on Halloween

1124
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,900
and go trick-or-treating
at strangers' homes.

1125
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,100
Many people say they won't give
out candy treats on Halloween.

1126
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,900
It's too dangerous
and they're too scared.

1127
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,500
Well, guess what?

1128
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,400
There never was any
razor blade in the apple.

1129
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,700
In fact, only two kids

1130
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,800
in the past 40 years have been
killed by Halloween candy.

1131
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,800
And both of them were poisoned
on purpose by relatives.

1132
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,500
Bye.

1133
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,500
It was like
a scene from a horror movie.

1134
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,500
This man was mowing his lawn
when a fox darted out

1135
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,000
of the woods and attacked
his riding-mower.

1136
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,500
A warning about a popular
weight-loss supplement.

1137
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,600
What you don't know
may kill you.

1138
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,800
You ride them every day,
but in an instant,

1139
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
an escalator can mangle you
or a loved one.

1140
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,700
We reveal why you may be
riding on stairway to danger.

1141
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,600
You might want to take
some extra precautions:

1142
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,400
keep a low profile,
don't go around dancing

1143
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,100
with a bunch of Americans
in the streets.

1144
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,000
Make sure that you don't draw
a lot of attention to yourself

1145
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,400
and the fact
that you're American.

1146
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,100
Nation's top doctor says
one in five Americans

1147
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,100
suffers some form
of mental disorder.

1148
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,700
The surgeon general David
Satcher pleads with people

1149
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,600
to seek help now.

1150
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,200
The media, the corporations,
the politicians,

1151
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,500
have all done such a good job
of scaring the American public,

1152
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,400
it's come to the point
where they don't need to give

1153
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,500
any reason at all.

1154
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,400
Today, the Justice Department
did issue a...

1155
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,900
a blanket alert.

1156
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,600
It was in recognition of a
general threat we received.

1157
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,800
Uh, this is not the first time

1158
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,300
the Justice Department
have acted like this.

1159
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,800
I hope it's the last.

1160
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,900
But given the attitude of
the evildoers, it may not be.

1161
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,400
I just love these boulevards
down here, though.

1162
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,000
You don't get this
in most of L.A.

1163
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,500
South Central
Los Angeles

1164
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,600
How come whenever
I'm out here, though,

1165
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,900
I turn on the 11-o'clock news
and I hear, you know:

1166
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,400
"Tonight in South Central,
drive-by shooting."

1167
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,300
Or: "Tonight in South
Central..."

1168
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,000
Prof. Barry Glassner
Author, "The Culture of Fear"

1169
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,300
...this, that or whatever. I mean,
they're not making that up, are they?

1170
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,200
No, they're not making it up,
but they're choosing

1171
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,700
what they're covering. If you
turn on the TV, on the news,

1172
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,100
what are you gonna hear about?

1173
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,200
Dangerous black guys, right?
Unnamed black guy who, you know,

1174
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,600
- accused of some crime or...
- Right.

1175
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,500
You're gonna see pictures
of black guys doing bad things,

1176
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,000
and hearing stories about black
guys doing bad things.

1177
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,900
And we've heard this
our whole lives.

1178
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,200
Now, the suspect is a black
male in his twenties.

1179
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
We are told he has
a large afro, sideburns,

1180
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,800
he was wearing a
silver chain at the time.

1181
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,100
Police say the suspect
is a black man.

1182
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,600
Six foot one, 160 to 180 pounds,
about 35 years in age.

1183
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,400
Suspect is a black male,
age 16 to 18.

1184
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,100
The suspect is
African-American.

1185
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,800
- Police believe--
- Police say--

1186
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,200
- The black man--
- Suspect--

1187
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
- The suspect is a black male
- A black man.

1188
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,000
A black... black... black...

1189
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,300
A black man.

1190
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,800
Susan Smith drowns
her two children.

1191
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,500
- She tells people a black guy...
- Correct.

1192
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,500
Stole the car
and stole the kids.

1193
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,500
And everyone, at first,
bought it.

1194
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Some guy jumped into her car,
with her two kids in it.

1195
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
Then he took off.
That's a black guy, she says.

1196
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,300
- Black male?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1197
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,200
And I told them I loved them.
I hollered I loved them

1198
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,500
And it's just a tragedy.

1199
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,600
The anonymous urban -
which means usually black -

1200
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,600
male, comes by and does this.

1201
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,800
It's the excuse
for all kinds of things.

1202
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,500
Charles Stewart,
a lawyer in Boston...

1203
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,600
- Right, exactly.
- ...kills his pregnant wife,

1204
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,100
says a black guy did it;
everybody buys it.

1205
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,200
The suspect described as a
black male about six feet tall.

1206
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,500
Chuck and Carol Stewart
were robbed at gunpoint

1207
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,600
as they left a Lamaze class.

1208
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,700
It seemed the ultimate
urban nightmare.

1209
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,200
You know, the thing I love
about this country of mine,

1210
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,700
is that whether you're
a psychotic killer

1211
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,400
or running for president
of the United States,

1212
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,300
the one thing you can
always count on

1213
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,200
is white America's fear
of the black man.

1214
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,400
We've heard the stories
on the news and in the papers

1215
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,300
and they have killed people.

1216
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,200
Killer bees, also known

1217
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,600
as "Africanized" bees.

1218
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,100
I'm scared. I'm really worried.

1219
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,600
Rose Shipley never expected a
nest of Africanized killer bees

1220
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
to shack up across the street
from her.

1221
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,900
But I'm terribly allergic
to them and so are my grandkids.

1222
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,700
They're originally from
southern and eastern Africa.

1223
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,500
Dr. Warrick Care brought some
to Brazil in 1956

1224
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
and tried to mate them

1225
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,500
with the European bee,
the kind that we're used to.

1226
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,100
But they got loose and moved
to the southern United States.

1227
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,700
The main difference between
a traditional honey bee

1228
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,900
and an Africanized bee is
the bee's aggressiveness.

1229
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,200
If I was to do this
to an Africanized bee's hive,

1230
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,500
I could have several hundred
stings in a matter of minutes.

1231
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,900
Danny Self raises the kinder,
gentler European bees,

1232
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,600
and he's done the research.

1233
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,400
The only way that you can tell

1234
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,300
the two of them, is doing
measurements on the body parts.

1235
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,100
Quite frankly,
the black community has become

1236
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,600
entertainment for the rest
of the community.

1237
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,100
Meaning what?

1238
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,500
The entertainment being
that the crime of the day -

1239
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,500
you know, "If it bleeds,
it leads" -

1240
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,500
gets to be the front story and
then that becomes the perception

1241
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,000
and the image of
an entire people.

1242
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,400
Which couldn't be further
from the truth, in my opinion.

1243
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,300
In fact, you'll find, I think,

1244
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,600
most African-Americans are quite
adverse to gun possession.

1245
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,400
In suburbia, I think,

1246
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,400
there's some notion that there's
going to be an invading horde,

1247
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,600
come from either the city
or from someplace unknown,

1248
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,000
to savage their suburban
community.

1249
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,900
To me, not only is it bizarre,
but it's totally, uh...

1250
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,600
unfounded.

1251
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,400
And these pistols,
curiously enough,

1252
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,800
weren't being taken off kids
in the city of Flint,

1253
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,800
but were being taken off of kids
out in the out-county area,

1254
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,600
in the suburban communities.
And--

1255
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,700
I didn't think that's
what you were gonna say.

1256
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,800
I thought you were gonna say
that it's all these black kids

1257
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,700
in the inner-city schools
that had these guns.

1258
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,300
No, that's...

1259
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,300
We've never really had many
problems with guns in the city.

1260
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,700
Not to say that we haven't;
we've had some.

1261
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,800
But that's never been
the biggest problem.

1262
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,300
The biggest problem has been
the gun possession

1263
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:45,000
by these adolescents
in suburbia.

1264
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,400
How'd you get a gun?

1265
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,200
I stole mine. I stole it
from a friend of mine.

1266
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,200
His dad owns a bunch of guns.

1267
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,100
What we're you doing
with the stolen guns?

1268
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,100
We went down to Detroit
and started selling them.

1269
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,200
'Cause I can get, like, a buck
fifty a pop for a 9-millimetre.

1270
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,200
Oh, really. Who were you trying
to sell them to?

1271
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,400
Anybody that would really want
'em. Gangs and stuff like that.

1272
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,000
- Gangs in the city of Detroit?
- Yeah.

1273
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,600
- Black?
- Uh, predominantly. Yeah.

1274
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,700
Yeah. So now you're out now,
you're okay.

1275
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,600
Yeah, I'm free now.
I'm completely clear.

1276
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,100
- You can keep selling guns.
- I can't keep selling guns.

1277
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,100
It's getting too risky.
Everybody knows me up here.

1278
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,000
People want guns, drugs or
alcohol, they come to my house

1279
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,700
and that's just too much.

1280
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,700
- Yeah, too much hassle.
- Yeah.

1281
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,900
My favourite statistic in all
the research I did discovered

1282
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:37,100
that the murder rate had gone
down by 20%. The coverage -

1283
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,700
that is, how many murders are
on the evening news -

1284
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,100
it went up by 600%.

1285
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,800
The American people are
conditioned by network TV,

1286
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,800
by local news,

1287
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,700
to believe that
their communities are

1288
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,700
much more dangerous
than they actually are.

1289
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,700
For example, here,
in this community,

1290
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,700
crime has decreased every year
for the past eight years.

1291
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,000
Yet, gun ownership,
particularly handgun ownership,

1292
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,100
is on the increase.

1293
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,800
Crime rates have been
dropping, dropping, dropping.

1294
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,300
Fear of crime has been going
up, up, up.

1295
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,700
How can that be possible?
It doesn't make any sense.

1296
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,300
But it makes perfect sense
when you see what we're hearing

1297
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,400
from politicians and seeing
in the news media.

1298
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,400
So we're, uh, we're right here

1299
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,800
on the corner of Florence
and Normandie.

1300
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,100
It's kind of Ground Zero
for the L.A. riots.

1301
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,500
Right.

1302
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,600
You know, if a couple
of white guys

1303
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,900
would go down and walk around
South Central,

1304
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,900
they're gonna get killed.

1305
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,300
Which I can tell you
is a common perception.

1306
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,700
The odds that something's
going to happen to us

1307
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,700
are really, really slight.

1308
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,800
- Minuscule.
- Right. Okay.

1309
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,700
But you know,
if you look up there,

1310
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,800
you get a different symbol
of the Hollywood sign.

1311
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,700
It means something
very different

1312
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,800
than the corner
of Florence and Normandie.

1313
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,800
For most Americans
and most of the world,

1314
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,700
it means glamour and Hollywood,
except that we can't see it.

1315
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
I can't see the Hollywood sign.
Where is it?

1316
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,300
Right. You can't see it because
of something that's probably...

1317
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,300
much more dangerous for us
right now,

1318
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,100
which is the stuff
we're breathing.

1319
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,200
The pollution that's blocking
the Hollywood sign,

1320
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,900
we're breathing this.

1321
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,800
That's far more dangerous than
all the other stuff the media's

1322
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,700
- telling us to be afraid of.
- Right.

1323
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,700
As we left the corner
of Florence and Normandie,

1324
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,500
I noticed that a number
of helicopters

1325
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,900
had appeared in the sky.

1326
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,900
Within seconds, the news media

1327
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,700
- started to arrive.
- So what's the story here?

1328
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,200
I'm waiting.
I thought you would know.

1329
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,300
No, I don't know anything.

1330
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
The Sergeant just told me
there's a guy with a gun.

1331
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,100
But they're not sure.
That's all they told me.

1332
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,400
Since there's no action,
I'm not getting my camera down.

1333
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,900
I just happened to see the
chopper, going to another story.

1334
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,400
- What story are you going to?
- It's a near- drowning.

1335
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,100
- It's a drowning?
- A near-drowning.

1336
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,200
How about a story
about how you can't see

1337
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,700
the Hollywood Hills
because of the pollution?

1338
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,200
Could you maybe do a story
on that tonight?

1339
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,000
Pollution, that's rather good.
I find that good.

1340
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,700
You can't see it. You can't see
anything around here.

1341
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,700
If you have to choose
between a guy with a gun

1342
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,600
and a near-drowning of a baby -
you could only be one place--

1343
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,600
- I go with the gun.
- You go with the gun, always.

1344
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,600
Is it all over, here?
It's all over? All over?

1345
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,600
- Not yet, not yet.
- Looks like it.

1346
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,200
Just wait for these sergeants
down here to come down,

1347
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,100
'cause they got all the details.

1348
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,200
Okay. Hey, I was
just wondering -

1349
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,700
I just got here to L.A. today -
I can't see the Hollywood sign,

1350
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,600
down on the hills there,
down Normandie.

1351
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,700
You can't see the sign
'cause of the pollution.

1352
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,000
- Right.
- Is there anybody you can arrest

1353
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,200
- for polluting up the air?
- Absolutely not.

1354
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,000
- Nobody?
- No.

1355
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,600
Why is that?

1356
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,600
Why is that, Sergeant?

1357
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,700
He's fighting!

1358
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,500
For over a decade,

1359
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,600
there has been one show
on American television

1360
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,300
that has consistently brought
black and white people together

1361
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,600
in an effort to reduce
our fears

1362
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,600
and celebrate our diversity.

1363
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
That show is Cops.

1364
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,400
I went to see a former
producer of "Cops"

1365
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,900
and executive producer

1366
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,800
of World's Wildest
Police Videos:

1367
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,600
Mr. Dick Herland.

1368
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,600
Look "liberal" up
in the dictionary

1369
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,600
and I think my picture's
in there somewhere,

1370
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,600
So then, you know, why not be
compelled to do, you know,

1371
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,600
a show that focuses on, you
know, what's causing the crime,

1372
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,100
as opposed to just chasing
the criminals down?

1373
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,600
Because I think it's harder
to do that show.

1374
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,600
I don't know what
that show would be.

1375
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,900
Anger does well, hate does
well, violence does well.

1376
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,100
Tolerance and understanding
and trying to learn to be

1377
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,200
a little different than you were
last year does less well.

1378
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,600
- Does less well in the ratings.
- Oh yeah.

1379
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,100
Maybe because we,
in the television business,

1380
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,100
because we tend to demonize
black and Hispanic people,

1381
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,100
then those watching it at home
are going:

1382
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,100
"I don't want to help
those people.

1383
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,100
I'm not going to do anything
to help them.

1384
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,800
Because I hate them now,
because they may hurt me."

1385
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,700
- You know what I'm saying?
- I know what you're saying,

1386
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,100
I'm not sure that's
what we're doing.

1387
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,600
I'm not sure we're demonizing

1388
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:09,000
black and Hispanic people, uh...
particularly.

1389
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,500
I don't think we show
black and Hispanic people

1390
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,100
as being criminals.

1391
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,400
I'd like to say not more often,

1392
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,500
but probably
they are more often.

1393
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,100
But I certainly don't think...
We're certainly not trying

1394
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,100
to demonize black
and Hispanic people.

1395
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,100
We show them on the news,
we show them on TV,

1396
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,500
as pretty scary people.

1397
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,400
Yeah.

1398
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,500
And I agree. I'd like
to see that reversed

1399
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,500
as much as possible. I...

1400
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,500
- Start tonight.
- Well, the thing is,

1401
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,600
I don't know how
to start tonight.

1402
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,700
I don't know how to tell
that story.

1403
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,600
If I was smart enough
to do that...

1404
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,100
- I'll pitch you one.
- Okay. All right.

1405
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,600
Um... um...

1406
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,000
Do a show called not Cops
but Corporate Cops.

1407
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,900
"Corporation man
Hey Corporate man

1408
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,500
"We're coming out to get you
better run while you can

1409
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,000
"We're coming out to get you
better run while you can"

1410
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,100
Uh... I love the idea.

1411
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,700
I don't think it would make
very interesting reality TV.

1412
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,000
Unless we can get those people
to get in their SUVs

1413
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:18,600
and drive really fast down
the road away from the police.

1414
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,900
But I'm telling you,
everyone in America

1415
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,800
who's got just your basic,
everyday job

1416
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,500
is gonna love watching the boss

1417
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
being chased down the street
with his shirt off,

1418
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,100
thrown to the ground

1419
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,100
and a knee to the neck. I tell
you, that is gonna get ratings.

1420
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,500
Yeah, I'm with you. And if
I can find a police outfit

1421
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,200
that would prosecute corporate
criminals appropriately

1422
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,900
and would go after them
appropriately... In other words,

1423
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,000
what you do to a man who's
just stolen a lady's purse

1424
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,000
with $85 to it,

1425
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,500
than you need to do
an appropriate response

1426
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,600
to a man who has just stolen $85
million from indigent people,

1427
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,200
then, boy, we're gonna be
out there filming that.

1428
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,600
But as a matter of fact,
when police go after the guy

1429
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,600
who's just stolen $85 million,

1430
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,900
they treat him like he was
a member of the city council -

1431
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,100
as he may or may not be - and
it's not exciting television.

1432
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,600
If you could get that guy
to take his shirt off...

1433
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,600
Right.

1434
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,600
Yeah, and throw his cellular
phone at the police

1435
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,600
as they come through the door,

1436
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,500
try to jump out that window,
then we'd have a show.

1437
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,500
You watch violence on TV
in a place like Canada

1438
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,500
and you know it's not happening
next door.

1439
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,500
You watch it here, and you know
it is happening next door.

1440
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,500
- Right.
- I think that's...

1441
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,500
I don't know what
the difference is,

1442
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,600
- but there's a big difference.
- Yeah, but why isn't...

1443
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,500
Why isn't it happening
in Canada?

1444
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,500
Why aren't there, you know,
10,000 murders a year?

1445
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,600
I don't know, but I want
to go to Canada to retire,

1446
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,400
or something, 'cause it sounds
like where we want to be.

1447
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,500
I'd like to find out what that
difference is. Wouldn't you?

1448
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,600
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying
to find out.

1449
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,600
Where are you supposed
to be right now?

1450
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,600
- School.
- School.

1451
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,200
School.

1452
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,200
Aren't you worried about
what you're not learning?

1453
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,100
Nah, I'm mostly helping
everybody else in the class.

1454
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,400
- Then I barely get to do my work.
- How about you? You're not

1455
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,700
- worried about your education?
- Well, I've got the textbook.

1456
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,300
Why do you think
we have so many, uh...

1457
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,600
- gun murders in America?
- Uh...

1458
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,000
I have no idea. People must hate
each other or something.

1459
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,000
Oh, you mean Canadians don't
hate each other?

1460
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,000
Well, we do but we don't go to
the point of shooting somebody

1461
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,000
- just to get revenge.
- What do you do?

1462
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,500
I don't know.
Tease them, maybe.

1463
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,100
- Make fun of them, ridicule them.
- Throw eggs at them.

1464
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,000
How many gun murders
in Sarnia this year?

1465
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,900
- None.
- Last year?

1466
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,000
I believe we had one,
at the time.

1467
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,000
The year before that?

1468
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,500
I can't recall what we had
in the way of--

1469
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,500
Maybe one in the last
three years?

1470
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,600
- Probably, yes.
- Mm-hm.

1471
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,800
Very low. Very low
for this city.

1472
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,800
Well, of course,
there's no murders here

1473
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,800
because there's only
70,000 people

1474
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,600
and it's the kissing
capital of the world.

1475
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,100
So I went down the river
to another Canadian city

1476
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,100
that was five times
as large as Sarnia:

1477
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,700
Windsor, Ontario, just across
the river from Detroit.

1478
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,500
I was sure there'd be
more murders in Windsor.

1479
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,600
Ever hear of anyone being shot
by a gun in Windsor?

1480
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,700
No. No.

1481
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,600
You remember any murders here?

1482
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,000
Uh, there was one
a long time ago. Probably--

1483
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,400
- How long ago?
- Oh...

1484
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,400
- In your lifetime?
- In my lifetime,

1485
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,000
probably around 15, 20 years
ago, there was one murder.

1486
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,100
In fact, this Windsor
policeman told me

1487
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,700
that the only gun murder

1488
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,900
he could recall in Windsor
in the last three years

1489
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,400
was committed by a guy
from Detroit,

1490
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,000
who had a stolen gun
from Minnesota.

1491
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,900
With nearly 400,000 people
in the Windsor area,

1492
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:51,400
there were simply no Canadians
shooting other Canadians.

1493
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,000
I thought it might be time

1494
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,900
for some fun facts
about Canada.

1495
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,400
I hit the streets of New York
to find out what

1496
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,900
the average American thought
about our friendly neighbour

1497
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,400
to the north.

1498
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,900
Canadians don't watch as much
violent movies as Americans do.

1499
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,900
That's wrong.

1500
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,500
Hordes of young boys,
all throughout Canada,

1501
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,000
eagerly await the next
Hollywood bloodbath.

1502
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,800
Then one of the guy gets
his leg taken off.

1503
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,900
- Oh, wow!
- And there was a lot of girls,

1504
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
- and naked at one point.
- I like that stuff.

1505
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,200
- What movie did you see tonight?
- Sixth Day.

1506
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,700
- With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
- Yeah.

1507
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,200
Did it make you want
to come out here

1508
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,200
and play this shoot-'em-up game?

1509
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,600
Well... yeah.

1510
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,500
There's no poverty in Canada
like there is here...

1511
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,500
in the States.

1512
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,000
Wrong again.

1513
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,100
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Ontario, Canada

1514
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,300
Actually, we've also had
a much higher unemployment rate.

1515
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,600
When Michigan rate was running at 4%,
we were still at 8-9%,

1516
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,800
We seem to have an institutional
unemployment rate.

1517
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,000
I think there'd mostly be
white people in Canada.

1518
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,000
Hmm... that's strange,
'cause when I'm in Canada,

1519
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,700
I see black people everywhere.

1520
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,500
And yellow people,
and brown people...

1521
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,400
and 13% of the country is
non-white.

1522
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,700
So the Canadians are

1523
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,000
pretty much just like us. And the
reason that they have (Toronto, Canada)

1524
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,400
so few murders has to be
because they've got

1525
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,000
so few guns.

1526
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,600
- What kind of guns do you own?
- Uh, I hunt.

1527
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,300
I own rifles and shotguns,
and I own pistols.

1528
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,900
- Mm-hm. So how many guns total?
- Uh... Probably about seven.

1529
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,400
- Seven guns?
- Yeah.

1530
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,400
- Do you have a gun?
- I have a few.

1531
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,300
- How many guns do you have?
- Half a dozen.

1532
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,900
You could name how many people
that own guns, that you know?

1533
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,600
- Two, three, a dozen?
- More than that.

1534
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,300
There's a tremendous
amount of gun ownership.

1535
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,400
We're a large country
geographically.

1536
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,900
We grew up with hunting and
fishing being a tradition.

1537
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,400
In Canada, with a population
of just around 30 million -

1538
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,300
there's about
10 million families -

1539
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,300
and the best estimate is
somewhere in the region

1540
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,300
of seven-million guns.

1541
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,700
Wow!

1542
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,000
Canada was one gun-loving,

1543
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,000
gun-toting, gun-crazy country!

1544
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,500
- Where can you get a gun?
- Uptown, any time I want.

1545
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,000
I see you're a Glock owner.

1546
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,800
Where can I get a Glock
in Canada?

1547
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,300
Most gun stores'll sell 'em
to you

1548
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,400
if you have the proper
permits and stuff.

1549
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,400
In fact, despite all
their tough gun laws,

1550
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,300
take a look at what I,

1551
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,000
a foreign citizen,
was able to do

1552
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,100
at the local Canadian Wal-Mart.

1553
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,000
- Where's the ammunition at?
- Where's the ammunition?

1554
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,300
- Yeah.
- Back here.

1555
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,800
- What kind are you looking for?
- You know, like, bullets.

1556
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,600
That's right.

1557
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,600
I could buy as much live
ammunition as I wanted to

1558
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,500
in Canada.
You take American?

1559
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,300
Do you lock your doors?

1560
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,100
- No.
- Are you afraid of anything?

1561
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,100
Sarnia, Canada

1562
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,700
- Nah, not really, no.
- Do you lock your doors at night?

1563
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,600
- No.
- You don't lock your doors?

1564
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,300
- No.
- Well, what do you...

1565
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,800
- Are you afraid of anything?
- Not really.

1566
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,400
- Have you ever been broken into?
- Yes, I have. Yeah.

1567
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,800
- What happened?
- They broke into my home.

1568
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,800
I wasn't there. They broke in,

1569
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,500
they stole some booze
and cigarettes and they left.

1570
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,900
So I figure it must've been
some teenagers

1571
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,800
out to have a little bit of fun.
That's all they took, though.

1572
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,900
Just some booze
and some cigarettes.

1573
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,800
Have you ever been
a victim of crime?

1574
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,800
- Yes.
- What kind of crime?

1575
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,300
Uh, I've had people walk in
while I've been sleeping

1576
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,300
and vandalize my home
and steal from me.

1577
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,400
And that didn't want to make
you lock your doors at night?

1578
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,000
No. No.

1579
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,700
As an American with
three locks on his doors,

1580
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
I found this all
a bit confusing.

1581
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,500
Even here, in Toronto,
a city of millions,

1582
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,000
people just didn't lock
their doors.

1583
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,400
So you don't lock your doors but
we, Americans, do. Why is that?

1584
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,000
You must be afraid
of your neighbour.

1585
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,400
Do you ever leave your doors
unlocked at home?

1586
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do?

1587
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,800
- Where do you live?
- Right around here.

1588
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,300
- Toronto?
- Around here.

1589
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,100
- You leave your doors unlocked?
- Yeah.

1590
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,200
You'd think, as Americans,

1591
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,900
that the lock is keeping people
out of your place.

1592
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,200
We, as Canadians,
see it more as, uh...

1593
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,900
when we lock the door, we're
imprisoning ourselves inside.

1594
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,700
You don't want to do that.

1595
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,800
Not really, no.

1596
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,700
We don't want to... No.

1597
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,200
I decided to go unannounced
to a neighbourhood in Toronto

1598
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,900
to see if this unlocked-door
thing was true.

1599
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,100
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
Just checking.

1600
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,000
Oh, hello!

1601
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,200
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1602
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,300
Nobody locks their doors.

1603
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,300
Nobody locks their doors
in this town.

1604
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,200
- You want to lock?
- No, no, no.

1605
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,500
- Do you like living here?
- I like it very much.

1606
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
- Yeah? And the T-shirt?
- The T- shirt too.

1607
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,800
This door was wide open.
And you're not afraid?

1608
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,200
- Should I be afraid?
- I don't know. You live here.

1609
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,500
- I don't think I'm afraid.
- You're not, are you?

1610
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,500
- Thank you very much.
- All right. No problem.

1611
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,500
- I'm sorry about the intrusion.
- No, no problem.

1612
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,100
- Thank you for not shooting me.
- No problem at all.

1613
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,500
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.

1614
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,700
As an American,

1615
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,100
I gotta say this all
seemed kind of strange.

1616
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,000
Until I looked up at the TV

1617
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,300
in the bar and noticed
what they watched

1618
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,300
for their evening news.

1619
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,000
They're friends of ours.

1620
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,200
We'll certainly listen to them
courteously and carefully,

1621
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,100
but you don't just make war
just 'cause someone says so.

1622
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,200
The Canadians weren't being
pumped full of fear.

1623
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,400
And their politicians seemed
to talk kind of funny.

1624
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Canada

1625
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,000
...making sure they have good daycare,
assistance for their parents

1626
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,400
when they're elderly and need
to be in an old-age home,

1627
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,500
that they have proper
health care that insures

1628
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,700
that they won't lose
their business or their house

1629
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
because they can't
afford their medical bills.

1630
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,700
That's how you build
a good society.

1631
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,300
No one wins unless everyone
wins. And you don't win

1632
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,600
by beating up on people
who can't defend themselves.

1633
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,100
And that's been the approach,
unfortunately,

1634
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,500
that's been spreading with some
of the right-wing governments

1635
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,400
across North America.
They pick onto people

1636
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,500
that can't defend
themselves and at the same time,

1637
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
they're turning around and
giving financial support

1638
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,500
and tax breaks and tax benefits
to people that don't need them.

1639
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,800
Where are the indigents in
the city? Where do they live?

1640
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,800
Uh... indigent... uh...

1641
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,300
You act like you've never heard
the word before.

1642
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,300
There's... We don't have that
problem here, really. It's...

1643
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,800
So I asked him,

1644
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,200
"Could you at least take me
to a Canadian slum,"

1645
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,800
and well...

1646
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,100
this is what a ghetto
looks like in Canada.

1647
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,600
Is this the same mentality that
says, with Canadians, if someone

1648
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,100
gets sick, they should actually
be able to have health care?

1649
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,000
- Yeah.
- Oh, definitely.

1650
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,200
- Yeah.
- Yup.

1651
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,700
Why?

1652
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,800
Because!

1653
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,700
Human rights. Everyone's got
the right to live.

1654
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,700
You just came out of
the emergency room?

1655
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,300
Yes, I did.

1656
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,900
How much did you have to pay
for your treatment?

1657
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,900
The bill is covered
by our hospital plan.

1658
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,900
You're telling me you didn't
have to pay anything?

1659
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,400
No, I don't.

1660
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,900
I have family that lives
in the States.

1661
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,800
They used to live in Canada
and moved over there.

1662
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,800
- And it's so different.
- They get afraid more easily.

1663
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,900
Oh, yeah.

1664
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,800
Yeah, very much so.

1665
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,800
'Cause everybody reacts
over there just like that.

1666
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,800
They don't stop and think.

1667
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,100
First reaction is pull the gun
out. "You're on my property."

1668
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,600
You know, like...

1669
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't know. It's just
different over here.

1670
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,000
- Where do you live?
- Detroit.

1671
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,700
Come over to Canada here
for the night?

1672
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,100
Right.

1673
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,200
People are more open-minded
here, a bit more welcoming.

1674
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:44,100
Feel any difference when
you cross over to this country?

1675
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,400
Be honest, now, come on.
- It's a lot lighter.

1676
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,300
The segregation over there
is definitely much more--

1677
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,400
- In the United States.
- ...more intensified

1678
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,300
- in the States, yeah.
- Yeah.

1679
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
So you can... You can feel it.

1680
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,900
Almost like they just
let you be.

1681
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,200
That's Canada for you.

1682
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,300
Every time I turn on the TV
in the States,

1683
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,800
it's always about a murder here,
a gunfight, hostile position...

1684
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,300
I just think the States, their
view of things is fighting.

1685
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,300
That's how they resolve
everything.

1686
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,300
If there's... there's something
going on in another country,

1687
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,300
they send people over
to fight it and...

1688
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,700
They are the most powerful
country in the world, though.

1689
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,100
Canada's more just, like,
"Let's negotiate,

1690
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,300
let's work something out."
Where the States is,

1691
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,600
"We'll kill you and that'll be
the end of that."

1692
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,600
Um, if guns were...
If more guns made people safer,

1693
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
then America would be one of the
safest countries in the world.

1694
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,100
It isn't. It's the opposite.

1695
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
I heard that 911 call,
you know, on TV someplace.

1696
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,600
It was horrible. It was just...

1697
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,400
'Cause he kept asking,
"Where's the shooter?"

1698
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,600
She said, "He's gone.
I need some help."

1699
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,100
The little girl was
in there too?

1700
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,100
She was on the floor, yes.

1701
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,100
And the police and
the medics came, or...

1702
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,100
By the time the medics
were here...

1703
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,100
The medics had just come in
and I remember him stepping in

1704
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,100
and taking over the room.
He said, "You have to leave."

1705
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,200
- All right.
- And then when the meds come in,

1706
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,600
when the police come in,
you're no longer in control.

1707
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,700
- They take over the building.
- Was she still alive then?

1708
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,100
Her lips had become
totally blue.

1709
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,300
Back in my hometown
of Flint, Michigan,

1710
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,200
a six-year-old first-grade boy,
at Buell Elementary,

1711
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,700
had found a gun
at his uncle's house,

1712
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,400
where he was staying because
his mother was being evicted.

1713
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,200
He brought the gun to school
and shot another first- grader,

1714
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,300
six-year-old Kayla Rolland.

1715
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,900
With one bullet that passed
through her body,

1716
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,500
she fell to the floor
and laid there dying

1717
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,100
while her teacher called 911
for help.

1718
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,000
No one knew why the little boy

1719
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,100
wanted to shoot
the little girl.

1720
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,100
As if the city
had not been through

1721
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,300
enough horror and tragedy

1722
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,700
in the past two decades,
it was now home

1723
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,000
to a new record: the youngest
school shooting ever

1724
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,000
in the United States.

1725
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,800
On the morning of the shooting,

1726
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
it only took the helicopters
and satellite trucks

1727
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,500
a half-hour to show up.

1728
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,200
They check in the truck.

1729
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,300
You know, we're doing one
in 30 minutes again.

1730
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,300
This evening,
about seven o'clock,

1731
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,500
will be a public memorial
service. Hundreds of people

1732
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,600
will mourn the loss of little
Kayla, a tiny little girl

1733
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,700
who loved pizza, teddy bears,

1734
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,000
and who was taken away from us
much too soon. Gina?

1735
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,100
Good morning, Christine.
The funeral home now passing out

1736
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,100
tens of thousands
of these pink ribbons

1737
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,500
to support the young
girl's family.

1738
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,000
Today will be an emotional day
and has been already,

1739
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,100
remembering little Kayla.

1740
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,100
Jeff Ross, Fox-2 News.

1741
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,000
Nice job.

1742
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,000
Yeah, Michelle, we're having
technical problems, okay?

1743
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,800
Well, don't talk to me about it,
call our sat truck.

1744
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,800
I need a haircut, man.

1745
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:34,100
I'm a pig. A rug.

1746
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,500
Here we go.

1747
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,600
Some too choked up
even to speak about it.

1748
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,600
There's a memorial service
scheduled here

1749
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,600
for seven o'clock tonight.

1750
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,500
We're live in Flint, Michigan,
this afternoon.

1751
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,600
Jeff Ross, Q-13 Reports.

1752
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1753
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,900
Want some hairspray?

1754
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,000
- I kind of need it, don't I?
- Yeah, you do,

1755
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,000
I got some...

1756
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,200
I have some. I just didn't put
it in. I didn't have a chance.

1757
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,900
I have hurricane-proof hairspray.

1758
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:10,300
This man prayed for Kayla
then let the balloon go.

1759
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,900
I say we have
the colour picture,

1760
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,200
not the black-and-white.

1761
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,100
Plenty of media here
that covered Columbine.

1762
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,500
You know, there are
some networks, especially,

1763
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,500
that go from, unfortunately,
tragedy to tragedy.

1764
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:26,100
And, uh, I feel bad for them.
Because that's all they see...

1765
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,200
The tragedies.

1766
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,500
We're just trying
to crunch right now

1767
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,600
for the five and the six.

1768
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,700
Today, we're feeding
CNN and Fox, so...

1769
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,100
The national media had never
visited Buell Elementary,

1770
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,100
or the Beecher school district
in which it sat,

1771
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,600
or this part of Flint
ever before.

1772
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,100
And few, if any, of these
reporters bothered to visit it

1773
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,000
even when they were here now.

1774
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,600
If they had ventured just
a block away from the school

1775
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,600
or the funeral home,
they might have seen

1776
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,000
a different kind of tragedy
that, perhaps, would contain

1777
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,700
some answers as to why
this little girl was dead.

1778
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,100
For over 20 years,
this impoverished area,

1779
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,300
in the hometown

1780
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,300
of the world's
largest corporation,

1781
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,900
had been ignored as completely
as it had been destroyed.

1782
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,500
With 87% of the students
living below

1783
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,500
the official poverty line,

1784
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,500
Buell and Beecher, and Flint,
did not fit into

1785
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,500
the accepted and widely
circulated story line

1786
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,200
put forth by
the nation's media.

1787
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,600
That being the one
about America

1788
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,600
and its invincible economy.

1789
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,300
The number-one cause of death
among young people

1790
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,800
in this part of Flint was
homicide. The football field,

1791
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,200
at Flint-Beecher, was sponsored
by a funeral home.

1792
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,100
The kids at Beecher have won

1793
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,000
13 state track championships,

1794
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,300
but they've never had

1795
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,500
a home track meet.

1796
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,500
Because around
the football field,

1797
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,400
all they have is
this dirt ring.

1798
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:12,100
Years ago, someone here
named the streets,

1799
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,600
in this part of town, after
all the Ivy League schools,

1800
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,500
as if they had dreamed
of better days

1801
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,500
and something greater
for themselves.

1802
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,800
The children are doing well.

1803
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The faculty and staff
are doing well.

1804
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,500
But we don't forget.

1805
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,900
We don't forget.

1806
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,400
Just don't want this happening
to anybody else, you know?

1807
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,000
It's...

1808
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,000
I know.

1809
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,000
I know. I don't want it to
happen to anybody else either.

1810
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,500
- Hmm...
- It's okay. It's okay.

1811
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,300
It's okay.

1812
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,900
It's okay.

1813
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,000
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1814
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,500
...from my cold, dead hands!

1815
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,500
Just as he did

1816
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,900
after the Columbine shooting,
Charlton Heston showed up

1817
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,700
in Flint to have
a big pro-gun rally.

1818
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,800
Freedom has never seen

1819
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,900
greater peril nor needed
you more urgently

1820
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,300
to come to her defence than now.

1821
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,000
Before he came to Flint,
Heston was interviewed

1822
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,100
by the Georgetown Hoya
about Kayla's death,

1823
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,000
and even his own NRA website
talked about it.

1824
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,200
We wanted to let the NRA know
that we haven't forgotten

1825
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,600
about Kayla Rolland.

1826
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,200
How could they come here?
To me, it's like they're rubbing

1827
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,400
our nose in it. I was shocked

1828
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,200
and appalled that
they would come here.

1829
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,600
Heston was asked by a local
reporter why he came to Flint

1830
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,000
after the tragedy at Buell,

1831
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,000
and what did the NRA
have to say

1832
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,700
about six-year-olds using guns.

1833
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,300
We spend $20 million every year

1834
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,600
and then we teach you...
to five and six-year-olds,

1835
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,600
we say, "If you see a gun,
don't touch it,

1836
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:12,100
leave the room, call an adult."

1837
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,700
And then Moses himself
showed up.

1838
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,700
Right here in the city
of Flint?

1839
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,800
Right here in Flint.

1840
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,700
Were there people that wanted
you to try this child,

1841
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,400
Arthur Busch
County Prosecutor, Flint, Michigan

1842
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,000
- or even try him as an adult?
- Oh... Oh, yeah.

1843
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,000
There were people from all over
America that wrote and called

1844
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:34,300
and sent mail and...
It was amazing to me, um...

1845
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,500
groups that were affiliated
with the NRA -

1846
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,400
groups, you know, people
that I call "gun nuts" -

1847
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,400
writing me and telling me
what a horrible thing it was

1848
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,900
that I had admonished homeowners
in our country

1849
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:52,700
to be careful about bringing
weapons into their home.

1850
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,500
They wanted this little boy
hung from the highest tree.

1851
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,400
I mean, there was such
an undercurrent of racism

1852
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,200
and hate and anger.

1853
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,000
It was ugly.

1854
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,800
That's a picture that
the little boy that was involved

1855
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,300
in the Buell-school shooting...

1856
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,700
Once he was brought back here
to our office,

1857
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,000
about 15 minutes after
the shooting took place,

1858
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,600
I gave him some crayons to kind
of occupy him a little bit.

1859
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,500
Michael Caldwell
Police Detective

1860
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,500
He came over and drew
that picture for me.

1861
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,700
Because at the time, I had
pictures right behind my desk

1862
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,800
that my children had drew for me
and he wanted to draw me one.

1863
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,300
This is what he drew for you.
What did he say this was?

1864
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,600
That's him at his house.

1865
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,800
That's him at his house,
right here.

1866
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,900
And why did you decide
to hang on to it?

1867
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,900
Because of the gravity of the
situation and what had occurred

1868
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,300
and he asked me to hang that
behind my desk,

1869
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,500
so I put it in a frame
and that's where it'll stay.

1870
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,900
Tamarla Owens was the mother
of the six-year-old boy.

1871
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,500
In order to get food stamps and
health care for her children,

1872
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,900
Tamarla was forced to work as
part of the state of Michigan's

1873
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,400
Welfare-to-Work Program.

1874
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,600
This program was so successful

1875
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,500
in tossing poor people
off welfare

1876
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:06,000
that it's founder,

1877
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,000
Gerald Miller, was soon hired

1878
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,200
by the number-one firm in the
country that states turned to

1879
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,500
to privatize
their welfare systems.

1880
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,500
That firm was Lockheed Martin.
With the cold war over

1881
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,100
and no enemy left
to frighten the public,

1882
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,100
Lockheed had found
the perfect way to diversify

1883
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,900
and the perfect way

1884
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,900
to profit from people's fears,

1885
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,900
with an enemy
much closer to home:

1886
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,100
poor black mothers

1887
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,200
like Tamarla Owens.

1888
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,400
We've got a one-parent family and
the mother's travelling 60 miles.

1889
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,000
Sheriff Robert Pickell
Flint, Michigan

1890
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,300
An hour, an hour and a half
away to go to work

1891
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,400
an hour, an hour and a half
to come home.

1892
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,800
How does that help a community?
But that's part of the state...

1893
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,800
you know, making parents
responsible, making them work--

1894
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,800
- Welfare to work.
- Welfare to work.

1895
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
That's a program
that ought to be stopped

1896
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,000
because it really has no merit.

1897
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,000
I think it adds more
to the problem

1898
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,000
than it does to solve it.

1899
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,900
- Really?
- I do.

1900
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,900
You're the sheriff
and you feel this way.

1901
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:07,000
I do, I do. I wish I could put
two parents in every home

1902
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,600
and make every parent
equally responsible,

1903
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,100
but I can't do that.

1904
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,100
But we're not doing anything
by taking one parent

1905
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:15,100
and putting them on a bus
and sending them out of town

1906
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,700
to make $5.50 an hour.

1907
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,700
This is the bus that she was
forced to ride every day

1908
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,700
in order to work off
the welfare money

1909
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,700
the state had given her.

1910
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,400
She, and many others from Flint
who were poor,

1911
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,400
would make the 80-mile
round-trip journey every day,

1912
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,100
from Flint to Auburn Hills,
in Oakland County,

1913
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:40,500
one of the wealthiest areas
in the country.

1914
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,500
Tamarla would leave

1915
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,100
early in the morning
and return late at night,

1916
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,600
rarely seeing
her young children.

1917
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,800
What's the point in doing that?
Where does the state benefit?

1918
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,400
Where does Flint and Genesee
County benefit from that?

1919
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,300
We have a child dead.
I think that may be, in part,

1920
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,400
part of the problem.

1921
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,800
We drove the one parent out.

1922
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,800
Now, you or anybody else
that can tell me

1923
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,900
that that best serves
the community,

1924
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,700
I shake my head and wonder why.

1925
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,500
How long you been riding
the bus?

1926
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,000
I've been working here

1927
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,900
- just about three years now.
- About three years?

1928
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,900
Yeah. My brother...
I got my brother working here,

1929
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,900
half of my neighbourhood
works out here.

1930
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,600
Just about everybody I know
personally works in the mall.

1931
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,300
In Flint, doing the same thing
I'm doing now,

1932
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,400
they only pay minimum wage
in Flint. I come 40 miles

1933
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,900
to make three or four
dollars more an hour.

1934
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,900
- How much do you make an hour?
- I make 8.50 now.

1935
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,800
Is that enough
to pay the bills?

1936
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,400
No.

1937
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,600
So did you know Tamarla Owens,

1938
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,600
the woman whose son
shot the little girl?

1939
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,300
- I think she rode this bus.
- I knew her a little bit.

1940
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,800
- Not real good.
- Nice lady?

1941
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,300
Yeah, she was okay. She came
to work every day, did her job.

1942
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,800
- She worked two jobs, so...
- She worked two jobs?

1943
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,500
She was trying
to make ends meet.

1944
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,500
"We're going hopping
We're going hopping today

1945
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,300
"Where things are popping...

1946
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,600
This is Dick Clark's
American Bandstand Grill,

1947
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,700
where Tamarla worked
one of her two jobs.

1948
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,700
"On the Bandstand
Bandstand"

1949
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,300
I think she worked in this room
here, as a bartender,

1950
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,300
fountain-person making drinks,
making shakes, desserts.

1951
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,100
- Was she a good employee?
- Yeah, she was.

1952
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,200
She also worked at the Fudgery,
in the mall here.

1953
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,500
Dick Clark is
an American icon,

1954
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,700
the man who brought rock'n'roll
into our homes every week

1955
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:37,700
on American Bandstand.

1956
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,900
Every part of your life,
you can link up

1957
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,200
to a part of music, usually.
So, as Dick says,

1958
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,900
"It's the soundtrack
of our lives."

1959
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,500
Music's the soundtrack
of our lives.

1960
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,900
His restaurant and the
Fudgery, here in Auburn Hills,

1961
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,700
applied for special tax breaks
because they were using

1962
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,700
welfare people as employees.

1963
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,100
Even though Tamarla worked
up to 70 hours a week

1964
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,000
at these two jobs

1965
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,600
in the mall, she did not earn
enough to pay her rent.

1966
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,700
And one week before
the shooting,

1967
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,500
was told by her landlord

1968
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,500
that he was evicting her.

1969
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,200
With nowhere to go
and not wanting to take

1970
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,900
her two children out of school,
Tamarla asked her brother

1971
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:17,300
if they could stay with him
for a few weeks.

1972
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,300
It was there that Tamarla's son

1973
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:23,000
found a small 32-calibre gun
and took it to school.

1974
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,300
Tamarla did not see him
take the gun to school,

1975
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,800
because she was on a state bus
to go serve drinks

1976
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,300
and make fudge for rich people.

1977
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,100
"Bandstand"

1978
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,100
I decided to fly out
to California

1979
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,000
to ask Dick Clark what
he thought about a system

1980
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,500
that forces poor,
single mothers to work

1981
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,800
two low-wage jobs to survive.

1982
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,900
I'm doing a documentary
on these school shootings

1983
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,800
and, you know,
guns and all that.

1984
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,700
And in my hometown of Flint
Michigan, which you know,

1985
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,300
this little six-year-old
shot a six-year-old--

1986
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,200
Get in the car, Dave!
Watch your arm, watch your arm.

1987
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,300
- Oop, sorry, sorry.
- I'm sorry, we're really late.

1988
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,300
Anyways, but the mother of
the kid who did the shooting

1989
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,900
works at Dick Clark's
All-American Grill...

1990
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,900
- Forget it.
- ...in Oakland County...

1991
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,700
- Close the door.
- A Welfare-to-work program--

1992
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:17,700
- Close the door.
- These people are forced...

1993
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,700
- Dick, no...
- Bye-bye. Come on, move over!

1994
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,700
I want you to help me convince
the governor of Michigan...

1995
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,700
It's a Welfare-to-work pro...
These women are forced to work!

1996
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,700
They've got kids at home. Dick!

1997
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,400
Ah, jeez!

1998
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,300
In George Bush's America,

1999
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,100
the poor were not a priority.

2000
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:37,900
And after September 11th, 2001,

2001
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,500
correcting America's
social problems

2002
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,600
took a back seat to fear,

2003
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,400
panic and a new set
of priorities.

2004
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,200
One way to express our unity

2005
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,200
is for Congress to set
the military budget,

2006
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,200
the defence of
the United States,

2007
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,200
as the number-one priority
and fully fund my request!

2008
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,900
We've been selling
a lot of chemical suits,

2009
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,700
with the gloves and the hoods.

2010
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:10,000
And we've been selling
a lot of gas masks.

2011
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,400
I'm trying to get one
for myself and my puppy.

2012
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,300
Denis Marks and his wife

2013
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,700
have been stocking up supplies.

2014
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,800
Weapons, ammunition...

2015
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,700
Wal-Mart says
after September 11th,

2016
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,100
gun sales surged 70%,

2017
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,400
ammunition up 140%.

2018
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,500
In Dallas, they're
already taking potshots

2019
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,500
at Osama bin Laden.

2020
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,600
In the months following
the 9/11 attacks,

2021
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:34,400
we, Americans, were gripped
in a state of fear.

2022
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,500
None of us knew
if we too would die

2023
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,000
at the hands of the evildoers,

2024
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,600
or who might be sitting

2025
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,700
next to some crazy guy trying
to light his shoes on fire.

2026
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,200
The threat seemed very real.

2027
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,800
Sounds a little paranoid but
I'm not gonna take the chance.

2028
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,800
Just trying to protect
myself and my family.

2029
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,800
Our growing fears were turned

2030
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,000
into a handsome profit
for many.

2031
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,600
Mike Blake has seen

2032
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,600
a 30% increase in sales at ADT

2033
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,900
over the last month.

2034
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,900
Most of the people he talks to
are still a little uneasy

2035
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,100
over the September 11th
terrorist attacks.

2036
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,800
How are we afraid of all these
things, it's because

2037
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,600
a lot of people are making
a lot of money off of it

2038
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,700
and a lot of careers off of it.

2039
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,900
And so, there's
vested interests,

2040
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:17,400
a lot of activity
to keep us afraid.

2041
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,200
And what better way to fight
box-cutter-wielding terrorists

2042
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,700
than to order a record number
of fighter jets

2043
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,700
from Lockheed?

2044
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,600
Yes, everyone felt safer,
especially with the army

2045
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,800
doing garbage detail
on Park Avenue.

2046
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,100
And the greatest benefit
of all of a terrorized public

2047
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,200
is that the corporate

2048
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:39,200
and political leaders can get
away with just about anything.

2049
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,200
I've never seen
a better example

2050
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,100
of cash-and-carry government

2051
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,800
than this Bush administration
and Enron.

2052
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,000
There were a lot of things
that I didn't know

2053
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,800
after the World Trade Center
attack,

2054
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
but one thing was clear:
whether it was before or after

2055
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:00,000
September 11th, a public that's
this out of control with fear

2056
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,900
should not have a lot of guns
or ammo laying around.

2057
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:09,300
Well, I was shot with a Tech-9.

2058
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,300
Nine millimetre?

2059
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,300
Yeah. Yeah, I was, uh...

2060
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,200
I guess it was supposed
to be semi-automatic,

2061
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,200
but it kind of seemed like
fully automatic to me,

2062
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:23,700
- from what I remember.
- This is Richard Costaldo.

2063
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,100
And this is Mark Taylor.
Both of these boys were shot

2064
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,500
the day of
the Columbine massacre.

2065
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,600
Richard is paralyzed for life
and in a wheelchair.

2066
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:37,700
And Mark is barely standing
after numerous operations.

2067
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,100
The kids at Columbine
had to pay a penalty.

2068
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,300
We paid a penalty that day...
for this nation.

2069
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,300
The way we look at it.

2070
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,300
Mark and Richard were disabled
and suffering

2071
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,200
from the 17-cent K-Mart bullets
still embedded in their bodies.

2072
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,200
As they showed me the various
entry points for the bullets,

2073
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,800
I thought of one way
we could reduce

2074
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,900
the number of guns and bullets
laying around. I asked the boys

2075
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,800
if they'd like to go to K-Mart
to return the merchandise.

2076
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,100
- Ready?
- You... you go.

2077
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,600
K-Mart Headquarters
Troy, Michigan

2078
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,900
Hi.

2079
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,800
Excuse me, will you turn
the camera off, please?

2080
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:54,800
- We're here to see Mr. Conaway.
- You have to turn the camera off

2081
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,700
- while you're in the building.
- Oh, okay, all right.

2082
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,700
Okay, turn it off now.

2083
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:02,800
- Hey, Michael.
- Hi, how are you?

2084
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,400
I'm Mary Lorenz. I'm director
of Media Relations for K-Mart.

2085
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,800
- Oh, good. All right, good.
- How can I help you today?

2086
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,500
Well, I'm here today...
This is Richard Costaldo.

2087
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,100
- Richard, nice to meet you.
- And this is Mark Taylor.

2088
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,600
- Mark.
- And they're students

2089
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,600
from Columbine High School.
They were shot at Columbine,

2090
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,700
in the massacre,
with bullets from K-Mart.

2091
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,600
You came a long way.
All the way from Colorado.

2092
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:29,500
Yeah, I just...
I was thinking that...

2093
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,500
since you stopped selling
the handguns and all,

2094
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:35,200
it'd kind of make sense to stop
selling the bullets too.

2095
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,500
Our request is that you get rid
of nine-millimetre bullets

2096
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,200
and that you don't sell them
in the store completely.

2097
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,600
We do carry... You probably
are aware of K- Mart -

2098
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:46,100
hopefully, you're shoppers
at our stores -

2099
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,600
that we do only carry, you know,
sporting firearms

2100
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:55,200
and the accessories
that go with the hunting sport.

2101
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,600
And we'll certainly take your
message to our chairman and CEO,

2102
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,000
Chuck Conaway.
He's not here today.

2103
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,600
- He's not here today?
- No. He's not here, actually,

2104
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,400
- this whole week.
- Not at all during the week?

2105
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,400
Do you have a limit on the
number of bullets, ammunition,

2106
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,500
- that people can purchase?
- You know, I can't answer

2107
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,600
these questions for you.
I'm not the merchandiser

2108
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,200
who places those products
in our stores.

2109
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,600
Can we speak to that person?

2110
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,600
But I can get answers
to those questions for you.

2111
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:21,300
If you leave your card, I could
get those answers for you.

2112
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,300
We don't want to leave a card.

2113
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,300
The reason why
we can't take a card

2114
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,200
and come back
is because Mark here,

2115
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,300
he's got a K-Mart bullet
just an inch away... right?

2116
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,200
- Yeah.
- From your aorta.

2117
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,600
- In between my aorta and spine.
- Between your aorta and spine.

2118
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,400
I'm glad to see that
you're still able to stand.

2119
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:41,100
And I told him that somebody
here would listen,

2120
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,600
somebody here would... would...

2121
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,600
would take the request
seriously. Not just a PR person,

2122
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,500
but somebody who has some
authority and can answer

2123
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,100
some of the questions
that they want answered.

2124
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:54,100
K-Mart does care about this,

2125
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,100
but I can't go any further
right now.

2126
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,500
So until I make a call, um,

2127
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:00,800
I'm gonna go back to the office

2128
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,900
and see if there's anyone
in merchandising...

2129
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,900
Mary went back upstairs.
And two hours later,

2130
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,800
she brought down this guy whose
job it is to buy the bullets

2131
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,400
for K-Mart.

2132
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:14,000
- Good. Stay out of trouble.
- Yes.

2133
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,400
We're not the ones in trouble,
guys.

2134
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,600
Mark thought he'd show him
his bullet wounds.

2135
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,500
- Those are his bullet holes.
- Hm.

2136
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,500
From your bullets.

2137
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,400
That's where the K-Mart bullets
went in.

2138
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,300
Well, take care.

2139
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,000
Is anybody else gonna
come down?

2140
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,000
Is anybody else gonna come down?
Is that it?

2141
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,600
- I'll check.
- Okay, thank you.

2142
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:37,100
We waited around
a couple more hours

2143
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,400
but no one else came down.

2144
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,500
As we left the building,
Mark came up with an idea.

2145
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,400
He suggested that we go

2146
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:49,300
to the nearest K-Mart
and buy out all their bullets.

2147
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,200
Just take as many of those
as you can.

2148
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,700
Yeah, you can come around here
and look.

2149
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:57,500
What else do we have over here?

2150
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,500
You got 357. Sure, I'll take 'em
all, take everything you got.

2151
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:03,100
- So you're 17? You're what?
- Sixteen.

2152
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,600
Wait.

2153
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,500
Oh, shit!

2154
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,000
Oh, my God...

2155
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:12,000
Mark pretty much cleaned them
out of their ammunition.

2156
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:15,400
And the next day, we decided to
go back to K-Mart headquarters

2157
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,700
with all the bullets.
This time,

2158
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,300
we brought the press.

2159
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,900
Our local first coverage
of south-eastern Michigan

2160
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,500
continues now
with all-new stories.

2161
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
Coming up here on
our six-o'clock report,

2162
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:30,000
a warning to everyone this
summer to watch out for snakes.

2163
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,200
You'll hear from a mom who was
bitten by a rattlesnake.

2164
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,500
And also, students who survived
the Columbine massacre

2165
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,000
are in town.
They are very angry with K-Mart.

2166
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,100
We're here to see Chuck
Conaway, the chairman of K- Mart.

2167
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,100
How you doing, sir?
It's always a pleasure.

2168
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,500
Okay, uh...

2169
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:49,500
They would like to speak
to Mr. Conaway.

2170
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,400
Here's the nine-millimetres.

2171
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:56,200
These are the bullets
that are in both Richard

2172
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,700
and in Mark's body right now.

2173
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,100
Move your group outside.

2174
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,900
I'll have somebody here
in five minutes.

2175
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,800
Do me a favour,
don't block the door.

2176
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,500
Just off to the side,
if you would.

2177
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,200
Will go outside and
somebody will come out.

2178
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,400
My name's Laurie McTavish.

2179
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,100
I'm the Vice-president of
Communications for K-Mart.

2180
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:21,600
I'm happy to deliver a statement
on behalf of the company.

2181
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:24,900
What happened in Columbine,
Colorado, was truly tragic

2182
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:27,100
and touched every American.

2183
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,500
We're sorry for the...

2184
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,700
disadvantage to this young man.

2185
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:34,600
K-Mart is phasing out the sale
of handgun ammunition.

2186
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:38,300
The business plan calls
for this to be complete

2187
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:42,000
in the continental U.S.
within the next 90 days.

2188
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,500
Wow! Wow!

2189
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,500
K-Mart representatives met
with Mr. Moore

2190
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,900
and the students from Columbine,
Colorado, yesterday,

2191
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,900
and listened to their concerns
about the product

2192
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,000
carried in K-Mart stores.

2193
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,900
The company committed,
at the end of that meeting,

2194
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,900
that K-Mart would have an answer
for them within a week's time.

2195
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,100
Well, the first thing we want
to do is thank you

2196
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,500
for committing to no longer
selling handgun ammunition

2197
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,400
in your stores.
And within 90 days--

2198
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:11,000
The process will be phased out
within 90 days.

2199
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,500
And after 90 days,
there will be no more selling

2200
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:16,500
of ammunition that can go into
handguns or assault weapons.

2201
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,800
Firearm ammunition, will be...
We will not sell it,

2202
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,800
after 90 days, in our stores.

2203
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,700
- We greatly appreciate that.
- Thank you.

2204
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,900
Thank you very much. Thank you.
That's very brave.

2205
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,700
Thank you. Wow!

2206
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,000
That blows my mind. That's
more than what we asked for.

2207
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,000
- It's remarkable.
- Yeah. Well, like I told you--

2208
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,000
- I didn't think--
- Did you think?

2209
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,000
- No!
- We're like, uh...

2210
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,400
We're just getting ready to...
We're going to the airport.

2211
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,900
The kids from Columbine had
scored an overwhelming victory

2212
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,900
against K-Mart
and it inspired me

2213
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,100
to do something that
I knew I had to do.

2214
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,900
All I needed... was a star map.

2215
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,400
- Hello?
- Mr. Heston?

2216
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,400
- Yeah.
- This is Michael Moore.

2217
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,900
- Yes.
- The film- maker?

2218
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,000
- Yes, of course.
- Yes. How you doing?

2219
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,500
Fine, thank you.

2220
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,700
Listen, I was wondering
if maybe I could talk to you.

2221
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,300
We're making a documentary
about the whole gun issue.

2222
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,200
And I'm a member of the NRA.

2223
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,000
I thought maybe we could talk
a little bit about--

2224
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,800
Tell you what, let me look
at my calendar.

2225
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,500
I may be able to give you
some time tomorrow.

2226
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:45,500
- I have some people here now.
- Okay, well, how can I--

2227
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,900
- Pardon me?
- Hold the phone.

2228
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,600
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

2229
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,500
I can give you a little time
tomorrow morning.

2230
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,400
- I think that's Thursday.
- Yes.

2231
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,000
- Let's say 8:30.
- Eight-thirty in the morning?

2232
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,000
- Yeah. Okay?
- Okay. And just come here?

2233
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,600
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

2234
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,900
Hello?

2235
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,500
Hi. It's Michael Moore here
to see Charlton Heston.

2236
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,500
Okay.

2237
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:32,500
Hi. Good morning.

2238
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,900
- How are you?
- Fine.

2239
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:42,300
Thank you very much
for agreeing to see me.

2240
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,900
He took me out
to his pool-and-tennis house

2241
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,900
so we could have a chat.

2242
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,900
I told him that I was
a lifetime member of the NRA

2243
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,200
and showed him
my membership card.

2244
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,100
Good for you. Well done.

2245
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,100
I assume you have guns
in the house here?

2246
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,900
Indeed I do.
Bad guys take notice!

2247
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,100
So you have them
for protection?

2248
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,400
- Yeah. Sure.
- Have you ever been

2249
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,500
- a victim of crime?
- No. No.

2250
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:17,300
- Never been assaulted or...?
- No.

2251
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,300
No violence toward you,
but you have guns in the house.

2252
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,400
- Loaded.
- They're loaded?

2253
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,900
Well, if you really needed
a weapon for self-defence,

2254
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,900
- you need it loaded.
- Okay, but why...

2255
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,800
why do you need it for
self- defence? Because--

2256
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,800
- I don't.
- Yeah, you've never been

2257
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,900
a victim of crime,
you haven't been assaulted.

2258
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,900
- No, that's true.
- You haven't been, you know...

2259
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,400
Why would you... So why not...
Why don't you unload the gun?

2260
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,800
Because the second amendment
gives me the right

2261
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,900
- to have it loaded.
- I agree.

2262
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,400
I totally agree with that.
I'm just saying... I mean,

2263
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,900
the second amendment gives me--

2264
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,800
Let's say it's
a comfort factor.

2265
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,000
It gives you comfort to know
that there's a loaded gun.

2266
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:54,400
Yeah.

2267
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:57,500
Comfort meaning that it allows
you to relax and feel safe?

2268
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,500
- Not worry about it.
- Not worry, not be afraid.

2269
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,400
And I'm not really, but, uh...

2270
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:05,900
I'm exercising one of the rights
passed on down to me

2271
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:09,000
from those wise, old, dead white
guys that invented this country.

2272
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:12,100
If it was good enough for them,
it's good enough for me.

2273
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,800
But you could still
exercise the right,

2274
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,400
just by having a gun unloaded
and locked away somewhere.

2275
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,700
I choose to have it.

2276
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,400
What sort of strikes me
as interesting is that,

2277
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,400
in other countries, where
they don't have the murder rate,

2278
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,400
the gun-murder rate
that we have, that, uh...

2279
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,400
many people say,

2280
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,400
"Well, that's because
they don't have guns around.

2281
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,400
It's hard to get a gun in
Britain or Germany or whatever."

2282
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,500
But we went to Canada and
there's seven million guns

2283
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,500
- in 10-million homes.
- There won't be very long.

2284
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,100
- But hear me out, though.
- Okay.

2285
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,900
Canada is a nation of hunters,

2286
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,900
millions of guns,

2287
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,900
and yet, they had just
a few murders last year.

2288
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,900
That's it. A country
of 30-million people.

2289
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:51,800
Now, why - here's my question -
why is it that...

2290
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,100
that they've got all these guns
laying around,

2291
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,000
yet they don't kill each other

2292
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,000
at the level that
we kill each other?

2293
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,300
I think American history is...

2294
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,800
uh... has a lot of blood

2295
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,900
- on its hands.
- And Germany history doesn't?

2296
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,800
- No.
- And British history?

2297
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:09,400
- I don't think as much.
- Oh, are you...

2298
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,000
Germans don't have as much,
blood on their hands?

2299
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,500
- Uh, they do, yes.
- The Brits, they ruled the world

2300
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,800
for 300 years
at the barrel of a gun.

2301
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,300
They're all violent people. They
have bad guys, they have crime,

2302
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,800
they have lots of guns--

2303
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,800
Well, it's an interesting
point, which can be explored

2304
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,300
and you're good to explore it
at great lengths,

2305
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,300
but I think that's about all
I have to say on it.

2306
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,300
You don't have any opinion,
though, as to why that is,

2307
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,300
that we are the unique country,
the only country,

2308
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,300
that does this, that kills each
other on this level, with guns?

2309
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:45,300
Well, we have, probably,
more mixed ethnicity

2310
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,800
than other countries,
some other countries.

2311
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,900
You think it's an ethnic thing?

2312
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,700
No, I don't. It's...

2313
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,800
I wouldn't go so far
as to say that.

2314
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:58,300
We had enough problems with
civil rights in the beginning.

2315
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:02,300
It's... But, uh, I have
no answer for that.

2316
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,800
What do you mean, you think
it's a mixed ethnicity?

2317
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,900
I don't understand.

2318
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,900
- You said, "How is it that..."
- That we're unique.

2319
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,100
"So many Americans
kill each other?"

2320
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,200
I don't know that that's true,
but, uh...

2321
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,800
Well, no, you know that.

2322
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,800
We know we have the highest
murder rate with guns.

2323
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,700
It's way higher
than any other country.

2324
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:25,300
The only answer I can give you
is the one I already gave you.

2325
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:28,400
- Which is?
- Which is that we have, uh...

2326
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,300
- Historically--
- ...a history of violence.

2327
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,500
Perhaps more than most
countries. Not more than Russia,

2328
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,800
- not more than Japan or China--
- Not more than Germany.

2329
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,400
Not more than Germany,
but certainly more than Canada.

2330
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:45,300
I come from Flint, Michigan,
and last year,

2331
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,400
a little six-year-old boy
took a gun into a classroom

2332
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,300
and shot and killed a
six-year-old girl. And, uh...

2333
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,800
it was really a tragic thing--

2334
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:56,900
- This was a kid, though.
- A six-year-old, yeah.

2335
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,400
Did you hear about this?

2336
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:01,200
A six-year-old shooting
a six-year-old?

2337
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,800
- Yeah.
- Well, here's my question.

2338
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,800
After that happened,

2339
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,800
you came to Flint
and held a big rally.

2340
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,300
Mm-hm.

2341
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,800
And, you know, I just--

2342
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,400
So did the vice-president.

2343
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:15,100
Yeah, but did you feel it was
being at all insensitive

2344
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,900
to the fact that this community
had just gone through--

2345
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,800
Actually, I wasn't aware
of that at the time we came.

2346
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:24,300
We came and did an
early-morning, uh... rally,

2347
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,200
then went on to wherever
we were going.

2348
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,300
You didn't know at the time,
that this killing had happened?

2349
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,300
- No.
- Had you known, would you have--

2350
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,300
Would I have cancelled
the... uh...

2351
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,200
- Yeah.
- I don't...

2352
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,700
Hard to say.

2353
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,700
It wasn't like it was
already planned.

2354
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,800
I mean, the choice to come there
was made

2355
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,700
after this horrible
killing took place.

2356
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,300
Yeah. Mm-hm.

2357
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:47,300
You know, had you know that,
would you have come?

2358
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,200
I don't know. I have no idea.

2359
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,300
- Maybe not. Maybe not.
- Okay. Thank you.

2360
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,800
You think you'd like to just
maybe apologize to the people

2361
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,700
in Flint for coming and doing
that at that time, or...?

2362
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,700
You want me to apologize...

2363
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,700
me, apologize to the people
in Flint?

2364
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,800
Or the people in Columbine

2365
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,300
for coming after
their horrible tragedy.

2366
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,800
Why do you go to the places
after they have

2367
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:12,300
these horrible tragedies? I'm
a member of your group here--

2368
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,000
Well, I'm afraid
we don't agree on... on that.

2369
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,700
You think it's okay
to just come and show up

2370
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:20,300
- at these events.
- No.

2371
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,300
You don't think it's okay?

2372
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,900
Mr. Heston, just one more thing.

2373
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,900
This is who she is -

2374
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,700
or was. This is her.

2375
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,700
Mr. Heston, please don't leave.

2376
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,500
Mr. Heston, please,
take a look at her.

2377
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:48,200
This is the girl.

2378
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:42,700
I left the Heston estate
atop Beverly Hills

2379
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,800
and walked back
into the real world,

2380
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:48,200
an America living
and breathing in fear...

2381
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:50,200
In your mind,
you imagine somebody

2382
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,200
who might break into your house,
to harm you or your family.

2383
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:56,700
What does that person look like?

2384
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:59,500
You. Her. Him.
The camera guy, anybody.

2385
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,200
Could be a gun in the camera,
I don't know.

2386
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:05,200
Where gun sales were now
at an all-time high...

2387
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:08,200
Can shoot as fast as
Wesson semi-automatic.

2388
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,300
And where, in the end,

2389
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,500
it all comes back to bowling

2390
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,500
for Columbine.

2391
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,200
Three bowling-alley employees
shot to death Sunday night

2392
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,700
at the AMF Broadway Lanes.

2393
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,700
There's nothing I really know.
I really don't know anything.

2394
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,300
- Just that three people died.
- Right.

2395
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,000
In Littleton,
in a bowling alley.

2396
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,700
I'm sorry.

2397
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,200
Yes, it was a glorious time
to be an American.
