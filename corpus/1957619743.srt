00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:04,221
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:18,243
- [Narrator] The following
is based on a true story.

3
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:20,273
Some names have been changed.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,940
(slow paced music)

5
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:37,510
(indistinct chatter)

6
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:56,103
- Ouch, that hurt!

7
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:58,853
I'm telling mom when we get home!

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,160
- Alright, let's keep it down
to a dull roar back there!

9
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,857
- We're just having fun Edward.

10
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:09,086
- Y'all acting like a
barrel full of monkeys.

11
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,505
(kid imitating monkey)

12
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,756
(laughing)

13
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,965
The monkey business gotta stop

14
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,778
or we're staying right here!

15
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,429
- You can't do that.

16
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
(children laughing)

17
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:56,629
- No more monkey business.

18
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,672
I'm the monkey in charge here okay?

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,033
Sit.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,393
Stay.

21
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,229
You too.

22
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,230
(children laughing)

23
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,134
You too.

24
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,403
Okay.

25
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,923
(slow paced music)

26
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,238
- How much did we pay for this one?

27
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,439
- [Blonde] 350.

28
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,419
- I put 180 in so far,

29
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,369
what do you figure?

30
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,843
I say we ask 1,000 firm.

31
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,290
- Alright, that's what, $500 profit?

32
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,541
- [Blonde] If we sell it.

33
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,691
- Split three ways, that's nothing.

34
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,207
- Your folks home?

35
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,503
- I don't know, my grandma is though.

36
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:20,336
Why?

37
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:21,343
- I don't know.

38
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,953
What you gonna do tonight?

39
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:25,044
- I don't know, nothing I guess.

40
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,987
- [Narrator] Your mom and
dad want us home for dinner.

41
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,025
- How much you figure we made this month?

42
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,195
- Not enough.

43
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,345
This isn't working too good.

44
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,945
These things just aren't moving.

45
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,346
- I need some money.

46
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:37,876
I need some money bad.

47
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:38,836
- What are you talking about?

48
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,566
Your parents got more money than God.

49
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:42,567
- Yeah, well my folks have
had so much for so long

50
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,497
that they don't think much of money.

51
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,327
They live like dirt farmers.

52
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,776
- Yeah.

53
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,418
I guess 78 acres of dirt,

54
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:51,161
richest suburb of San Francisco.

55
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:54,799
This place is worth
more than Rhode Island.

56
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,489
- I can hit up my grandma though.

57
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,352
I'd have to lie.

58
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,263
I could do that.

59
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,050
- Maybe if I got some money I could get

60
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,181
my parents off my back.

61
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,161
I'm supposed to be a podiatrist
like dear old dad you know.

62
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,981
- You gonna live for now man.

63
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,832
Risk, daring, it all comes
to the fast and the strong.

64
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,222
That is who makes it in this world.

65
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,392
The bold and the daring.

66
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,216
- Like you and your old cars huh?

67
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:21,005
You're very bold and daring.

68
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,688
(grunting)

69
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,568
- [Jim] What'd you do that for?

70
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:32,401
You okay?

71
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:42,166
- Okay, so the car
thing ain't working out.

72
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:48,221
There's got to be way
to score some big money.

73
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,068
(horn honking)

74
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,961
- Talk about it later, I gotta go.

75
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,719
- Yeah, go home to mommy and daddy.

76
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:06,212
(slow paced music)

77
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,385
- You know Odessa, sometimes
I feel like I've got

78
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:31,815
all a man could ever need.

79
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:35,876
Take a look, it's not much, but it's ours.

80
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,279
Come here my darling Hannah.

81
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,227
We have a beautiful daughter,

82
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,040
and a beautiful grandchild.

83
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:50,008
Yes, and a beautiful wife.

84
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:53,619
- Oh, I told the girls
down at work that if

85
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,959
you ever won the lottery,

86
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,619
you'd probably just buy a new
battery for that old tractor.

87
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:01,140
- Maybe, and a new transmission
for the old school bus.

88
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,460
- Look, Lee's coming by
for Hannah in an hour

89
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,700
and they're gonna stay for dinner.

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,791
Now Hannah, you tell grandpa be sure to

91
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,231
get washed up and ready.

92
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,982
- Hannah, you tell her that
I'll be done in 20 minutes.

93
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,653
- I think it's about time you started

94
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,864
putting your nose to the grindstone Fred.

95
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:25,984
Frankly, you're becoming an embarrassment

96
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,834
and I won't have it.

97
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,465
You've been given everything,

98
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:30,935
now do something with it

99
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,545
instead of squandering it away--

100
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,445
- You were giving everything too.

101
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,926
What do you do?

102
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,286
- What's that supposed to mean?

103
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,056
- You inherited everything from Grandma,

104
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,616
so why are you acting like you earned

105
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,867
everything on your own?

106
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,437
- Don't use that tone with me young man.

107
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:44,777
I've worked.

108
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:47,227
I run this quarry and I run this family.

109
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,261
Fred enough.

110
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:54,262
- You need to prove you're
worthy of our family name.

111
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,269
It's an old name, a proud name.

112
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,410
We've been a part of the
history of this state

113
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,960
since the gold rush and
I won't have my only son

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,271
treat his heritage like the dole.

115
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:09,301
You just seem to have one harebrained,

116
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,622
worthless scheme after another.

117
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,822
(slow paced music)

118
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,929
(horse neighs)

119
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,020
- You're leaving again dad?

120
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,293
- Rodeo up at Calgary.

121
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:03,282
- Can I go?

122
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,521
- No, you got school and you
gotta be man of the house

123
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,354
while I'm gone.

124
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:11,234
Well maybe I don't want to
be the man of the house.

125
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,282
- Times gonna come when
you gotta measure up

126
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:17,042
to being a man whether
you're ready or not.

127
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,593
Life doesn't always wait on ya.

128
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:22,733
Here, why don't you load
up that other horse for me

129
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,334
while I say goodbye to your mom.

130
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:26,608
Go on.

131
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:48,495
(horse neighs)

132
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,641
Whoa whoa Tim!

133
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,491
Come on Tim, you gotta
show that horse who's boss.

134
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:58,324
- [Mom] Jack.

135
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,570
- He's spooked some dad!

136
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,980
- Spooked?

137
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,910
Easy.

138
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,210
- You're being a little
hard on him aren't ya?

139
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,108
- Yeah well maybe you're being
a little too soft on him.

140
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,678
- Come on mom.

141
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,913
- Still think we could
renovate this place?

142
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,287
- Yeah we could.

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,315
But we don't even have
enough for the down payment.

144
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:32,391
- Oh I think my grandma
on cough up the dough.

145
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,095
But think about how much work it is.

146
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,095
I got a better idea.

147
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,009
- What?

148
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:42,257
Use grandma's money, make some big money.

149
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,910
- [Jim] Yeah right, how?

150
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,141
- A movie.

151
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,621
We come up with a story, produce it.

152
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,859
- What do we know about making movies?

153
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,439
- Nothing, who does?

154
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,190
I got a friend at film
school says it's a breeze.

155
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,023
You know what they make.

156
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:03,987
People like stories
about crime and violence.

157
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,171
- I saw this Clint
Eastwood movie last week.

158
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,614
They hijacked this bunch
of kids, it was great.

159
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:11,465
- Kids.

160
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,025
That's really smart.

161
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:19,183
People would pay ransom
right away for kids.

162
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:21,183
- Yeah, but they blew
it in the movie Fred.

163
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,727
- Yeah, yeah, but if you did it right,

164
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,607
really planned it.

165
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,854
See that's where they always screw up.

166
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,605
They're stupid, they don't plan it.

167
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,386
You remember that busload
of kids that crashed?

168
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,229
How upset everyone was?

169
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:42,007
For a bus full of kids you
could get a million dollars.

170
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:42,840
Easy.

171
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,037
- What the heck, two million.

172
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,647
- Three million huh?

173
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,288
- Five million.

174
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:50,871
Five million dollars from
the state of California.

175
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,289
Let's plan it.

176
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,009
See if it can work.

177
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,042
- That's crazy.

178
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,813
- Yeah we are.

179
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,331
But what else you got to do?

180
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:07,294
It's just a game.

181
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,621
See if we can come up with something.

182
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,242
- Come up with what?

183
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,125
A movie on a crime?

184
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:17,102
(ominous music)

185
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:17,936
- A crime.

186
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,336
A perfect crime.

187
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,239
(ominous music)

188
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,797
(slow paced music)

189
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,446
- [Brunette] Just like clockwork.

190
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,876
- You did too!

191
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:43,827
I'm telling mom!

192
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,977
- I got your peanut butter fix for ya.

193
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:46,810
Kisses.

194
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,537
- Hey mom!

195
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,828
- You better not.

196
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,328
- No fighting.

197
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,219
You have homework?

198
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,179
- [Girl] I don't but Peter does!

199
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:58,112
- How would you know anyway?

200
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,473
- Mom, he hit me!

201
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,650
He's been a pest all day!

202
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,483
- She's lying!

203
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,034
She's just trying to get me in trouble!

204
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,461
- Stop it!

205
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,201
I come home from work
and you two start it up,

206
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,622
the both of you, fight fight fight.

207
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,245
Just cool it.

208
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:25,144
- [Fred] All right Jim come
on, you've got enough time.

209
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:26,294
What do you got for me?

210
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,395
- I've looked through hundreds of pages

211
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,095
of County section Maps,

212
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,955
I finally found the perfect place.

213
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:34,915
Chowchilla.

214
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,606
It's remote, it's got
plenty of escape routes,

215
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,919
far from the law, and just the right size.

216
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,510
- Taking this a little bit
serious for a game aren't you?

217
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,578
- This is excellent work Jim.

218
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,038
Attention to detail.

219
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,428
I like it.

220
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,571
How far is this place?

221
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,272
- It's only three hours from here.

222
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,419
- Let's go for a ride.

223
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:01,530
(bell ringing)

224
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,645
This is good.

225
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:31,985
- This is ridiculous.

226
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:33,225
Come on, let's go home.

227
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,126
- Come on, relax, what's the big deal?

228
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,926
Man can you believe this place is only

229
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,529
three hours from Portola Valley?

230
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,137
The kids though.

231
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,277
- Too many kids.

232
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,927
Too many people around here
and way too much traffic.

233
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,368
- Summer school starts in two weeks.

234
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,598
There'll be a lot less kids then.

235
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,208
- Can we get out of here?

236
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,282
You guys are getting a little too serious.

237
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,179
(ominous music)

238
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,695
- We'd have to have him get
pretty far from the school.

239
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,205
- He turns on road 16.

240
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:35,209
Map this on your chart there.

241
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,339
When he goes down road 12, he's
as far from anyone possible.

242
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,057
(indistinct chatter)

243
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,564
- Look at that guy, dumb is a post I bet.

244
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:10,804
- This is the place.

245
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:13,954
- Place for what?

246
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:19,021
- What do you think we've
been cruising this dump for?

247
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,946
We got this thing all
damn near planned out.

248
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:23,137
Don't we?

249
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,945
- Damn near.

250
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,778
Damn near.

251
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:37,389
- Are you in?

252
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,337
'Cause it's a go.

253
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,046
(applauding)

254
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:17,828
- [Narrator] Now shooting down the chute

255
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,828
we've got Johnny Miller!

256
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,532
(loud horn honking)

257
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,295
Okay, Johnny takes his full eight seconds!

258
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:29,786
Nice job cowboy!

259
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,536
That's the way to go!

260
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,556
All righty now, up next we got

261
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,776
Tim Pearson out of chute number four.

262
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,516
He's riding Bambino.

263
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,646
And Tim's representing
the Pearson Farms today!

264
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,813
So good luck to you Timmy!

265
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,942
- Okay son, make me proud.

266
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,805
- Good to go.

267
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,388
(loud ringing)

268
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,110
- [Narrator] Ooh, tough luck there.

269
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,703
Hang in next time there Timmy!

270
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:15,526
(indistinct speaking)

271
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:16,359
- Thanks.

272
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,187
- You're never gonna
win a buckle that way.

273
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:34,075
- I think you did just fine.

274
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,779
You get a buckle from me anytime.

275
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:44,251
(slow paced music)

276
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:21,443
- Okay, we'll wait to
register these things

277
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,145
until just before.

278
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:23,978
- [Rick] Why?

279
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:25,554
- In case anybody gets the license plates,

280
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,944
the information will get
lost in the bureaucracy.

281
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,165
- Alright, we got to
refit these interiors,

282
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,495
and we got to install the CBs,

283
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,171
and you guys have got to get a name

284
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,411
out of the phone book that we
can register these things to.

285
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,266
- We're gonna do all this in a month?

286
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,386
- We gotta finish before
summer school's out.

287
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,636
You got any better ideas?

288
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,517
- Hey, is it safe to do the
work here at your folks?

289
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,917
- Let me worry about that.

290
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,468
Also, I got an old x-ray machine.

291
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:49,328
- An x-ray machine?

292
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:51,928
- Yeah, and some parachutes
and some mannequins too.

293
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:54,497
- Hey Jim.

294
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,266
We're gonna be late for dinner.

295
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,130
- Watch your step squirt.

296
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,051
- I will.

297
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:17,052
- Hey, I didn't know you could talk.

298
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,393
- Bye Tim.

299
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:21,892
- [Children] Ooh!

300
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:27,469

301
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:31,651

305
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:51,420
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

306
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,220
- Alright, here's how I figure it.

307
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,030
The kids, after we
transfer 'em into the vans,

308
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,450
we drive around till we get to the place

309
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,288
where we're gonna hide 'em,

310
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:07,594
and we do have to hide 'em.

311
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:10,061
Where's Rick?

312
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,445
- Mom made him stay at
home, clean his room.

313
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,927
- We're gonna do this Jim, is he in?

314
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,647
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

315
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,197
- He'll do anything I tell him.

316
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:23,437
- Yeah?

317
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,367
I'm telling you,

318
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:28,427
he better.

319
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:31,037
- He will.

320
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:35,196
(loud gun firing)
(glass shattering)

321
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,266
So where could you hide them.

322
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:39,206
I mean, where could you
hold a bunch of kids

323
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,247
until the ransoms delivered?

324
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:42,567
How could you be sure that they're gonna

325
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,467
stay put unless you're there yourself?

326
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,945
- I am way ahead of you.

327
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,197
(loud gun firing)
(glass shattering)

328
00:21:53,197 --> 00:21:56,114
(slow paced music)

329
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:22,493
- Come on back!

330
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:24,921
Come on, come on back!

331
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:27,004
Alright, watch your side.

332
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:30,361
Watch it on the side!

333
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:33,140
Alright good form, good form!

334
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,223
Come on back!

335
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:39,994
Come on back!

336
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,440
- [Narrator] What's the matter darling?

337
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,260
You've been blue.

338
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,480
- It's nothing.

339
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,771
- It's been nothing for three weeks now.

340
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:07,644
Come on honey.

341
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,772
- I hurt Tim's feelings.

342
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,302
- [Mom] I thought you liked him?

343
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:15,712
- I do, he asked me to the movies.

344
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,483
- [Mom] That's nice.

345
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,263
- I couldn't give him an answer.

346
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,863
Bonnie and Wendy were there
and they laughed at him.

347
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,614
- Well you can still say yes if you want.

348
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,025
- He's been avoiding me this whole time

349
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,358
and summer school's almost over anyway.

350
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,106
- You know, sometimes
you feel like you'd never

351
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:37,769
get another chance at anything.

352
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:41,491
But you always do.

353
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,230
Hey, I promise.

354
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:47,631
- Thanks mom.

355
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:55,153
(loud clanking)

356
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:32,264
(creaking)

357
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,456
- [Narrator] What's that?

358
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,356
- The roof!

359
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,954
- Come on Rick, let's get out of here!

360
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:37,787
Get out!

361
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:41,045
Hold on!

362
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,425
Hold up, hold up!

363
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:52,593
The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer!

364
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:56,985
- What's the problem?

365
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:59,210
- The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer.

366
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,650
- Relax.

367
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,940
- Relax?

368
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,040
You go down there, I'm not going in there.

369
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:08,271
- Get my toolbox.

370
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:10,795
Go get some two-by-fours out
of that lumber pile alright.

371
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:22,737
Hurry up!

372
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:34,435
(ominous music)

373
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,388
Strong son of a gun for an old guy.

374
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,148
I'll have to be on him.

375
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,021
All the time.

376
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:08,491
- You know, I'll be glad
when summer school is out

377
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:11,972
so that I can put a little
more time in on this place.

378
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,472
- You've been working it
too hard on both ends.

379
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,326
Maybe you should think about
cutting back on the driving.

380
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,013
- I hate to admit it but

381
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:23,204
those kids are beginning
to get on my nerves.

382
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,767
They're getting sassier
and louder every year.

383
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:30,768
- Well you're getting older every year.

384
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:36,199
- Older am I?

385
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:37,929
Older?

386
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:42,509
Come on, let's wrestle huh?

387
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,509
- No Edward.

388
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:46,726
(laughing)

389
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:02,814
(ominous music)

390
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,579
- [Little Boy] Oh you always get it!

391
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,368
- Nuh uh, you got it yesterday!

392
00:27:21,368 --> 00:27:23,550
- Yeah, right after you
took it from my hand.

393
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,383
My turn!

394
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,501
- No you got it yesterday!

395
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,968
- Would you two stop it?

396
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:30,154
- [Little Boy] Oh she started it!

397
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:31,002
- I got it first!

398
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:32,454
He's gonna take it away from me!

399
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:33,408
- You know what?

400
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,809
I have a good mind to take
you both to the pound.

401
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,059
I don't want to hear another
peep out of either one of you.

402
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,640
- Okay, shut the door.

403
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,473
Perfect.

404
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,560
Get those extra Jerry cans.

405
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:05,341
We are three hours away.

406
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,991
Man I can't taste the adrenaline.

407
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:09,201
This is it!

408
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:10,525
We can't miss!

409
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,112
Come on, let's do it!

410
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,742
We have planned it to
perfection, it is foolproof.

411
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:17,493
- Yes, we're really
gonna do this aren't we?

412
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:18,623
- Yes.

413
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:19,456
- Yes!

414
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:22,704
- Okay, he picks up those
kids at the pool at 4 o'clock,

415
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:23,637
let's move!

416
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,959
You can't back out now.

417
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,363
We're counting on you.

418
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:39,269
You got your gun?

419
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,573
- George Hill here we come.

420
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,692
- Let's go.

421
00:28:58,658 --> 00:28:59,491
Don't bunch up.

422
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,541
One at a time, one at a time, come on.

423
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,945
Alright, here we go.

424
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:05,503
Come on.

425
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:06,495
Get up.

426
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,662
There you are.

427
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:18,432
Alright, keep it down.

428
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,712
- It's almost over!

429
00:29:19,712 --> 00:29:22,583
One more day of summer school!

430
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,981
- [Kids] One more day!

431
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:25,468
One more day!

432
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,202
One more day!

433
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:29,255
- Keep it down back there!

434
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:31,035

436
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:33,851

- [Fred] Right on schedule.

00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:30,054
- We're really gonna do this aren't we?

442
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,083
- Yeah we are.

443
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,538

444
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:35,576
- Man, my head's pounding like crazy.

00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:36,409
- Mine too.

446
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,454

470
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:22,704
- Get in back.

471
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:24,534

472
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,736

Do you want anybody hurt?

Alright.

(screaming)

482
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,351

(ominous music)

484
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:51,833

You're going first, you understand me?

Come on kids, jump down here.

504
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,668
Watch your head.

505
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:29,501
- Where are you taking us?

506
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,672
I need to know!

507
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:31,835
- You sit back and do nothing!

508
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,382
You understand me?

509
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:35,201
Nothing, until I tell you to do it!

510
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:36,101
Let's go!

511
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:36,934

518
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,659
(screaming)

519
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,287
Yes, we did it.

520
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,344
Like clockwork.

521
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,177
4:35.

522
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:40,070
(loud sobbing)

523
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,692
- [Narrator] I'm scared Edward.

524
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:45,316
What are they gonna do to us?

525
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:46,567
- It's alright.

526
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,071
It's some kind of a joke I'm sure.

527
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:50,904
- [Narrator] What are they gonna do to us?

528
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:52,905
- It's not a joke is it?

529
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:57,035
They're going to kill us all aren't they?

530
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,793
- No, no, no, no, no they're not.

531
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:01,411
- What are they gonna do to us?

532
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,670
- [Narrator] I'm scared.

533
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,171
I'm scared Edward.

534
00:36:49,638 --> 00:36:52,089
- At least I can depend on you Wrigley.

535
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:05,935
(solemn music)

536
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,973

537
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:33,911
(sobbing)

538
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,920

539
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,079

540
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,028
Can you hear me?

541
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:52,472
Speak to me, talk to me!

542
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,059
You've got to stop.

543
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:02,713
Get some air back here.

544
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,297

545
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:11,297

546
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:15,237
(ringing)

547
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:18,458
- Superintendent Tatum.

548
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,705
No, we haven't heard anything.

549
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:22,753
Well it's probably a breakdown.

550
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:23,606
Yes you see the drivers
(ringing)

551
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:27,134
are instructed not to leave the bus..

552
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:30,655
Well that doesn't sound like Ed Gray.

553
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:31,875
Well I'll check into it

554
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,961
and I'll get back to you Mrs. Alanzo.

555
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,211
Yes, thank you.

556
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,642
Yes.

557
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:40,147
Superintendent Tatum.

558
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:40,980
No, no.
(ringing)

559
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,160
We think it may be a breakout.

560
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,317
We're checking into it.

561
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:44,867
Yes sir.

562
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,123
Superintendent Tatum.

563
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,290
(ringing)

564
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:50,502
- Hello.

565
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,335
- [Narrator] Is Edward home yet?

566
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:52,479
- No he's not.

567
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,100
He was supposed to be
here to bail hay but--

568
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,433
(dial tone)

569
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:19,796
- I couldn't find the bus on his route.

570
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:23,324
- [Narrator] What do you mean?

571
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,434
- What do you mean?

572
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:25,864
- Ed's bus.

573
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,714
Couldn't find it.

574
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:28,945
We covered the route twice.

575
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:32,305
- I've got my other two
men looking everywhere.

576
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:34,389
Expanding out from the original route.

577
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:38,826
Right now, it's nowhere to be seen.

578
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:40,177
- Nowhere?

579
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,697
What do you mean nowhere?

580
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:43,627
It's a big yellow bus.

581
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:45,047
Where is it?

582
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,148
Where's my babies?

583
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,371
Where's our kids?

584
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:57,662
(coughing)

585
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,523
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, we're almost there.

586
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:17,496
It's gonna be okay.

587
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:20,153
- Almost where?

588
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:20,986
Back home?

589
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:24,682
- We'll sing a song.

590
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:26,030
♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪

591
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,698
- But I'm not happy.

592
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,461
- Then we'll sing if you're sad

593
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,107
and you know it clap your hands.

594
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:36,592
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

595
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:41,593
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

596
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:44,114
♪ If you're sad and you know it ♪

597
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:46,495
♪ Then your face will surely show it ♪

598
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:51,495
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

599
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:03,333
- [Narrator] We've got it.

600
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,919
It's in Berenda Slough
off road 14 and a half.

601
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,869
I don't see anybody there though, over.

602
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,991
(sirens blaring)

603
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:33,699
- It's the bus, they found the bus.

604
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:37,179
The kids, the kids are gone.

605
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:42,489
(ominous music)

606
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:09,925
(coughing)

607
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:15,454
- It smells.

608
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:17,753
It's making me sick.

609
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:19,886
- Gasoline, they're refilling the tanks.

610
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,160
- I'm gonna get sick.

611
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:28,631
- Alright.

612
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,251
Come here.

613
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,084
Come here.

614
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:34,579
- Edward.

615
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:38,701
Edward, I have to pee.

616
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:39,534
- [Kids] Me too.

617
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:40,814
- Just go ahead and do
what you've done before.

618
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:42,715
Go ahead, go ahead and do it.

619
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:43,548
Do it.

620
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,381
(loud banging)

621
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:45,852
- Hey!

622
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:47,935
I want it quiet in there!

623
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,367
- [Narrator] Mommy, I wanna go home.

624
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,883
- A doll, nothing else.

625
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,643
Not a footprint, not a trace.

626
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:24,407
- Les, I've got a faint tire track here.

627
00:43:25,324 --> 00:43:26,157
- Shoot it.

628
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:29,017
Yeah.

629
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:32,885
- Tire prints show a lot of weight.

630
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:40,237
- Looks like another set of wheels

631
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:41,687
got stuck a little over here.

632
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:44,897
- You think the kids might not have been

633
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:46,081
transferred into another bus?

634
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,618
- [Les] I think we're talking vans.

635
00:43:48,618 --> 00:43:50,131
Small delivery types maybe.

636
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:56,385
(ominous music)

637
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,167
(faint crying)

638
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:22,616
- Let's get to work.

639
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:47,921
Okay, let's do it.

640
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,277
You, get out.

641
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:54,689
Come on, come on, get out.

642
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:06,446
Take your clothes off.

643
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,334
Take your clothes off.

644
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:21,276
The pants.

645
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:23,847
Take the pants off.

646
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:31,835
Come on, come on hurry up.

647
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,316
Get down.

648
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:38,426
- What is this?

649
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:40,947
Hey, just what do you fellas want?

650
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,097
Listen, those kids are
suffocating in there.

651
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,727
They're dying of thirst.

652
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:46,578
They're sitting in their own waste.

653
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,591
- Get down the hole, now.

654
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:01,030
- It works.

655
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:15,678
(screaming)

656
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,973
- Give me a piece your clothing.

657
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:22,474
All he's got is a shirt.

658
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:25,464
- We got to get a piece
from each kid, remember.

659
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:26,297
Give me your glasses.

660
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,611
- What's your name?

661
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:29,682
- Ricardo, Ricardo Alanzo.

662
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:31,785
- How old?

663
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:32,875
- Eight.

664
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,709
Are you gonna kill me?

665
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,762
- Maybe, give me your glasses.

666
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,159
- I need 'em to see.

667
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,945
- [Fred] Give me your glasses.

668
00:46:39,945 --> 00:46:41,445
- Here, take them.

669
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:44,754
- What are you doing!

670
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,006
Go on, down in there.

671
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:55,673
- [Jim] He's got a
flashlight in there okay.

672
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:02,302
(screaming)

673
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,740
What's your name?

674
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,573
- Peter Rogers.

675
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:10,508
- [Jim] How old?

676
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:11,892
- Nine.

677
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:14,402
- Alright, just give him your shirt.

678
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:16,050
Give it to him.

679
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,608
Go on, go on, go on.

680
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:37,760
Come on!

681
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:41,937
- [Jim] What's your name?

682
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:43,227
- Tim Pearson.

683
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,227
- This is tough guy.

684
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:46,571
Give me your belt tough guy.

685
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,251
Give me your belt.

686
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:51,387
- No I'm not gonna give you my belt.

687
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:53,656
No, no my mother gave it to me.

688
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:54,739
Let go of me.

689
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,280
- Oh look, we got the champ here.

690
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,433
Down the hole champ.

691
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,125
(screaming)

692
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:20,344
(indistinct chattering)

693
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:27,094
- I think Sheriff Holman's here.

694
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:29,037
Sheriff Holman, he's here.

695
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:30,153
- What took him so long?

696
00:48:30,153 --> 00:48:30,986
- I don't know.

697
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:31,819
He'll be here any second now

698
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:32,743
and I'm sure he'll have
something to tell us.

699
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,646
- Oh there.

700
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:34,926
- There she is.

701
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,046
Where's that damn husband of yours?

702
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,618
- What?

703
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:39,452
- [Narrator] Jack don't.

704
00:48:39,452 --> 00:48:40,517
- Where is he?

705
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,207
He was always a little strange
as far as I was concerned.

706
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:44,737
- What are you saying Jack?

707
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:47,478
My Edward would never do
anything to harm a child.

708
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:50,278
Why he's driven you to
school and your children.

709
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:52,109
- Yeah, well you don't have a kid missing.

710
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,709
You don't know how we feel.

711
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:54,949
- Oh yes I do.

712
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:56,779
I've got my husband missing.

713
00:48:56,779 --> 00:48:59,860
And he's as good and
decent as any man alive.

714
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,750
And you all better just pray to God

715
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,784
how lucky you are that those
children are with Edward.

716
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:09,592
- [Jack] There he is.

717
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:12,905
- Please, I have a statement.

718
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,293
I've just been informed that the

719
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:18,333
President of the United
States has dispatched

720
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,424
50 FBI agents to Chowchilla.

721
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:22,964
- What about you?

722
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,124
What are you doing?

723
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:26,607
- I know this is no ease to some of you,

724
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:29,105
but we and the federal government

725
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:32,185
are about to commence
with the biggest manhunt

726
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:33,976
in California history.

727
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:36,105
- What have you found out?

728
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,906
They've been gone for eight hours.

729
00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:38,739
Why?

730
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:41,580
Why have they taken our children?

731
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:43,450
Why?

732
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,388
- We're working with everything we have.

733
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,286
- [Narrator] They're doing nothing.

734
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:53,705
- Why hasn't anything happening?

735
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:55,720
- He'll be safe.

736
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,887
He'll be fine.

737
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:00,001
(screaming)

738
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:02,501
- [Narrator] I don't wanna go!

739
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,809
- Sally, how many more
are your in your van?

740
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,287
- Just me and Wendy.

741
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:09,746
Where's my brother?

742
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:11,079
- I'm over here!

743
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:13,489
- [Edward] Come on Wendy.

744
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:16,240
- Edward, don't let them do this!

745
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:19,954
(screaming)

746
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:40,958
- [Narrator] Watch out!

747
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,271
- Go go go.

748
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,604
(loud thud)

749
00:50:45,931 --> 00:50:48,598
(ominous music)

750
00:51:00,243 --> 00:51:01,795
- You'll be alright.

751
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:03,713
We're gonna be alright.

752
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:10,522
(loud thudding)

753
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,855
(screaming)

754
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,387
- Hold up hold up, what are you doing?

755
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:18,220
It's not enough.

756
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,603
- Right, the plates, the batteries,

757
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:22,685
we've got almost 400 pounds on here.

758
00:51:22,685 --> 00:51:23,754
I think it's enough.

759
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:25,774
- Do as I tell you.

760
00:51:25,774 --> 00:51:27,141
- Fred, it's enough.

761
00:51:32,738 --> 00:51:33,739
- Better be.

762
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:36,366
It better be.

763
00:51:46,377 --> 00:51:49,044
(ominous music)

764
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:52,920
(loud thudding)

765
00:51:56,214 --> 00:52:01,215
- It's okay, it's alright.

766
00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:41,514
- [Narrator] I wanna go home.

767
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:45,251
- Edward, Edward look here.

768
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:48,068
Edward look here.

769
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:56,479
What is it?

770
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:58,020
- Air.

771
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,993
Some sort of fan system for fresh air.

772
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,373
Sounds weak.

773
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:05,861
Yeah it is weak.

774
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,053
(screaming)

775
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,980
(creaking)

776
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:23,737
Get back!

777
00:53:36,626 --> 00:53:38,746
- [Rick] Is that a cop?

778
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:40,534
Oh my god, Jim there's
a cop right behind us.

779
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:41,820
- [Fred] Shut up!

780
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:43,750
Just stay cool.

781
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:59,950
- Can't stop can we?

782
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,623
We couldn't just let them go could we?

783
00:54:02,466 --> 00:54:04,091
- Just stay cool.

784
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:05,234
- Wait, wait.

785
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:10,552
We'll wait until the morning.

786
00:54:10,552 --> 00:54:11,802
We'll call in the ransom.

787
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:15,873
I still think five millions the best.

788
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,626
- [Narrator] I'm scared.

789
00:54:30,075 --> 00:54:31,843
- [Narrator] Water!

790
00:54:31,843 --> 00:54:33,139
- [Tim] Edward, there's food in here!

791
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,244
Get out the water!

792
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:38,184
(indistinct yelling)

793
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:39,340
- Stay back!

794
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,173
Calm down!

795
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:45,146
Stop, get back!

796
00:54:45,146 --> 00:54:47,158
This has to be rationed!

797
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,401
You have to share, do you
know what share means?

798
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,149
We've got to share this!

799
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:55,379
Now we don't know how long...

800
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,571
All right.

801
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:57,405
- [Tim] Don't step on that.

802
00:54:57,405 --> 00:54:58,366
- Okay line up.

803
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:00,142
Line up like you're doing
waiting for the bus.

804
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:01,725
All of you line up.

805
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:08,301
(ringing)

806
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:14,101
(indistinct chatter)

807
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:30,080
- Les, there's 200 press types out there.

808
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,425
This one woman from from New York City

809
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:33,489
just took a cap from LA to get here.

810
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:35,756
A 200-mile cab ride.

811
00:55:35,756 --> 00:55:36,996
She wants to report.

812
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:38,047
- Yeah?

813
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:39,080
To report what?

814
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,347
Kids have been gone 18
hours and no message.

815
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:42,397
Why don't think call?

816
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,625
(busy signal)

817
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:55,078
- Man.

818
00:55:57,497 --> 00:56:02,314
There's not a phone in
Chowchilla that's not busy.

819
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:04,001
- How're we supposed to phone in a ransom

820
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:05,951
if all the phones are busy man?

821
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:06,991
- Try again.

822
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:09,542
- We've been trying to get
through for three hours.

823
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:25,228
(coughing)

824
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:33,276
- The airs getting awfully
thin in here Edward.

825
00:56:33,276 --> 00:56:37,119
I mean that fan's starting to get slower.

826
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:39,900
- Yeah.

827
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,690
I've been watching it for quite a while.

828
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:50,585
- What are we gonna do when it quits?

829
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:52,359
What are we gonna do if it quits Edward?

830
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:55,713
- Hold on now, none of
that you understand?

831
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:56,796
None of that.

832
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,890
I'm gonna need your help.

833
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:01,723
You understand?

834
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:03,527
Good.

835
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:11,612
We've been here for about

836
00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:12,825
almost 14 hours.

837
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,573
We got to get out.

838
00:57:15,573 --> 00:57:17,759
- [Tim] How are we gonna do that Edward?

839
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:18,863
- I can help.

840
00:57:18,863 --> 00:57:20,383
I'm little but let me help.

841
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:25,347
- Yeah yeah yeah.

842
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:30,138
I tell you what.

843
00:57:31,098 --> 00:57:32,725
We want to take the mattresses

844
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:35,526
and pile them up.

845
00:57:35,526 --> 00:57:37,608
Okay squirt, you're gonna help.

846
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,145
Help pile up the mattresses over here.

847
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:40,645
Come on, let's go.

848
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:44,612
- [Tim] Hey, come on get up.

849
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:47,446
We're gonna move these mattresses.

850
00:57:50,953 --> 00:57:53,620
Let's go, we're gonna move this.

851
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,526
Let's move it over here.

852
00:57:58,549 --> 00:58:00,716
(ringing)

853
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:07,180
- [Reporter] Mrs. Rogers, can
you tell us about your kids?

854
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,801
- They're just kids.

855
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,025
Cats and dogs.

856
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:14,335
I miss them so much I could die.

857
00:58:18,323 --> 00:58:19,973
How could anyone do such a thing?

858
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:22,987
They're just children.

859
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:31,178
If whoever out there is watching,

860
00:58:33,446 --> 00:58:34,279
please,

861
00:58:36,376 --> 00:58:37,439
my babies.

862
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,660
Please don't hurt my babies.

863
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:45,937
(loud sobbing)

864
00:58:45,937 --> 00:58:46,851
- Hold on honey, hold on.

865
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:50,371
- [Mrs. Rogers] I'm sorry.

866
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:54,876
(coughing)

867
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:17,276
- I can't do it.

868
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,086
We need something, a crowbar or something.

869
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,673
That's would do it.

870
00:59:23,604 --> 00:59:25,434
That's what we need.

871
00:59:25,434 --> 00:59:26,835
- [Tim] Fine I'll get it.

872
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:27,668
- No, no, no.

873
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:28,501
- [Tim] It'll work.

874
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:29,715
- The roof.

875
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:31,055
- Edward we need, we need it--

876
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:31,905
- Don't touch it.

877
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:41,187
It could bring down the whole roof.

878
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:43,287
Kids, kids, get back.

879
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:44,467
Get back against the trailer.

880
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:45,920
Way back.

881
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,960
Get back of the trailer,
back of the trailer.

882
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,377
Come on, come on.

883
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:52,582
Get back of the trailer.

884
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,291
That's it.

885
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:01,660
Let's get it up.

886
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,805
Get it up, that's it.

887
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:06,055
(scraping)

888
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:13,256
(suspenseful music)

889
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:31,650
Come on.

890
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:40,239
Give me that.

891
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:57,694
It moved a bit.

892
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,483
You see that?

893
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:05,124
- We gotta get back there Jim.

894
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:12,252
What if something happens to those kids?

895
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,302
- Nothing's gonna--

896
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,552
- Jim, you were in there!

897
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:17,853
And that roof could
collapse at any second!

898
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:19,443
- Don't go chicken on us.

899
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:20,957
Fred finds out he'll be mad.

900
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:24,717
- You know, I never really
dreamed we'd do this.

901
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:32,145
Did you hear those kids screaming Jim?

902
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:33,336
Did you?

903
01:01:33,336 --> 01:01:34,259
- They're kids.

904
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,626
They'll get over it.

905
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:37,459
They're probably--

906
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,916
- Jim, have you been watching the news!

907
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:42,347
The whole federal government's involved!

908
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:45,148
There's reporters from all
over the world in Chowchilla!

909
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:47,441
- Settle down damn it.

910
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:50,408
It is perfect.

911
01:01:50,408 --> 01:01:51,709
It is perfect!

912
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,359
It has been pulled off perfectly.

913
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:56,556
- The hell it is.

914
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,583
Perfect.

915
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:04,211
- Okay.

916
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:07,041
Alright, we'll take
them some food later on.

917
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:07,874
Not now.

918
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:09,712
Not until it's after dark.

919
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:11,305
It's too dangerous until then.

920
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:21,024
(coughing)

921
01:02:21,024 --> 01:02:22,932
- Sally give me your hand.

922
01:02:22,932 --> 01:02:23,765
Here.

923
01:02:25,765 --> 01:02:26,599
You got it?

924
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:27,432
- Uh huh.

925
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:36,719
- Put that up.

926
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:56,551
- Yeah they put something on top of this.

927
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,010
Feels like a battery.

928
01:03:03,264 --> 01:03:04,097
A big one.

929
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,740
It's coming.

930
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:13,035
Little by little it's coming.

931
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:17,876
- Here Edward.

932
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:48,988
(creaking)

933
01:03:48,988 --> 01:03:51,009
- [Mrs. Rogers] Whoever
is out there watching,

934
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:54,219
please, please don't hurt my babies.

935
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:56,372
- Ugh, turn off that TV.

936
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,522
I can't hear anymore
of that terrible news.

937
01:04:00,522 --> 01:04:02,706
Those poor children.

938
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:03,841
Isn't that awful?

939
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,071
- It's tragic.

940
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,251
It's terrible, it's just terrible.

941
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:08,875
- Who could do such a thing.

942
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,462
- This is what society's coming to.

943
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:14,883
- [Narrator] The police
await more reinforcements

944
01:04:14,883 --> 01:04:16,832
from the FBI as the manhunt

945
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:18,986
continues throughout the area.

946
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:20,226
Live from Chowchilla.

947
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,378
- [Mom] You're not eating much Rick.

948
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:33,336
- I'm just not hungry mom.

949
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,366
- You look tired too dear.

950
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:36,206
You get enough rest?

951
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,769
- Probably too much rest.

952
01:04:38,757 --> 01:04:40,577
I want you boys to start
doing more around here

953
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:42,227
to help your mother.

954
01:04:42,227 --> 01:04:43,177
Is that understood?

955
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:45,011
- Yes.

956
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:49,148
Come on Rick, we gotta
drive over to Fred's.

957
01:04:49,148 --> 01:04:51,559
- Fred, that young man.

958
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,369
He's inherited everything from his family

959
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,069
except their brains if you ask me.

960
01:04:56,585 --> 01:04:58,763
- Are you sure you're
feeling all right darling?

961
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:01,160
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

962
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,933
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

963
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,350
Can I be excused?

964
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:09,378
- Excuse me.

965
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:26,639
(faint whirring)

966
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:02,624
- Get 'em on the ground.

967
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:04,664
Be careful, be careful.

968
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:07,664
It could still have some acid in it.

969
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:32,212
Alright, be careful.

970
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:36,496
- Edward, Edward, some of the little kids

971
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:37,846
are fainting from the heat.

972
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,524
(solemn music)

973
01:06:47,002 --> 01:06:48,002
- All right.

974
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:50,799
All right.

975
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,446
Here, dampen this with water.

976
01:06:56,189 --> 01:06:58,270
You dampen this with water

977
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:01,030
and then wipe their faces with it.

978
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,384
- But the water is going fast.

979
01:07:03,384 --> 01:07:05,601
- It's okay, you just do what I told you.

980
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:06,478
Go ahead now.

981
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,231
Come on.

982
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:13,647
(solemn music)

983
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:32,447
(loud banging)

984
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:19,079
(solemn music)

985
01:08:33,241 --> 01:08:35,080
We're done for kid.

986
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,663
I'm telling you we're done for.

987
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:43,617
- No we're not.

988
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:44,451
No you're not.

989
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,284
We're not done for Edward.

990
01:08:45,284 --> 01:08:46,808
Listen to me, we're not done for.

991
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:47,793
Now don't give up.

992
01:08:47,793 --> 01:08:49,225
We're gonna do it Edward alright.

993
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,027
You get up Edward, right now you get up!

994
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:52,944
You get up.

995
01:08:55,456 --> 01:08:56,374
You get up.

996
01:08:57,744 --> 01:08:59,164
You get up.

997
01:08:59,164 --> 01:09:02,247
You get up Edward, don't you do this!

998
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:08,101
- [Jim] Man, what if they
can trace my handwriting?

999
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:10,115
- They won't?

1000
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:14,403
We have to write a note.

1001
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:15,423
We can't get through on the phone's,

1002
01:09:15,423 --> 01:09:18,073
all the phones are busy,
we can't get through.

1003
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:19,393
- That's not how you spell ransom.

1004
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:20,944
R-A-N-S-O-M?

1005
01:09:20,944 --> 01:09:21,874
- Yeah.

1006
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:22,954
- No, there's an E at the end.

1007
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:24,624
- No there isn't.

1008
01:09:24,624 --> 01:09:26,114
- Sign the note Beelzebub.

1009
01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:27,125
The name of the devil.

1010
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,935
That will really throw them off.

1011
01:09:28,935 --> 01:09:30,235
- How you spell Beelzebub?

1012
01:09:31,615 --> 01:09:36,149
- B-E-A-L-S-A bub okay?

1013
01:09:43,788 --> 01:09:44,715
- Alright, "To whom it may concern,

1014
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:45,955
"your bus has been kidnapped.

1015
01:09:45,955 --> 01:09:47,375
"We demand five million dollars in ransom

1016
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,735
"to be put into suitcases.

1017
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:50,746
"Use old bills, use a CHP plane,

1018
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:51,639
"drop off the...

1019
01:09:52,486 --> 01:09:53,319
"We are Beelzebub."

1020
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:54,152
This is great.

1021
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:55,029
This is good.

1022
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,480
- That's good, and then what?

1023
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:01,093
- Okay, you guys will go
up on top of the mountain.

1024
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,061
No wait, Jim you'll go
up on top of the mountain

1025
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:06,151
and you'll hang out by those blinkers.

1026
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:08,502
You have to hijack a private plane.

1027
01:10:08,502 --> 01:10:10,822
We'll throw out the
dummies with the parachutes

1028
01:10:10,822 --> 01:10:12,142
and then you'll jump out later

1029
01:10:12,142 --> 01:10:14,142
over that airstrip at the mountain base.

1030
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:16,843
The plane will be on autopilot.

1031
01:10:16,843 --> 01:10:18,133
They'll be tracking it on radar

1032
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:19,620
but no one will be aboard.

1033
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:23,854
- The note Fred.

1034
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:25,304
- What, the note the note, it's perfect,

1035
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,137
it's fine, it's great.

1036
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:27,805
Don't worry about the note.

1037
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:28,905
- If we're gonna give it to the governor,

1038
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:31,355
I mean, what, are we gonna just walk up

1039
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:32,976
and hand it to him?

1040
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:34,829
How are we gonna deliver the note?

1041
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:40,337
- We'll get it there.

1042
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:42,380
We'll get it there.

1043
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:53,094
(crickets chirping)

1044
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:56,806
(coughing)

1045
01:10:58,973 --> 01:11:01,648
- [Narrator] My feet are sore.

1046
01:11:01,648 --> 01:11:04,445
- Listen, listen, I need your help okay?

1047
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:05,278
Listen you get up.

1048
01:11:05,278 --> 01:11:07,467
Ricardo you get up.

1049
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:10,081
Get up, you be careful.

1050
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:11,740
Be careful alright.

1051
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,657
Be careful.

1052
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:15,231
Ricardo right here, I need you right here.

1053
01:11:15,231 --> 01:11:16,886
I need you to be shining this alright?

1054
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:19,094
Be careful.

1055
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:21,781
Hold this up.

1056
01:11:23,331 --> 01:11:24,914
Be careful alright.

1057
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:33,944
- [Narrator] Let's get this down.

1058
01:11:35,704 --> 01:11:38,310
- We can do something with this.

1059
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:41,227
(slow paced music)

1060
01:12:35,704 --> 01:12:36,537
Edward!

1061
01:12:40,253 --> 01:12:41,086
Edward!

1062
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:48,125
(faint buzzing)

1063
01:12:51,831 --> 01:12:54,248
(screeching)

1064
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:58,524
- Edward.

1065
01:12:59,782 --> 01:13:02,451
Edward, one of the fans stopped.

1066
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:03,624
Help help us.

1067
01:13:12,099 --> 01:13:12,932
- Edward!

1068
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:15,850
Edward!

1069
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:27,476
(solemn music)

1070
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:38,369
I got some light.

1071
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,033
(screaming)

1072
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:04,971
- It's alright.

1073
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,578
- [Ricardo] Let me help.

1074
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,711
- But be careful.

1075
01:14:16,711 --> 01:14:17,544
Come on.

1076
01:14:20,135 --> 01:14:22,371
- [Narrator] What's happening?

1077
01:14:22,371 --> 01:14:24,194
- [Rick] Are we going
back there now or what?

1078
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:25,854
- [Jim] Relax Rick.

1079
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:27,495
- Relax?

1080
01:14:27,495 --> 01:14:30,225
Jim there's 26 kids in there.

1081
01:14:30,225 --> 01:14:31,775
He leaves enough food for five.

1082
01:14:33,296 --> 01:14:35,486
- We can't go back there now.

1083
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:36,836
We got to send in the note.

1084
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,970
- Send the note to who?

1085
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:43,390
What are we, we walk up
and hand it to some cop?

1086
01:14:48,968 --> 01:14:49,868
That's real smart.

1087
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:52,272
A real work of genius.

1088
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:55,172
Perfect crime.

1089
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:04,801
I'm just saying we got
to go back there now.

1090
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,934
- We will, later.

1091
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:09,432
You think I want them to die?

1092
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:13,105
They're worth nothing dead.

1093
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,726
- You go through, you look around.

1094
01:15:32,726 --> 01:15:34,096
But be careful.

1095
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,126
Make sure that there's nobody around.

1096
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:36,959
Okay?

1097
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:16,155
Did you see anyone?

1098
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,603
- [Tim] No, I don't see anyone.

1099
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:18,436
- You sure?

1100
01:16:18,436 --> 01:16:20,539
- [Tim] Yes I'm sure.

1101
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:22,402
- Well we're getting out.

1102
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:23,298
We're getting out.

1103
01:16:23,298 --> 01:16:24,965
- We're getting out.

1104
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,539
- We're getting out of here.

1105
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:29,775
We're getting out of here kids.

1106
01:16:29,775 --> 01:16:30,834
Hurry up, come on.

1107
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:32,332
We're going home.

1108
01:16:32,332 --> 01:16:34,224
We're going home, come on.

1109
01:16:34,224 --> 01:16:35,847
Come on, let's go.

1110
01:16:35,847 --> 01:16:38,348
(light music)

1111
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:45,762
Okay.

1112
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:56,463
The monkeys coming up next.

1113
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,580
They gave their name
on the way going down.

1114
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,346
Let 'em give their name
on the way going up.

1115
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:03,481
Say your name Peter.

1116
01:17:03,481 --> 01:17:05,319
- Peter, Peter Rogers.

1117
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:06,527
- That's right.

1118
01:17:06,527 --> 01:17:07,694
Come on Wendy.

1119
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:09,645
Say your name.

1120
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:10,978
- [Wendy] Wendy.

1121
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,573
- [Narrator] Julie Smith.

1122
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:31,184
- [Narrator] Kylie Spencer.

1123
01:17:54,486 --> 01:17:55,653
- Come on Sal.

1124
01:17:56,501 --> 01:17:57,761
Come on.

1125
01:17:57,761 --> 01:17:58,594
Jump up.

1126
01:18:05,456 --> 01:18:08,374
(slow paced music)

1127
01:18:28,822 --> 01:18:29,838
- [Narrator] Where are we Edward?

1128
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:38,936
- [Narrator] It sure doesn't
look much like Chowchilla.

1129
01:18:39,037 --> 01:18:40,187
- It sure doesn't.

1130
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:44,428
No, I don't know where we are,

1131
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:47,628
but I want you all to stick together.

1132
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:49,358
Now stick together.

1133
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:50,849
Come on, follow me.

1134
01:18:53,715 --> 01:18:56,383
(ominous music)

1135
01:19:35,673 --> 01:19:37,090
Come on, come on.

1136
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,320
Shh, I see a car.

1137
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,352
Hide, come over here.

1138
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:45,013
Come over here, come on.

1139
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,846
Get moving get moving.

1140
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:56,910
Hey!

1141
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:57,743
Hey!

1142
01:19:58,668 --> 01:19:59,974
Hey!

1143
01:19:59,974 --> 01:20:01,367
Hey you!

1144
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:02,201
Hey hey!

1145
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:06,473
(children shouting)

1146
01:20:23,547 --> 01:20:24,380
Hey wait.

1147
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:35,026
(melancholy music)

1148
01:20:40,005 --> 01:20:42,063
- They've been found.

1149
01:20:42,063 --> 01:20:43,563
All of them.

1150
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:44,814
Safe and sound.

1151
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,581
- No no no no, there's
plenty of weight on top,

1152
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:03,681
they'll never get out.

1153
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:08,075
I'd kill ya.

1154
01:21:09,878 --> 01:21:10,895
- I can't believe it.

1155
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:12,975
This is crazy.

1156
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:17,433
- You're coming with me?

1157
01:21:17,433 --> 01:21:18,266
- Yeah.

1158
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:21,277
I can't believe it.

1159
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:25,194
- All right I'm gonna go north to Canada.

1160
01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:26,178
You guys go south.

1161
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:29,138
- I'm not going.

1162
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:31,736
- You gonna stay?

1163
01:21:32,936 --> 01:21:34,836
That's good, you stay here.

1164
01:21:34,836 --> 01:21:35,806
You get rid of everything.

1165
01:21:35,806 --> 01:21:37,449
You get rid of all the evidence.

1166
01:21:39,212 --> 01:21:40,650
- I don't believe this.

1167
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:42,717
- They got nothing though.

1168
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:44,768
They don't have a clue, they got nothing!

1169
01:21:45,808 --> 01:21:47,461
We have contingency plans.

1170
01:21:49,158 --> 01:21:51,012
- What contingency plans?

1171
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:55,810
- I've got to talk to mom.

1172
01:21:59,018 --> 01:22:01,601
(solemn music)

1173
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:15,296
- Tell them,

1174
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:16,810
tell them that I'm sorry.

1175
01:22:19,276 --> 01:22:22,057
I don't want them to think
that they failed with us.

1176
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:29,135
I'm sorry Rick.

1177
01:22:39,427 --> 01:22:42,427
- Tell me that this is just a dream.

1178
01:22:46,374 --> 01:22:51,375
(sirens blaring)
(applauding)

1179
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,137
- I love you.

1180
01:24:04,137 --> 01:24:05,720
I love you so much.

1181
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:39,766
(coughing)

1182
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,876
- I don't know how they
stayed alive down there.

1183
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:47,841
It was like a sewer.

1184
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:54,089
- Trailer was bought by one
Frederick Woods the fourth.

1185
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,389
- [Narrator] That's the
name of the quarry owner.

1186
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:57,721
- Yeah that's right, his son.

1187
01:24:57,721 --> 01:25:00,041
A very wealthy son from Portola Valley.

1188
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,516
We're running a check on him now.

1189
01:25:01,516 --> 01:25:02,681
- Not too many kids from Portola Valley

1190
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:03,861
have rap sheets on them.

1191
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:04,694
- This one did.

1192
01:25:04,694 --> 01:25:07,181
Fred Woods prior, tampering with vehicles.

1193
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:08,732
And he had accomplices.

1194
01:25:08,732 --> 01:25:11,162
Two other kids James
and Richard Schoenfeld.

1195
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:12,482
- [Narrator] Really?

1196
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:15,013
- Pull the mug shots and
release them to the press.

1197
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:17,886
I want everyone in the country
looking for these bastards.

1198
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:26,646
- Oh my god.

1199
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,067
You didn't Ricky.

1200
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:36,982
- I did it.

1201
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:39,662
- My god.

1202
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:43,262
And Jim?

1203
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:47,554
- Jim too.

1204
01:25:56,988 --> 01:25:57,821
- Oh.

1205
01:26:02,286 --> 01:26:04,453
(sobbing)

1206
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,407
- What should I do mom?

1207
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:39,840
- [Father] Tim!

1208
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,190
Tim get on out here.

1209
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:46,601
- [Tim] Yeah?

1210
01:26:48,058 --> 01:26:51,709
- You lost that buckle
your mama made for you huh?

1211
01:26:51,709 --> 01:26:52,542
- Yes sir.

1212
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:55,477
I mean sorta.

1213
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:58,490
I mean, I mean, I mean sorta the guys--

1214
01:26:58,490 --> 01:26:59,413
- It's yours son.

1215
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:04,384
Edward told me what
you did down there and,

1216
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,075
and you're more a man than I'll ever be.

1217
01:27:12,017 --> 01:27:13,017
This is yours champ.

1218
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,486
- How'd it get started?

1219
01:27:31,486 --> 01:27:34,099
- Money, a game, a joke.

1220
01:27:35,106 --> 01:27:36,969
That's how the whole thing got started.

1221
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:40,367
- That's where the idea came from?

1222
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:42,000
- It's just a crazy idea.

1223
01:27:42,847 --> 01:27:44,668
I never thought we'd really do anything.

1224
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:46,841
And then, then Fred comes up.

1225
01:27:48,195 --> 01:27:50,956
"Let's do some preliminary stuff.

1226
01:27:50,956 --> 01:27:51,956
"That wouldn't hurt.

1227
01:27:52,866 --> 01:27:54,416
"Buy a trailer and stuff."

1228
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,490
Now he says you won't be taken alive.

1229
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,834
(solemn music)

1230
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,891
(sirens blaring)

1231
01:28:33,496 --> 01:28:36,579
(indistinct yelling)

1232
01:29:00,311 --> 01:29:02,979
(ominous music)

1233
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:12,388
(slow paced music)

1234
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:41,504
(birds chirping)

1235
01:30:10,404 --> 01:30:11,237
- Ed.

1236
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:13,777
What is it?

1237
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:19,044
(slow paced music)

1238
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:21,997
What is it?

1239
01:30:21,997 --> 01:30:23,357
- I ain't no hero.

1240
01:30:24,214 --> 01:30:25,692
They keep calling me a hero.

1241
01:30:27,249 --> 01:30:30,175
- If you're not a hero then nobody is.

1242
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,709
You're as good as they come.

1243
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:34,576
- I thought I'd failed.

1244
01:30:36,376 --> 01:30:38,127
I thought we were all going to die.

1245
01:30:42,247 --> 01:30:43,080
Odessa,

1246
01:30:46,938 --> 01:30:47,771
I was afraid.

1247
01:30:49,899 --> 01:30:50,999
- Oh we're all afraid,

1248
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:53,839
but you didn't die Edward.

1249
01:30:53,839 --> 01:30:55,112
We're all safe.

1250
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:00,703
And this just makes us
know what's important.

1251
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:05,611
Every precious moment we have together

1252
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:08,482
with the ones we love.

1253
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:14,235
(slow paced music)

1254
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:35,911
(slow paced music)

1255
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:52,463
(light music)
