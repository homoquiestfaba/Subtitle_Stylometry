           Hi.                  

122
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,732
                   Hello.       

123
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,938
              ( sighs )         

124
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,712
   You're late.                 

125
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,282
    - ( sighs ) I was hoping    
     you wouldn't notice.       
    - It's okay.                

126
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,718
I expected it.                  
You were late for               
your first day of work.         

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,987
          ( chuckles )          
          You noticed that, too?

128
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,691
Yeah. I'm your advisor.         
I'm supposed to notice.         

129
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,094
                      Huh.      

130
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,697
   - Do you live here alone?    
   - No. ( chuckles )           

131
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,732
No, this is                     
my family's house.              

132
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:32,637
My parents still live here      
and, apparently, so do I.       

133
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,740
          - Huh.                
          - Should we?          

134
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,809
            Oh, uh, yeah.       
            Car's down this way.

Bottle cap.

      Why?                      
      What did you hear?        

145
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,001
Some of the juniors             
said you weren't happy          
with the work.                  

146
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,637
- They're wrong.                
- They weren't disparaging you. 

147
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,641
They were impressed             
that an associate stood up      
for herself the way you did.    

148
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,677
     It's not the work.         

149
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,345
      I mean,                   
      it is the work.           

150
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,215
     It's tedious,              
     but that's to be expected. 

151
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,717
       Second-year associates   
       get the grunt work.      

152
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,953
       I can live with that.    

153
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,956
       I'll complain about it,  
       but I can live with it.  

154
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,192
         It's the trademark suit
         that's got me fuming.  

155
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,695
I take it you did not agree     
with the judge's decision?      

156
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:07,232
      I completely agreed       
      with the judge's decision.

157
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,334
          And I told Thompson   
          six months ago        

158
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,203
     that we would lose         
     if we tried it like        
     a trademark dispute.       

159
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:16,741
           I was basically      
           silenced for voicing 
           a dissenting opinion.

160
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,245
      Hmm, there's no real      
      contribution at our level.

161
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,947
       There's only the illusion
       of contribution.         

162
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,950
              ( exhales )       
              Get ready, buster.
              You're on deck.

164
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,825
    Are you sure it's the firm  
    you're frustrated with?     

165
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,395
         Shouldn't we be getting
         to the meeting?        

166
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,964
      Ah, we have some time.    
      It's not for another      
      few hours.                

167
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,400
     - What?                    
     - I thought we'd swing     
       by the art center.       

168
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,736
 There's an Afro-centric exhibit
 that's supposed to be--        

169
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,404
                   Wait.        
                   What is this?

170
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,074
              ( chuckles )      
              "What is this?"   
              I don't know.     

171
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,077
    I mean, taken at face value,
    that's a pretty existential 
    question, Michelle.         

172
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,312
                 What happened  
                 to the meeting?

173
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,848
 It doesn't start               
 till 4:00,                     

174
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,784
so I thought                    
we'd see some paintings,        
maybe grab a bite to eat.       

175
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,422
      - ( scoffs )              
      - We don't have to.       

176
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,492
           Barack, you seem like
           a really sweet guy,  

177
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,095
           but how many times   
           do I have to tell you

178
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,830
             we're not          
             going out together?

179
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,432
Mm, well, Michelle,             
thank you for saying that.      

180
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,367
You seem like                   
a real sweet girl.              

181
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,902
 But I have to                  
 correct you.                   

182
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,405
We are in fact out              
and we are in fact together.    

183
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,107
             But not on a date. 

184
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,410
    - This is not a date.       
    - It doesn't have to be.    

185
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,912
                Barack, I don't 
                want it to be.  

186
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,247
You know, usually,              
women I meet                    

187
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,883
are willing to look past        
my hideous appearance           

188
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,318
  and get to know               
  the real me.                  

189
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,819
               If I thought     
               you were hideous,

190
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,020
           I wouldn't have      
           set you up with Gina.

191
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,288
         Gina's very attractive.

192
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,825
Now, that's true.               
Gina is very attractive.        

193
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,461
             This is not a date.

194
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,930
   That's okay.                 
   I'll-- I'll go               
   at your pace.                

195
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,932
                Barack, there's 
                no pace to go at

196
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,034
        because there's         
        no anything to speak of.

197
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,437
               I am your advisor
               at our law firm. 

198
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,206
    - It would be tacky.        
    - You keep saying that.     

199
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,542
  - And you keep ignoring it.   
  - For good reason.            

200
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:01,312
You're my advisor insomuch      
as you introduce me around      
at the beginning of the month   

201
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,981
and you show me how to use      
the coffee machine,             

202
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,916
which, by the way,              
I still can't figure out,       

203
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,018
   so some advisor.             

204
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,021
 Secondly,                      
 it's not our law firm.         

205
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,356
  It's your law firm.           

206
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,024
I'm just here                   
for the summer.                 

207
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,493
          And while you're here,
          it's inappropriate.   

208
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,962
So, you think                   
I'm attractive enough           

209
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,165
 - to set up with               
  your prettiest friend?        
 - You think she's that pretty? 

210
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,499
You and I share a lot           
of the same interests.          

211
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,101
               I don't know     
               that that's true.

212
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,036
    - We both love Chicago.     
    - I get it.                 

213
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,005
               You think we have
               a lot in common. 

214
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,507
        And maybe we do.        
        Maybe we can be friends.

215
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,044
   But if you                   
   can't understand this,       
   then you can't understand me.

216
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,481
  It's hard enough being a woman
  at a giant corporate law firm.

217
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,416
                For all the talk
                of equality that
                goes around     

218
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,151
                 and all those  
                 filled quotas, 

219
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,353
            I'm still surrounded
            by mostly men.      

220
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:46,391
     So, I gotta work           
     just a little bit harder   
     to earn everyone's respect.

221
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,194
          I gotta work          
          a little bit harder   
          to be taken seriously.

222
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,296
                Now add on      
                that I'm black. 

223
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,999
          All that extra work   
          I put in to compensate
          for being a woman?    

224
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,503
         Being black erases that
         and brings me back down
         to zero.               

225
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,138
             So, now I'm working
             double-time        

226
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,541
    just to be seen for who I am
    and what I'm capable of.    

227
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,110
        Now, how's it gonna look
        to a guy like Thompson  

228
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,546
        if I swoop in           
        and start dating        
        the first cute black guy

229
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,515
              who walks through 
              the firm's doors? 

230
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,284
       The liberal-minded people
       will think it's precious 

231
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,120
    and the closed-minded people
    will think it's pathetic.   

232
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,226
You think I'm cute?             

233
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,428
              I didn't say that.

234
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,331
   - Some of the secretaries    
    described you that way.     
   - Nice dodge.                

235
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,300
        Listen, listen,         
        we're a few blocks away.

236
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,169
      Why don't we go in        
      and check out the exhibit?

237
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,538
            I'd still like us   
            to go to the meeting
            a little later.     

238
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,607
                It would mean   
                a lot to me.    

239
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,445
                Okay, it's--    
                it's not a date.

240
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,381
     - Fine.                    
     - Until you say it is.     

241
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,363
       ( quiet chatter )        

242
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:07,672
( gasps )                       
That's Ernie Barnes.            

243
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,674
       You read that            
       in the brochure?         

244
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,044
No, no.                         
I can spot a Barnes             
a mile away.                    

245
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,215
        You know,               
        Barnes is a real        
        interesting brother.    

246
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,984
 - Did you watch "Good Times"?  
 - Not a family staple.         

247
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,686
                 Really?        

248
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,555
        There was a black family
        in Chicago that didn't  
        watch "Good Times"?     

249
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,426
We were more                    
of a "Brady Bunch,              
"Dick Van Dyke" kind of family. 

250
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,463
    Those kids on Euclid Avenue,
    man, I'm telling you        
    they had it good.           

251
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,236
              "Dy-no-mite!"     

252
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:42,540
  - ( chuckles )                
   Do you remember that?        
  - Yes, I remember the line.   

253
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,409
      The character's name      
      was J.J.                  

254
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,643
               Right.           

255
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,446
           He was kind of       
           a screwup.           

256
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:53,117
  He would steal here and there,
  couldn't read or write,       
  talked jive.                  

257
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,120
        You know, just a bad    
        TV stereotype, right?   

258
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,522
      Mm-hmm.                   

259
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,991
      But, see,                 
      as the show progressed,   

260
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,661
      J.J. developed            
      this interest in painting.

261
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,265
As it turned out,               
he actually had                 
a lot of talent.                

262
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,335
But he didn't                   
take it seriously.              

263
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:14,439
Not until his dad,              
who was this tough,             
blue-collar guy,                

264
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,041
encouraged him                  
to keep painting.               

265
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,678
He saw it                       
as his son's only way           
out of the projects.            

266
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,182
              What did he paint?

267
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,684
Black ghetto life.              

268
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:30,621
They were crisp,                
exaggerated, very colorful.     

269
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,392
His style                       
was a lot like these.           

270
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,631
     That's because Ernie Barnes
     did all the paintings      
     for the show.              

271
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,035
          Hmm.                  

272
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,218
           Michelle:            
  <i> My brother would love this.</i>  

273
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,520
    - Barack:<i> Craig, right? </i>    
    -<i> Yeah.</i>                     

274
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,123
How did you know?               

275
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,559
<i> I may have overheard you</i>       
<i> talking about him</i>              
<i> at the office.</i>                 

276
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,595
         - Stalker.             
         -<i> ( chuckles )</i>         

277
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,531
Yeah, but who's                 
the bigger Looney Tune?         

278
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,135
The stalker or the victim       
who willingly goes to a         
museum with a stalker?          

279
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,470
                      Willingly?

280
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:23,174
            I'm more inclined   
            to describe this as 
            a hostage situation.

281
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,209
I'm that bad, huh?              

282
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,577
                       Oh, hush.

283
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,115
Craig shoot hoops?              

284
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,618
                He's decent.    

285
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,720
Pick-up games?                  
Office league?                  

286
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,589
         He's an assistant coach
         at Illinois Tech.      

287
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,592
    No kidding?                 

288
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,694
I assume he played ball         
at school?                      

289
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,130
             Yeah, at Princeton,

290
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,633
      then for a couple of years
      in the BBL.               

291
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,736
      He actually               
      got drafted by the Sixers,
      but they never played him.

292
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,239
         - ( chuckles )         
         - What?                

293
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,743
I'd say "decent ballplayer"     
is a gross understatement.      

294
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,081
                 He was decent. 

295
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,715
                   Great is NBA.

296
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,452
     Uh, no.                    
     Good is college.           

297
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,688
Great is your brother.          
Superhuman is the NBA.          

298
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,459
I think I came                  
to my realization               

299
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,129
when I missed varsity           
my junior year of high school.  

300
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,797
Cut class for a week            
after that.                     

301
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,634
         - Why?                 
         - I was hapa.          

302
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,171
          So, in everyone's eyes
          I shouldn't have just 
          made the team,        

303
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,673
   I should've been the best.   

304
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:32,143
      - What's hapa?            
      - Hawaiian or mixed.      

305
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,511
                      Hmm.      

306
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,417
   Maybe they didn't            
   expect you to be the best.   

307
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,553
   Maybe you put that           
   expectation on yourself.     

308
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,571
           It makes me think    
           of Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,375

324
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,258
         - Do you sing?         
         - I play.              

325
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,428
         - Any good?            
         - I'm not bad.         

326
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,764
            My Aunt Robbie      
            was a piano teacher,

327
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,966
             so I started young.

328
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,802
           - How old?           
           - Four.              

329
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,804
         That's young.          

330
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,873
    Not for my mom.             

331
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,244
She started us early            
on everything--                 

332
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,479
    reading,                    

333
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,481
French lessons.                 

334
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,417
      - You speak French?       
      - Mm.                     

335
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,487
     - Are you fluent?          
     - I know a few words.      

336
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,224
      I never would've taken you
      for a Frenchie.           

337
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,659

     -<i> I mean, any other</i>

338
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,796
                It's just       
                so sentimental.

340
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,003
            What does that mean?

341
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,907
It means                        
"Things are not                 
always as they appear."

   No, you're mistaken.         

355
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:22,406
This is not a slice of pie.     
This is a slice of heaven.      

356
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,443
                   Mm.

359
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,916
                    Oh, yeah?   

360
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,784
               Which flavor?    

361
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,721
    Chocolate.                  

362
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:40,991
     - Ugh.                     
     - What, you don't like     
      chocolate ice cream?      

363
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,127
              I don't like      
              ice cream, period.

364
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,930
Now, that's weirder             
than not liking pie.            

365
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,665
         Not when you spend     
         a summer in high school

366
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,400
       working at               
       Baskin-Robbins, it's not.

367
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,103
                 I overdid it.  

368
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,472
They have Baskin-Robbins        
in Hawaii?                      

369
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:57,007
       You do know Hawaii       
       is part of these here    
       United States, don't you?

370
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,978
   It just seems                
   so foreign.                  

371
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,483
                Honolulu's      
                pretty normal.  

372
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,951
           Played hoops all day.

373
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,887
          Went to a good school.

374
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,156
      Then again, there's a lot 
      about my high school years

375
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,891
              I do not remember.

376
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,660
      Why?                      

377
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,998
            Let's just say      
            a lot of it got lost
            in a cloudy haze.   

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
         Oh.                    

379
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,704
     - Because you smoked       
      a lot of marijuana?       
     - ( chuckles )             

380
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,573
           Yes, because I smoked
           a lot of marijuana.  

381
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,780
            I had a lot         
            of growing up to do.

382
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,705
  One time, when I was          
  nine years old,               

383
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,607
   I go to this girl's          
   birthday party               

384
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,444
and I show up,                  
and it's me and 20 girls.       

385
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,446
I'm the only boy there.         

386
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,883
  When I asked them why,        
  they all just started         
  laughing at me.               

387
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,053
  I remember running            
  all the way home.             
  I was mortified.              

388
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,888
               What made you    
               think of that?   

389
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,857
I don't know.                   
It just popped in my head.      

390
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,760
     Could never                
     figure it out.             

391
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,062
     Hey, you're                
     a smart lady.              

392
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,897
    Why were they               
    laughing at me?             

393
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,900
             They probably      
             had crushes on you.

394
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,771
          I mean,               
          everything's backwards
          when you're little.   

395
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,540
           When a boy likes you,
           he pulls your hair.  

396
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,776
      When you like a boy,      
      you kick him in the shins.

397
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,911
You do any shin kicking         
back in the day?                

398
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:46,083
   If you were on the playground
   and you were brown and cute, 
   watch out.                   

399
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:50,721
      You, uh, doing any        
      shin kicking these days?  

400
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,224
         Are you inquiring      
         about my personal life?

401
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,926
           I might be.          

402
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,028
   - Well, the answer is no.    
   - Hmm.                       

403
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:04,702
       Tell me more about       
       your grade school        
       Casanova years.          

404
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,070
       ( laughs )               
       No.                      

405
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,239
    No, no.                     
    I couldn't have             
    been less popular.          

406
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:12,910
The kids in Indonesia           
used to throw me in the swamp   
and call me Blackberry.         

407
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,545
               Indonesia?       

408
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:17,147
Yeah, I lived in Jakarta        
for a few years.                

409
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,816
    I'm not kidding.            

410
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,519
  We had crocodiles             
  in the backyard.              

411
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:25,122
          But-- but--           
          but why were you      
          living there?         

412
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,124
         I mean, how did you    
         end up there?          

413
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,027
Lolo, my mother's ex-husband,   
was from there                  

414
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,562
     and went back              
     for work.                  

415
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,830
    We went with him.           

416
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,632
              But where was     
              your dad?         

417
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,903
  ( exhales )                   
  He was back in Kenya.         

418
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,071
    And you didn't wanna        
    live with him?              

419
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,644
     It wasn't an option.       

420
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,056
               Anyway, I didn't 
               have to suffer   

421
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,092
            at the hands        
            of my Indonesian    
            tormentors for long.

422
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,261
          I moved back to Hawaii
          when I was 10.        

423
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,064
      My mother wanted me       
      to get a better education.

424
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,066
          Well?                 

425
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,868
         Did you?               

426
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,603
                I don't know.   

427
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:17,308
          How would you rate    
          my level of education?

428
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,878
 You're like that               
 jive-talking stereotype        
 from "Good Times."             

429
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,682
             So, what about you?

430
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,017
       What about me?           

431
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,720
         Well, you're Ivy League
         through and through.   

432
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,022
Craig got                       
the natural smarts.             

433
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,091
I just worked                   
my butt off.                    

434
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,893
            I'm sure your mother
            made sure of that.  

435
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,661
    She never had to.           

436
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,165
    Education was always        
    priority number one.        

437
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,734
   My dad would stand           
   for nothing less,            

438
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:47,171
  and there was no way          
  Craig and I were gonna        
  disappoint him.               

439
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:48,706
              What's he like?   

440
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,844
He's the greatest man           
in the world.                   

441
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,314
   He told us                   
   from day one                 

442
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:00,184
education was the key           
to our happiness                

443
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,786
    and he didn't               
    let us forget it.           

444
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,922
             What's he do       
             for a living?      

445
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:08,158
Operations engineer             
for the water department.       

446
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,394
Basically,                      
he fixes the boilers.           

447
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,396
He's been there                 
since '68.                      

448
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,099
      That must be where you get
      your work ethic.          

449
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,802
  ( chuckles )                  
  You don't know                
  the half of it.               

450
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,638
        Well, tell me, then.    

451
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,241
You're asking                   
a lot of questions.             

452
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,277
          ( sighs )             
          You don't have to     
          answer them, Michelle.

453
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:36,186
Can you keep what's said        
outside the office              

454
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,255
 outside the office?            

455
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,258
             Michelle,          
             I've been trying   

456
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,227
              to get you        
              outside the office
              for a month now.  

457
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,130
     I'm serious.               

458
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,367
                Yes. Absolutely.

459
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,874
   My dad has MS.               

460
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,911
              That why          
              you live at home? 

461
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:04,081
It's better to be there         
and to help out.                

462
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,017
He's on crutches now.           

463
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,689
Still gets himself              
to work every day.              

464
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,963
    You know, they are lucky    
    to have a daughter like you.

465
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,867
I'm lucky to have               
parents like them.              

466
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,210
  Is your mother                
  still alive?                  

467
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,479
                  Hmm, oh, yeah.

468
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,449
         Still in Jakarta.      
         She's a wonderful lady.

469
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:42,052
 -<i> But you don't see her much? </i> 
 - Nah, she has her own life.   

470
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,755
               But she's        
               brilliant, warm. 

471
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,757
               Truly wonderful. 

472
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,960
   - And she's white?           
   - ( chuckles ) Snow white.   

473
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,895
                Born in         
                Wichita, Kansas.

474
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,765
    - You were born in '60?     
    - '61.                      

475
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,166
       Hmm.                     

476
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,304
        A white woman           
        and a black man         

477
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,273
getting married                 
and having a kid back then.     

478
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,943
They were                       
ahead of their time.            

479
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,479
You want the God's honest       
truth about my folks?           

480
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,314
            - Sure.             
            - Okay.             

481
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,483
     My mother thought          
     Harry Belafonte            

482
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:16,086
      was the most handsome man 
      on the face of the planet.

483
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,424
 - Yeah, I'd say chocolate was  
  her favorite flavor, too.     
 - ( both laughing )            

484
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:24,895
            No, really, I think 
            their attraction    
            was that simple.    

485
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,364
          My father looked like 
          Nat King Cole         

486
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,067
       and my mother            
       looked like Patsy Cline. 

487
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,839
       ( drums playing )        

488
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,240
          Okay.                 

489
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,555
           Man: Hey!            

490
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,959
      ( people whooping )       

491
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,153
      -<i> ( drumming ends ) </i>      
      -<i> ( people cheer )</i>        

492
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,855
      <i> ( Barack laughing )</i>      

493
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,890
        <i> Not bad at all,</i>        
        <i> Miss Robinson.</i>         

494
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,026
       - Those drummers         
        were incredible.        
       - Yeah, they were.       

495
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,428
      - I wonder if             
       they were African.       
      - Why?                    

496
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,463
                 Well, it can be
                 a ritual.      

497
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,866
      I was part of one         
      while visiting my         
      family's village in Kenya.

498
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,636
  - What were the rituals for?  
  - Eh, prayer, mostly.         

499
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,306
          Do you believe in God?

500
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,042
You like to go straight         
for the jugular, don't you?     

501
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,180
- You have a real nice jugular. 
 Real defined, real sexy.       
- Watch it, now.                

502
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,350
Growing up, we went             
to church on Sundays,           

503
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,585
 but I don't know.              

504
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:32,322
I believe in some sort          
of guiding spirit.              

505
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:36,260
But I also think                
God helps those who             
help themselves.                

506
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:40,330
- I think I saw that            
 on a bumper sticker somewhere. 
- That's how you know it's good.

507
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,498
                       Ah.      

508
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,034
And your religious              
proclivities?                   

509
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,904
            Let's just say      
            I'm still evolving. 

510
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,106
    - What were you raised?     
    - Nothing, really.          

511
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,575
         My mom didn't associate
         with any one religion. 

512
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,611
And your father?                
Was he like you?                

513
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,080
About the only thing            
my father and I had in common   

514
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,982
      was that we both          
      went to Harvard.          

515
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,118
        The only difference is  
        he got kicked out.      

516
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,687
   - You still got two years.   
   - ( chuckles )               

517
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,156
       Think that's enough time 
       for me to develop a      
       drinking problem         

518
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,959
       and burn through         
       all my student loans?    

519
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,295
       You don't like           
       talking about him.       

520
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:15,465
 - Well, there isn't            
  much to say, unfortunately.   
 - That can't be true.          

521
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,234
            It is true.         

522
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,336
  - His life is incomplete...   
  -<i> ( gentle splash )</i>           

523
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,438
              ...in every       
              imaginable way.   

524
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,342
          He married my mother, 
          they had me, he left. 

525
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,010
               Went to Harvard, 
               got kicked out,  

526
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,112
              never got his PhD.

527
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,415
          Got a job with        
          the Kenyan government,

528
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,183
                  got fired,    

529
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,185
             never found        
             a stable job again.

530
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,521
       Had a few too many drinks
       at a bar one night,      

531
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:41,658
           got behind the wheel,
           never made it home.  

532
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,428
        He died when he was 46. 
        His life was incomplete.

533
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,664
             Even his tombstone 
             is blank.          

534
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:51,101
     - No one bothered          
      to have it engraved.      
     - No one bothered?         

535
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,502
       All that family          
       over there?              

536
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,304
           No one had the money.

537
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,009
<i> ( gentle splashing )</i>           

538
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,144
    You'll do it.               

539
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,447
When you have the money,        
you'll go back there            

540
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,115
and have                        
his name engraved.              

541
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,453
           You think you know me
           well enough to make  
           that prediction?     

542
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,054
     No.                        

543
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,290
But I am                        
a pretty hopeful person,        

544
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:17,160
 so I'll just say               
 I hope you do it.

563
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,343
             Sounds             
             interesting enough.

564
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,712
Blick, Thompson, and Cohen      
were talking about it           
in the office.                  

565
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:12,182
      <i> And Thompson said</i>

      <i> towards white people.</i>    

566
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,417
              No, he didn't.    

567
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,752
    He didn't mean              
    anything by it.             

568
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,388
He's a little out of touch,     
that's all.                     

569
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,825
         I'm just tired of being
         two different people.  

570
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,460
             I played that game 
             at Princeton       

571
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,395
           and I played it again
           at Harvard.          

572
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,532
 There were white kids at school
 who would talk to me in class, 

573
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,300
               but if I saw them
               out on the quad  

574
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,135
            and they were with  
            their other friends,

575
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,771
   they would walk right past me
   without so much as a nod.    

576
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,475
<i> Now, obviously,</i>                
<i> the firm is not like that,</i>     

577
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,778
       but sometimes            
       when I'm leaving         
       Southside in the morning,

578
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,380
           headed for the Loop, 
           I feel like          

579
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:47,150
    I'm leaving Planet Black    
    and landing on Planet White.

580
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,120
      Come on.                  

581
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,255
   You got wooed                
   just like me.                

582
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,824
   You got wined                
   and dined.                   

583
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,526
You saw the corporate culture,  
the racial culture.             

584
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,863
You knew the score              
and you still said yes.         

585
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,598
     <i> Are you sure it's the firm</i>
     <i> you're frustrated with?</i>   

586
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,800
     That's the second time     
     you asked me that question.

587
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:06,369
It's the second time            
you haven't answered it.        

588
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,539
        What are you suggesting?

589
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,741
       <i> Take the bottle cap case</i>
       <i> as an example.</i>          

590
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,846
   Once you made your point,    
   why bother pressing further? 

591
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,447
         To try and get through 
         to Thompson.           

592
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,483
         <i> Come on,</i>              
         <i> you knew you wouldn't.</i>

593
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,418
          <i> Like you said,</i>       
          <i> you're a second-year</i> 
          <i> associate.</i>           

594
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,453
       Thompson wants you       
       doing research,          

595
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,689
  interfacing with the clients, 
  preparing his arguments--     

596
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,524
    - the grunt work, right?    
    -<i> Right.</i>                    

597
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,893
      But if I don't speak up,  
      what's the alternative?   

598
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,162
              Shut my mouth     
              and sit there     
              looking pretty?   

599
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,264
      First of all,             
      you always sit there      
      looking pretty.           

600
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:37,501
         <i> Second of all,</i>        
         <i> I'm not suggesting</i>    
         <i> you silence yourself.</i> 

601
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:40,670
       I'm just wondering       
       why you chose to work    
       at a corporate firm      

602
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,440
  where you knew your silence   
  would be expected.            

603
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:47,444
 And, really, what I'm wondering
 is why you're wasting the fight
 you have inside you            

604
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,480
    on battles you can't win    
    and issues you don't        
    care about.                 

605
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,483
                 Excuse me?     

606
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:58,255
      You think because we spend
      one afternoon together    

607
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,157
           and you tried        
           to buy me a sandwich,

608
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,625
             you're entitled    
             to pass judgment   

609
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,460
          on the choices I made 
          in my life?           

610
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:06,363
     - ( sighs )                
     - You think                
       I'm wasting my life.

              <i> Now, I never used</i>
              <i> those words.</i>     

612
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,566
        You didn't have         
        to use those words.     

613
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:13,170
<i> You used other ones,</i>           
<i> and they stung just as much.</i>   

614
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,538
                Why?            

615
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,906
       If you really loved      
       what you were doing,     

616
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,707
      would you be bothered     
      by what I said?

         to go screw myself     

619
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480

620
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,482

00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:39,542
       - Hello!                 
       - So happy               
        to see you guys.        

651
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,010
    Looks like we got           
    a full house today.         

652
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,912
  Well, everyone heard          
  you was coming, Barack.       

653
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,515
We all wanted                   
to get a look at                
our Harvard man all grown up.   

654
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,083
    Does a year and a half      
    change a man?               

655
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,553
 Woman:                         
<i> No, but apparently</i>             
<i> it gets you a lady.</i>            

656
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,489
     -<i> Finally, a sister! </i>      
     - Woman #2:<i> Mm-hmm!</i>        

657
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,125
         How you doing, sweetie?
         My name's Bernadette.  

658
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,761
    - Oh, Michelle.             
      Very nice to meet you.    
    - Hey, girl.                

659
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,963
         - I'm Janice.          
         - Hi.                  

660
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,499
  We was your boyfriend's ladies
  while he was working here     
  in the Gardens.               

661
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,801
   - Oh, we're not--            
   - Platonic ladies, child.    

662
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,004
     - Hey.                     
     - Don't go giving her      
       any ideas.               

663
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,775
We did everything together      
except the sexy stuff.          

664
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:14,844
Mm. Now this is a real man      
you got yourself here.          

665
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,714
 - Bernadette:<i> Mm-hmm... </i>       
 - Just going right over there.

  - Janice:<i> Yo, Rafiqa!</i>         

670
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,594
            This Barack's woman,
            Michelle.           

671
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,897
                Mm, he done well
                for himself.    

672
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,933
 - Welcome!                     
 - Janice, we're not together.  

673
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,603
- You saying this Barack's girl?
- No, Kyle, this Barack's woman.

674
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,739
   - Michelle.                  
   - Y'all married and shit?    

675
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:45,875
      Kyle, watch your mouth.   
      Your ass in church.       

676
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,011
   ( muttering )                

677
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,115
        - Y'all married?        
        - No.                   

678
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,518
          We're not together    
          at all.               

679
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,524
    Let me tell you             
    a little something          
    about Barack.               

680
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:04,761
My son Lawan wanted             
to be in the navy               

681
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,764
since he was playing            
with toy boats in the tub.      

682
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,867
But growing up                  
in the Gardens, whoo!           

683
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,169
Little by little,               
the place was getting to him.   

684
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:18,041
And he was starting to get      
the same ideas as every other   
young Negro around here,        

685
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,077
  thinking there                
  ain't no place for them       
  outside these walls.          

686
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,880
  And even if there was,        
  ain't no way out.             

687
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,983
Well,                           
then comes Barack,              

688
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,520
and every time                  
he come by the house            
to talk business,               

689
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:34,257
  <i> he sets aside a little time</i>  
     <i> to talk with my Lawan</i>     

690
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,192
       <i> about navy boats.</i>       

691
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,962
Now, I don't even               
know how Barack knew            
about navy boats,               

692
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:41,231
and he could've been            
making up names,                
for all I know.                 

693
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:45,535
The USS this                    
and the USS that.               

694
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,136
It didn't matter.               

695
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,640
   He kept Lawan                
   interested.                  

696
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:54,777
He told my boy                  
that he could be anything       

697
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,280
   if he worked                 
   hard enough.                 

698
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,949
You see, he didn't have         
a father to tell him that.      

699
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,051
And you know what?              

700
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,226
   - He made it out.

 Okay, now, today,              
 you know we're here to         
 discuss the community center.  

710
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,293
    - ( scoffs )                
     What community center?     
    -<i> Look, I know.</i>             

711
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,762
   I know the city's decision   
   was a disappointment,        
   all right?                   

712
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,631
              Lord, Tommy.      
              It was more than  
              a disappointment. 

713
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,734
    It was six months           
    of our lives down the drain.

714
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,837
       ( crowd agreeing )       

715
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,273
    Okay, hold on.              
    Everybody, just hold on.    

716
00:42:57,275 --> 00:43:00,009
    It was a disappointment.    
    But it wasn't all bad.      

717
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:03,179
  See, now, we got ourselves    
  not one, not two, but three   
  foundations                   

718
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:06,015
  to fund our                   
  community center programs     
  when the time is right.       

719
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,885
  - And I got that in writing.  
  - ( crowd grousing )          

720
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:13,256
   Now, how in God's name       
   are they supposed to fund    
   our community center programs

721
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,358
            when we ain't got   
            no community center?

722
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,694
              All:              
         That's right!          

723
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:20,196
   Well, that's the dilemma     
   we're here today to solve.   

724
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,931
           Now, what we         
           have to do first     

725
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,067
   is take a look at            
   why the city council said no.

726
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,602
     Well, what difference      
     does it make?              

727
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,170
  They say no                   
  to everything we ask for.     

728
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,972
    Now, now, that's just       
    not always true, Curtis.    

729
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,107
Now, we got that job center     
up and running.                 

730
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,943

on hold for them while          
they rehabbing.                 

731
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,912

              is this--         

732
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:38,815
       Senator Torrance         
       got himself a state grant

733

       that he's gonna preach in

      up the road to play

          can't even go play

      towards the goals         
      we setting.               

754
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,835
    - Right now, that's         
     the community center.      
    - Woman:<i> Tell them, Tommy.</i>  

755
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,104
     Now, you know              
     from past experiences      
     we got things done         

756
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:37,240
      because we honed in       
      on one issue,             

757
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,008
       we pressed,              
       we squeezed,             

758
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,977
     and we screamed until      
     somebody finally listened. 

759
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,079
    It's taking too long.       
    We tired of screaming!      

760
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,882
    - Well, then ain't          
     nothing gonna change.      
    -<i> Well, maybe it can't!</i>     

761
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,419
           - Huh?               
           - No way.            

762
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,392
      Well, look,               
      I disagree.               

763
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,695
    And I'm sure                
    our guest here              
    disagrees, too,             

764
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,798
because I seem to recall        
when he was standing here       

765
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,233
    <i> in my position</i>             
    <i> by this podium</i>             
    <i> a year and a half ago,</i>     

766
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,702
      <i> y'all got something done.</i>

767
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,305
           I seem to recall     
           with his guidance,   

768
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,007
            your patience       
            and persistence,    

769
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,209
            y'all got that      
            asbestos problem    
            cleared up.         

770
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,212
   - Woman:<i> That's true. </i>       
   - Got them toilets fixed.    

771
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,981
       The pipes cleaned.       

772
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,349
<i> Now, I know</i>                    
<i> when times were tough,</i>         

773
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:23,019
this brother right here         

774
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,188
    had a lot                   
    of motivational             
    words for us,               

775
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,157
and I'm gonna ask him           
to come up and say              
a few right now,                

776
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,258
'cause I'ma tell you            
something.                      

777
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,327
We might be down                
for the count...                

778
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,464
 but we ain't out.              

779
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,901
 Brother Barack.                

780
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:43,172
  -<i> Why don't you come on up? </i>  
  - ( applause )                

781
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,508
   - It's all you.              
   - Thanks, bro. Thank you.    

782
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,278
          - All right.          
          -<i> Thank you.</i>          

783
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,517
    -<i> You know,</i>                 
    <i> </i> it's good to be back.     
    - ( chuckles )              

784
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,419
        It's good to see        
        all of you.             

785
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,221
      ( sniffs, chuckles )      

786
00:45:58,223 --> 00:45:59,822
        I missed                
        that musty smell        
        up here.                

787
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,158
      ( people chuckling,       
          chattering )          

788
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,927
 Looks like Pastor Mike hasn't  
 gotten around to filling in    
 that hole in the roof.         

789
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,963
              No.               

790
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,098
    Think we're gonna have to   
    organize a meeting just     
    to get that leak fixed.     

791
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,900
        - ( chuckling )         
        - Woman:<i> Never.</i>         

792
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,871
         But listen.            

793
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:21,778
      I, um--                   
      I feel your pain.         

794
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,481
  I do. It's-- it's a part      
  of me now, that pain.         

795
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,819
   Sometimes, it hits me        
   like a heart attack          

796
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,421
hundreds of miles away          
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.    

797
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:38,394
 Now, I could be listening      
 to a lecture in class          

798
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:41,364
       or studying              
       in the library           

799
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:45,168
   or watching a movie          
   or talking to a friend.      

800
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,470
        - I think               
          of all of you.        
        - Woman: Mmm.           

801
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:52,074
I may have gone on              
to a different life             
at Harvard,                     

802
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,543
but you know                    
what I realized?                

803
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:00,817
  - I never left the Gardens.   
  - Crowd: That's right.        

804
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:04,353
    Now, Tommy deserves         
    some credit here, folks.    

805
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,456
Our fight with                  
the city council                
two years ago                   

806
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,393
        was proof that          
        these victories         
        do not come easy        

807
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:12,428
         and they don't         
         come big.              

808
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,865
         They are few           
         and far between.       

809
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:18,401
     But you gotta use them     
     like building blocks.      

810
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:21,504
     You know, one by one,      
     one on top of the other,   

811
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:26,142
   and little by little,        
   you got yourself a building. 

812
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:28,044
    And that's exactly          
    what you need in this case  

813
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,047
    is a building               
    for your community center.  

814
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,416
       Now, I feel              
       your disappointment.     

815
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,954
        But the truth is        

816
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,289
         you're in              
         a good position        
         right now.             

817
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,125
  - ( all arguing )             
  - Woman:<i> That's why we ain't</i>  
  <i>  got no community center!</i>    

818
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,094
         All right, all right,  
         all right.             

819
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:47,196
          Tommy got             
          funding pledges.      

820
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:51,334
 That's real.                   
 That's money down the line     
 and that's hard to secure.     

821
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,102
     Now, I know it's not       
     the whole package,         

822
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,271
    but think about it.         

823
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:57,073
      Now all you need          
      is a building.            

824
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,475
<i> You're halfway there.</i>          

825
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:02,245
    The council said no         
    to the building,            

826
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,480
    but that was before         
    you had funding pledges     

827
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,482
    secured with the help       
    of Brother Tommy here.      

828
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,520
    So, now when you remount    
    your campaign,              

829
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,256
     you have something         
     to bring to the table.     

830
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,157
      You're contributing.      

831
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,094
      And the folks downtown    
      who like to see us        
      contributing,             

832
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:22,098
   makes them feel like         
   the money they give you      
   is gonna be put to good use. 

833
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,034
      They just wanna know      
      that you care.            

834
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:29,071
  And Tommy's right             
  when he says we need to take  
  a look at why they said no.   

835
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,073
       Not because              
       it's the right decision, 

836
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,443
      but because               
      you gotta understand      
      where they're coming from.

837
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,647
       You've gotta understand  
       the city's motivations,  
       its self-interest        

838
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:41,684
<i> in order to align them</i>         
<i> with your own.</i>                 

839
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:45,988
        We turn self-interest   
        into mutual interest.   

840
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,525
       All right, so let's give 
       the council members      

841
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,595
       the benefit of the doubt 
       for a moment.            

842
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,665
  Let's say they want you       
  to have your community center.

843
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,401
       ( crowd grousing )       

844
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,603
     - Mm.                      
     - Barack:<i> Okay, okay.</i>      

845
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:04,540
     But let's say for a moment 
     that we got some good folks
     on that council            

846
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,443
     and they'd like            
     to see your kids have      
     a place to go after school.

847
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,213
  - Woman:<i> Yeah, right. </i>        
  - Barack:<i> Now, I believe</i>      
  <i>  there probably are a few.</i>   

848
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:15,451
     So, if we've got some      
     good-hearted folks there...

849
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,955
            why can't they get  
            your funding request
            approved?           

850
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:22,258
   - Getting paid to say no.    
   - Barack:<i> Okay, Curtis.</i>      

851
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,961
    I hear you, I hear you.     
    Anyone else?                

852
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,997
      - Don't care enough.      
      - All right.              

853
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,032
        Any other ideas?        

854
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,201
          Maybe they don't think
          they can.             

855
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:35,571
          ( chatter )           

856
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:38,274
      That's what               
      I'm thinking, Kyle.       

857
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,278
I don't think they believe      
they can get it done            

858
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,180
even if they wanted to.         

859
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,516
They know developers            
don't wanna build               
in the Gardens.                 

860
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:48,718
<i> There's nothing in it</i>          
<i> for them.</i>                      

861
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,387
<i> No stores,</i>                     
<i> no economy.</i>                    

862
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,357
These council members           
don't necessarily want          
the answer to be no.            

863
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,092
   They just believe            
   it will be.                  

864
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,493
             Curtis:            
            <i> So, what are you</i>   
            <i> proposing, Barack?</i> 

865
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,261
       That we build            
       the damn thing ourselves?

866
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,731
          Almost.               
          Almost, Curtis.       

867
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:05,034
   Now, Tommy and I             
   have been discussing this,   

868
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:09,705
  and we both think             
  you might wanna consider      
  changing the goal slightly.   

869
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:13,609
<i> Refocus your efforts on</i>        
<i> obtaining a land designation.</i>  

870
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,313
    Now, if you                 
    control the land,           

871
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,248
    you can cut a deal          
    with one developer          

872
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,751
    to build everything         
    in the area                 

873
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:26,455
   on the condition             
   that one of the buildings    
   be the community center.     

874
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,291
<i> Now, that's more jobs,</i>         

875
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:31,360
         more stores,           

876
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,330
     and a community center     
     for your children.         

877
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,199
       They just gonna say no   
       like they say no to      
       everything else!         

878
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,736
Now, we gotta stop thinking     
the word "no" is the end        
of the line, Curtis.            

879
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,172
   "No" is just a word.         

880
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:47,043
 You flip those letters around, 
 you get an entirely            
 different word.                

881
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:50,046
        - "On."                 
        - That's right.         

882
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,482
       -<i> As in carry on.</i>        
       <i>  ( chuckles ) </i>          
       -<i> Yeah, all right.</i>       

883
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,217
      Say it with me, now.      

884
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,420
       - Carry on.              
       - Crowd: Carry on.       

885
00:50:57,422 --> 00:51:00,256
   - They say "no," we say...   
   - Crowd: "Carry on."         

886
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,725
    - They say "no," we say...  
    - Crowd: "Carry on!"        

887
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,794
    - Carry on, carry on.       
    - ( cheering, applause )    

888
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,632
     That's it.                 
     There you go.              

889
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,812
         You know,              
         Harold Washington...   

890
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,448
       - Woman:<i> My man. </i>        
       - Yeah.                  

891
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,551
    Harold Washington           
    was one of the reasons      
    I moved to Chicago.         

892
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,419
             Woman:             
       <i> Hmm, was he, now?</i>       

893
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,588
  When I first came here,       
  every barber shop             

894
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,723
    and chicken shack           
    on the Southside            

895
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:37,827
had a squeaky-clean picture     
of him hanging up on the wall   
for everyone to see.            

896
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,429
 - Man:<i> He's right about that. </i> 
 - Woman:<i> They all do.</i>          

897
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,332
     Chicago's first            
     black mayor.               

898
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,768
  - He was our mayor.           
  - Woman:<i> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</i>  

899
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,673
- Yeah.                         
- But even Mayor Washington     
 disappointed in some respects. 

900
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,778
     He had to face             
     the great truth            
     of our country--           

901
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,180
    that it's not easy          
    to get things done.         

902
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,152
 You know, the founders         
 made it that way on purpose.   

903
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,787
    They made it messy...       

904
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,890
    so that no one law,         

905
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,893
    no one government,          
    no one man,                 

906
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,863
  could decide the fate         
  of everything and everyone.   

907
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,871
   In very simple terms,        

908
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:25,407
  we got a heck of a lot        
  of different people           

909
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:28,878
   with a heck of a lot         
   of different agendas.        

910
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,882
But I also believe              
that people, most people,       

911
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:36,485
      are basically,            
      at their core,            
      good people.              

912
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:42,291
     So, if at first            
     we don't understand        
     their agenda,              

913
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,493
      city council,             
      the aldermen,             

914
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,362
  and the state senator...      

915
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,199
      we have to try            
      our hardest               

916
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,768
to understand                   
who they are                    

917
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,670
and what they need.             

918
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,243
  We have to let go             
  of judgment.                  

919
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,283
    That's a lesson...          

920
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,755
    I learned today             
    from a friend.              

921
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,929
<i> No matter what we think</i>        
<i> about someone...</i>               

922
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:24,233
<i> we never truly know</i>            
<i> what it's like to walk</i>         
<i> in their shoes.</i>                

923
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,771
     But we have to try.        

924
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,809
<i> You know, whether</i>              
<i> it's a colleague,</i>              
<i> a family member,</i>               

925
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,911
or a particular opponent--      

926
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,380
     well, especially           
     our opponents.             

927
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,252
Because where their needs       
align with our needs...         

928
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,789
    is where                    
    things get done.            

929
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:51,393
    Now, that's America.        

930
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,964
    Just a bunch

940
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,440
         It's been a while

941
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,443
      that kind of connection   
      to real-life struggle.    

942
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,478
                 Me, too.       

943
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:49,585
    In high school,             
    my typing teacher           
    gave me an A-.              

944
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,421
( chuckles )                    

945
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:56,458
I wrote her a letter every day  
until she changed it to an A.   

946
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:01,563
    I celebrated                
    all day long.               

947
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:04,900
  But that night,               
  I couldn't sleep.             

948
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:09,438
I kept asking myself            
over and over again,            

949
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,840
  "Did I even                   
  deserve the A?"               

950
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,612
  Sometimes, I forget           
  why I'm fighting.             

951
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:21,483
  Or even                       
  that I am fighting.           

952
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:26,655
I didn't know I was             
wrestling with myself           
about the firm.                 

953
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,660
       I understand that.

955
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:38,767

959
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,612
     I knew there was           
     a decent chance, yeah.     

960
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,114
     Mm-hmm.

to join the navy.

00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,951
         It wasn't bad.         

968
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:32,955
     You sounded                
     a little professorial.     

969
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:36,525
          ( chuckles )          

970
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,762
        But you definitely      
        have a knack for        
        making speeches.        

971
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,032
               Thank you.       

972
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,873
         You know,              
         that being said,       

973
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,875
         it didn't hurt         
         to take you there      
         on our first date.     

974
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:57,012
       - Our first what?        
       - You heard me.          

975
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:02,017
      ( chuckles )              
      You must have misspoken,  

976
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,019
          because               
          according to you,     

977
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:08,957
          this isn't a date     
          until I say so.       

978
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,693
      You know, if you don't    
      wanna spend any more time 
      with me today,            

979
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,095
         I'll respect it.       

980
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,598
        I won't like it,        
        but I'll respect        
        your wishes.            

981
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,872
           But if you wanna     
           keep hanging,        

982
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:27,910
let's call it a date            
and move on to the next event.  

983
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:31,079
     - Next event?              
     - Drinks and a movie.      

984
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,218
        You think               
        you're real smooth.     

985
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,554
           And real cute.       

986
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,858
         I don't know           
         about the cute part.   

987
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,795
            I mean, they did    
            look good on Dumbo. 

988
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,165
    - I'd rather be Dumbo       
     than the Wicked Queen.     
    - Wicked Queen?             

989
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,135
       Now, you can't just say  
       any old wicked queen.    

990
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,138
      - From which movie?       
      - ( both chuckling )      

991
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,546
      - ( chatter )             
      -<i> ( music playing )</i>       

992
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:08,484
      <i>  Why can't nobody</i>       
           <i> love me </i>           

993
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,155
    <i>  Like my baby does? </i>     

994
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,160
         <i>  Young girl</i>          
      <i> turned out to be </i>       

995
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:21,964
         <i>  Two times,</i>          
       <i> twice the woman </i>       

996
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:24,566
       <i>  That I thought</i>        
         <i> she was... </i>          

997
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:26,935
      Michelle:<i> Don't even</i>      
     <i> come at me with that</i>      
   <i> "Innervisions" nonsense.</i>    

998
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:29,004
            Barack:             
      <i> It's a better album</i>      
          <i> all around.</i>          

999
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,708
     Michelle:<i> "You and I,"</i>     
    <i> "Sunshine of My Life,"</i>     
        <i> "Superstition."</i>        

1000
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,576
  - Barack:<i> All great songs. </i>   
  - His best.                   

1001
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,211
           Huh, not better than 
           "Higher Ground."     

1002
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:39,014
      "Talking Book"            
      was the first album       
      I ever heard.             

1003
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,583
And if it was the last,         
I'd be set for life.            

1004
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,986
 - That's how brilliant it is.  
 - Mm-mm.                       

1005
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:46,522
   ( chuckles )                 
   Man.                         

1006
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,992
Well, at least we can agree     
that Stevie is the best.        

1007
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:53,262
      - Mm.                     
      - At least we can         
       start from there.        

1008
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:03,272
Okay, so what about             
that moment in the church       

1009
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:05,207
before the meeting?             

1010
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,308
                    Which?      

1011
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,043
I think                         
Bernadette said it              

1012
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,747
about you finally               
dating a sister.                

1013
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,015
       ( both chuckling )       

1014
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:14,316
                Who knows       
                with those two? 

1015
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,752
     - They love to gossip.     
     - Is it true?              

1016
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:19,755
      - Is what true?           
      - That you never          
       date black women?        

1017
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:23,625
      - Not true.               
      - But you did             
       date white women.        

1018
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:26,628
             I've dated a couple
             white women, yes.  

1019
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,064
Which do you prefer?            

1020
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,899
                  ( chuckles )  

1021
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:35,203
Come on, buster.                
Now it's your turn              
to ante up.                     

1022
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:45,013
       My girlfriend            
       at Columbia was white.   

1023
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,081
     Okay.                      

1024
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,050
          It was pretty serious.

1025
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,751
What was her name?              

1026
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,787
             Jennifer.          

1027
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,956
       How long were            
       you with Jennifer?       

1028
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,091
                   A little over
                   two years.   

1029
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,361
          ( chuckles )          
          Mm-hmm.               

1030
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,200
       Columbia was a...        

1031
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,903
          strange time          
          in my life.           

1032
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:11,039
        I was reading a lot,    
        figuring stuff out.     

1033
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,674
        I had very few friends. 

1034
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:15,677
    - Except for Jennifer.      
    - ( chuckles ) Exactly.     

1035
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,181
          She was lovely.       

1036
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,350
          She really was.       

1037
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,652
        She was very caring.    

1038
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,654
        Kept me company         
        when I was lonely.      

1039
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:32,661
      We fell into that         
      private little universe   
      couples can fall into     

1040
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:36,198
      where you develop         
      your own kind of language 
      and customs, you know?    

1041
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,135
      I've never had that       
      with anyone               

1042
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,237
         other than             
         my own family.         

1043
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,805
                 It's nice.     

1044
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:52,314
               Anyway,          

1045
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,017
           when we went to visit
           her family,          

1046
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,719
      they were incredibly      
      gracious to me.           

1047
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,856
      Very nice,                
      open-minded people.       

1048
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:04,960
      But I looked around       
      at all the pictures       
      on the walls,             

1049
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,996
      all the white faces,      

1050
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,232
    and I knew I couldn't spend 
    any more of my life         

1051
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:11,967
      living as an outsider.    

1052
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,673
         Does that answer       
         your question?         

1053
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:21,076
       So, why did you          
       come to Chicago?         

1054
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,113
          To try and make       
          a difference.         

1055
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:27,015
   Mm-hmm.                      

1056
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,817
Thought I would, too.           

1057
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:32,954
     Thought maybe              
     I'd work civil cases.      

1058
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,857
         Help women,            
         empower them.          

1059
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:39,995
       Being at                 
       that meeting today       

1060
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:43,165
      aroused some              
      of those old dreams.      

1061
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,933
     Lit some kind of fire.     

1062
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,904
But those                       
last couple years,              

1063
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:51,173
the corporate firms             
descend upon the campus         

1064
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,909
like a pack of wolves.          

1065
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,410
   And they're so appealing.    

1066
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,379
                ( chuckles )    

1067
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:00,449
  I wanted to be in a position  
  to pay off my loans,          

1068
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:02,918
       pay my folks back,       

1069
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,853
         live a little,         

1070
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,455
          enjoy life.           

1071
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:08,356
           There's nothing wrong
           with that.           

1072
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,926
    There's nothing wrong       
    with it until there is.     

1073
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,427
                Yeah, I know    
                what you mean.  

1074
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:17,499
        I just feel             
        like something else     
        is pulling at me.       

1075
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:20,335
        I wonder                
        if I can write books    

1076
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:23,238
      or hold                   
      a position of influence   
      in civil rights.          

1077
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,041
          - Politics?           
          - Maybe.              

1078
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:31,046
    I just want to do more.     

1079
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,181
          Yeah, so do I.        

1080
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,185
     And maybe just wanting it  
     is enough for now.         

1081
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,291
                 Hm.            

1082
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:45,360
       Whatever I end up doing, 

1083
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,396
       I take comfort in knowing
       I can't do much worse    
       than my dad did.         

1084
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:53,435
       That doesn't sound       
       like the same guy        

1085
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,505
        who gave                
        that fancy speech       
        earlier,                

1086
01:02:56,507 --> 01:03:00,008
    the one who talked about    
    letting go of judgment.     

1087
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,081
     I've noticed how you talk  
     about your father.         

1088
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:11,286
That's such an angry way        
to live your life--             

1089
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,321
judging him,                    

1090
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:16,391
living your life                
against his.                    

1091
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,528
   You're still fighting him,   

1092
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,963
   but he's not here anymore.   

1093
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,270
   You said earlier you felt    
   his life was incomplete.     

1094
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:33,575
Every father's life             
is incomplete.                  

1095
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:37,045
That's why                      
they have sons--                

1096
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:39,247
to finish                       
what they started.              

1097
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:47,556
  You know, my grandfather      
  was not a very generous man.  

1098
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:51,326
    He could have helped        
    my dad through college,     

1099
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:55,030
    but he was so terrified     
    of getting into debt,       

1100
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:57,866
     he refused to lend him     
     any money.                 

1101
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:01,269
So my dad had                   
to drop out of school           

1102
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,171
<i> after a year.</i>                  

1103
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,142
<i> Took a while,</i>                  

1104
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:09,411
<i> but he forgave</i>                 
<i> my grandfather.</i>                

1105
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:14,316
        Then he got his job     
        with the city...        

1106
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,519
        and he has spent        
        the rest of his life    

1107
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,054
    working in that boiler room,

1108
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:21,456
          making sure           
          not to do to his kids 

1109
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,425
           what his father      
           did to him.          

1110
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:28,897
          You have to forgive   
          your father...        

1111
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:33,301
<i> so your anger doesn't</i>          
<i> turn you into him.</i>

<i> You have to forgive him...</i>

1114
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,413

01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:51,533
         So, you got around     
         to seeing the movie,   
         I take it.             

1186
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,801
     Yes, yes, we did.          

1187
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:55,103
In fact, I was just             
explaining to Michelle          

1188
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:56,771
how angry that ending           
made me.                        

1189
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,840
       Why would the deliveryman
       have thrown the trash can

1190
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:00,842
              through his       
              employer's window?

1191
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:04,412
<i> He must have known</i>             
<i> his actions would cause</i>        
<i> the mob to riot.</i>               

1192
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,714
<i> It seemed</i>                      
<i> totally irrational.</i>            

1193
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,250
Let me put it to you            
another way, Avery.             

1194
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,819
                   I'm all ears.

1195
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:12,854
        <i> If Mookie hadn't thrown</i>
        <i> the trash can,</i>         

1196
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,523
maybe the crowd would have      
turned on Sal and his sons.     

1197
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,659
So, instead of the store        
being destroyed,                

1198
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,561
they might be dead.             

1199
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:21,262
And Mookie knew                 
the insurance                   

1200
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,231
would cover the damage          
to the store.                   

1201
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,767
He was saving Sal's life.       

1202
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,303
   I never would have considered
   that perspective, Barack.    

1203
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:30,505
       See, that's why we need  
       a guy like you full-time.

1204
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:32,373
                  ( chuckles )  

1205
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,476
         Michelle, make sure    
         to treat him real good.

1206
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,378
We want him sticking around.    

1207
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,581
      We'll see you both Monday.

1208
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,849
         - Good night.          
         - Good night.          

1209
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,150
              Night.            

1210
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:51,659
You know I only said that       
to make Avery feel better.      

1211
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:54,529
Mookie threw that trash can     
because he was fucking angry.   

1212
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,197
  ( chuckles )                  

1213
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,802
What a coincidence              
seeing him here.                

1214
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,704
That's really wild.             

1215
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,706
        It wasn't a coincidence.

1216
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,742
          It was cosmic justice.

1217
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,344
            I knew damn well    
            going out with you  

1218
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,212
          was the wrong thing   
          to do-- pun intended--

1219
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:13,748
       and don't even try       
       to convince me otherwise,
       Barack,                  

1220
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,719
         because there's nothing
         you can say.           

1221
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:19,387
     Nothing?                   

1222
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,922
 I can't tell you that          
 Avery doesn't give a hoot      

1223
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:22,524
  about seeing                  
  the two of us out?            

1224
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,559
         "Make sure to treat him
         real good."            

1225
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,928
      That was not okay, Barack.

1226
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,830
           By any measure.      

1227
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,798
           It was smarmy.       

1228
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,501
        You don't think that was
        laced with anything?    

1229
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,938
        You don't think he meant
        anything by that?       

1230
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,340
       Maybe he did.            
       So, what?                

1231
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,343
      First thing Monday morning

1232
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,279
      he's gonna spread         
      this juicy little anecdote

1233
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,548
            around the office   
            like wildfire.      

1234
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,449
          You know, none of this
          would have happened   

1235
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,919
      if you had just respected 
      the boundaries I laid out,

1236
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:52,687
              but you refused.  

1237
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,657
       You didn't respect       
       our working relationship.

1238
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,492
         And now that's all     
         there's going to be.
