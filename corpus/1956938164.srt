1
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:17,233
[female operator] 911. May I help you?

2
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:19,209
[fake Chinese accent] I
think it's a fight maybe,

3
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,799
And there could be a gun there.

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,899
That's right!

5
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:23,899
Can you give me a location?

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:24,933
This, uh, disturbance

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:29,866
at Wang's Fu restaurant
at 84 Paradise. Yes. At...

8
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,866
Can I have your name?

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,699
No. No, no. My name is not important.

10
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:36,333
I think you guys should
be there pretty quick.

11
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:37,632
That's right.

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,300
Good. Thank you.

13
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:50,532
Our ass is covered like a diaper.

14
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:52,233
[police radio] 1051, Chinatown.

15
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,266
Disturbance at 84 Paradise Road.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,333
Wang Fu restaurant.

17
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:58,467
Unit 18 responding. Roger that 1051.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,300
We're on it, 84 Paradise.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,133
[sirens]

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,467
[radio] In the vicinity...

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,799
Let's back those guys up.

22
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,599
No, they'll be okay. Just stay out of it.

23
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,632
What's the matter with you, man?

24
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,200
Cutting down on your MSG or some shit, huh?

25
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,633
What's the matter with you, Roadie?

26
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,333
You want to do some ching-chong recruiting?

27
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,476
Hey, now that's a good idea.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,300
We need Chinese cops in Chinatown.

29
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,266
In fact, my brother,

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,300
you can pass out the fucking applications.

31
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,566
We're cops, man. We back each other up.

32
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,233
That's what we're supposed to do.

33
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,166
Come on, man. Those guys can handle it.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
Have a heart.

35
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,566
[siren] Come on.

36
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,632
[busts door open]

37
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,899
Out of my way! Come on.

38
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,799
Let's go! Move it!

39
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,300
[screams and crashing]

40
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,833
Move! Come on. Move!

41
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,732
Get out!

42
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,300
[thud] Out of my way!

43
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,200
[speaks Chinese]

44
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,942
You guys forgot to
support your local police?

45
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,467
You don't support us,

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,532
how can we support you? Huh?

47
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,266
Huh? Huh?

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,266
[man with Chinese accent]
Why you do this? Huh?

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,766
Thanks for the contribution.

50
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,200
[cop] Put your hands up.

51
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,899
Get back, buddy. Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

52
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,166
Move. Move!

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,599
Go watch the door, huh?

54
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,166
Hey, Grant. Yeah.

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,300
Report this to the bank. You hear me?

56
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,799
[laughs]

57
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,566
Break it up. Break it the fuck up.

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,200
Fucking ping pong! You
got a fucking problem?

59
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,766
Rhoades. Rhoades. Relax, man, relax.

60
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,366
Out of my way, man!

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,566
Fucking...

62
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,899
Asshole. What the fuck is he doing here?

63
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:43,266
He was driving! What was I supposed to do?

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,708
Hands on the table. Eyes on the floor.

65
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,176
Don't look at me. What are you looking at?

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,899
Look out! You're killing him, man.

67
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,899
Get off him! Come on, get up.

68
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,500
Come on!

69
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:54,666
Now! Come on, man!

70
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,200
Son of a bitch.

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Ugh!

72
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,866
Come on. Come on!

73
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,200
Get up! Get up!

74
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,699
Come on! Come on!

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,933
[camera shutters clicking]

76
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,467
Lieutenant,
we were responding to a disturbance call.

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,333
We just stumbled on this shit.

78
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,433
Did any of our boys get hurt?

79
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,333
No. But Rhoades almost got dead.

80
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,200
Got a good shot in the coconut,

81
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,833
but Beckstrom saved his life. Right,
Jensen?

82
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,500
It's true. Put a call in to the Mayor.

83
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,342
Maybe you can squeeze
a medal of valor out of him.

84
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,899
He deserves it.

85
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,632
You okay?

86
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,933
Yeah, I'll live.

87
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,433
Take care of him, okay?

88
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,766
Yeah.

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,200
Good job.

90
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,799
Everybody's here now.
The whole damn circus.

91
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,266
Moose has got his story fixed.

92
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,899
I warned you.

93
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,732
I warned you.

94
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:55,467
You fax the Feds, you watch your back.

95
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,799
Hey, I need to find...

96
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,333
Do me a favor. Check
with the Watch Commander.

97
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:44,366
Tell him it's not my problem.

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,300
Hey, Mirk! We missed you at the ball game,
buddy.

99
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,467
[bangs locker]

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,899
[spits]

101
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:52,799
[all chuckle]

102
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,166
You're a real fucking comedian, Moose.

103
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,608
When are you gonna learn to relax, man?

104
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,200
How long have you got? A month?

105
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,266
A week.

106
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,766
29 years, 11 months,
and 3 weeks, and counting, huh?

107
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,833
Mirk, buddy, you're not gonna make it.

108
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,200
It's that last week,
that's when the ax falls.

109
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,732
[mutters] Shut the fuck up.

110
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,899
Take it easy on them doughnuts.

111
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,166
Shut you mouth.

112
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,899
Tough night. It happens.

113
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:22,400
I ain't gonna lie,
Mirk. I've seen better, man.

114
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,300
Want some aspirin?

115
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,732
Want something to wash it down with?

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,366
How old is this coffee, Mirk?

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,866
I don't know. Four, maybe five days?

118
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,366
Good. I hate it when it's fresh, man.

119
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,899
Are you still on that?

120
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,233
I can't...

121
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,899
You were working with Rhoades.

122
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,266
Lieutenant, listen to me. Mirk is retiring.

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,300
You've gotta rearrange the assignments.
Just let me work with the Moose.

124
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:24,400
Beckstrom, you just saved your partner's
black ass. You know what that means?

125
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,899
That brutality complaint is bullshit.

126
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,632
Yeah, but...

127
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,866
Listen, just listen to me, okay?

128
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:37,166
You were a brave cop who was
protecting his Afro-American partner.

129
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,933
Now, that other complaint's gonna
be bullshit. You want to mess with that?

130
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,266
No...

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,632
No. Good boy! Good boy! Huh?

132
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,166
Best face for the Grand Jury.

133
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,899
You're a good cop. Clean as shit.

134
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,899
Colorblind cop. Hell! They'll probably
put you on the happy news tonight.

135
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,200
[whispers] But Moose wants me to...

136
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,233
Not another word. No more. That's it.

137
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't want to hear about it again.

138
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,833
And get your paperwork all squared away,

139
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,233
but in the meantime,

140
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,266
I know the skipper will want to meet you.

141
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,632
Have you taken Jesus Christ into
your life as your personal Savior yet?

142
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,566
Hey, Sagamaki,
are you trolling for choir boys again?

143
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,233
You can come to church this Sunday

144
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,266
and we can all pray
together. What do you say?

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,675
Hey, Red, don't let him get you alone

146
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,233
at the prayer meeting, huh?

147
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,532
Hey, Lieutenant. This is our new man.

148
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,300
Perfect timing, Mochizuki San.

149
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,400
One more minute and I'd be
over at the crapper taking a shit.

150
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:37,333
I never would've had the opportunity
to meet this new man, Really, thank you.

151
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:41,233
You know,
I can wait outside if you want. [chuckles]

152
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,899
Nah. You're older than most recruits.

153
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,833
I was in the Marine Corps 10 years.

154
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,532
Really? What's your MOS?

155
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,666
3125.

156
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,166
You're an RTO?

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,933
Hmm.

158
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:55,566
I can't help the radio.

159
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,467
How did you get around Affirmative Action?

160
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,233
I told 'em my father's real
name was Kunta Kinte.

161
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:12,566
Look. Suit up and I'll send you on an
orientation ride with Moose and Jensen.

162
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,532
Okay? They'll show you your turf.

163
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,366
All right. Thank you, sir.

164
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,333
I asked him to cut me loose of Rhoades.

165
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,799
Eyler's turned into a fucking old
woman with this Grand Jury shit.

166
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:28,266
Rhoades almost fucked up that little
surprise we had with the chinkies last night.

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,433
They won't try another one of
those gambling den situations

168
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,666
with out cutting us in any time soon,
right?

169
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,899
That's why we need a good man
like you out on the street with him.

170
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,233
God damn it. I mean,
I saved this black ass' life,

171
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,575
and now it comes back to haunt me

172
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,333
I shoulda just let him die...

173
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:47,933
Beck, hey, hey. You're in
the streets out there, not me.

174
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,266
Anything can happen.

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,467
[breathes heavily] Ugh.

176
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,532
One one thousand, two one thousand.

177
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,866
Come on,
man. Enough of this Jane Fonda bullshit.

178
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,766
Come on, get in here. Let's go!

179
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,833
[breathing heavily]

180
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,300
Checked that new dude?

181
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,300
♪ From the halls of Montezuma ♪

182
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,699
[both chuckle]

183
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:12,699
The fool look like he from

184
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,866
Mark Fuhrman Police Academy.

185
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,899
You can all that with just one look?

186
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:21,133
Yeah. They all look like they'll
kiss him now, check it out.

187
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,166
You on for tonight?

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,566
Yeah, man, of course.

189
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,266
You got your macho jeep all
gassed up and ready to go?

190
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,866
I thought you was gonna drive.

191
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,433
No. I'm drinking, you're driving.

192
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:38,632
I'm always driving. How
come you don't drive?

193
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,899
Good looks.

194
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,200
By now you're probably wondering,

195
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,933
"Am I gonna piss my panties
at the first sign of trouble?"

196
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:49,732
Probably. Don't worry about that.
Ms. Jensen here is still pissing hers.

197
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:52,300
[chuckles] Yeah? Well
you can kiss my sweet ass.

198
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,899
I spent some time on the streets.
Two years I had shore patrol.

199
00:09:55,933 --> 00:10:00,300
That's right. If I were you I wouldn't
wave that Marine Corps shit around Eyler.

200
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,933
Why not? I thought his
kid was in the Marine Corps.

201
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,266
Was. Rest in peace.

202
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,866
No shit. How'd he die?

203
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,632
Granada. Friendly fucking fire.

204
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,467
Ain't that some shit? What
else do you want to know?

205
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,632
Hey. 10 o'clock. Ooga-boogas
at the jungle. What do you know?

206
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,933
[Moose] Make a U. [siren]

207
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,766
[Jensen] Ooh, the boogie man!

208
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,233
That's a number one coming up.

209
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:25,433
So what's the lesson,
Andre? What are we supposed to do?

210
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,866
You're a fine example, a credit to
your race. Did that work for you?

211
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,266
I got you here, didn't I?

212
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,433
I know. But what about your promotion?

213
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,842
You look like Shaft. Went to college.

214
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,866
It's more than most detectives.

215
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:39,532
Eyler barely squeezed his ass outta
high school and he's a Lieutenant.

216
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,333
You pissed him off big time.

217
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,899
I don't want to make nobody mad.

218
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,766
Come on. Look at all the minorities.

219
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,300
When's the Department
gonna get with the times?

220
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,866
Hey.

221
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,766
Hi, honey. How are you?

222
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,366
Good. Glad you could make it.

223
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,467
Hi, Rhoades.

224
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,933
Hi, Xeenie.

225
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:58,200
Looks good.

226
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,233
No, I'm gonna get a taco later.

227
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,866
Adventure feeds the soul.

228
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,933
Tacos feed my face.

229
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,366
Aren't you hungry?

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,233
Xeenie made them herself.

231
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,732
Okay. I'll take this one here.

232
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,166
Get down.

233
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,166
Ugh!

234
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,766
You keep your hands on the car.

235
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,166
I got him! get down, man!

236
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,366
That's good. You know I like
diversion with the boys around the hood.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,899
Registration,
everything checks out. They're clean.

238
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,433
See? That don't mean squat to me.

239
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,899
Looks like we got a pair
of hardened criminals here.

240
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:53,500
How do you want to handle this situation,
General?

241
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:55,166
You want me to take care of this?

242
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,266
Yeah, show me the jar handle.

243
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,233
You got yourself a jig on shore leave,

244
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,933
so you need to give 'em the DWA test.

245
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,699
Come on, I didn't do anything.

246
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:06,933
DWA, what's that?

247
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:11,166
Attention. Stand still.
Put your feet together.

248
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,266
All right now.

249
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
All right. Bring your right
forefinger and your thumb up,

250
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,532
and hold on to your right earlobe.

251
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,632
Come on, man. Come on.

252
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,166
Forefinger and your thumb
up to hold your right earlobe.

253
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,433
Okay?

254
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,467
The right.

255
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,233
[cops chuckle]

256
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,566
Go on. Grab it on. Grab it on.

257
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,233
That's very good.

258
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,632
[laughs]

259
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,467
I want you to take your left
forefinger and your thumb,

260
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
and hold on to your left earlobe.

261
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,666
Right here. Very good. Now,
you've done this before?

262
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,333
You've done this before?

263
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:45,333
No, no, you're very good. It's okay.

264
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,632
Okay. Push your jaw out.

265
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,833
Push out your jaw.

266
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,500
Push your jaw out!

267
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:53,467
Push it out. Good.

268
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,866
Breath in and out
through your mouth rapidly.

269
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,532
[cops chuckle]

270
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,866
[both breathe] There you go.

271
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,233
Now say, "Uh!"

272
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,233
Uh. Come on.

273
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,300
Say, "Uh!"

274
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,500
Uh. Uh. Uh.

275
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,166
[chuckles]

276
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,300
Uh. Uh. Uh.

277
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,400
You're DWA, you matched it.

278
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,732
Driving Wild Aboriginal.

279
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,899
Good boy, you passed it,
chief. Now go on. Get outta here.

280
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,200
Go ahead, go.

281
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,632
What about Speedy Gonzalez here, huh?

282
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,242
[in Spanish accent] Hey, you try to run,

283
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,300
we're gonna teach you a lesson.

284
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,233
What do you say, Colonel?

285
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,376
What do you want to do with this one?

286
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,899
Well, we got a lot of work tonight now.

287
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:37,933
All right. Now listen, you use
your feet and you're gonna get beat.

288
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,200
Okay. Hm?

289
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,200
Wait a minute. These
wetbacks got hard heads.

290
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,766
I don't want you to bruise your knuckle.

291
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,200
[chuckles] Oh, ho, ho.

292
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,632
Oh.

293
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:55,200
"X" marks the spot.

294
00:13:55,233 --> 00:14:00,899
Now I just realized, this could
be construed to be police brutality.

295
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,833
And we sure don't want to
be doing anything illegal here.

296
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:07,666
[In Spanish accent] Hey, Paco,
you got a free pass tonight

297
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,433
Get outta my world!

298
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,732
[chuckles]

299
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:15,300
What you say,
muchachos? It's a big world out there.

300
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,532
What is the use of working your tail off

301
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,300
at the FBI if they only
give you a little dinky shield.

302
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,532
You need a real cop shield,
a master shield.

303
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,366
Accepted the world over.

304
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,300
Hi, Michael. Nice badge.

305
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,233
Thank you. Fancy meeting you here.

306
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:56,266
Really? I thought this was
more my thing than yours.

307
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,899
I may have changed since you last saw me.

308
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,933
I could've gone through
a cultural metamorphosis.

309
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:05,333
Hm. I don't think so. Your
baseball hat kinda gives you away.

310
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,532
No. I could change.

311
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,699
I read somewhere that
women like to mold us like clay.

312
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:14,233
Hm. I'm sure you'll make
some lucky girl a nice ashtray.

313
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,666
[both laugh]

314
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:18,166
Alright. Enough bad jokes.

315
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
How come you don't return my calls?

316
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:24,766
I received the files, but, uh,
I haven't had a chance to look at them yet.

317
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,899
Okay. I'm gonna save you a little time.

318
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:31,200
Now listen to this. 25
homicides within the last 8 years.

319
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:35,233
All unsolved. With circumstances
that point to police vigilantism.

320
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,599
Michael, please...

321
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:40,233
From a racist group of cops
that happens to be in my division.

322
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:44,200
Now when I go to pull the files,
the forensics, the lab reports, all that,

323
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,833
they're gone. They turn up missing.

324
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,566
This is not the time...

325
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,166
Wait, hold on, one second.

326
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,766
Now all that's left of the ballistics
reports are the first five killings.

327
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,599
And they match. It's the same gun.

328
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,766
If we get that gun, we can nail these cops.

329
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,233
Michel, I'll look into it.

330
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,200
You look good.

331
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,899
Turn around.

332
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,833
Oh, please. [chuckles]

333
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,500
How's your mom?

334
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:17,899
She's fine.

335
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:22,200
Okay, I gotta go. I promise I'll
look into as soon as possible.

336
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:23,500
Okay? Bye.

337
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:37,266
Go Andre. Go Andre.

338
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,433
Go Andre. Go Andre.

339
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,599
Why not? Why not?

340
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,166
I better get outta here, man.

341
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,333
Okay. Hey, Xeenie, we're taking the cut.

342
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,566
Bye, Dad.

343
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,899
Bye, Xenia.

344
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:53,166
Sorry, I didn't know Anita
Bayard was gonna be here.

345
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,433
You mean to keep me away?

346
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:58,833
Damn. She's stuck up. What'd
she have to say about the files?

347
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,732
She said she's been
busy but she'll get to it.

348
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,866
Yeah. Mm-hm. Sure!

349
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,632
First of all, you keep your
mouth shut and your eyes open.

350
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,266
The faster you learn that,
the faster you get your own car.

351
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,666
Hey, are we gonna get some food any time?

352
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,632
Are you hungry?

353
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,833
Here. Why don't you
have half of my sandwich?

354
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,899
Why don't you come meet the guys?

355
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,233
Nah, I don't want to be born again.

356
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:30,500
Aw, they're not Christians. Only
Mochizuki's a Christian. [chuckles]

357
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,500
They're just regular guys.

358
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:35,233
Moose is a regular guy?

359
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah.

360
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,166
Hey, don't even talk to that old fool, huh?

361
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,866
He's counting the days
until he pulls the pin

362
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,200
thinks everyone's out to dig 'em a grave.

363
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:48,999
[chuckles]

364
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,632
Hey, rookie. You might want to think

365
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,433
about carrying a second gun out there,

366
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,233
something small, easy to get at,

367
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:59,666
a .38 snubby.

368
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:03,467
Now me and most of the boys,
we use dumb dumb hollow points.

369
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,666
They ain't regulation,
like Mr. Rhoades uses,

370
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:10,333
but it'll tear a perp a new
asshole every time, I guarantee.

371
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,666
[all laugh]

372
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,233
Regulations bullets work real well, Moosey,

373
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:15,799
if you know how to shoot straight.

374
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,899
Is that right?

375
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,933
Yeah, baby, that's right.

376
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,933
It's straight when you
shoot it towards your head.

377
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,799
Hey, uh, give me that.

378
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,766
Hey, Rhoades,
you batting fifth on Saturday?

379
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,100
'Cause I was thinking,

380
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,732
maybe you ought to lead off
with your natural speed and all.

381
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:33,166
[all] Oh, ho!

382
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,467
Whatever's right for the team, man.

383
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,866
Well, what a fine attitude, my man.

384
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,333
Because once we get out there,
you are one of us.

385
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,200
You are a Phantom.

386
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,467
[all] Yeah!

387
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,233
[Rhoades] Speaking of baseball,

388
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,699
I'm talking to this new
brother from Union High,

389
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,333
Bat enough, plays first base...

390
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,200
Whoa! I play first...

391
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,732
Don't yank my chain, huh?

392
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,899
And don't be recruiting no more brothers.

393
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,899
I don't want to have to change
the name of the team to The Spooks.

394
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,899
[all] Woo. [chuckles]

395
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,899
You know why I like white girls?

396
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:07,233
[mimics female voice] Because
you get all that screaming!

397
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,632
And you never meet the parents.

398
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,899
[all snicker]

399
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,400
Leave them white girls alone, boy.

400
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:16,233
Did you pull strings to
get this flat top rookie?

401
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,866
Hey, Rhoades, you want to tell me why you
always got some fucking bug up your ass?

402
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,833
Them big innocent watery blue eyes, huh?

403
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,866
But you fast tracked that
fresh Gestapo meat, don't you?

404
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,233
You know why you're brown?

405
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,200
You're so full of shit.

406
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Hey, Becky.

407
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:51,799
Come on, Mirk. Let's give it a try. Come
to my church and we'll all pray together.

408
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,666
Hey, guys. How does that thing go? Uh,

409
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:58,533
Nam yoho renge kyo,
Nam yoho renge [chuckles]

410
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,300
New guy's a nice kid.

411
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:07,300
I'd hate to see him get into any trouble,
Bill.

412
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,266
Well, he's not.

413
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,566
Ugh.

414
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,599
[radio] Becky, what's your twenty?

415
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,833
Southwest 126. What's up, Moose?

416
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:21,200
We're dead in the
water. we got a flat tire,

417
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:25,433
we're not going anywhere for a while but we
got an 1124 coming up. Can you take that?

418
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,799
You got it, Moose.

419
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,200
Roger that, thank you very much, buddy.

420
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:33,266
That's Disciple's territory, man.

421
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,476
It's a suspicious brand of vehicle, man.

422
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
What's your fucking problem?

423
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,766
Let Moose cover his own area.

424
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,333
Hey, we're cops, we help each other out.
That's what we're supposed to do, right?

425
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,799
Don't fucking tell me how to police, man.

426
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,666
I tell you how to slam dunk?

427
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,333
[Rhoades] Something
ain't right. This is bullshit.

428
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,533
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's check it out.

429
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:02,799
Call for backup.

430
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,799
Come on, man. It's a pussy move.

431
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,300
Becky, call for backup.

432
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,899
Okay. Whatever you say.

433
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,433
All right. I'll go in here,
you come round the side.

434
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:11,699
What am I, a rookie?

435
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,366
No, you're not a rookie, dude.

436
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,300
I got your backup. [snickers]

437
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,866
You know what I mean?
See this stuff right here?

438
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,566
Yeah. You know?

439
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,533
[meow]

440
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,732
[rat squeaks]

441
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,200
What's that?

442
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,500
[gunshots]

443
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,833
[unloaded gun]

444
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,566
Oh, Rhoades,
what did you step into this time?

445
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,899
Don't let him get away.

446
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
[panting] Calling 30 Upper West Park Way

447
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,433
by the Old Mill, officer needs assistance.

448
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,166
Officer needs a coroner.

449
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,300
Oh, shit.

450
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,460
Okay, clear guys. Clear guys.

451
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,266
Get this goddamn shirt outta here.

452
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,599
Gimme that shirt.

453
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:08,533
You want to tell me what happened here?

454
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,300
Gimme that fucking shirt!

455
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,666
Come on, man. Come on.

456
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:19,233
Come on,
you got your partner killed, Rhoades.

457
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,766
You unloaded my fucking gun.

458
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,533
You want to pin this on me, huh?

459
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:24,266
I'll kick your fucking ass.

460
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,799
Come on, let's get some Affirmative Action,
you fucking monkey.

461
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,833
I'll chop your head.

462
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,242
Are you crazy? You're putting yourself

463
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,899
and all of us in the fucking politics.

464
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:35,599
I thought you'd finally
be in the fight. Come on!

465
00:24:35,632 --> 00:24:37,400
Get your hands off of me.

466
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:40,433
There's more of them than
us. You'll just end up dead.

467
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,200
Get your hands off me. You hear me?

468
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,133
Come on, man. Fuck!

469
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,400
Look, I'm not saying, "Let it go."

470
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:51,699
You just gotta be smarter than them.

471
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,266
There's gotta be an investigation, okay?

472
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,233
I don't know why Becks was
carrying loose rounds in his pocket

473
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,200
but I'll look into it personally.

474
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,533
Not loose rounds. My rounds. In my gun.

475
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:27,533
Looks, Rhoades, I don't think you had
anything to do with Beckstrom's death.

476
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,500
I need a new partner.

477
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,766
Yeah, well, psss,
we're a little thin right now.

478
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,632
I'll take the new kid.

479
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,233
DeBruler? No way, I got plans for him.

480
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:42,766
It's gonna take me about a week and I'll,
um, redo the schedule, okay?

481
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,166
I need a new partner now.

482
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,333
Are you trying to tell me
how to run my station?

483
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:51,599
I request permission to contact Personnel
Division for a hearing to determine...

484
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:54,233
I need a rat. Like you've been going to IA,
huh?

485
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,933
You leave me no choice
but to go to the press.

486
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,833
You? Go to the press? No! You are a cop!

487
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,699
What did you do going hooking
yourself up with that rookie?

488
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,166
Will you be my partner?

489
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,366
No way. Your partners die.

490
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,500
I spent 15 years on the street
to get my cushy day, man.

491
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,233
No sweat, man, my partners don't die.

492
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,566
Yeah, I know. I know.

493
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,166
All right, first of all,

494
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,942
if DeBruler doesn't
grade out in my evaluation,

495
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,933
you got yourself in the
spot that much earlier

496
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:22,233
for my mankind.

497
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:26,933
See? There he goes again,
looking for ways to piss them off.

498
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:29,699
You fellows go ahead. All right?

499
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:31,200
See you later, man.

500
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,300
Get that thing outta your ear.

501
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,533
Okay, check this out.

502
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:38,599
If I'm his training officer

503
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:40,200
it's up to me to ask his TO

504
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,266
to ground him in investigating techniques.

505
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,675
Mh-hm. Like looking through all the files

506
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:48,333
and using his name on the paperwork

507
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:51,732
so as not to raise any red flags?

508
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:54,266
Someone's gotta do it. man.

509
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,400
Look, you'd better start growing
eyes in the back of your head, son.

510
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:03,166
That missing bullet stint.
That was just a first step.

511
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,200
That's the whole thing. Now,
see this rookie

512
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:10,200
he's my best chance to staying alive.
He's too green to put a bullet in my back.

513
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:12,166
Yes, weak.

514
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,366
Listen. He's too naive to know
what I'm doing. He's my best shot.

515
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,266
Okay.

516
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,233
Just keep looking for shit to step in.

517
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,833
Go find yourself some nice fresh turd

518
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,866
and don't forget to take off your shoes

519
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,500
and let it get all up between your toes.

520
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,899
I give it up to Jesus, boy.

521
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:31,566
[bagpipes] Sniffs.

522
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,599
[Commander] Honor guard.

523
00:27:57,632 --> 00:28:00,200
Load!

524
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,599

525
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:04,732
Honor guard. Volley!

526
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,200
Honor guard.

527
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,433
Aim!

528
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,599
Honor guard.

529
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:12,233
Fire! [gunshots]

530
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:15,533
Honor guard. Fire! [gunshots]

531
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:19,300
Honor guard. Fire! [gunshots]

532
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Thanks.

533
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:47,533
So it was your idea, huh, Moose?

534
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:50,166
I don't think I know
what you're talking about.

535
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,166
The Rhoades thing without my permission.

536
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,400
We got a nigger problem...

537
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,933
We don't use that kind of
language here. Understand?

538
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,166
You're not doing a damn thing about it.

539
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,632
So you were gonna do
something about it. You moron.

540
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:06,200
If you're gonna be a decision maker
you better look at the big picture.

541
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:09,467
There's a Grand Jury out there
and you just got their attention.

542
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,266
So now Rhoades is a problem.

543
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,200
A problem I gotta deal with.

544
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,666
Hey, FBI lady.

545
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,300
Can I give you a lift?

546
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,933
I'm with my boss and
friends. Now's not a good time.

547
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,266
Anita.

548
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,366
I need someone to talk to.

549
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,899
Just for a minute.

550
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,632
I'll give you a ride home. Okay?

551
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:16,233
Michael, it's starting to rain.

552
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,866
When are you gonna get a
real car? I mean there's no roof.

553
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:22,233
Who do I contact considering
that another cop is trying to kill me?

554
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:24,599
It's not my department.

555
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:28,566
I tried going through channels,
they got the whole system rigged.

556
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,333
I get no support. They
draft all the Hitlers they want.

557
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:33,266
They brought a new one this week.

558
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,933
Michael,
you can't go off like a loose cannon.

559
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,666
You do more harm than
good. You're not looking at...

560
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,766
At the big picture. Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,166
If you won't even give me backup,

562
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,799
what am I supposed to do?

563
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay. Now let me ask you a question.

564
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,133
Where the hell are we going?

565
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:55,400
[Keith] Who are those guys?

566
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,200
They're ours, cops, downtown around.

567
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,166
I'm glad you could make it, Keith.

568
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,533
Thanks for inviting me.

569
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,433
You're putting him with Rhoades?

570
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:04,899
Can it, Moose.

571
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,933
Trying to find out how
the other half lives?

572
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,899
Back off, Tavola. It was my decision.

573
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,467
If I was running this outfit...

574
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,833
Well you're not running this outfit. Okay?

575
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,632
Why don't you go help those guys, son?

576
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,799
[Moose] Bon voyage, Becks.

577
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,699
So what do you think of all this?

578
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:28,333
I feel like I belong here.

579
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:31,200
That's why I became a police officer.

580
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:33,632
To find people like myself.

581
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,500
Every last one of these
guys proved themselves.

582
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,732
They proved people.
Proved it. Not just talk.

583
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,533
I want to prove myself.
I'm stuck with Rhoades.

584
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,933
Well, you'll get the chance.

585
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:49,599
Troublemakers like your new partner
and all that Affirmative Action bullshit

586
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:54,366
it's on the way out. We still have to
tolerate minorities, but not for long.

587
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,566
How long do I have to wait?

588
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,300
Something happens to Rhoades, pffff.

589
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,799
He'll get a full Department funeral,
just like Beckstrom got,

590
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,200
we'll all be there.

591
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
[Eyler] You remind me of my son.

592
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,833
[Keith] I do?

593
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:14,566
Yeah. He would've done the right thing,
too.

594
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,799
Hey, Moose!

595
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,732
That is for Beckstrom.

596
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:20,300
I don't think he's gonna miss it. Do you?

597
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,933
Yeah, you're real big on
tradition. Aren't you, Moose?

598
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:24,200
Huh?

599
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,500
He's a piece of work.

600
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,933
Yeah, but he's a good cop.

601
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:32,632
Yeah.

602
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,933
All right, here we are. Come on.

603
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:38,166
Thank you. Wow!

604
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,500
Yup. Check it out.

Isn't this this a trip
down memory lane here?

609
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,233
Yeah. [chuckles]

610
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:52,899
Michael, I need to get back.

611

Hey, we just climbed, we're already here

612
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,833
come on, you're here.

613
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:58,933

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,699
Do you remember that?

702
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:09,500
I know, I know, it's just that you
know how bad I want these guys.

703
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:13,266
I mean, how many chances
are we gonna get like this?

704
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,732
They had me running license plates scams.

705
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:17,533
Oh.

706
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:26,533
Fuck it. What's the difference?

707
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:30,166
All right? [growls]

708
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,632
You know what? It's nothing.

709
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,899
[thunder]

710
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:39,166
Ah. I love this adrenalin.

711
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,933
Hm. That worries me.

712
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:43,233
[both chuckle]

713
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:45,833
Hey, Moose, How you doing this morning?

714
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:50,266
Oh, no, rookie. First day I gotta get
your coffee for ya. How do you like it?

715
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,533
I can get my own coffee.

716
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:53,266
You sure?

717
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,200
Don't you like it black?
Black is beautiful. No? Okay.

718
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,833
Moose, look at you. Sunglasses?

719
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,666
Must have been a rough night, huh?

720
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,333
Who was the lucky fella?

721
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,732
That's Phil Ericsson. My Rabbi.

722
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,632
He adopted me when I was
a rookie cop. About your age.

723
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:15,266
Yeah? What happened to him?

724
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,366
Ambushed.

725
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
He went after some drug
scumbags on his own time.

726
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:21,400
Five of them jumped him, cut him to pieces,

727
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,899
dumped him in a playground,
took his gun and badge.

728
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,266
Damn. No shit.

729
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,433
Next day they were flashing
him around the jungle like a trophy.

730
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,766
Did they ever get caught?

731
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:33,166
You mean arrested? No.

732
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,266
We turned the heat up,
we had this town by its balls.

733
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,133
But no proof, no case. Nothing.

734
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,599
And then somehow,
uh [chuckles] they started turning up dead.

735
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:48,899
One by one by one.

736
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:51,233
All five of them.

737
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,799
What happened?

738
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,599
Depends who you listen to.

739
00:40:57,632 --> 00:41:00,366
If you ask some of the people around here,

740
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,666
they'll tell you Ericsson did it.

741
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,632
Ericsson? You mean, like his ghost?

742
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:09,166
Well, they say he came back from the grave,
hunted them down,

743
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,233
and took his gun and badge back.

744
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:13,166
It's bullshit.

745
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,166
It's a legend.

746
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,899
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

747
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:21,200
I'm dead serious.

748
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,500
You listen to me, son,

749
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:30,533
those are the people that
you're dealing with around here.

750
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,732
You know,
that banana seems to fit with you.

751
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:36,233
Oh, man,
let me know if you're interested, baby.

752
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,699
I got it in for you.

753
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:40,732
[chuckles]

754
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:43,233
Hey, hey, rookie man.

755
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:44,933
Banana? Apple?

756
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:46,300
No.

757
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,567
No cholesterol. You sure?

758
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,866
How about a Tic Tac to
keep your breath fresh?

759
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,467
My breath's fine.

760
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,899
How do you get your hair flat like that?

761
00:41:54,933 --> 00:42:00,400
Now here's the vehicle. Yeah,
mine. You're going on a soul patrol.

762
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,266
Looking good.

763
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,433
All right. Hey, Moose. Right on,
brother. Stay black.

764
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,632
So where are you from?

765
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,233
Hm, from Tennessee.

766
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:22,467
Well, Tennessee,
not everybody's right for this job.

767
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,400
Yeah, but you'll give me
the benefit of the doubt, right?

768
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:26,933
Absolutely, baby.

769
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:29,732
So it's not just me you're
messing with here, right?

770
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,766
It's more of a, a what, a rookie thing?

771
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,233
It's you if you can't do the job.

772
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,366
Sounds like you expect me to screw up.

773
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,866
I expect everybody to screw up.

774
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:43,400
Maybe my being here's a mistake. Hm?

775
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:45,333
Personally, I think it's a mistake

776
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:48,567
to send inexperienced, rookie, redneck cops

777
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,200
into patrolling minority
neighborhoods. Yes.

778
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,899
But your folks make the rules,
not mine. Right?

779
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:55,400
[hip hop music]

780
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,766
In this blue uniform, we become a target.

781
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:00,866
Doesn't matter if you like Garth Brooks,
I like Snoop Dog,

782
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:03,200
we don't back each other up, we're dead.

783
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:04,200
Hm.

784
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:06,933
Beckstrom got killed. He didn't back me up.

785
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:09,899
So now Beckstrom's a dead mother fucker.

786
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:13,866
And I'm alive.

787
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:17,833
Which way are you gonna go?

788
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:24,300
[Rhoades] We could be black
man and boy white. Right?

789
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,632
What's this?

790
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:26,766
Got a call.

791
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:29,300
What call? There was no call.

792
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,266
Then stay in the car.

793
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:41,166
[radio] Hey, Rhoades. What's your twenty?

794
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,833
Yeah, he's outta the car.

795
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:48,200
DeBruler? Hey, you wash up real good. I
don't want to see any charcoal on your car

796
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,200
[both chuckle]

797
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,333
Man, I told you before,
it's chocolate, not charcoal.

798
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,233
[loud heavy metal music]

799
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:02,533
All right. Hands up. Touch your head.

800
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:03,799
[Neil] What the hell...

801
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,899
Get the fuck up.

802
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,732
You have no right...

803
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:09,233
I've the right of my gun and night stick.

804
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:10,300
On head. How old are you?

805
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,433
14.

806
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,933
Shouldn't you be at school?

807
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm late.

808
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:16,899
32 days of truancy is pretty fucking late.

809
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:18,500
Oh, my God. What's happening?

810
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,400
Back off, lady! This your daughter?

811
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:21,933
Yes. Her name is Marsha.

812
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:25,266
[Neil] You can't bust
somebody for skipping school.

813
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,799
How about contempt of a cop,
huh? Or disorderly conduct?

814
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:35,666
Uh-oh. Possession of controlled substances.

815
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:37,766
Man, those are my cigarettes.

816
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:42,200
No. My field test tells me when I get these
bad boys back from the lab, they're pot.

817
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:45,200
You're in a world of
trouble. A world of trouble.

818
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:46,300
Everything okay?

819
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,433
I'm on parole.

820
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,799
Oh, great.

821
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:51,366
Then you shouldn't have close encounters

822
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,866
of the third grade. ain't that right,
DeBruler?

823
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,599
That's right.

824
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:57,833
Please, let him go. Mother, please.

825
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:59,899
Hey, hey, girl! Look at me.

826
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,899
Now Mom can't do anything for you.

827
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,732
Come on, you'll never see me again.

828
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:04,933
Neal!

829
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:07,400
Look, man, you know her idea totally, okay?

830
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,866
She told me she was 18.

831
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:11,599
Come on, man.

832
00:45:11,632 --> 00:45:14,799
Officer, come on, I mean,
maybe he's telling the truth.

833
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah, man, no shit. That's the truth.

834
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,942
I'm gonna let you got this time, all right?

835
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:21,866
[removes handcuffs]

836
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:24,266
Come back for seconds, and I'll...

837
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,333
Yeah!

838
00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:27,500
Now you.

839
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:28,899
What time is class?

840
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:29,732
8:30.

841
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:32,366
No! Class is gonna be 8:27 for you.

842
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,266
I want your ass there every day.
Early! In that class, you got me?

843
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,500
Now you're late,
or you miss one more class,

844
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,866
you come in late,
you even fart in study hall,

845
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:45,233
and I'll send you to a foster home at the
Born Again Missionary. Do you understand?

846
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:46,166
Yes.

847
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,300
Am I clear?

848
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,899
That's enough. That's enough.

849
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,567
Come on.

850
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,632
Button up your shirt.

Christ.

852
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:04,366
For a second, I thought you weren't coming.

853
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,599
I told her to keep that
prick out of the house

854
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:09,166
and get back to school
and she tells me to fuck off.

855
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,833
She doesn't listen to me any more, Rhoades

856
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:13,766
like, do you think she's having sex?

857
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:16,732
I haven't had a man over in 17 months.

858
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:20,266
Listen, come by the diner and I'll
bake you a hot apple pie. Okay?

859
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,333
This is my partner,
DeBruler, he loves hot pie.

860
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,799
DeBruler?

861
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,467
Yeah, he's new in town.

862
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,632
What an exotic name.

863
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,300
Listen. You like home cooking?

864
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,533
Yeah.

865
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,300
Come by the diner, I'll fix you up.

866
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,400
I'll bring him by.

867
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:35,567
Thanks, Rhoades.

868
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,933
You come by!

869
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:39,666
Nice to see yourself
bonding with the community.

870
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:43,599
You wanted to put your big nose into the
mix, I didn't want you to feel left out.

871
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:46,567
Oh, we gotta watch each other's backs,
right?

872
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,833
Exactly. You're learning. Right.

873
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:54,899
Uh-oh. Flowers?

874
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:59,866
Let me guess. Could this be for
a certain Anita Bayard of the FBI?

875
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,866
Why don't you take
you're old ass back inside.

876
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:05,632
Leave me alone. Why don't you?

877
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:09,732
Listen to me. Take it real easy.
Go slow. Women like that shit.

878
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:12,632
You know what I mean,
you sort of move in...

879
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:16,266
You know what I'm saying?

880
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,166
I don't think that's her thing.
You know what I'm saying?

881
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,300
I'm not talking about
that. I'm talking about...

882
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:26,632
You know... doo, da, da, baby.

883
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:31,233
Look, why don't you go home and
dance with that big woman of yours

884
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,233
and quit giving the kid love talk.

885
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:35,400
I am the Master of Love.

886
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:40,233
Just because there's snow on the roof don't
mean there ain't no fire in the furnace.

887
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:42,599
Andre,

888
00:47:42,632 --> 00:47:44,833
ain't that much snow up there on the roof.

889
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:48,366
Well, you know grass don't
grow on a busy sidewalk.

890
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,567
[laughs]

891
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,266
Come on, now. Remember. Barefoot.
Hm? Real slow. They like that shit.

892
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,500
Counter. Huh? Brother Andre,
he's your tit man.

893
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:01,200
Get the action going. All right?

894
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:02,500
Go, Andre. [chuckles]

895
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:03,567
All right.

896
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,599
Hey, pretty lady.

897
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:22,866
I got something for you.

898
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,599
Michael.

899
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:28,500
What do you say, uh, no baseball hat,

900
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,899
no pressure and um,

901
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:34,699
thanks for being there the other day.

902
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,567
Bye. Bye.

903
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:51,899
Hey,
Moose. What's that? You had then do two?

904
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:53,200
Yeah.

905
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:55,866
No. No. I got two.

906
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,200
Listen to me, Dopey.

907
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,866
There were three of them,
I got two of them.

908
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:05,200
What are you arguing about?
Who's got the most flea bites?

909
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,899
[Moose] Hey, why don't you
mind your own business, all right?

910
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:11,233
Fuck you. I got two.

911
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:12,732
[laughs]

912
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,533
[hip hop music]

913
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:26,166
Call backup.

914
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,632
We need backup at South Drive.

915
00:49:56,567 --> 00:50:01,200
[cars roar and sirens]

916
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:03,166
[cop] Freeze!

917
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,699
Let's get outta here.

918
00:50:04,732 --> 00:50:06,732
[shouting]

919
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:08,899
Everybody freeze. Lift your hands.

920
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:12,866
Down! Down!

921
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:14,533
You motherfucking asshole!

922
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:16,300
Hands behind your head. Now!

923
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,567
Put your hands up.

924
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,599
[cop] Get down! Get down! Down!

925
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:21,899
Come on, get down!

926
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:24,166
Get your ass over here.

927
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:31,632
Come on. Get up now.

928
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,400
What the fuck are you looking at?

929
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:34,899
[sprays] Ah!

930
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:39,333
[cop] Get him. The gun.

931
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:40,899
Mirk, get back to the fucking car.

932
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:43,300
You only got a couple
days. Go back to the car.

933
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:47,233
I know you, don't I? You're the
brother that did Beckstrom, huh?

934
00:50:47,266 --> 00:50:48,599
DeBruler!

935
00:50:58,799 --> 00:50:59,933
[cop] Freeze!

936
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:07,966
[gunshots]

937
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:12,200
The next time, let your spear
chucking partner do the running.

938
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,233
That's what they're good at,

939
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:17,400
besides, who knows? You lay back,
let Rhoades do the chase

940
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:21,400
and maybe Junior there puts a round
in them before he gets plugged. Let's go.

941
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,699
He's just a kid. He's only what,
12 years old?

942
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:26,200
No. He's a fucking animal. They're all are.

943
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,467
That's the way it is.
Don't you trust nobody.

944
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,933
They hate us, and we hate them. All right?

945
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:33,567
At least we got that punk
who killed Beckstrom.

946
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,200
Fuck! who said? Look,
Rhoades doesn't get in the way

947
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:39,866
of the shine who killed Becky. It's simple.

948
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:41,433
I see what you mean.

949
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,333
Your partner turned his back on you

950
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,933
the same way he did on Beckstrom.

951
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:48,200
And that's the bottom line. Look,
Rhoades is one of them.

952
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:52,266
If he had his way he'd badge any of
those goddamn animals over you any time.

953
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,833
You understand me?

954
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:58,599
You guys waiting for him to expire or what?

955
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:06,632
Hey, DeBruler! Power to the people, right?

956
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:15,866
Hey, DeBruler! Power to the people, right?

957
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,366
[nurse] All right, fellas,
you're outta here.

958
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,899
Out that out. Damn!

959
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:21,533
I thought I was being released.

960
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,699
The Doctor Bayard wants to talk to you.

961
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:25,899
Hey, momma, there's nothing wrong with him.

962
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,166
Look. I'm serious. Come on.

963
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,500
Hey, rook.

964
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:33,467
Thank you.

965
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,200
I'm sorry if I let you down.

966
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:37,233
Look, just get better. Okay?

967
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:40,533
You scare me like that again and
I'll send you that nurse for a month.

968
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:43,933
All right.

969
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:45,233
Thanks for coming.

970
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:49,799
Yeah. Get well.

971
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,933
[Rhoades] Hey. What's happening?

972
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:53,732
What are you doing here?

973
00:52:53,766 --> 00:52:56,933
Came by to see how bad
your big-ass square head was.

974
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,233
You okay?

975
00:52:58,266 --> 00:52:59,533
Yeah.

976
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,266
Nowhere they're going.

977
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,766
Listen, you know what? I'm a little tired.

978
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:06,500
Cool. Cool. I'll leave.

979
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:08,632
I'll tell you something, though, man.

980
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:12,433
My first shooting,
a little Mexican girl got killed,

981
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:16,166
about the same age as that kid today.

982
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,433
Look, I'm fine.

983
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:19,899
All right?

984
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,899
I don't even know why the fuck you're here.

985
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:24,833
Why are you doing this?

986
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:25,866
Doing what?

987
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:29,166
Acting all buddy buddy
with me around the guys,

988
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,732
why are you doing that?

989
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:33,467
Afraid they're won't let
you into their little clan?

990
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,400
That's why you're doing it, isn't it?

991
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,366
Kicking me out.

992
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,233
I guess I made a mistake.

993
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:42,866
Yeah.

994
00:53:42,899 --> 00:53:45,799
Doctor Bayer here for your checkup.

995
00:53:49,632 --> 00:53:50,933
Shit!

996
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:52,899
You want to tell me about this?

997
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:54,732
Huh?

998
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:57,400
Come on, man. What about you?

999
00:53:57,433 --> 00:54:02,567
Can you tell what this FBI lady do?

1000
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:04,866
I'm FBI.

1001
00:54:04,899 --> 00:54:06,433
You couldn't tell me that?

1002
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:11,567
Stay out of it!

1003
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,899
You guys after the Phantoms?

1004
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,933
That's privileged information.

1005
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:16,799
Now why would you cut me outta that?

1006
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,899
I've been trying all this
time to get the FBI involved.

1007
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:21,866
Man, I was running a cover.

1008
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:23,933
You were messing with it from the word go.

1009
00:54:23,966 --> 00:54:26,933
I didn't know who you were, motherfucker.

1010
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:28,933
Do we understand something here?

1011
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,200
My life is on the line.

1012
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:32,933
They're not trying to kill you or you,

1013
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:34,500
They've been after me!

1014
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:36,732
I don't know whose
battle you think this is.

1015
00:54:36,766 --> 00:54:37,833
It's mine!

1016
00:54:37,866 --> 00:54:38,933
Bullshit.

1017
00:54:38,966 --> 00:54:40,467
No. It is mine!

1018
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,933
If you jeopardize my agent's cover...

1019
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:44,699
Why would I do that?

1020
00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:46,899
Is that logical? Huh?

1021
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:49,766
I don't even know what to say to you.

1022
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,599
Alright then, Michael.

1023
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:55,799
What you gonna do?

1024
00:54:55,833 --> 00:55:00,433
You could blow this sky high.

1025
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,266
I think we can try real hard,

1026
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,699
we can pretend we don't get along too well,
huh?

1027
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:13,833
For how long do you know Anita?

1028
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:15,833
I like you hick accent better, man.

1029
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:17,833
Look, my Mom's really from Tennessee,

1030
00:55:17,866 --> 00:55:20,732
so you can stop with all
the fucking insults, okay?

1031
00:55:20,766 --> 00:55:22,899
515 responding.

1032
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:29,233
Get your fucking foot off the dash.

1033
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:30,699
Honey, look at this.

1034
00:55:30,732 --> 00:55:33,300
Mommy will be right back.

1035
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,433
[children talk]

1036
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:40,467
Over here!

1037
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,200
Thank God, you're here.

1038
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:45,366
There's something down
there. You gotta do something.

1039
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,567
All right. We got it. Okay. Thank you.

1040
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,567
[children play and giggle]

1041
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,567
I said go back!

1042
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:06,333
Aw, look at this, brand-new fucking shoes.

1043
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:13,899
Aw, look at this, brand-new fucking shoes.

1044
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:19,366
Oh, man. Check this out.

1045
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,266
Oh, God. [sighs]

1046
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,266
This is a handcuff mark.

1047
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,500
That's for the coroner for to decide.

1048
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:31,632
No, that's for the coroner to
confirm. It's a handcuff mark.

1049
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,233
This kid was beaten to death.

1050
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,666
We got two more over here.

1054
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,200
Fucking Moose.

Flip top.

1056
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:50,200
Tavola always breaks
the flip top off his beer can.

1057
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:53,366
The night of Beckstrom's funeral
these kids were hanging around.

1058
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,766
Then you're a witness.

1059
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,300
No. It puts them at the scene.

1060
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,300
Just can't tie it... Son of a bitch.

00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:07,766
Moose and Grant, I heard them
argue over who got credit for the kills.

1064
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,533
They said that exactly?

1065
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:11,567
The bastards keep score.

1066
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,632
You know what? We ain't got
shit. Nothing in a court of law.

1067
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,799
All we have is three
dead kids and a flip top.

1068
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,266
Moose didn't beat them
to death with a beer can.

1226
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:21,666
What the fuck do you do that for?

1227
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,533
I didn't do it. You did it.

1228
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:25,866
When you tried to jump me asshole.

1229
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:26,933
[blows whistle]

1230
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:28,600
[alarms set off] No. No!

1231
01:10:28,632 --> 01:10:31,600
[jailer] You're hurting
me. He's attacking me.

1232
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,366
[alarms and jailer yelling]

1233
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,866
[Potter] No. This is s set up.

1234
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,567
I didn't do nothing. It's a set up.

1235
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,666
Hey, yo'll. I didn't do anything. Nothing!

1236
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,833
[Potter] No. I didn't do nothing.

1237
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:45,300
[clanking]

1238
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:49,300
[Potter] I didn't do it! Agh!

1239
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:55,300
[general shouting and swearing]

1240
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:58,666
Go!

1241
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:01,400
Come on, will ya? Take a shot.

1242
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:03,433
[alarms, shouting and blows]

1243
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:11,467
Come on!

1244
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Come on!

1245
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:24,366
Agh! Ugh.

1246
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,333
[yelling stops]

1247
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:33,866
Hm.

1248
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:37,233
What's this word? E - X - C - A...

1249
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:39,699
What are you,
nuts? It's not an "X", it's an "S".

1250
01:11:39,732 --> 01:11:41,799
"Escape". Come on.

1251
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:43,433
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

1252
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:46,866
"Prisoner fell downstairs
attempting escape."

1253
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:49,632
So this how it goes down,
nobody's gonna question it?

1254
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,866
Don't worry about it.
You'll get used to it.

1255
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:55,567
No one's gonna question a sworn
statement from all these officers.

1256
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,433
Excuse me, can I borrow you a second?

1257
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:58,567
Yeah, sure.

1258
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,533
Where are you going?

1259
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:07,266
It's no problem, a little police business.

1260
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,866
Hey, Kojak,
why don't you watch your back, huh?

1261
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:11,799
Tell the Lieutenant what you told me.

1262
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,567
Bring me the log.

1263
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,732
Tell the Lieutenant, not the whole room.

1264
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:19,300
[Ernie] Okay.

1265
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,533
Every rookie officer that came
out of the Academy is in here,

1266
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:24,400
where they did guard duty, how long,

1267
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:25,799
their final assignment...

1268
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:29,833
Ernie, cut to the chase. Show
him what you showed me.

1269
01:12:29,866 --> 01:12:32,266
I checked the log.

1270
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,699
DeBruler's name was put in
there in the Warden's office.

1271
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:38,266
So what are you getting at?

1272
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,833
It's a fake. The warden
doesn't make entries in the log.

1273
01:12:41,866 --> 01:12:44,799
So I look around, checked around.

1274
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,567
That guy never worked here.

1275
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,366
So how does the name get in the book?

1276
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,666
Someone with clout
must've called the warden's

1277
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:56,567
and said they want it to look like
this guy did his jail assignment here.

1278
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,166
But who?

1279
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,567
What the hell's the difference?

1280
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,632
IA, prosecutor's office.

1281
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:04,632
The point is this bastard is under cover.

1282
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,600
And he's taking a long hard look at us.

1283
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:11,166
So Bill, maybe I'm not such
a stupid moron after all, huh?

1284
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,799
Relax, Moose, will ya?

1285
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,766
So what you gonna do about
this? What more do you need?

1286
01:13:15,799 --> 01:13:19,933
Look, I'll take care of it. Alright?

1287
01:13:19,966 --> 01:13:23,600
Thanks.

1288
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:24,933
Fellas!

1289
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:28,600
I think it's time for
a little trip to Code 7.

1290
01:13:28,632 --> 01:13:32,333
I thought we were going out
in the street to find Mirk's killer.

1291
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:36,666
Short stop. Gotta get the right
weapon for the right job, right fellas?

1292
01:13:36,699 --> 01:13:43,732
[all] Right!

1293
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:46,366
[knocking on door]

1294
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,300
Keith, did you forget your keys again?

1295
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:56,567
[gasps]

1296
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,933
Waiting for DeBruler in your church dress?

1297
01:13:58,966 --> 01:14:00,833
What are you doing here?

1298
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:04,300
I came about getting a warrant,

1299
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:07,266
but maybe you don't have
time for business right now, huh?

1300
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,400
Are those my files?

1301
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:12,400
The ones you pretend not to read?

1302
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:20,433
Yes.

1303
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:26,200
You based your operation on my work, huh?

1304
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:28,233
Or is that none of my business too?

1305
01:14:28,266 --> 01:14:29,833
We wanted to tell you.

1306
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:32,600
I know, I just don't really
see the big picture too well

1307
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:36,266
You two put a whole new meaning
in undercover work here now.

1308
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,666
Is this about your file or is
it about who I sleep with?

1309
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:42,467
It's about being used.

1310
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,567
I don't mind being useful.

1311
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,400
I mind being used. There's a difference.

1312
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:49,400
Micheal, wait.

1313
01:14:49,433 --> 01:14:53,166
You wanted the FBI to get
involved? We got involved.

1314
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,600
You deal with these
pigheaded fools everyday?

1315
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:57,500
Do you think the feds are in a hurry

1316
01:14:57,533 --> 01:15:00,600
to rush in and bust a bunch of racist cops?

1317
01:15:00,632 --> 01:15:03,467
I've had to plot to make this happen.

1318
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,333
I sent the man that I love undercover,
not for the promotion

1319
01:15:08,366 --> 01:15:11,699
but because I care about stopping them.

1320
01:15:11,732 --> 01:15:15,666
Because I care about you.

1321
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,732
That's the truth.

1322
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:25,567
[pager]

1323
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:33,600
Oh, shit.

1324
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:35,699
What's wrong?

1325
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:37,300
They're on to your boy.

1326
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:42,799
Thanks for letting me known.

1327
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,600
Keith's cover's been blown.

1328
01:15:44,632 --> 01:15:47,833
The quickest we can mobilize is an hour.

1329
01:15:47,866 --> 01:15:51,500
If the Phantoms are on to DeBruler,
he may not have an hour.

1330
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:53,933
Well, maybe they won't do anything.

1331
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,732
Now they know he's FBI,
maybe they won't mess with him.

1332
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,732
Now they killed Mirkovich.

1333
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:03,333
He's one of them and they blew
his ass away with Ericsson's gun.

1334
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:06,366
The best shot is to get
me that warrant. Okay?

1335
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:14,400
I'm going to Code Seven. Get me the
warrant now. I need it now. Right away!

1336
01:16:18,632 --> 01:16:26,632
[suspense music]

1337
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:36,666
[suspense music]

1338
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:52,632
[crack]

1339
01:16:54,666 --> 01:17:02,666
[crack]

1340
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:11,500
[hammers]

1341
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:18,732
[hammers]

1342
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:26,766
[sound of train passing by]

1343
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:36,799
[sound of train passing by]

1344
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,866
Lieutenant. Moose.

1345
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:16,333
[Jensen] Isn't that the Rhoads' car?

1346
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:18,766
Son of a bitch, it is.

1347
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:25,200
Go!

1348
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:32,632
There comes a time in every man's
life when he has to take a stand.

1349
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,632
Hey, Moose. What's the deal, man?

1350
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:37,467
Get the hell outta here.

1351
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,799
[male] Go. Go. Go.

1352
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:46,833
[male] Move! Move!

1353
01:18:50,732 --> 01:18:52,732
[Moose] Rhoades?

1354
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:57,732
[Moose] Whoa! Hold your fire!

1355
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,632
[Moose] You shouldn't be here.

1356
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:02,400
You know that, don't you?

1357
01:19:02,433 --> 01:19:06,766
[pulls trigger]

1358
01:19:06,799 --> 01:19:10,699
The jig is up.

1359
01:19:10,732 --> 01:19:18,732
[sniggers]

1360
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,600
Hey, come on.

1361
01:19:24,632 --> 01:19:25,567
[Rhoades] Huh?

1362
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,632
Hey!

1363
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:33,467
Come on, bitch, I'll treat you like a king.

1364
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,933
Get up, fucker.

1365
01:19:34,966 --> 01:19:36,600
Come on, Moose.

1366
01:19:36,632 --> 01:19:39,333
That's right, I'm right here, baby.

1367
01:19:39,366 --> 01:19:40,833
Let him free.

1368
01:19:40,866 --> 01:19:46,467
Come on! Agh!

1369
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,766
Get up, man!

1370
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:51,799
Get up, Moose!

1371
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:56,799
We got your boy with your own boy.

1372
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:57,899
Come on.

1373
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:01,666
Oh, you motherfucker.

1374
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:03,467
Whoa, Moose.

1375
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,467
It's all right. He's my partner.

1376
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
I'll deal with it.

1377
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,533
Not here. Not smart.

1378
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:16,300
Well,
there's no time like the present, son.

1379
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,500
Check him.

1380
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,333
Don't fucking move.

1381
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:25,233
What's this about?

1382
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:26,833
He's clean. There's no way.

1383
01:20:26,866 --> 01:20:29,300
It's about honor.

1384
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,533
About a sense of responsibility.

1385
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:34,600
We have all taken a test,
and we have passed.

1386
01:20:34,632 --> 01:20:36,500
Me, Mirkovich, everybody.

1387
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,233
Is this about Mirkovich's ghost story?

1388
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:47,533
Mirk had a bad habit of leaving
out some parts of our story.

1389
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:49,400
You see these five guys here?

1390
01:20:49,433 --> 01:20:52,433
These five bastards killed Ericsson.

1391
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:56,866
The Phantom ghost who avenged
him were me and Mirkovich off duty.

1392
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:59,933
We found the first one
over here just by luck.

1393
01:20:59,966 --> 01:21:02,433
Big dumb coon,

1394
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:05,467
flashing Ericsson's badge and his gun.

1395
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,533
So we just turned it on him, you know?

1396
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:11,666
We held it right up to his head. Pissed
his pants and gave up all his partners.

1397
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:14,500
Boom! [all laugh]

1398
01:21:14,533 --> 01:21:16,899
See? Then we pick them up, one at a time.

1399
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:18,699
One at a time.

1400
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:21,233
We got 'em all.

1401
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:25,500
That was the beginning. Me and Mirkovich.

1402
01:21:25,533 --> 01:21:27,233
You started the Phantoms.

1403
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:32,300
It's about history, Keith, and tradition.

1404
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:35,366
That's what binds society together.

1405
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,732
That's why when the Phantoms strike,
we use Ericsson's gun.

1406
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:41,300
That's right.

1407
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,866
When we find the nigger
that killed Mirkovich,

1408
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,233
Ericsson's gun's gonna go boom again.

1409
01:21:47,266 --> 01:21:52,866
Yeah, it's a duty, it's an honor
to carry out that tradition, Keith.

1410
01:21:52,899 --> 01:21:57,200
So why don't you just step up?

1411
01:21:57,233 --> 01:21:59,567
Join us.

1412
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,266
It's not right. He's my partner.

1413
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,500
Yeah, well.

1414
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:08,899
He brought all this down on his own head.

1415
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:13,899
Come on.

1416
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:15,799
Show us what you're made of.

1417
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,567
Go on, General.

1418
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,881
If you don't kill that nigger right now,
I'm gonna do it.

1419
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:32,866
Step right up.

1420
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:38,567
No. No. No. Put it right up to his head.

1421
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,400
Go on.

1422
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:42,166
That's it.

1423
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
[Eyler] Now pull the trigger.

1424
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:46,866
Do it nice and easy though,
so you don't miss.

1425
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,732
Do it!

1426
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:53,933
No.

1427
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:55,699
I'm FBI.

1428
01:22:55,732 --> 01:22:58,600
FBI! Now we're fucking screwed!

1429
01:22:58,633 --> 01:23:00,933
You motherfuckers.

1430
01:23:00,966 --> 01:23:03,567
I'm gonna put you in a
hole so deep and dark,

1431
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,699
they'll never find your fucking bodies.

1432
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:07,666
Anything happens to us

1433
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:10,600
and the Feds will rain down
on you like you've never seen.

1434
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:13,200
Sometimes a brave
officer dies in the crossfire,

1435
01:23:13,233 --> 01:23:15,366
specially when his bad black partner's

1436
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,899
been caught dealing drugs
to brothers in the hood.

1437
01:23:17,933 --> 01:23:20,300
Man, that bullshit will never fly.

1438
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:23,200
[laughs] Well, I got a magic pencil.

1439
01:23:23,233 --> 01:23:24,567
Don't I, fellas?

1440
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,732
Right on!

1441
01:23:25,766 --> 01:23:27,500
Besides, who's gonna convict us?

1442
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:30,266
We're the thin blue line
that keeps the animals back.

1443
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,833
We got dirt on half the officials
in this county in those files!

1444
01:23:33,866 --> 01:23:37,699
We have affiliate groups, we got contacts,

1445
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:40,433
In every single state.

1446
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:49,766
You have no idea what you're up against.

1447
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:51,699
You piece of shit.

1448
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:53,799
[chuckles]

1449
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:57,133
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1450
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,732
Do it. Do it.

1451
01:23:59,766 --> 01:24:00,833
Hey.

1452
01:24:00,866 --> 01:24:02,766
What about tradition?

1453
01:24:02,799 --> 01:24:05,433
Why don't you kill us with Ericsson's gun,
huh?

1454
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:06,866
The way Moose did Mirkovich.

1455
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:08,732
[All] What?

1456
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:10,366
Shut your fucking nigger mouth.

1457
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,840
What the fuck are you talking about?

1458
01:24:11,866 --> 01:24:13,866
You blew him away, didn't you, Moose?

1459
01:24:13,899 --> 01:24:15,433
Huh? You blew Mirk away.

1460
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,666
That's why Ericsson's gun ain't there,
right?

1461
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,400
You fucking piece of shit...

1462
01:24:19,433 --> 01:24:20,732
Hey, hey. Shut up.

1463
01:24:20,766 --> 01:24:22,333
Go check it now. Go!

1464
01:24:22,366 --> 01:24:24,476
Check fucking what? What
the fuck are you talking about?

1465
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,633
Shut up. Please. Shh.

1466
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,433
It ain't there.

1467
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:35,266
What do you mean?

1468
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,633
What are they talking about?

1469
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:41,699
Look,
I don't know a thing. I swear to God...

1470
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:42,866
Jensen, shut up.

1471
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:44,633
No, you shut up.

1472
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:45,600
Grant.

1473
01:24:45,633 --> 01:24:48,333
Lieutenant, I don't know what's going on.

1474
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:51,567
Moose. Moose, I saw something in your bag.

1475
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,400
No, Brad, no. You didn't
see a fucking thing in my bag...

1476
01:24:54,433 --> 01:24:57,600
This fucking nigger can't
prove a fucking thing.

1477
01:24:57,633 --> 01:24:59,933
Yeah, that's bullshit. You know that.

1478
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:03,633
The ballistic report shows Mirk
was killed with Ericsson's gun, Moose,

1479
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:04,866
and you fucking did it.

1480
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,233
Where is it, Moose. Huh?

1481
01:25:08,266 --> 01:25:09,732
Where is it?

1482
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,300
He was passed it, Bill, you know that.

1483
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:19,433
He was way past it.

1484
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:21,633
He was gonna sing to the Grand Jury.

1485
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,732
I did the right thing.

1486
01:25:23,766 --> 01:25:25,666
He did. Come on.

1487
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:29,333
Bill, you wouldn't do it. He
was your fucking partner.

1488
01:25:29,366 --> 01:25:31,333
I did what I was supposed to do, Billy!

1489
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:33,467
Shut up, Moose.

1490
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,533
Just shut the fuck up!

1491
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:36,799
Billy, come on.

1492
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,467
We're in this together.

1493
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,600
You did it!

1494
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:41,732
[train passes]

1495
01:25:41,766 --> 01:25:43,833
You killed Mirkovich! [gunshot]

1496
01:25:43,866 --> 01:25:47,366
DeBruler! Go! Come on, man!

1497
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,833
No ammo.

1498
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,633
There. There!

1499
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,166
[Rhoades] Come on. Move in on.

1500
01:26:19,933 --> 01:26:21,200
Rhoades!

1501
01:26:23,633 --> 01:26:24,899
What the fuck we gonna do?

1502
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:28,533
We got enough shit here
to hang us ten times over!

1503
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,799
There's more of us than there are of them,
okay?

1504
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,300
So go out! Go wide! Go, go!

1505
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:01,732
We'll get 'em round the back way. Come on!

1506
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,633
[gunshot]

1507
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,266
Agh!

1508
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:08,166
Thanks for the tip,
Moose. [breathes heavily]

1509
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,467
Stand up. Come on.

1510
01:28:47,866 --> 01:28:50,600
How many people did you kill with this?

1511
01:28:51,799 --> 01:28:54,766
How many fucking
people did you kill with it!

1512
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:56,699
What difference does it make. Huh?

1513
01:28:56,732 --> 01:28:59,899
Your people kill each other
quicker than we ever could.

1514
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:03,433
You're finished, you piece of shit!

1515
01:29:03,467 --> 01:29:05,666
Maybe not today, but we'll get ya.

1516
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:07,567
[chuckles]

1517
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,633
You're a dead man.

1518
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:10,899
[spins barrel]

1519
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:18,400
Then don't spoil the moment for me.

1520
01:29:18,433 --> 01:29:19,766
Come on!

1521
01:29:19,799 --> 01:29:24,433
You pansy-ass chicken shit! Come on,
pull the fucking trigger!

1522
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:25,467
Shut up!

1523
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,866
Fuck!

1524
01:29:32,899 --> 01:29:34,600
Look at me, Eyler.

1525
01:29:34,633 --> 01:29:37,666
I'm the man you hate. Look at me.

1526
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,600
Put it down, son

1527
01:29:41,633 --> 01:29:45,567
Stay the fuck back,
Andre. This is between me and him, man.

1528
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,699
[Rhoades] Stay the shit outta this.

1529
01:29:47,732 --> 01:29:49,567
Over here. Come on,

1530
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,567
Stay back.

1531
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,633
What's going on?

1532
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:54,533
Don't fuck up your life.

1533
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:56,933
But I've been fucked up.

1534
01:29:56,966 --> 01:29:59,833
The moment I want to get
these motherfuckers, man!

1535
01:29:59,866 --> 01:30:02,500
We both want to see it's through.

1536
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:06,166
Wrong! This ain't about black,
it ain't about white.

1537
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,366
It's about right, man.

1538
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,732
Chicken shit.

1539
01:30:13,467 --> 01:30:14,866
Come on, brother.

1540
01:30:14,899 --> 01:30:17,567
Don't become them.

1541
01:30:22,732 --> 01:30:23,766
God.

1542
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,742
[Andre] The guy then turned to the Feds,

1543
01:30:29,766 --> 01:30:33,467
and the Feds are pissing
on each other's uniform.

1544
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,766
Ericsson's gun is gonna be here
to go to the FBI Ballistics Center.

1545
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:42,732
And the Grand Jury's getting a special
prosecutor to go after the Phantoms.

1546
01:30:42,766 --> 01:30:46,500
Anita wants to be named
FBI Director by morning.

1547
01:30:46,533 --> 01:30:49,366
But she'll settle for a
Supreme Court Justice.

1548
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,266
You weren't exactly
going through the channels

1549
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,200
but I guess you opened a
few spots down the road.

1550
01:30:55,233 --> 01:30:57,300
I'm proud of you.

1551
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:58,666
You got me here, Andre.

1552
01:30:58,699 --> 01:31:00,699
I mean it, son.

1553
01:31:00,732 --> 01:31:03,266
I'm really proud of ya.

1554
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,699
Hey!

1555
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:11,366
They kicked your ass.

1556
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:13,899
Partner.

1557
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:16,366
[chuckles]

1558
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,166
Congratulations, Agent Bayard.

1559
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,433
Agent DeBruler,

1560
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:21,666
we're looking at
arraignments in the morning.

1561
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,200
[Anita] I was so worried.

1562
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,666
[Rhoades] DeBruler!

1563
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:15,732
Ahh.

1564
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:21,366
Rhoades.

1565
01:32:22,766 --> 01:32:25,333
Fucker shot my partner.

1566
01:32:25,366 --> 01:32:26,400
It's over.

1567
01:32:41,266 --> 01:32:43,233
[breathes heavily]

1568
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,833
Go to him.

1569
01:32:49,866 --> 01:32:54,600
Go on. He needs you. Go. Let's go.

1570
01:32:59,933 --> 01:33:01,400
Keith.

1571
01:33:01,433 --> 01:33:03,666
I'm here.

1572
01:33:03,699 --> 01:33:05,533
[Anita] I'm here.
