1
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:54,401
# An old man turned 98

2
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,523
# He won the lottery

3
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,725
# And he died the next day...

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,698
What the shit is this?

5
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,500
Why is this on
the get-psyched mix?

6
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:03,734
'Cause I got to throw you
a curveball

7
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:05,169
every now and then
or you get bored,

8
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,004
and then the mix doesn't have
its intended effect.

9
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,740
No, I want to get revved up,
and this song's not doing it.

10
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:13,111
Oh, really? I defy you to crush
this chorus and not get psyched.

11
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,512
Not going to happen.

12
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,115
# Don't you think?

13
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,718
# It's like rain

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,453
# On your wedding day

15
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,589
What is it?

16
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,224
# It's a free ride

17
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:27,427
# When you already paid
# That you already take

18
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,429
# It's the good advice

19
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,864
Help me out!

20
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,766
# That you just didn't take

21
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,503
# And who would've thought?

22
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:39,473
# You figure
# It figures

23
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,375
# Mr. Play It Safe
- Classic Alanis.

24
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:43,944
# Was afraid to fly...

25
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,112
He was afraid.

26
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,682
- Bring it home.
- Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:52,086
<i>Come on, papi. Yes!</i>

28
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,490
We've got our jam on now.
- Jump to it.

29
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,058
It's been a dry June,

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,027
and I know it doesn't need
to be said out loud,

31
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,362
but we need this sale.
- I am so confident

32
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,797
that we're going
to close this thing

33
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,698
that I'm going to order
the Pappy Van Winkle.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,300
I know it's pricey,
but I want

35
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:07,003
to spiritually invest
in our success.

36
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,171
I'll tell you what, if you
didn't order the Pappy,

37
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:11,606
I'd send your raggedy ass
back out to the car

38
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:14,510
to listen to the get-psyched mix
to get your mind right.

39
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:17,046
We're selling Bob Williams.
Been married 16 years.

40
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,515
Wife Karen, one daughter.

41
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,716
You read the first page
of the scouting report.

42
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,183
Let me hip you to page two.

43
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,920
Daughter's name is Skyler,
big into gymnastics.

44
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:25,923
And to hear Bob tell it, the kid
is aces on the pommel horse.

45
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,925
He don't just tell it, old boy.
He likes to show it with pictures.

46
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,928
Everyone's searching
for something. Am I right, Bob?

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,863
Love. Success.

48
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:36,734
But what's the one thing
that no one can get more of?

49
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,369
Time.

50
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,906
Mmm. And you can't fight it.

51
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,309
Well, you don't have to tell me.
I mean, look at my little girl.

52
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,344
How old is Skyler
nowadays, Bob?

53
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:46,812
Just turned nine in May.
- Nine?

54
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:47,813
Isn't that something?
- She just turned nine.

55
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,213
Skyler's nine?
- Mmm.

56
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,116
Good Lord. How old
does that make all of us?

57
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:52,885
Don't answer that
question, Bob.

58
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:55,254
Let's move on.
- I was about... I was about to answer.

59
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:58,158
Pretty soon, she's going to be
borrowing Karen's makeup,

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,292
and you're going to have
two beauties on your hands.

61
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:01,594
Lock the door.
It's coming, Bob.

62
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:02,996
Double digits.
- No way. Is Skyler

63
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,965
still giving them hell
on that pommel horse?

64
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,434
You want to see that photo?
- If it's not too much trouble.

65
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,169
Yeah, let me show you Sky, yeah.

66
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,971
Let's get those eyes on Skyler.
- Look at her.

67
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,906
Yeah... yeah,
she's really sprouted.

68
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Skyler's
really slimming down.

69
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,444
And I'll tell you what.

70
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,911
Gorgeous.
- She's eating really healthy.

71
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,715
Just mostly fruits and nuts.

72
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,417
Her choice. - There is no
telling what this little girl

73
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,820
on a squirrel diet
could end up doing.

74
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:26,722
Could she win us the gold
and make us proud?

75
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,155
You're damn right she could.
- You're damn right.

76
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,690
I have a feeling
she's already made you proud.

77
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,460
Am I right?
- Guilty. Guilty, my friend.

78
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,262
Oh, guys, it... it goes so fast.

79
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,299
Oh, it's like a freight train
going down the track.

80
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,933
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack.
Now she's got a boyfriend.

81
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,635
Oh.
- Guy you like, hopefully.

82
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,639
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack,
she's married.

83
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,907
Clickety-clack,
she's putting you in a home!

84
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,375
Oh, my God, a home.

85
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,610
She would do it, too.

86
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,045
I believe that, too.
- No, no, she would.

87
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:50,813
Only when you don't
remember who she is.

88
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,083
I'm kidding!

89
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:56,619
Oh, it feels good
to laugh about Alzheimer's.

90
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,288
You can't control time.

91
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,723
No.

92
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:02,626
But... you can manage it.

93
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:05,763
Mmm.
- Bob...

94
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,498
the Chronoshock Aught Thirteen.

95
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,799
Carpe diem.

96
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,069
These babies will fly
off your shelf.

97
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:12,937
Now, I know that you've moved up
to having six stores,

98
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,305
so you're probably
going to want to have

99
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:16,141
a little larger order
than you did last year.

100
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,742
You're kidding, right?

101
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,648
Your... your business
has... been folded.

102
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,649
I'm sorry?
- No, no, no, no, Bob,

103
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,918
there has been some chatter.

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,520
The last few years
have been rough.

105
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:29,655
But come on,
who hasn't felt the pinch?

106
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,525
Yeah.
They didn't tell you, did they?

107
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,926
Look...

108
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,194
I thought you guys
just wanted to grab dinner

109
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,130
for old times' sake, but, uh...
- Yeah.

110
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,433
your company is closed.

111
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:42,269
I hate to be the one
telling you that.

112
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:46,106
Honestly, I know
that I can't buy the watches

113
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,677
because your company
doesn't exist anymore,

114
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,712
but I wish I could.

115
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:53,080
I mean, that's
how good you guys are.

116
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,183
One round
of Pappy Van Winkle.

117
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,018
Enjoy, gentlemen.

118
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,322
Oh... wow.

119
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,957
That is expensive stuff.

120
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,693
You know, Bob, uh...
do you mind, uh...

121
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,195
just going Dutch?
- You don't have to say any more.

122
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,097
I got it. I'm doing this.
Let me do this.

123
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,199
I'm saying let's slice the pie
three ways, honestly.

124
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,900
If you don't mind.
- No, that-that-that's silly.

125
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:14,002
That's silly.
I'm doing really, really...

126
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,706
really well right now,
and you guys are not.

127
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,108
But, Bob, I can...
- At all.

128
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,242
Let me do this.

129
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:20,944
But let's just split it.
Let's go Dutch.

130
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,679
Okay. Okay.
- Let's be the three Dutchmen.

131
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,980
Okay, but this Dutchman's
going to...

132
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,849
going to pay when he can
in a couple weeks.

133
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,218
I hope you understand.

134
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,186
<i>What the fuck, Sammy?</i>

135
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,387
What the fuck, me?
What the fuck, you?

136
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,723
Who told you
you could barge

137
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:33,958
into my office
without an appointment?

138
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,126
You closed the company?

139
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,894
And then you send
us out on a sale

140
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,196
that we really needed

141
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,298
and had Bob Williams
drop that bomb on us?

142
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,334
Bob Williams has got
a big fucking mouth.

143
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,836
Yeah, he does.
- Look.

144
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:45,871
You weren't going to get
the sale anyway.

145
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:47,105
Nobody wears a watch anymore.

146
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,774
They just check
their goddamn phones.

147
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,242
Disagree. Cite your sources.
- The kids, maybe,

148
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:51,910
but there's...
there's a broader market.

149
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,178
Lorraine, what time is it?

150
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:55,615
10:26.

151
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:59,451
One hip, pioneering secretary
does not a cultural trend make.

152
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:00,853
She's 75 years old.

153
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,755
Watches are obsolete,
and so are the two of you.

154
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:03,756
Hey. Obsolete?

155
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,291
What does that even mean?

156
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,661
It means everything's
computerized now.

157
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,328
It's cheaper
for a machine to tell

158
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,464
these companies what to order
than a manufacturer's rep.

159
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,233
They don't need us anymore.

160
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:16,770
No, people have a deep mistrust
of machines. - That's right.

161
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,939
<i>Have you seen Terminator?</i>

162
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:21,909
<i>Yep. Mm-hmm. All of them.
- Or 2 or 3 or 4?</i>

163
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:25,780
People want to deal with
people, not Terminators.

164
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,615
People hate people.

165
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,783
Times have changed.

166
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,351
That's so negative.

167
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:32,420
Luckily, I saw this coming,
cashed out my retirement,

168
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:35,090
bought a condo in Miami Beach,
new tits for the wife.

169
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:37,092
Silicone. It's legal again.

170
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,893
- Wow. - Saline's out?
- Yeah, me and the old lady

171
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:41,330
are going to be tucked away
real nice.

172
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,598
Yeah, great for you, huh?

173
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,799
Perfect.

174
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,203
So, uh, that's it, right?

175
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,771
But what about us, Sammy?

176
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:52,108
You two were great salesmen...
the best...

177
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,945
but at the end of the day,
you're grinders, foot soldiers.

178
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,713
We all know
you'll never be generals.

179
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,315
And I'm going to say
something harsh now.

180
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,116
Now you're going to say
something harsh?

181
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,987
Strap it in, boys, 'cause it
ain't pretty out there.

182
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,722
And you two are dinosaurs.

183
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,489
Face it.

184
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:10,194
Where you're going...
you've already been.

185
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,265
I thank you for your service.

186
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,572
What are we going to do?

187
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,574
I don't know.

188
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,944
But I got to worry
about the now.

189
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,546
I don't know what the hell
I'm going to say to Megan.

190
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,922
# It's like rain...

191
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:37,957
No. Let it play.

192
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,896
For the love of God,
let it play.

193
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:46,065
# It's a free ride
when you've already paid #

194
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:49,169
- Go. # It's the good
advice that you... #

195
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,839
Come on, Megan, listen to me.
Honey, let's talk about this.

196
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,841
Is this because
I'm too unselfish in bed?

197
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:55,943
Because I can change it around.
I'm not going to say it's going to be easy,

198
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,444
but I can do it.
Megan, listen to me.

199
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:00,081
Honey, it's always darkest
before the dawn.

200
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,816
No, Billy, it's not. It's actually
darkest in the middle of the night.

201
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:04,719
We have enough on the table here
without arguing about proverbs.

202
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:05,954
Look, I knew things
weren't great,

203
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:07,689
but to come home
to a foreclosure sign?

204
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,525
Can we hug it for a second?
Can I touch it? - No. No, please.

205
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,193
Okay, listen.
That could've been avoided

206
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:12,994
if the Bob Williams deal
didn't go so bad on me.

207
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,997
You blew the Bob Williams deal?
- Well, it's not so much

208
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,899
that I blew the deal
as much as the company

209
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,501
just decided to shut down
and take our jobs away.

210
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,037
What? - Come on, listen to me,
sweetheart.

211
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,905
I promise you,
I can pay for all of this.

212
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,139
It's not about
the money, Billy.

213
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,774
This is about you, okay?

214
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:28,178
You-you talk a big game, but you
never do anything about it.

215
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,913
It's like you say that we're
going to go to Spain,

216
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,282
but have I ever been to Barcelona?
- "Barthelona. "

217
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,450
Ugh.
- And not yet, but we're going.

218
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:34,918
<i>Vaya con dios, mi amor.</i>

219
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,253
<i>What?
- Porque esta bravo</i>

220
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,289
<i>en Barthelona y fantástico.</i>

221
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,124
No, we are not going
to "Barthelona," okay?

222
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,125
We have discussed going
to Barthelona,

223
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,063
but we are never going
to go to Barthelona.

224
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,231
Not with an attitude like that, we're not.
- Oh, God.

225
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,934
Wait, do you
even hear yourself?

226
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,536
Yes. - I'm glad that you got
to say some of that,

227
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,103
because we're in a
relationship, and I'm

228
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,739
just glad that we're both
committed to it.

229
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,308
No... do you know how badly
I want to believe that, Billy?

230
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,277
Because I've been with you
for a long time,

231
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,980
and nothing ever seems
to get better.

232
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,447
Honey, you were...

233
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,085
you're such a great guy,
but you always figure out

234
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,587
a way to screw things up
and let people down.

235
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,955
And, Billy, I love you,

236
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,459
but I'm really tired
of being let down.

237
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,367
That's terrible, Nicky.

238
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,535
Are you okay?

239
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,838
I should have gone on my own
when I had the chance.

240
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,306
I was so stupid. I was...

241
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:26,741
Nicky, you did
the right thing.

242
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:28,577
Always got a paycheck,
played it smart.

243
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:29,977
Dad would have been proud.

244
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,512
Well, what would he
have been proud of?

245
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,682
I didn't play it smart.
I played it safe.

246
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,683
And look where I am now.

247
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:36,218
Proud?

248
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,087
You're at your nephew's
Little League game.

249
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,087
Now, cheer up.

250
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,555
Okay.
- Come on.

251
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:43,058
All right, Tate!
- All right, here we go, Tate.

252
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,527
Put some wood on it.

253
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,029
He's a great kid.

254
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:48,864
I keep telling you you'd
make a terrific father.

255
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:51,034
Yep, you do keep
telling me that.

256
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,568
Unfortunately, it would
require you having

257
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,072
a relationship that lasted
longer than three months.

258
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,374
I'm not sure it
would require that.

259
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,609
Let me call Kevin.
- Jeanie...

260
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,278
I'm sure your boyfriend's
a great guy,

261
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,213
but I'm not ready
to work for someone

262
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,082
who spent all
of last Thanksgiving

263
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,551
explaining the meaning
of his tattoo.

264
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:08,952
Be reasonable, Nicky.

265
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,554
Take the job.

266
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,624
What else are you
going to do?

267
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:15,126
That's it. Just take
the walk, Eagle Eye.

268
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,627
Walk's as good as a hit.
Come on.

269
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,229
What is this guy saying?
Bullshit.

270
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,031
Nick. Nick!

271
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,434
A walk's not as good as a hit.
It's not as good - Nick!

272
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,003
as a double or a triple.

273
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,304
It's not as good
as a dinger.

274
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:26,671
Go on, take
a big cut, Tate.

275
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:27,906
Nick!

276
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,975
Get off the field.
- What are you doing?

277
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:32,378
You call him Eagle Eye
to get him not to swing?

278
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,014
Come on, he's 12 years old.

279
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,182
He's got the rest
of his life to take a walk.

280
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,851
How about you take a walk,
pal, and get off my field?

281
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,420
Just stop calling him
Eagle Eye, okay?

282
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,189
Oh, I'm going to
call him Eagle Eye.

283
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,990
Oh, no, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

284
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,525
You're Eagle Eye, you piece of...
- No, I'm not.

285
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,160
Huh?

286
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,330
Nick!
Get off me!

287
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:54,302
Go ahead, Tate. Swing!

288
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,404
I'm okay! I'm okay.

289
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,472
Play ball!

290
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,707
Come on, Tate! Swing big!

291
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,683
<i>Read Moneyball, asshole.</i>

292
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:10,152
<i>Walks are as good as hits.</i>

293
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,524
Just when you think your day

294
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,593
couldn't get any worse,
it got worse.

295
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,028
I feel like my day

296
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,998
bent me over, put a ball
in my mouth and fucked me bad.

297
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,302
Is it just me, or does life look
a lot like those hillbillies

298
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:27,570
<i>from Deliverance
right now?</i>

299
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,539
It's got me over
by the tree there,

300
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,775
just told me I had
a pretty mouth.

301
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:35,479
You over, squealing like a
pig on all fours. "Whee!"

302
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,948
I'm looking, "Wh-Where's Burt
Reynolds with the crossbow?"

303
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,550
He's not coming.

304
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,720
We're there,
it's gonna happen.

305
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,154
You're gonna get raped.

306
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,622
You know what it is?

307
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:47,592
I feel like life's inside of me,
just working,

308
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:49,895
just pushing,
just going all after it.

309
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:51,930
And then, all of a sudden,
life pulls out.

310
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,732
But he's gonna scurry up
the pillow.

311
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,168
Boom, just explodes
right in my fucking mouth.

312
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,238
How are you?

313
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,040
Hey. A cute kid.

314
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,474
How old is she?

315
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:03,676
She's a boy.

316
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:04,477
Okay.

317
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,179
Still very attractive.

318
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,580
You know,
without pink or blue,

319
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:08,916
it's hard to tell,
but the features are great.

320
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,250
Maybe... maybe put him
in some modeling.

321
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:11,450
That's what they're going for...

322
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:12,752
that right-down-the-middle
thing.

323
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:14,688
It's like, how many
different ways

324
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,990
do we have to say,
"I give up,"

325
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,292
say "uncle," say "mercy"

326
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:20,494
before life stops
wailing away on us?

327
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,563
I mean, we are
getting pounded.

328
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:24,932
You know, I feel like
our whole generation are sheep

329
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,701
that's been sold
a bad bill of goods.

330
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,970
Like, we were told, you know,
go to college, get good grades.

331
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,773
Well, you didn't
go to college.

332
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,475
I'm saying,
in theory, in concept,

333
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,645
our generation was told
that you go to college,

334
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,547
you get a job, you...
you get a mortgage,

335
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,114
and, you know,
here we did everything

336
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,316
the way we
were supposed to,

337
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:42,585
and what do we
get for it?

338
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,752
Where's our thanks?
Nothing.

339
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:47,791
I think I'm going to call
Kevin about that job.

340
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:48,991
Kevin?

341
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,859
Thanksgiving tattoo?

342
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,128
We're not that low,
are we, Nick?

343
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,095
Okay.

344
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,663
Come on.

345
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:27,566
Show me one little
something here.

346
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:33,439
What are you going to do, Billy?
Come on, Billy.

347
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,765
There he is.

348
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,133
Nickrophiliac!
- Hey.

349
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,502
How you been?

350
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,338
Good. Just working away.
- Yeah.

351
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,572
Yeah. I see that.
- Yeah.

352
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,773
Don't slag off
on the corners.

353
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,175
Okay.

354
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,844
The corners are so important.
- All right.

355
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,913
'Cause we got people tracking
shit in here all the time.

356
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,213
Okay.

357
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,084
And I mean, like,
literally dog shit.

358
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,385
Jesus.

359
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,720
Huh? - Wow, I should've
worn some gloves.

360
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,456
I said I should've worn
some gloves.

361
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,724
Gloves aren't
gonna help you.

362
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,691
You don't want
protector duty?

363
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,393
'Cause I got another
place I can put you:

364
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,296
out on the curb,
twirling the big arrow.

365
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,364
Does that sound good?

366
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,698
Hot sun beating
down on you?

367
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,400
I've lost three of those
guys to skin cancer.

368
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,135
We call that curb
"the widow maker. "

369
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,137
I don't want to go out to
the widow maker. - Okay?

370
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,807
How do you think you'd fare out
there with that alabaster skin?

371
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,943
Well, I-I don't know.
- I'll tell you.

372
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,211
You'd be dead in a year.

373
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,678
It felt like you...

374
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,315
Jeggings.
- What?

376
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,083
Jeggings, 5:00.
- Where?

377
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,754
Right there.

378
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,821
I'd like to play around
in that rumpus room.

379
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,423
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

380
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,825
Have you done the back door yet?

381
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,427
Do what?
- Back door.

382
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,795
Back-door action.

383
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:29,531
"Knock-knock. " Back door.

384
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,031
No.
- "It's me. "

385
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:31,832
No.

386
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,834
"With my penis. "
- No.

387
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,370
A life changer.

388
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,005
It is a life changer!

389
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,908
You VIP your way
into that back alley,

390
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,977
you don't even think about
the main entrance anymore.

391
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:44,713
You know what I mean by
"the main entrance"?

392
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,850
We're talking dick
into the vagina.

393
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,185
Kevin, this is
an awkward conversation.

394
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,253
Why?

395
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,456
Because you're going out
with my sister!

396
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,659
Oh, yeah. Well, don't-don't
think we didn't go through

397
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,028
a period of adjustment.

398
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,263
Adjustment?

399
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:00,596
Can you gentlemen help me?

400
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,698
Yes, ma'am. Nick is
one of our best.

401
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,134
In fact, his
entire family

402
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,303
knows their way
around a mattress.

403
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,807
Get it.
- What are...?

404
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,342
Get it done.
- My question is about

405
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,145
memory foam versus standard.

406
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,347
Specifically as it relates
to lumbar support.

407
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,249
What?

408
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,684
Lumbar support.
- I'm... Okay, I'm sorry.

409
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,419
Hi, great choice in mattress.
- Yeah.

410
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,888
Why don't you go ahead
and, uh, lie down there.

411
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,524
Let's try to work our way
through this conundrum,

412
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,026
uh, because what I think
you're asking is... - Oh, man.

413
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,462
Uh, Billy, I'm with a customer,
thank you. - Sure.

414
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,465
Pardon me, ma'am, yeah,
just maybe start off on this.

415
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,667
Yeah. Just lay it down.
- Yeah, come here for a second.

416
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,403
Hey, what
are you doing here?

417
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,903
Listen, I got it.

418
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:39,205
I've seen the future,
and it's beautiful for us.

419
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,906
Okay, I don't know
what you got,

420
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:43,009
but I got a job here,
and I don't want to lose it.

421
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,177
Now, can we talk
about this later?

422
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,645
No, we can't talk
about it later.

423
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,146
The future doesn't know later.

424
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:48,081
What are you...?

425
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,649
All the future is,
is later.

426
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,251
That's literally
what the future is.

427
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,085
It's later.

428
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,421
What are you talking about?

429
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,789
Google.

430
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,690
Google?
- Yeah.

431
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:57,924
The place is amazing.

432
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,861
They got nap pods,
they got massage rooms,

433
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:00,928
they got a volleyball court.

434
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,396
They got the whole nine.

435
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,766
It's ranked as the greatest
place to work at in America.

436
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,300
Yeah, I know.
It's a technology company...

437
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,069
a field we know
jack squat about.

438
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:09,704
Look-it, Google needs us.

439
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,306
And Google wants us.

440
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,407
They do?

441
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:13,942
You sweet son of a bitch.

442
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:15,644
You got us a job at Google?

443
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:16,912
Well, it's not actually a job.

444
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,347
What do you mean,
not an actual job?

445
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,415
Well, it's an interview
for an internship that has

446
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,086
a better-than-not chance
of materializing into a job.

447
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,854
Billy, now you're
making me very angry.

448
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,758
You want me to leave my job
to go for an interview,

449
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,060
not for a job
but for an internship

450
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,763
that may or may not
lead to a job?

451
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,732
Nick, aren't you tired of asking
for just enough to get by?

452
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:36,866
Yes.

453
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:39,603
I want to do something
that matters.

454
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,773
I want to have a life that I'm
excited about and that's great.

455
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,109
Nick, I want us
to go to California.

456
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,578
And I want us to get
these jobs at Google.

457
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,648
I'm going to speak
to a manager.

458
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,117
Terrific. I think he's right
over there in the corner.

459
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,385
Let's roll it on over
onto the stomach.

460
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,187
He'll be very helpful.
- Okay, what we're gonna do here

461
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,256
is get a little support
for the hips.

462
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:00,192
So here comes... Imagine a
pillow, right like there, okay?

463
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,427
Oh. Uh-huh.

464
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,862
And what we're gonna do
is separate the feet,

465
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,863
create a little heat dispersion.

466
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,265
Excuse me!
- Now, so we have...

467
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:09,302
Is there something
I can help you with, ma'am?!

468
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,203
What?!

469
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,872
I'm trying to buy a mattress.

470
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,273
Unbelievable!

471
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,242
Listen, our interview
is in one hour.

472
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:18,712
Now, Nick, this might be
the last chance that we got.

473
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:22,182
How's it going, Gossip Girls?
CW just called; you're canceled.

474
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,083
Excuse me?

475
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:24,451
Look, I know you're peddling him

476
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:27,020
a bunch of crap,
just like the crap merchandise

477
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,122
you two used to shill.

478
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:30,058
So, listen up, Marfan Syndrome.

479
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,659
Excuse me?
- Marfansism.

480
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:32,793
Big man's disease.

481
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:33,962
The Giant Killer.

482
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:35,730
You.
- Me and you are the same height.

483
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,032
We're not the same height.
We're not the same height.

484
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,835
I'm handsome tall.

485
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:42,370
You're the type of tall where
you walk through the airport,

486
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,639
people stop what they're eating
and look at you.

487
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,175
You're like a freak.

488
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:47,910
Now, Nick,
you have a customer waiting.

489
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:51,213
Nick... we have
our future waiting.

490
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,581
Nick, you know what that says?

491
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,216
No, I don't read Sanskrit.

492
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,653
"Make reasonable choices. "

493
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,856
That's an odd thing
to get tattooed on your neck.

494
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:03,193
Just get back to work!

495
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,362
God! I'm sorry
you had to see that, ma'am.

496
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:07,264
Now, let's get
back to you

497
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,599
and talk pelvic
ventilation.

498
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:09,600
Kevin!

499
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,568
What?

500
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,837
You know, you've been saying

501
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,438
some insulting things
to me all day.

502
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,640
What are you doing?

503
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,074
I'm taking the shirt off.

504
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,142
Because I don't know

505
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:19,443
what happens
to a dream deferred.

506
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:22,546
Does it dry up like
a raisin in the sun?

507
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,549
Or does it explode?

508
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,485
I don't want to find out.

509
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,122
You just made the worst mistake
of your life, my friend.

510
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,190
Hey, hey-hey-hey-hey,
yeah, hey!

511
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,359
You take the shirt off,
it doesn't go back on, okay?

512
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,462
There's not a
second chance!

513
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:40,032
See you in hell!

514
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,136
So we're meeting our
interviewer in here?

515
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,737
No, not in here.
We're meeting him in here.

516
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,872
It's a Hangout.

517
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,307
This is how people
do it now, Nicky...

518
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,008
they have their interviews
on the Internet. - Oh.

519
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,309
I like it.

520
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,980
Now, it says here
that the internship

521
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:54,882
is only for college
students, so...

522
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:56,517
Guess who's way ahead of you.

523
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,319
That's why I enrolled us
at the University of Phoenix.

524
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,988
That proud online institution.

525
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,222
Go, Fighting Phoenixes.

526
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:03,258
Nice.

527
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,527
Wait, you put my major
down as physics?

528
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,161
Why-why would you put
my major down as...

529
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,195
I don't know shit
about physics.

530
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,731
Look...
- Physics scares me.

531
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,033
These guys paint the corner
of the plate with their pitches.

532
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,868
They're not gonna come
straight down the middle

533
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,771
and ask you about physics;
it's too obvious.

534
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,038
I took it off the table.

535
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,473
Good. Hide in plain sight.

536
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,109
Yes.

537
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,278
But you put you down for
sales? As your major?

538
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,379
Well, 'cause I'm a talker.

539
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,014
I figure I should
probably dazzle.

540
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,582
I want you to... you know,
I've thought about this.

541
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,417
I just figure, like, hide
your vacancy and let me dazzle.

542
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,685
Okay, dazzle.
Are you done yet?

543
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,054
There's a 15-minute limit.

544
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:32,556
I'm sorry, you know what?

545
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,191
The big boys are gonna need
the computer a little longer,

546
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,558
but maybe we can make this
a win-win for you.

547
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,860
Get yourself a soda pop.

548
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,095
Give her some money, yeah.
Here you go.

549
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,696
Yeah, just go put
some sugar in your body.

550
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,098
Enjoy it.
- What a cute kid.

551
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,767
I'm no child, but, Billy...
- Okay, here they are.

552
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:44,402
Now, when I hit this, they'll be
able to see us, so come on in,

553
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:45,969
get in there close so we
can be seen on the Webcam.

554
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:47,437
See how small the Webcam is?
- They can see us...

555
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,373
No, get cheek to cheek.
Nick, come here, cheek to cheek.

556
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,109
Okay, but don't crowd me.
You're crowding me right now.

557
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:52,844
Nick, get cheek to cheek.
Will you get your cheek...

558
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,912
Buddy, they can't see us.
- I understand that. Here we go.

559
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:56,714
Go cheek to cheek. Just go like I tell you.
- Okay. Don't yell in my...

560
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,082
Put your fucking cheek next to mine.
- Yes, yes, I get it.

561
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,251
We can see you guys.

562
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:00,786
Okay, great!
- Good! You got us?

563
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,054
Hi! My name is Billy!

564
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,922
Uh, we can hear you
fine as well.

565
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:04,957
Oh, great. Um...
- Good.

566
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,958
Billy McMahon.

567
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,992
Nick Campbell.

568
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,627
I'm Benjamin.
- Allison.

569
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:09,829
We're thirsty, too.

570
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,064
Okay, slow it down
there, camper.

571
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,065
I'm not an ATM.

572
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,233
I got a job interview here.

573
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,600
Thank you.
- We'll be back.

574
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,669
Okay, easy.
- Are you in a library?

575
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,271
You know, we're in a program
here called... - We are.

576
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:19,372
There's some beautiful
little kids here.

577
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:20,840
Yeah, kids.
Helping kids program...

578
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:22,676
one of the things we're
involved in... where we take

579
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:25,211
suburban kids and we teach them
what it's like to be homeless.

580
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:26,981
Oh, what's it called?
- Oh, it's-it's called, uh...

581
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,716
Attitude Adjustment.
- Attitude Adjustment.

582
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,484
And that's where we are today.
We're helping the kids.

583
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,187
And-and to be honest with you,
we did the interview here

584
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:33,587
because we wanted
to help out,

585
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:35,589
and also we don't have Webcams
for our computer.

586
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:37,324
If you don't have
a Webcam on your computer,

587
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,361
what type of computer do you
use for your coding ability?

588
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,696
Coding ability?
- Uh, yeah.

589
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,899
Uh, under computer skills,
you put "C-plus-plus. "

590
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,200
That's actually a C-plus.

591
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:46,635
What's that?
- Well, the second plus is

592
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,905
to reflect my attitude
of how I felt about the C-plus.

593
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,039
But it's a C-plus.

594
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,040
It was a typing class.

595
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,274
You know, same principle,

596
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,942
just not the engine
inside the baby there.

597
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:55,211
But it was more like
"quick brown fox. "

598
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,212
You know, put your hands
in the basin,

599
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,380
and crushing it like that.

600
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,248
But that h-helped me out
a lot when I,

601
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,751
as I started my journey
into computers

602
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,685
because I already knew
where to put my hands, clearly.

603
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,521
Okay, if we could focus on
this now... you are currently

604
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,558
enrolled at the University
of Phoenix online?

605
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,092
Indeed, yes, we are.
- Damn right we are.

606
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,360
Damn right we are.
- It's, uh, the oldest

607
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,029
institution of its
kind, and as such,

608
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,499
many people refer to it as the
Harvard of Internet colleges.

609
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,700
Oh! I hadn't
heard that actually.

610
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,969
I... No.

611
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,337
That-that has not
made it out here,

612
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,337
that reputation.
- Well, we're Phoenix proud.

613
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,338
We're Phoenix proud.

614
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,607
Well, that's fine.

615
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,309
Um, we're gonna ask you
a few questions

616
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,177
that some of our candidates
find a little bit odd.

617
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,178
Let's get weird!

618
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,781
No judgment. Shoot.

619
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,982
You're shrunken down
to the size of nickels

620
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,750
and dropped to the
bottom of a blender.

621
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,019
What do you do?

622
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,055
I... Is there anything
else in the blender?

623
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:37,289
Uh, I don't know.

624
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,357
Well, that's gonna
make a difference.

625
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,491
Are there ice cubes
to climb on?

626
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,826
Are we working with
a daiquiri here?

627
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,328
Are we throwing
a little rum in?

628
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,863
Are we making a smoothie?
- It's been a long week.

629
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,832
Maybe we want to let these
little guys live a little.

630
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay, for the sake of the
argument, let's say it's empty.

631
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:48,702
Sure. - Well, in that case,
it's easy, then.

632
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:49,835
Why?
- I'm sorry?

633
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,271
If we're shrunk down
to the size

634
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:52,405
of a nickel and there's
no liquid in the blender,

635
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,673
we go ahead
and put it on our backs.

636
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:55,442
So you take her flat
on your back like this.

637
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,411
Right, right, right. You just
lay back, enjoy that breeze.

638
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,612
Lay stiff as a board, light as a feather.
- Pretend it's a fan.

639
00:22:58,614 --> 00:22:59,980
Okay, once is...
- And let those blades

640
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,047
just whip all around
you like this.

641
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,719
It's like getting an MRI.
- Dazzle, dazzle.

642
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,087
Once this blender's on,
it's on forever.

643
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,289
It's on. Forever.

644
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,856
Respectfully,
I got to disagree.

645
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:11,459
We sold blenders, and even
the best model in the world

646
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:13,028
is only gonna run nonstop
for, what, Billy?

647
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,162
Even the Germans,
the Germans could never...

648
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:15,931
Yeah. Even the
German model.

649
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,865
Even one of those Braun ones,
they're only gonna run nonstop

650
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:20,068
maybe ten or 11 hours.
So we're getting out,

651
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,703
and when we do,
we're better off for it,

652
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:23,138
because whatever doesn't
kill you makes you stronger.

653
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,407
But let's just go ahead

654
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,009
and big-picture this
for a second, if I can.

655
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:27,676
Just like the
founders of Google.

656
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:28,844
Big-picture Googling.

657
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:31,481
It's not so much
getting out of the blender;

658
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:33,149
it's what happens next.

659
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:34,717
That's the question.

660
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:37,253
You've got two nickel-sized
men free in the world.

661
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,755
Think of the possibilities.
- I mean, I... I...

662
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,557
off the top of my head,
and I'm just spitballing here.

663
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,326
My head's swimming.
- Sunglass repair?

664
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,961
Yeah, yeah... - We'd be hell on
those little screws.

665
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,130
Or maybe you stick us in
those submarines that they put

666
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:47,598
in people's bodies
to fight diseases.

667
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,366
That's cutting-edge
right there.

668
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:50,901
Okay, you... That's-that's
not a real thing,

669
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:51,903
the submarines.
- No.

670
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,071
Wait a minute.

671
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:54,239
I thought we were
stuck in a blender.

672
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,407
Now we're saving lives?
What?!

673
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:56,941
Uh, what?
- What?

674
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:58,176
- What?! - What?!
- What?

675
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,411
Let me just recap this
for you real quick.

676
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,412
We started off in a blend...
- Yeah.

677
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:01,613
Now we're saving lives!

678
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:02,681
- What?!
- What?!

679
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,517
- What? What? - What?
- Wait a minute!

680
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,318
We were stuck in a blender...
- What a journey!

681
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,552
...and now we saving lives?!

682
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:08,955
What?!
- You guys led us to this.

683
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:10,256
Thank you.

684
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,757
I think we've gotten
a little far afield.

685
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,259
Just a little off topic.

686
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:15,394
Ally, I'll get inside you
and I'll fight for you.

687
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:16,796
Uh, thank you.
I... I appreciate that, but...

688
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,164
Which one of you...
which one of you is physics?

689
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,733
Mr. Campbell?

690
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:23,203
You could maybe expound
on this from a physics aspect.

691
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:24,337
Physics.

692
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,639
Here, here...

693
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,642
Listen, the...
I... I could bend your ear

694
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:31,212
about physics and various
physical phenomenon,

695
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:33,680
but the truth is,
we were in a blender.

696
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,784
We lost our jobs,
we'd given up.

697
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,987
So I think we already
answered the question

698
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:40,288
when we took
this interview.

699
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,925
We got ourselves out,
and here we are.

700
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:45,660
If you guys really want to know
what happens when you take

701
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:49,164
two guys out of a blender...
I'm sorry, Allison, is it?

702
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,833
Yes.

703
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,201
Then give us a shot.

704
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:54,636
And I think you'd be
happy that you did.

705
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,407
So, who is our next applicant?

706
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,177
Ah, our two daiquiri men.

707
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,579
So, what are we
thinking... Dana?

708
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,882
You're kidding, right?

709
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,083
No.

710
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,385
Eleanor?

711
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:10,821
Mmm, they seem like
really nice guys,

712
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,856
but I... I don't think so.
- Okay. Moving on.

713
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:13,857
Oh, can I say something?

714
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,191
You can. You will.

715
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,761
We will resent you
for wasting our time,

716
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,362
but please don't let that
stop you.

717
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:20,832
It's just, diversity is
in our DNA, right?

718
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,366
I thought the goal here

719
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,735
was to find people with a
different way of thinking.

720
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:26,370
There's plenty of people with
a different way of thinking.

721
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:27,672
It doesn't mean
that we have to hire them.

722
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:29,741
Very good point, Dana.
Moving on.

723
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:31,308
I'm sorry, but you read
their résumés, right?

724
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,378
They have more years

725
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,746
of sales and life experience

726
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:36,782
than the age
of most of our interns.

727
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:38,484
Not to mention,
our final judgment

728
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:40,519
is always based on
the Layover Test, right?

729
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,953
Who would you rather
be stuck next to

730
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,424
at an airport bar
for a six-hour delay?

731
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:46,325
The ten millionth kid
who knows that if you shrink,

732
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,493
your strength-to-weight ratio

733
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,229
allows you to jump
way higher? Duh.

734
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,731
Or the out-of-the-box thinkers

735
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,766
who turned being
stuck in a blender

736
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,736
into an advantage?

737
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:00,374
# Tell me how you feel

738
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:01,742
# What's your fantasy, oh?

739
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:04,545
# I see us on a beach
down in Mexico #

740
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,415
# You can put your feet up,
be my señorita #

741
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,250
# We ain't got to rush,
just take it slow #

742
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:12,787
# You'll be in the high life,
soaking up the sunlight #

743
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:15,723
# Anything you want,
it's yours #

744
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,760
# I'll have you living life
like you should #

745
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:21,463
# You say you never
had it so good... #

746
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:23,966
So it begins.

747
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,101
Here we go.

748
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:26,202
Place is incredible.

749
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:27,503
Where do we check in?

750
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:28,904
Let's ask somebody here.

751
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,406
Oh, excuse me!

752
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:32,108
I'm sorry, excuse me, do you...

753
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:38,080
Billy?

754
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,450
It's scary because it's new.

755
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,751
Let's go check in.

756
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:44,087
Head towards those
big, big letters there.

757
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:45,556
What's up, family?

758
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:47,891
# Girl, tell me how you feel

759
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:49,493
# What's your fantasy, oh?

760
00:26:49,495 --> 00:26:51,963
# I see us on a beach
down in Mexico #

761
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:55,834
# You can put your feet up,
be my señorita #

762
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:58,035
# We ain't got to rush,
just take it slow #

763
00:26:58,037 --> 00:27:00,638
# You'll be in the high life,
soaking up the sunlight #

764
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,608
# Anything you want,
it's yours #

765
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,376
# I'll have you living life

766
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:05,677
- What's your last name?
# Like you should

767
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,414
# You say you never
had it so good #

768
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,650
<i># Na na-na na-na na-na #</i>

769
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:14,621
<i># Na na na #
# You never had it so good</i>

770
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:16,788
<i># Na na-na na-na na-na #</i>

771
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,860
<i># Na na-na na #
# You never had it so good...</i>

772
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,163
Picture the greatest
amusement park

773
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:24,798
you've ever been to as a kid.

774
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,300
Now imagine a place
nothing like it

775
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:29,637
and a million times better.

776
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,705
That's where we are.

777
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,240
I'm gonna grab us a coffee.

778
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:34,341
You check us in.

779
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:36,210
Yeah.

780
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:42,584
Morning.

781
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:44,351
Hi.
- What's the damage here?

782
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:47,355
Nothing.

783
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,623
For the... for these?

784
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,592
Free.
- These are complimentary?

785
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:51,928
Complimentary. Free.

786
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,362
Whatever you want.

787
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:54,729
What you're just saying is if I...

788
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,097
whatever I walk away
with here...

789
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:57,099
It's free.

790
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,301
...doesn't... yeah.

791
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,869
You can have bananas.

792
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:01,871
I probably should, only because
it's a great way to st...

793
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:03,439
This is the most important
meal of the day.

794
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,840
Take two. They're free.

795
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:06,609
No, I know, but for my day, I need it.
- Yeah.

796
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:08,445
What about these...
the bagels and all that?

797
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:09,646
Yeah, it's free.
Anything you want.

798
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:10,881
If you're insisting,
twist my arm.

799
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:12,216
I'll have a couple of them.
- Sure.

800
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:13,416
Like four-four of them.
- Four?

801
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:14,585
Well, just whatever it is.
- Yeah.

802
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:16,053
What about five of them?
- Free, too.

803
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,955
Well, why don't you go ahead
and make it seven, then?

804
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,591
If you want to whip up
some of the other drinks.

805
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:21,059
Do you have a to-go cup,
like, a Guzzler? - Sure.

806
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:22,593
Do you have, like,
a Rednek Guzzler with a straw?

807
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:23,994
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Yes?

808
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,131
Do you know what, uh,
launch this was from?

809
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,800
Sorry. Uh, I have a meeting.

810
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:30,268
Oh, no, no,
I don't want to hold you.

811
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,537
I was just...

812
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,538
I... I was just curious.

813
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,607
Was this thing
actually in space?

814
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:38,544
If only there were
some Web page you could go to.

815
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:39,778
Right?
Where you could just

816
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,281
type things in
and search for answers.

817
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,617
Ah. Yes, that
would be nice.

818
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,119
Nick Campbell.

819
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,488
Uh, oops. Intern.

820
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,390
Dana Simms. Late.

821
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:52,391
Yep, and I'm late, too.

822
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:53,526
I got to rush off.

823
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:55,061
<i>And it's SpaceShipOne.</i>

824
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:57,197
First private
manned spaceflight.

825
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:59,200
Winner of the X Prize.

826
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,676
Oh, my God,
are those your dads?

827
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:11,245
Seriously, same-sex partners
make excellent parents.

828
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,047
I so wish my parents were gay.

829
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,482
When did 20 start
to look like 12?

830
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,917
Oh, man.

831
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,519
Yes, of course
I'll work my hardest.

832
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,054
Mom, how can I work
harder than my hardest?

833
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,722
That's physically
impossible...

834
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,524
Okay, okay, I-I will.

835
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,993
Yes, I love you... Mom.

836
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,396
Billy McMahon, Billy McMahon.
- Nice to meet you.

837
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,764
How are you?

838
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,197
Oh, I'm gonna grab
some food over here.

839
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,599
You okay? - Get something.
I'm good.

840
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,168
You all right if I leave you?
- Yeah.

841
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,972
This stuff looks good, huh?

842
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,340
Little pick-me-up.
- Excuse me. Sir.

843
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,841
Graham Hawtrey.
- Oh.

844
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,343
Billy McMahon.
- I'm so thrilled to be here.

845
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,411
Oh, me, too.

846
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,047
Feels kind of like
the first day

847
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,948
of spring training
for Little League here.

848
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,586
I got to tell you, I feel like
I got a few more clicks

849
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,121
on the old odometer
than most of you kids here.

850
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,756
Well, honestly,
that's why I came over here.

851
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,225
I said to myself,
"Graham, there's a man

852
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,393
"with some life experience.

853
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:56,695
Probably teach you
a thing or two. "

854
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:58,162
Oh, you got to meet
my friend, Nicky.

855
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:58,962
You'll love him. Nicky!

856
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,298
Nickelodeon!
Come over here!

857
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,299
Come over.

858
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,767
Come meet this guy, Graham.

859
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:03,868
He's in the internship
program with me and you.

860
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,869
Hey. How you doing?
- Good.

861
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,572
You're interns?
- Yes.

862
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,373
Shut up!
- Deal with it.

863
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,241
Shut the fuck up.
- Deal with it.

864
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,544
But you're so old, though.

865
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,012
Whoa. Excuse me?

866
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:15,081
Oh, my God, I feel terrible!
I feel so stupid.

867
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,782
No, don't be. We're excited.
- No, it's fine.

868
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:18,751
- No, I feel terrible. I feel terrible.
- No. For what?

869
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,653
I just, you know, um...
I thought you were important.

870
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,054
Oh, shit.

871
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,091
I've got to find some people
who actually matter,

872
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,359
but good luck!

873
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,794
Wh-Why did you bring me over
to introduce me to this guy?

874
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:29,262
It's like he was
your best friend.

875
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:30,664
You introduced me
to Hitler.

876
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,799
Well, he seemed like
he was sweet at first.

877
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,335
My name is Roger Chetty.

878
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:37,204
And I am head
of the Google Intern Program.

879
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,807
Welcome to Google.

880
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:42,377
This will not be
your average internship.

881
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:44,178
Oh, no.

882
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,047
You will do what we do.

883
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,217
And we will watch
how well you do it.

884
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,920
Now, you represent
the finest schools.

885
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:54,822
Your intelligence,
your achievement is well noted,

886
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:56,692
but to excel at this internship,

887
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:59,561
you're going to need
far more than brainpower.

888
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:03,299
What you're going to need
is Googliness.

889
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,168
Nothing funny.

890
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,404
Googliness.

891
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:12,343
The intangible stuff
that made a search engine

892
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,511
into an engine for change.

893
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:17,948
Now, you will be
divided into teams,

894
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,517
and by the end of the summer,

895
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,587
only one team will be guaranteed
a full-time position.

896
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:28,893
The other 95% of you will not.

897
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:30,762
Now, you've been split up
into several seminars

898
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,898
to acquaint you
with our campus and culture.

899
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,268
Seminar descriptions have been
e - mailed to each of you.

900
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,738
I would wish you luck,
but it's not luck that you need.

901
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,908
Get to work!

902
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,241
Well, this ain't
gonna be about

903
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:45,243
getting coffee
and running errands for people.

904
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,479
No, no.

905
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,347
We're looking at some sort
of mental Hunger Games

906
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:50,850
against a bunch of genius kids
for just a handful of jobs.

907
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:52,018
That's why we got
to nail this thing.

908
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,219
This is our
opening statement.

909
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:54,287
If it please the court.

910
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,922
Oh, it pleases
the court, counselor.

911
00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:57,291
<i>Okay, Workplace Seminar.</i>

912
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:58,425
<i>Still a few seats left.</i>

913
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:00,594
First impression time, baby.

914
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:01,761
Bingo!

915
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:02,696
Okay, we can do
good in this.

916
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:04,031
We have to do...
- Shazam!

917
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,732
So close yet so far, boys.

918
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,501
Whoa! Graham, Graham,
we were here first.

919
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,503
You know what?

920
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:09,704
You're right.

921
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:10,772
You guys could use
the advantage.

922
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:11,872
Go ahead.

923
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:13,307
What's that
supposed to mean?

924
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:15,810
It means that in a world
of excellence,

925
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,646
old and unexceptional
qualifies as diversity.

926
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:20,249
So you know what?
Go ahead.

927
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:21,249
What's that saying?

928
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:23,251
"Age before beauty"?

929
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:25,054
Thank you.

930
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,056
You're welcome, William.

931
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:28,791
You know, there's always
some joker

932
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,893
who likes to play fuck-around.

933
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,195
I guess that's
gonna be you, Graham.

934
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:35,598
All right, at least we know.
Game on.

935
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,367
Good luck, boys.

936
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,869
Now, I recognize that Google
is not a conventional workplace.

937
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,939
Having said that,
we have rules.

938
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:45,675
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

939
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,077
You are going to raise
the green paddle

940
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,846
to indicate "yes"
and the red paddle

941
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,682
to indicate "no. "

942
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,485
So, let's begin.

943
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:57,154
"Having a beer
with your boss. "

944
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:02,093
Some of you are under 21.

945
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,661
Some of us
aren't under 21, so...

946
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:05,063
if you want to grab
a cold one with me,

947
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,431
I'm happy to do that with you.

948
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,833
I will not be grabbing
a cold one with you.

949
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:09,968
You get high?

950
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,603
I don't get high.
- Okay.

951
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:13,205
I'm not judging;
I'm just saying,

952
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:14,006
people do it.

953
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,341
That being said,
if you want

954
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,243
something cold to drink,
we'll hook you up.

955
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,310
I'm okay.

956
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:19,912
Thank you; just
stop talking to me.

957
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,248
<i>I'm your Bill Holden
in Stalag 17.</i>

958
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,450
I don't even... I really
don't get that reference.

959
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:27,520
Google it.
- Got it.

960
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:31,357
"Dating a fellow intern. "

961
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,495
This is Google, not Match. com.

962
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,930
Chetty, excuse me.
What about a full-time employee?

963
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,133
Say, management level,
but not a direct supervisor.

964
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:43,838
Great eyes,
and a severity to her look

965
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,007
that is surprisingly sexy.

966
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,110
What's the policy
on that?

967
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,812
No? That's frowned upon also?

968
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:51,947
So we'll say no to love?

969
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,048
We'll say no to love, yes.

970
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,317
That's gonna be a no.
- Now,

971
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,419
"taking food home
from the office. "

972
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:58,453
Boom.

973
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,722
Yes.

974
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:00,756
Are you having
difficulty with this,

975
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:02,191
Mr. McMahon?
- I'm sorry.

976
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:03,326
Just to drill down on this,
what if it's,

977
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,927
like, a perishable?
Like, say there was

978
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:06,362
a pudding or something
that was left out.

979
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,197
You'd like to take home
a pudding, would you?

980
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,865
I wouldn't mind taking home
a pudding; I don't...

981
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,368
I don't know who wouldn't.
- Oh, yeah.

982
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,203
But that being said,
I'm just saying if it's gonna

983
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:14,837
go bad, is that okay to take-take it home?
- Mm-hmm.

984
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,305
Mm-hmm. Anything else
you'd like to take home?

985
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:17,908
Only if there was, let's say,
salsa or chips.

986
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,109
You know,
something that's not wrapped.

987
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,477
Salsa, chips and pudding.

988
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,278
Or sushi.

989
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,814
Salsa, chips, pudding and sushi.

990
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:24,181
Anything else?
- Ice cream.

991
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:26,183
Salsa, chips, pudding,
sushi and ice cream.

992
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:28,052
Pizza.
- Salsa, chips, pudding,

993
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:29,354
sushi, ice cream and pizza.

994
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:30,722
I wouldn't take home
a frozen pizza,

995
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:31,856
but if there was a nice pie

996
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:33,192
that was out...
- Oh, boy.

997
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:37,028
I am truly impressed,
Mr. McMahon.

998
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,465
Thank you.
- At the both of you.

999
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:42,568
At how quickly you have
confirmed my doubts about you.

1000
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,337
Now, let's try this

1001
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,438
one more time.

1002
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:52,512
"Taking food home
from the office. "

1003
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,147
Very good.

1004
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,489
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is all.

1005
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,831
Well, I'm not
gonna dress it up.

1006
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,834
Today didn't go well.

1007
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:15,169
Yeah.

1008
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:17,371
It certainly wasn't
the first impression

1009
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:18,674
we were looking for.

1010
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,777
But here's the deal.

1011
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:25,080
Tomorrow is
the pick teams day, right?

1012
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,449
Which makes it
all the more important

1013
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:29,719
for us to fall in
with a strong team.

1014
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,453
If we can surround ourselves

1015
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:33,155
with the right group
of these little geniuses,

1016
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:35,725
we still got a shot here.

1017
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,727
Nicky,

1018
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:39,462
we can coattail this bitch.

1019
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:42,098
You're right, and by the way,
there's no shame in that.

1020
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,533
No.
- There's no shame

1021
00:35:43,535 --> 00:35:45,903
in being the 12th man
at the end of the bench

1022
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,204
who's never getting
in the game,

1023
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:48,372
but he's got a lot
of enthusiasm.

1024
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,073
Right.
- He's waving the towel,

1025
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:51,375
he's doling out high fives
during time-outs.

1026
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:52,476
Exactly.

1027
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,278
Because I'll tell you
about that guy.

1028
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,547
When the team wins
the championship,

1029
00:35:56,549 --> 00:35:58,016
he still gets a ring.

1030
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,483
Damn right he does.

1031
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:01,885
So we got to be
that awkward seven-footer

1032
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:02,887
from Lithuania.

1033
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,155
I love your spirit.

1034
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:05,790
Look, I love you like a brother,

1035
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,292
but I can't have
those cold clams

1036
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:09,327
brushing up against me
in the bed here at night.

1037
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,262
Keep me up all night.
- Okay, suit yourself.

1038
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:13,131
I'm gonna give you the bed;
I'll take her tomorrow.

1039
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:16,569
<i>Can you hit that light,
Pocahontas?</i>

1040
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,903
<i>Tomorrow's a new day.</i>

1041
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:21,607
<i>Welcome to day two. I am Sid,</i>

1042
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:22,908
eighth-year Googler.

1043
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,579
You guys are new Googlers;

1044
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:27,047
thus you're... Nooglers.

1045
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:29,181
Okay.

1046
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:31,985
Now, this place is all about
community and collaboration.

1047
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:34,387
So you'll be
working in teams

1048
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:35,789
from here on out. All right.

1049
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,058
You have five minutes.

1050
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,058
Pick your teams.

1051
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,726
You, on me.

1052
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:40,894
Oh, now, be picky, okay?

1053
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:42,163
Play hard to get.

1054
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,598
Don't be desperate;
just be cool, okay?

1055
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,832
This is everything.

1056
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,400
Are you still looking
for someone?

1057
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,269
I could be your teammate.
- College, major, S.A.T. score?

1058
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,271
Um, Harvard,
computer science, 2390.

1059
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:51,672
Fine. On me, Fatface.

1060
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:52,741
Uh, my name's Zach, not...

1061
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,842
You?
- University of...

1062
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:54,910
No.

1063
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,211
My name's
not Fat...

1064
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,480
Hello, Stanford.
You're coming with me.

1065
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,415
The University
of Phoenix online.

1066
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:01,950
Sort of considered
the Harvard of the West.

1067
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,245
Why don't we all be a team?

1068
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:04,986
Why don't we all be a team?

1069
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,355
Why don't we
all be a team?

1070
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,956
Can I just get...
Oh, please don't touch me.

1071
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,091
Please,
you-you're touching me.

1072
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,393
Blondie, you're coming with me

1073
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,128
on account
of your physical appearance.

1074
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,697
Does anyone want to...
want to be on a team with me?

1075
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,232
Super fun.

1076
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,401
Really smart, but also very fun.

1077
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,105
I was voted "most likely to
succeed" in my chess club.

1078
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,680
Um, Mr. Chetty?

1079
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,184
I don't have a group.

1080
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,186
You'll mentor
the leftovers.

1081
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,053
Which, it would seem,
would include

1082
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:37,889
your two charity cases.

1083
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,558
Nice.
- Off you go.

1084
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,493
Go.

1085
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,064
Yo, Billy and Nick?

1086
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,933
- Hey. - Hi.
- Nice, there they are.

1087
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,202
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lyle,

1088
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,204
one of the team
managers. Pound me.

1089
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,139
Oh, normally,
just putting the-the fist out

1090
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:55,074
without the words
is all that's necessary.

1091
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:57,176
Come on, bro, fist me;
get up in there.

1092
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:59,312
Yeah,
that's definitely not right.

1093
00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:01,014
I... I'm sorry,
you said you were a-a manager?

1094
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:02,115
How old are you?

1095
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,383
I'm 23, but no worries, fellas.

1096
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,019
I'm an old soul.
- Yeah, that's great.

1097
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,988
Um, yeah, well,
the thing about it is, pal,

1098
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,424
is that, um, we don't have a...
well, we have two... me and...

1099
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,460
me and Nick... but we don't have
the rest of our team.

1100
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:13,927
We didn't...
- But we figured...

1101
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,896
Correction:
you didn't have a team,

1102
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,632
but you got one now, son.

1103
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,067
'Cause I got a
few outliers.

1104
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:21,569
Buh-bam, ker-plash, zshaw!

1105
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,638
And we about to get it all good
up in this hood, right?

1106
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,306
Outliers?

1107
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,576
Outliers, 'cause I just dropped
a little G-well on you.

1108
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:30,045
'Cause Malcolm's my dog,
Malcolm's my dog.

1109
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:32,013
What you say...
Malcolm's my dog.

1110
00:38:32,015 --> 00:38:33,849
<i>Outliers, you know,
from 10,000 hours?</i>

1111
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,418
Look, let's get
a team meeting going, everybody!

1112
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,686
Come on, team meet time.

1113
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:40,390
Nick?
- Wonder Twin powers activate!

1114
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,591
What other options do we have?
Let's go, everybody!

1115
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:44,261
Come on, you're with me!
You're with me.

1116
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,762
Uh...
- My team, corner pocket.

1117
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:48,665
All right, let's get some
meet and greet going

1118
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,167
up in this heezy.

1119
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,002
I'm Lyle, and it's pretty
much WYSIWYG...

1120
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:53,370
"what you see is what you get. "

1121
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,439
I've been here at the Goog
for four years,

1122
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:57,808
working on seven projies

1123
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,076
<i>en este momento.</i>

1124
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,078
Wow, seven projects?

1125
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Hey, they ask, and I do's it.

1126
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,248
What can I say,
I'm a people pleaser,

1127
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,283
especially the ladies.

1128
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:06,652
My Mercedes.

1129
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,453
So it's all good
in Lyle's hood, you heard?

1130
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:10,254
Uh, yeah, is Lyle always

1131
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:12,057
gonna be referring to himself
in the third person?

1132
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,226
'Cause if he is, I might want
to punch Lyle in the face.

1133
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,227
Okay, tough but fair.

1134
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,595
Good note.

1135
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:18,264
Lyle's still a little nervous.
Shh...

1136
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,265
Uh, first-time manager;
Lyle's a first-time...

1137
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm gonna stop doing that.
I'm gonna cut it out.

1138
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:23,770
Keep it to first
and second person.

1139
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:26,172
Who's next?

1140
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:29,175
My name is Yo-Yo Santos.

1141
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:30,310
Yo-Yo, how about a high five?

1142
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:31,444
Whoa.
- Whoa.

1143
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:33,513
Yo-Yo, easy, buddy.
I come in peace.

1144
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:35,015
Geez, Yo-Yo, did you get

1145
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:36,283
beat up a lot in school?

1146
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:38,152
I was homeschooled by my mom.

1147
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:39,352
Did you get beat up

1148
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:40,754
a lot in homeschool?

1149
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,923
Discipline is a very
important part of growth.

1150
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:43,924
But my mother
was actually

1151
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,159
a very nurturing person.

1152
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,561
For example, she
provided me selflessly

1153
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:48,228
with the milk
of her bosom

1154
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,863
until I was
seven years old.

1155
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,366
So it's like, uh,

1156
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:53,134
you're tying your shoe,
you're climbing trees,

1157
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:55,203
you're blowing up fireworks,
and then you're right on Mom.

1158
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:56,404
You got mouth on Mom.

1159
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:58,273
Breast-feeding leads
to a higher IQ.

1160
00:39:58,275 --> 00:39:59,441
Okay.
Actually, the science

1161
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:01,776
isn't quite definitive on that.

1162
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:03,145
I was bottle-fed.

1163
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:04,213
It never slowed me down.

1164
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,548
Vitamins are vitamins,

1165
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,718
whether they come
from a teat or a baba.

1166
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,252
Wrong.

1167
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:11,554
Sorry, what was that?

1168
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,688
Wrong.

1169
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,358
The teat or baba thing,
it's wrong.

1170
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,993
I just Googled it,
so you're wrong.

1171
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:18,694
Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart.

1172
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,230
Well, it's a pleasure

1173
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:21,498
to meet you, Stu.
You know, you can't trust

1174
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,100
everything you read
on the...

1175
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,169
<i>The Journal of the American
Medical Association?</i>

1176
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,269
Sounds pretty trustworthy.

1177
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:27,371
It says that breast milk

1178
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:28,438
has more nutrients

1179
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,508
and that those nutrients

1180
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,310
are more easily
digested and absorbed.

1181
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:33,478
Your confusion
is understandable, though.

1182
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,579
You were bottle-fed.

1183
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:35,813
He's right. That's right.

1184
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:37,181
Whoa, guys,

1185
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:38,883
where's all this hostility
coming from?

1186
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:40,952
Where do you think
it's coming from, you big tree?

1187
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:42,354
Two fifths
of our team are

1188
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,656
made up of two old guys
who don't know shit.

1189
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:45,590
Wow.

1190
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:47,826
Okay, guys, I, for one,

1191
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,595
am very happy to have

1192
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,732
two strapping, mature
gentlemen on the team.

1193
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:53,733
Thank you.

1194
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:54,800
Oh, uh,

1195
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:56,535
I'm Neha Patel,
and oh, my God,

1196
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,371
you guys would make
the best Luke and Han.

1197
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,406
Excuse me?

1198
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:00,540
<i>Oh, Star Wars cosplay.</i>

1199
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,308
Cosplay?
- Costume play.

1200
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,576
You know, where people dress up

1201
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,278
as their favorite anime
or movie character?

1202
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,679
I'd be slave girl Leia.

1203
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:10,117
Yeah, metal bikini top,
metal G-string panty,

1204
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,352
high-heel leather boots.

1205
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:13,387
Of course,
I'm chained at the neck.

1206
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,454
Not too constricted,

1207
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:17,591
but just enough
to make things interesting.

1208
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:18,826
The neck constriction's
interesting?

1209
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:19,927
Yeah, a few of us

1210
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,229
get together and...

1211
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,597
whatever happens, happens.

1212
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,531
Oh, uh,

1213
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,999
but work-wise, yeah, um,

1214
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,902
your skills
aren't really relevant here

1215
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,571
or really in this millennium,
so stay out of our way.

1216
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,473
We're gonna do this shit
on our own.

1217
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,041
Well, I'm loving this friction.

1218
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:35,644
You know why? Because that's
how you get a fire started.

1219
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:37,346
I'm Nick;
this is my pal, Billy,

1220
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:38,581
and despite
what you may think,

1221
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,283
uh, we're here
like the rest of you,

1222
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:41,651
just running down a dream.

1223
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:43,786
All right.

1224
00:41:43,788 --> 00:41:45,488
Team Lyle!

1225
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,889
No, okay, we'll workshop that.

1226
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:47,990
It's in beta.

1227
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,359
Okeydoke.

1228
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:51,695
Our Translate lecture
is in 15 minutes.

1229
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,432
Translate is about giving
everyone access

1230
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:56,800
to every word ever written,

1231
00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:59,737
no matter what language
it was written in,

1232
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:02,806
because when the entire
world can see, read

1233
00:42:02,808 --> 00:42:06,244
and find the rest of
the world's cool stuff,

1234
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:07,479
good things start happening.
Lyle,

1235
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,280
you laying-in-the-weeds
son of a bitch.

1236
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:10,982
You're hot for
teacher, my man.

1237
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:14,819
I took her dance class
here once,

1238
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:17,356
but she doesn't even know
I exist.

1239
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:18,390
What are you
talking about?

1240
00:42:18,392 --> 00:42:19,959
"Doesn't know you exist"?

1241
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:22,161
Come on, you're communicating
with her right here.

1242
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:23,395
What's this thing?

1243
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,564
Oh, no, this is just
the company intranet.

1244
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:28,502
It's got info
on every Google employee

1245
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,937
like birthdays, trivia,
meeting calendars, everything.

1246
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:33,907
Really?

1247
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:35,475
Hmm.

1248
00:42:47,322 --> 00:42:49,790
Oh, hey, fancy seeing you here.

1249
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,025
Is it?

1250
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,294
Or maybe you calendar-stalked me
and you knew exactly

1251
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:54,695
where I was gonna be right now.

1252
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,832
Now, am I detecting
a bit of an accent?

1253
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:57,733
You are.

1254
00:42:57,735 --> 00:42:59,734
Uh-huh,
I have a very good ear.

1255
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:01,770
English, right? 'Ello, guvna.

1256
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:04,239
<i>Oliver Twist,
"more bread, please, sir. "</i>

1257
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:05,807
Australian, actually.

1258
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:08,010
Really?
Similar flags, though.

1259
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:09,478
Hey, Dana.
- Kiwi.

1260
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,812
<i>Lord of the Rings country.</i>

1261
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:12,282
Okay, the stain
on this one's better,

1262
00:43:12,284 --> 00:43:13,816
but the white one
may be a goner.

1263
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:14,984
Okay, thanks.

1264
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:16,219
I eat very fast.

1265
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,253
Bangers and mash.

1266
00:43:17,255 --> 00:43:18,254
That's also British.

1267
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:19,622
Vegemite sandwich, then,

1268
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:21,357
which I'm sure you
gobble down very quickly

1269
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,026
so you can get
back to the grind.

1270
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:25,496
I mean, it is impressive
staying at work till midnight

1271
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,830
every day...
also on the calendar.

1272
00:43:27,832 --> 00:43:28,899
Look, Nick,

1273
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:31,902
I'm sure you're very popular

1274
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,938
with the 19-year-olds
at the University of Phoenix,

1275
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,575
with your Southern drawl,
and the blond hair,

1276
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:39,543
and this whole thing
you got going on,

1277
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:42,147
but I got to tell you,
this is just never gonna happen.

1278
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:44,516
"This"? What?

1279
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:45,518
I mean, it's...

1280
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,751
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1281
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:48,420
This is me reaching out
as an intern.

1282
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:49,521
They've encouraged us

1283
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:50,789
to approach experienced Googlers

1284
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,124
and just pick their brains.

1285
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:54,260
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1286
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:55,361
Of course.

1287
00:43:55,363 --> 00:43:56,796
You thought I was just...

1288
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:58,798
"Oh, who's this wanker
just steaming in?"

1289
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,467
You just want to learn.
You want to learn.

1290
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:02,903
Well, look, Sid here,
he's incredible.

1291
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:05,438
He's about to give a talk
on HTML5.

1292
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,439
Okay.
- Nick is desperate to learn.

1293
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:07,573
He'd love to come along.

1294
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,575
Yeah.
- Let's make it happen.

1295
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:09,776
Yeah, sure.

1296
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:11,044
Okay, well...
- Come on down, brother.

1297
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:12,980
Sometimes we go
all day, all night.

1298
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:14,349
Well, I can't start any sooner
than right now.

1299
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,049
Let's do it.

1300
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:17,684
Cool, let's rock.
- Come on, everybody; here we go.

1301
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:18,752
Now, wait, where are you going?

1302
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:20,421
Oh, I have a meeting.

1303
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:22,123
But you know that.

1304
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:23,399
Cheerio.

1305
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:24,764
Cheerio.

1306
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:25,793
Let's go.

1307
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:28,263
Come on, don't be shy.

1308
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:34,269
You have a crush on her,
my friend.

1309
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,804
<i>Good morning, interns.</i>

1310
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,073
<i>Today marks the first
of several challenges</i>

1311
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,542
through which your team
will show their merits.

1312
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,345
While internally dogfooding
a new product,

1313
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,545
a number of Googlers reported

1314
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,414
a bug that disabled their audio.

1315
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,450
All two million lines

1316
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:50,253
of that code
are in the source files.

1317
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,456
Your job: find the bug.

1318
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,923
Okay, we should check
the user reports.

1319
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,392
Scan the logs for any red flags.

1320
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:56,726
See what exceptions
were thrown.

1321
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,162
I always start
by drawing up strategies

1322
00:44:58,164 --> 00:44:59,463
to sift through the code.

1323
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:01,132
Code, right? Code, right? Codes.
- Right?

1324
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:02,799
Uh... - So at the end of the
day, we're looking

1325
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,468
to kind of break the
password here, right?

1326
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,936
Maybe the answer's
in the question.

1327
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:07,571
Maybe it's something with bug.
- Eureka.

1328
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:08,572
<i>Bug like fly.
The Fly.</i>

1329
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:09,574
Is Chetty a cinephile?

1330
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,909
Goldblum.
- Goldblum!

1331
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,544
Boggles my mind
that no one has a notebook out.

1332
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,314
You guys are focused
on writing this gibberish.

1333
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,782
Maybe that's helpful,
maybe it's not,

1334
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,750
but I guarantee you
what we're saying is helpful.

1335
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:22,054
Guys, we're looking for a bug, not
a password. They're different things.

1336
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:23,622
Keep going
with that human connection.

1337
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:25,090
Oh, geez, you know what?
- You had it.

1338
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:29,495
We'll go on fly,
'cause that's where we're at,

1339
00:45:29,497 --> 00:45:31,129
and we're flying it; we're right there.
- Fly, fly.

1340
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,332
I know we're buzzing around it.
- I like that.

1341
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:33,833
Zzz, Y-L-F.

1342
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,835
And it's a word scramble,
and it's life.

1343
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,604
For some reason, I can't
get "fly" out of my mind,

1344
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:39,039
and now I'm going Lopez,
Jennifer Lopez.

1345
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:40,707
Is it a fly girl?
- "Superfly. "

1346
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,943
Pop fly? Uh, excavation.

1347
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:45,112
Earthquakes, California.
- That's it! Write that down!

1348
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:46,613
Where? Where?
- Do it, do it, write it down, type it in.

1349
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:48,183
What am I doing?
- Would you please stop?

1350
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:50,818
<i>No, we're working.
- No, we're working.</i>

1351
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,956
Yeah, and that's a Sharpie,
by the way, genius.

1352
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,558
That's my fault.

1353
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,793
Go ahead and wash that.

1354
00:45:58,795 --> 00:46:01,329
Look, guys, I'm sorry,
but you're not helping.

1355
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:02,797
You're just saying
a lot of words really fast

1356
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:04,099
that mean nothing.

1357
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:06,302
To find the bug, we need
to scan the user logs

1358
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:08,371
and review the code until we
find the programmer's mistake.

1359
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:09,671
It's the only way.

1360
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:11,307
Except what if it's not
the only way?

1361
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:13,275
Go. - Okay, you said
that someone programmed it.

1362
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:14,710
That means some person

1363
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:17,347
in this building wrote that code.
- A human being.

1364
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,548
Let's just give him a name
and call him Tony.

1365
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,852
Tony.
- Let's say Tony likes kayaking.

1366
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:23,620
Kayak. - All of a sudden,
me and Nick become friends

1367
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:25,188
with Tony; we're throwing
a few beers back.

1368
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,024
We're doing a little kayaking
with my main man, Tony.

1369
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,160
Tony's bombed on
the open water.

1370
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,128
Next thing you know,

1371
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,131
we start gabbing
about audio bugs.

1372
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:35,133
Yeah, I actually think
it's a great idea.

1373
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:36,467
Good, great!
- Finally!

1374
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:37,834
Dark and stormy, feeling us.

1375
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,504
Yeah, no,
feeling you big-time, buddy.

1376
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,272
Terrific. - You know what, in fact,
why don't the two

1377
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:43,474
of you guys right now
go and find the programmer.

1378
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:44,877
Great. Great idea.

1379
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:46,078
Yo-Yo, who's our man?

1380
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:49,147
His name is Charles Xavier.

1381
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:51,216
Charles Xavier.
- Perfect. Nick, write this down.

1382
00:46:51,218 --> 00:46:53,485
Steel trap.
- Uh, he's a professor.

1383
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:54,887
At Stanford.

1384
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:57,055
Yeah, just a few
minutes away, really.

1385
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:58,757
Guys...
- And he's in a wheelchair.

1386
00:46:58,759 --> 00:46:59,992
Got it, Stanford, wheelchair.

1387
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:01,594
What else?
- Uh, oh, he's bald.

1388
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:03,797
Might be with his best friend
who wears a metal helmet.

1389
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:05,665
Wears a fitted suit.
- He looks like a geneticist.

1390
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:07,434
More, more, more, more.
Go on, hit us, hit us.

1391
00:47:07,436 --> 00:47:09,769
Has a British accent.
- British? With my ear, we're done.

1392
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:11,471
Okay, keep searching;
think fly, think bug.

1393
00:47:11,473 --> 00:47:12,907
I promise you, somehow,

1394
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:14,308
this intersects with Goldblum.
- Billy!

1395
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,708
Let's get a move on.
- Goldblum, of course.

1396
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,210
All right, back to work, guys.

1397
00:47:19,815 --> 00:47:22,817
Hey, Professor, what up!

1398
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,389
Professor Charles Xavier?

1399
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:29,658
Very funny.

1400
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,359
British.
Listen, Professor Xavier,

1401
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,728
sorry to bother you. If we could
just talk to you for...

1402
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,863
Gentlemen,
I don't have time for his.

1403
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:35,897
Okay, Professor Xavier,

1404
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,199
we know that it's you,

1405
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:38,900
and listen,
we really need your help.

1406
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:40,570
All right, you-you found me out.

1407
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:42,004
I am Charles Xavier,

1408
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,673
and that's Cyclops,

1409
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,409
and Rogue.

1410
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:47,477
We're all here.

1411
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:48,811
Now, come closer.

1412
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:49,979
I want to share some

1413
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:52,082
of my telekinetic wisdom
with you.

1414
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:53,683
Well, I want you to share
with me,

1415
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:54,817
'cause I want to know
about these bugs.

1416
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,423
Assholes!

1417
00:47:59,425 --> 00:48:01,758
Oh, you maniacal monster!

1418
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,461
Professor Xavier
is a total dick!

1419
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:06,363
<i>Yo to the yo.</i>

1420
00:48:06,365 --> 00:48:08,199
Where are we at on ensuring
it wasn't a networking issue?

1421
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,834
Confirmed there
was no packet lost.

1422
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:11,069
Almost done checking
on whether the encryption

1423
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,270
had the wrong certificate.

1424
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:13,705
I'm sorry, "almost"?

1425
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:14,839
Uh, you're either done
or you're not.

1426
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:15,907
You can't be almost pregnant.

1427
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:17,509
Yeah, hey,
she would know, guys.

1428
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,378
You know what, why don't you
Google "asshole," asshole?

1429
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,280
She's right.
It's not good enough.

1430
00:48:21,282 --> 00:48:22,714
Get it together, Yo-Yo.

1431
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,583
What the fuck was that?

1432
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:27,086
I was punishing myself
for my inferior performance.

1433
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:28,621
Well, that's good.

1434
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:29,990
That's great.
We got crazy over here

1435
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:32,091
and crazy horny over here.
- Oh, let me guess.

1436
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:34,126
Big dick 'cause... little dick?
- Did your mind

1437
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,729
just immediately go
to a penis joke?

1438
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:36,897
Is that, like, all you...
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1439
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:37,998
Was that not witty enough
for you?

1440
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,332
Because I'm too busy working.

1441
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,102
No, yeah, that's fine.
I just want you

1442
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:42,502
to acknowledge the fact that
I'm winning the quip-off.

1443
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:44,204
That's what you're worried
about right now?

1444
00:48:44,206 --> 00:48:45,739
Yes, that's really
what I'm worried about.

1445
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:46,874
So you're more concerned
with snarky banter

1446
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:48,142
than actually winning?
- Yeah.

1447
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:54,115
The deadline's at
the end of the week, so...

1448
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:55,783
Hey, hey.

1449
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:57,618
You guys find Professor Xavier?

1450
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,754
Yeah, we found him.

1451
00:48:58,756 --> 00:48:59,955
Yeah, thanks
so much for that.

1452
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:01,122
That's, uh...

1453
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,757
really great
team spirit.

1454
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:04,259
Mind sliding over here?

1455
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:07,029
I'm sorry.

1456
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,432
It really doesn't look like
there's enough room for you.

1457
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:13,235
Have a great lunch.

1458
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,336
Yeah, enjoy it.

1459
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,473
Okay, let's see here.

1460
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,411
Let's see.

1461
00:49:21,413 --> 00:49:23,446
See anything?
- Oh, there's an opening.

1462
00:49:23,448 --> 00:49:26,383
Is that taken? Okay.
It's taken.

1463
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:32,122
Let's go over here.

1464
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,926
Hi, Headphones.
You mind if we sit here?

1465
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:38,462
I think we can take that

1466
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:39,930
as a "yes. "
- All right.

1467
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:42,399
We're gonna have to
at this point.

1468
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,269
How you doing, bud?

1469
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:46,171
He doesn't even
know we exist.

1470
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:48,340
He's like some kind
of a superhero on this computer.

1471
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:50,375
Look at him;
he's just crushing his thing

1472
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:51,710
and kicking ass.

1473
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,078
Do you remember
what it felt like

1474
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,281
to be that good at something?

1475
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,482
Look at this!

1476
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:58,617
William.

1477
00:49:58,619 --> 00:49:59,952
Nicholas.

1478
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:02,355
Person I don't know.

1479
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,223
Figured I'd find you
at the cool kids' table.

1480
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:07,560
It's like a confederacy
of outcasts out here.

1481
00:50:07,562 --> 00:50:09,362
Heard you had
a day trip to, uh,

1482
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:10,764
Palo Alto?

1483
00:50:10,766 --> 00:50:14,401
Home of Silicon Valley and
also the X-Men, apparently.

1484
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:16,104
Where are you going
with this, Graham?

1485
00:50:16,106 --> 00:50:18,572
Oh, I just wanted
to let you guys know,

1486
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:19,973
we won the bug challenge.

1487
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,709
What are you gonna do
about it, boys?

1488
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:23,611
I wouldn't worry if I was you
about what we're gonna do

1489
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,446
or what we're not gonna do;
we're gonna be just fine.

1490
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:27,115
You're gonna be fine?
All right.

1491
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:28,416
Keep telling yourself that.

1492
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,618
See you all-stars
at the intramural fields

1493
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,953
for the next challenge
I'll win.

1494
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:34,223
Sports. Something
we know about, baby.

1495
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:35,790
Something we know
a lot about, baby.

1496
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,558
Come on, now.
- Look at me.

1497
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,794
For real.

1498
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:03,754
All right, teams,
welcome to the Quidditch pitch.

1499
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:06,424
Let's have a good,
clean match, Nooglers.

1500
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:14,665
Fatty, don't touch the ball.

1501
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,667
Okay, rules. The Beaters toss
the Bludgers at the Chasers

1502
00:51:16,669 --> 00:51:18,637
before they can get the Quaffle
through the three rings.

1503
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:20,439
No blagging, no blatching,
no bumphing, no haversacking.

1504
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:22,307
I don't want to see
any Quaffle-pocking.

1505
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:24,543
No Imperius curses,
no Confundus charms.

1506
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:26,645
In the unlikely event
of a Dementor attack,

1507
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,246
use a Patronus charm.

1508
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,483
I recommend the stag,
but that's a personal decision.

1509
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:32,185
Lyle, Lyle, Lyle,
these beautiful idiots

1510
00:51:32,187 --> 00:51:33,218
have no idea
what you're talking about.

1511
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,554
Use your Muggle words.
Come on.

1512
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,022
Come on, Lyle,
you're making me feel

1513
00:51:36,024 --> 00:51:37,657
like I'm back in
math class, okay?

1514
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:40,728
You got a couple savants here
with eye-hand coordination.

1515
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,062
Just say "game on"
and let us play.

1516
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:44,664
Fair enough; version 2.0.

1517
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,766
Peg them with the kick balls

1518
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:47,067
before they throw the volleyball

1519
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,202
through the hoop.

1520
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:49,536
Brooms in, people.

1521
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:50,704
Hufflepuff on three.

1522
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:52,673
One, two, three...

1523
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:53,674
Hufflepuff!

1524
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:54,742
Yeah, son!

1525
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:55,943
Yeah, let's get it.

1526
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,712
All right, game time.

1527
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,647
Let's get Huff-tarded in here.

1528
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,557
No mercy! No mercy!

1529
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,825
Tips down!

1530
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,327
Blue team, ready?

1531
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,963
Ready!

1532
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,865
Red team, ready?

1533
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:16,966
Bangarang!

1534
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,769
Brooms up!

1535
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,382
Ball!

1536
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:35,385
All right, slam it!

1537
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:36,754
Nice.
- Yeah!

1538
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:38,022
Yeah!

1539
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:40,390
Ten points blue.

1540
00:52:40,392 --> 00:52:41,526
Billy, Billy, talk to me!

1541
00:52:41,528 --> 00:52:42,894
What do I do?
- What are we doing?

1542
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:44,228
How do I do it?
- It's chaos!

1543
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,531
Come on, you got it.

1544
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,300
Billy, I'm lost.

1545
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:51,035
Just hit them, hit them!

1546
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:53,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's happening?

1547
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,574
Lyle!

1548
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:57,409
What the hell was that?

1549
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:59,411
Why don't you try looking up
and giving a shit, man?

1550
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,480
Come on!

1551
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:02,981
I can't take this! What am I
supposed... Come get me.

1552
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:04,050
Who do I hit?

1553
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:05,318
No, no!
- Come get hit.

1554
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,386
Who wants to fight?

1555
00:53:06,388 --> 00:53:07,620
I want somebody
to hit!

1556
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:08,955
Get the broom
between the legs, folks.

1557
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:10,290
My bad. Let's go, let's go.

1558
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,791
Lesson learned, lesson learned,
lesson learned.

1559
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,194
What the fuck does this have
to do with computers?

1560
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:15,663
I'm winning.
- Stop.

1561
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:17,031
Don't move, fatty.

1562
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:25,907
Blue, ten points.

1563
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,341
Ball!

1564
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:29,510
Thank you.

1565
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,747
What?! What?!

1566
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:33,748
Time-out.

1567
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,050
Time!

1568
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,621
Bring it in, guys.
Come on, let's huddle up.

1569
00:53:39,623 --> 00:53:40,755
Good work, everybody.

1570
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:42,057
Everybody except for you, Zach.

1571
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,026
It's over.
- Yeah, our team's a joke.

1572
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,228
Well, I ain't laughing.

1573
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,428
What about you, Billy?

1574
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,529
Hell, no.

1575
00:53:47,531 --> 00:53:49,632
Listen, we need to
get our minds right

1576
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:51,000
and start believing.

1577
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:52,068
This reminds me of a little girl

1578
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,102
who had to get
her head right

1579
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,137
and start believing,

1580
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,405
a little girl from a steel town

1581
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:56,739
who had the
dream to dance.

1582
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:58,507
No one believed
in that little welder girl,

1583
00:53:58,509 --> 00:54:00,143
but thank God she believed
in herself.

1584
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:01,144
<i>Are you talking
about Flashdance?</i>

1585
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:02,212
The movie from the '80s?

1586
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:03,513
Yeah, you're
damn right I am.

1587
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:04,514
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

1588
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:06,216
Got it.
- The deck was stacked

1589
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:08,352
against Alex, and you know
how she overcame those odds?

1590
00:54:08,354 --> 00:54:09,920
By believing in
herself and trying.

1591
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:12,657
She literally had
to become a maniac.

1592
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:14,691
Have any of you ever
been called a maniac?

1593
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:15,726
Maybe because you were

1594
00:54:15,728 --> 00:54:16,728
a little bit different?

1595
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,096
My mom calls me a maniac

1596
00:54:18,098 --> 00:54:19,297
every night when I tell her
I love her.

1597
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,565
Of course she does, Yo-Yo.

1598
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,902
You are a little bit,
in a good way.

1599
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:23,936
Well, guess what.

1600
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:25,370
That old Bill Gates,

1601
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:27,373
they called him a maniac, too.
- No question.

1602
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,775
Yeah, I don't think anyone
ever called him a maniac.

1603
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:31,610
I just called him a maniac.
- Okay, damn it, guys.

1604
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:33,113
You guys are getting off the point here.
- You're right.

1605
00:54:33,115 --> 00:54:34,413
She had to strip
down to nothing.

1606
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:36,282
She had to sit in that chair
and arch her back,

1607
00:54:36,284 --> 00:54:37,416
and she pulled
a chain to nowhere,

1608
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:38,585
and doused herself with water.

1609
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:40,120
Yeah, where did that
water come from?

1610
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:41,821
Who knows?
- It came from her belief

1611
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:43,255
that it was there.

1612
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:45,358
She believed so hard she
found herself with an audition

1613
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,260
in front of those stuffed shirts
at the dance school,

1614
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:50,731
and she spun...
oh, and she spun and she spun

1615
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:52,433
and she spun
and she spun

1616
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:54,501
and she spun herself into
that dance school.

1617
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:56,771
And she spun herself
into our hearts.

1618
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:58,172
Now,

1619
00:54:58,174 --> 00:54:59,507
in the second half

1620
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:01,543
of whatever the hell
you guys call this game,

1621
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:03,978
can't we all be
that little welder girl

1622
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,546
who wants to be
something more?

1623
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:07,082
Now, look, I know you
guys aren't excited

1624
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:09,384
that we're on your team,
but we're here.

1625
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:11,586
Guys, we're in
this thing together.

1626
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:13,722
So I'm asking you,
believe in yourselves,

1627
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:14,856
believe in each other.

1628
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,927
Let's put on our
leg warmers,

1629
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:19,996
and let's dance our asses off.

1630
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:22,397
Come here, you little
lovable maniacs. Get in here.

1631
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,667
All right, now, I got an idea
that I think would make

1632
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,169
Bear Bryant smile.
No idea

1633
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:27,603
who that is,
but we're listening.

1634
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,743
Let's go!

1635
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,214
Stuart!

1636
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:38,816
Neha!

1637
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:41,485
Lyle, hit me!

1638
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:43,787
Got it, got it, got it, got it!

1639
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:44,822
Yeah!

1640
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:48,093
Baby!

1641
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,769
Blind her! I'm going in!

1642
00:55:58,005 --> 00:55:59,138
Yeah!

1643
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,373
Yes!

1644
00:56:08,617 --> 00:56:09,849
Yo-Yo!

1645
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:14,221
- Yeah!
- Eat it, Malfoy! Suck it!

1646
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,193
See ya!

1647
00:56:20,195 --> 00:56:21,762
Coming at you, Nick!

1648
00:56:23,232 --> 00:56:24,432
Yeah!

1649
00:56:24,434 --> 00:56:26,100
Who's on Blondie?

1650
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:29,269
All right, let's go, boys.

1651
00:56:30,273 --> 00:56:33,074
Okay.

1652
00:56:33,076 --> 00:56:34,475
Pick and roll.

1653
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:35,511
Stockton to Malone!

1654
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:37,545
She shoots, she scores, baby!

1655
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:39,580
Baby, what's up?!
- Yeah!

1656
00:56:40,816 --> 00:56:41,917
Tie game!

1657
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:43,118
Where were you? Huh?

1658
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,620
I had to use the
restroom. I'm sorry.

1659
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,093
It's the Golden Snitch!

1660
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:53,229
Who the fuck is this now?

1661
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:54,798
Zach, get over here.

1662
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,533
All right, Fatface, I think
it's time to fake an injury.

1663
00:56:57,535 --> 00:56:59,436
I don't know how
to fake an injury.

1664
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,972
Man down.

1665
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,876
Get the tennis ball and we win!

1666
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,153
Run, you big tree!

1667
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:17,888
- Aah!
- Go!

1668
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,126
Come on, ref,
you gonna call that?!

1669
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:35,540
Yeah! Yeah!

1670
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,220
You can't be serious.
That bitch just snaked me.

1671
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:48,622
That's got to be illegal.

1672
00:57:48,624 --> 00:57:50,724
Sorry, if I didn't see it,
I can't call it.

1673
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:52,993
You okay there, Golden Boy?

1674
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:54,061
Yeah, the Snitch is fine.

1675
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:55,529
G.D. it!

1676
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:56,997
Don't start that, Yo-Yo.

1677
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:58,232
You did your best

1678
00:57:58,234 --> 00:58:00,468
out there today.
That's the first time

1679
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,403
we all came together as a team.

1680
00:58:02,405 --> 00:58:04,338
Goddamn it, Billy's right.

1681
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,074
Let's keep it rolling.

1682
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:07,642
Just keep it rolling.

1683
00:58:07,644 --> 00:58:09,611
Come on, let's
get a frosty.

1684
00:58:09,613 --> 00:58:12,548
Nick?
- Yeah?

1685
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,883
Would I be wrong
to call you my brother?

1686
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,619
Of course not.
I'd do anything

1687
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,053
for my little show pony.

1688
00:58:18,055 --> 00:58:19,622
Look at me. Anything.

1689
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:21,858
I'm gonna need you
to ice my balls for me.

1690
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:27,531
Brother!

1691
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,172
Oh, boy.

1692
00:58:35,174 --> 00:58:38,109
Time to shut the engines down
for a little bit and...

1693
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:40,111
take a load off, Nicky.

1694
00:58:40,113 --> 00:58:41,811
Oh, boy. What would I do

1695
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:45,349
without these babies?
- This is a "shh" zone.

1696
00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:47,185
Hi. Hey.

1697
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:48,686
Sorry.

1698
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:50,189
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1699
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:53,424
By the way, thank you
for sending me to that seminar.

1700
00:58:53,426 --> 00:58:55,327
It was actually
pretty interesting.

1701
00:58:55,329 --> 00:58:56,395
Really?

1702
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:57,663
Absolutely.

1703
00:58:57,665 --> 00:58:59,264
What have you been up to?

1704
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:00,933
I'm gonna go.

1705
00:59:00,935 --> 00:59:02,434
No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1706
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:04,269
You were here first;
I'll leave.

1707
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,571
Sorry.

1708
00:59:05,573 --> 00:59:07,373
Uh, one thing before I go;
quick question.

1709
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,875
If I was to invite someone out

1710
00:59:08,877 --> 00:59:11,243
to a really nice dinner
around here, where would I go?

1711
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:13,246
Um...

1712
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:14,881
I wouldn't know, actually.

1713
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:17,518
I spend most of my time
on campus.

1714
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,819
What?! That's criminal!

1715
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:21,854
Has it occurred to you that
I work hard for a reason?

1716
00:59:21,856 --> 00:59:23,557
Hmm? This may
sound silly

1717
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,060
to you, but I actually
believe that what we do here

1718
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,962
helps make people's lives
a little bit better.

1719
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,830
No, no, no. I-I'm not
saying that sounds silly.

1720
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,232
I think it's
admirable. I agree.

1721
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,433
I'm just saying
that sometimes

1722
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,502
with all the work,
that you can...

1723
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,239
forget about the person
that matters the most.

1724
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,741
Is this a nap pod
or a convo pod?

1725
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,043
Oh, that's right...
it's a nap pod.

1726
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,079
Shh!
- Yikes.

1727
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,748
I know where you're
going with this.

1728
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,882
Where?
- You think I'm some

1729
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,316
30-year-old exec who's devoted

1730
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,851
her entire life to her career.

1731
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,622
Right? And one day
I'm gonna wake up wanting more.

1732
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:54,724
Stop me if I'm off base here.

1733
00:59:54,726 --> 00:59:56,058
No?
- Well, no...

1734
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,593
What else does your
intuition tell you?

1735
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,061
That, um, I can't go
on Facebook anymore

1736
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,796
because it's nothing but
happy couples gloating

1737
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,733
about their perfect little
babies in those tiny socks

1738
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:04,234
that look like
goddamn sneakers?

1739
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:06,637
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the little Chuck Taylors.

1740
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:07,838
Only I'm ten years
too late, right?

1741
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,139
Because while I've been working

1742
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:11,008
so hard, I missed out
on all the bad dates

1743
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,611
and the assholes,
and now I'm running out of time.

1744
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:16,047
No one told me
it was a game of musical chairs.

1745
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:17,781
And by the time
I figured it out,

1746
01:00:17,783 --> 01:00:20,118
you know, you can forget it,
it's too late.

1747
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,653
Yeah.

1748
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:24,890
Anyway...

1749
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:28,793
anyway... is that kind of
what you were gonna say to me?

1750
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,196
Well, no, I was gonna suggest
that you work harder,

1751
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:32,498
that you roll up
your sleeves,

1752
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,166
that you buckle down
and you get to work.

1753
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:36,635
You can't change the world
when you're laying in a nap pod.

1754
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,604
No, but honestly,

1755
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,372
if any of what
you were just saying

1756
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:42,676
applies even slightly
to yourself, you might want

1757
01:00:42,678 --> 01:00:44,110
to think about doing
something about it.

1758
01:00:44,112 --> 01:00:45,611
And that's not me

1759
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:47,347
preaching at you;
that's coming from someone who,

1760
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:50,050
when they wake up, the first
thing on their calendar

1761
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:51,551
is regret.

1762
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:53,821
Now, that's not
a good feeling.

1763
01:00:56,558 --> 01:00:58,159
Anyway, I should go.

1764
01:00:58,161 --> 01:00:59,694
Thank you!

1765
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:02,530
But before I go...
- Ah, geez!

1766
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,665
Just bear with me.
I want to throw down

1767
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,067
a challenge for you

1768
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:08,235
to go out to dinner
before I leave town.

1769
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:11,106
I'll let you know if a window
opens up. - Great.

1770
01:01:11,108 --> 01:01:12,674
And if it does,
don't minimize it.

1771
01:01:12,676 --> 01:01:14,543
Don't click
that little red "X"

1772
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,544
in the corner.

1773
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,945
See? I'm getting it.

1774
01:01:16,947 --> 01:01:18,347
I get it.

1775
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:20,316
Okay.

1776
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:22,452
Shh. Go back to sleep.

1777
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:30,026
Hey, Chetty.

1778
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:32,995
Pretty good effort on the, uh,
Quidditch field yesterday,

1779
01:01:32,997 --> 01:01:34,197
huh?

1780
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,835
It was a game throwing balls,
and you lost.

1781
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:39,903
Yeah, but we really rallied
the second half, I think.

1782
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:41,772
Uh, kind of a spiritual
victory for us.

1783
01:01:41,774 --> 01:01:44,241
Well, perhaps you'll land
a spiritual job.

1784
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,977
You know, Mr. McMahon,
the admissions committee

1785
01:01:46,979 --> 01:01:49,381
was split on you;
you made it by one vote.

1786
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:51,749
That deciding member
thought you showed promise.

1787
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,651
It's clear now

1788
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:55,754
that... he was wrong.

1789
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:59,158
Sometimes the long shots
pay off the biggest.

1790
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:01,693
Enjoy your pudding.

1791
01:02:01,695 --> 01:02:04,396
I will.

1792
01:02:04,398 --> 01:02:06,031
Oh, and, Chetty?

1793
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:07,466
Not for nothing,

1794
01:02:07,468 --> 01:02:09,735
can't get me not to like you.

1795
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:19,346
All right, guys,
let's take this new team spirit,

1796
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:21,948
and let's apply it to this next
app challenge. We got this.

1797
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,017
Yo, it'd help if we had
an idea for an app.

1798
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:27,221
- You bet your sweet ass
it would, Stewie. - No.

1799
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:29,624
Never Stewie.
- Okay, you don't like "Stewie. "

1800
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,391
Perimeter breach
acknowledged, Stuart.

1801
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:33,895
It'll feel good when
this one warms up to me.

1802
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,363
You know it's gonna
happen, right?

1803
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:36,564
I'll break you down like
a two-by-four, bronco.

1804
01:02:36,566 --> 01:02:37,565
Watch me do it.

1805
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,634
Okay, come on, guys,

1806
01:02:38,636 --> 01:02:39,934
let's brainstorm this puppy.

1807
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,502
We're gonna put
the coffee in the pot,

1808
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:42,904
and we're gonna let it
percolate. Let's go!

1809
01:02:42,906 --> 01:02:44,339
I think it'll be
helpful to explore

1810
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,741
what apps have been
most popular in the past.

1811
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:47,242
Go.
- Go backwards to go forwards.

1812
01:02:47,244 --> 01:02:48,976
Oh, and we can bin it, you know?
- Fall out.

1813
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:50,446
Uh, categorize needle-movers
by type of user.

1814
01:02:50,448 --> 01:02:51,814
You're gonna do what?
There you go, Neha.

1815
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:53,315
Hit it both by function
and by user.

1816
01:02:53,317 --> 01:02:55,318
The old two-prong. You're
on the forest moon of Endor,

1817
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,086
taking out the shield generator,
and you're launching

1818
01:02:57,088 --> 01:02:58,288
an offensive
with Admiral Ackbar.

1819
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,022
It's not a trap.

1820
01:03:00,024 --> 01:03:02,125
All right, guys, I don't want to
kill the momentum, or the mojo

1821
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:04,394
that you have cooking,
but to be fair with you,

1822
01:03:04,396 --> 01:03:06,797
needles and categories,
they don't use apps.

1823
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:07,832
People use apps.

1824
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:09,098
So I have an idea...

1825
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,733
nowadays, people are
taking pictures, right?

1826
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:12,236
They have their phones now;
they're out.

1827
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:14,071
Something catches their eye,
they want to take it.

1828
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:16,273
But then the photo's just
sitting there... what if they

1829
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,075
take that photo
and instantaneously

1830
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:19,577
put it out there on the line

1831
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:20,911
and they share it
with their friends?

1832
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:22,781
That's Instagram.
It already exists.

1833
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,950
It's one of the most
popular apps in the world.

1834
01:03:24,952 --> 01:03:28,487
Facebook bought 'em for, like, a billion
dollars. That's "billion" with a "B. "

1835
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:30,188
Oh, no, no. Mine is
very different than that.

1836
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:33,458
Because, in mine, you're taking
the photo instantaneously,

1837
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,827
you're putting the photo
out there on the line.

1838
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:37,195
on the line
and I'm creating an exchange.

1839
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:38,964
Yeah, that's Instagram.
- But mine's more

1840
01:03:38,966 --> 01:03:40,600
of a social sharing
on the line that's happening.

1841
01:03:40,602 --> 01:03:42,068
Online.
Quick interjection.

1842
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,370
When you keep saying "on
the line," you do mean "online"?

1843
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:47,373
Stuart, don't do that.
You don't do that to a man.

1844
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,108
He's got a million-dollar idea
right here.

1845
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,744
Billion-dollar idea.
- Even better. Let him flow.

1846
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:52,412
Nick, I appreciate it.
You can't bring me down.

1847
01:03:52,414 --> 01:03:54,281
I'm too positive. Come here,
let me share something with you.

1848
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:56,683
No. - Please, come.
I'm gonna explain this

1849
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:58,085
to you in a way
that's visual.

1850
01:03:58,087 --> 01:03:59,586
He's bigger than you.
Be careful.

1851
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:01,890
So, now you're out there,
take a photo.

1852
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:03,558
Just a pretend one.
Go ahead.

1853
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:07,629
Now you take that photo,
you put it on the line,

1854
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:10,398
Online. - ... put it on Twitter,
you put it on whatever you want.

1855
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,833
That is Instagram.

1856
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,369
That's Instagram.
- Hundred percent.

1857
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:15,537
I get it. We're hip.
- We're not dummies.

1858
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:18,273
Point taken. Now let's
go with my concept.

1859
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:21,577
Now you've taken a
photo instantaneously,

1860
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:23,045
or not instantaneously,

1861
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:25,748
and then you take those
and you send those out

1862
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,216
on the line.

1863
01:04:27,218 --> 01:04:29,886
Online.
- You don't have to say shit.

1864
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:31,888
You don't. You just say,

1865
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,756
"I like that photo,"
and you share that photo

1866
01:04:33,758 --> 01:04:35,125
instantaneously
on the line

1867
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:36,593
- Online.
- with your friends.

1868
01:04:36,595 --> 01:04:37,894
Now everyone's exchanging ideas.

1869
01:04:37,896 --> 01:04:39,429
Everyone's exchanging photos!

1870
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:40,898
And that's
why the photos

1871
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,633
that are being shared
on the line... - Online.

1872
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:45,035
will be known as
"Exchangeagram. "

1873
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:46,737
Nice!
- Holy shitballs, Billy!

1874
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:48,172
We don't have
time for this.

1875
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:49,874
Hello, fellow interns!
Graham Hawtrey here.

1876
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,242
I've taken the liberty

1877
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:54,045
of attaching a link
to our app, which has

1878
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:56,914
already been downloaded
230 times. Booyah!

1879
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,784
Great.

1880
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:00,152
We're gonna lose
yet another challenge,

1881
01:05:00,154 --> 01:05:01,587
we're not gonna
get these jobs,

1882
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:03,188
and our lives
are basically ruined.

1883
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,924
Okay, hold on a sec.
Your life isn't ruined.

1884
01:05:05,926 --> 01:05:07,125
You guys are 21 years old.

1885
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:09,062
You have your whole life
in front of you.

1886
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:11,030
Do you even know what it's
like to be 21 right now?

1887
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,464
I mean, a quarter
of the kids

1888
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:14,066
coming out of college
can't even get jobs.

1889
01:05:14,068 --> 01:05:15,335
That's a correct statistic.
Mother says

1890
01:05:15,337 --> 01:05:17,303
you can work hard and go
to the right school,

1891
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:18,905
but nothing
is guaranteed anymore.

1892
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:21,541
That's life. Sorry.

1893
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,076
These guys are right.

1894
01:05:23,078 --> 01:05:25,813
The whole American Dream thing
that you guys grew up on,

1895
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:28,248
that's all it is
nowadays... a dream.

1896
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,917
You're too young
to be this cynical.

1897
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,785
Do you really see
the world this way?

1898
01:05:31,787 --> 01:05:33,287
That's not how we see it.

1899
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:36,290
It's just...
the way things are now.

1900
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:37,892
All right, that's it.

1901
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:39,427
Everybody up.
Here we go.

1902
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:41,695
Let's do it.
Breath-of-fresh-air time.

1903
01:05:41,697 --> 01:05:42,897
Why? we have
work to do.

1904
01:05:42,899 --> 01:05:43,932
No, no, no.
- Uh-huh. Ah-ah!

1905
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:45,266
Time to hit
the reset button.

1906
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:46,935
Yeah.
- We're taking it to the street.

1907
01:05:46,937 --> 01:05:48,638
We're gonna get our heads
right, 'cause we need

1908
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,305
to come together as a team,
'cause that's not happening.

1909
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:51,873
What about the app?
- This is bigger than an app.

1910
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,542
Okay, and by the way,
we do have something

1911
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:55,277
pretty terrific in our back
pocket with that Exchangeagram.

1912
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:56,879
Just let it marinate.
- Oh, we're holding four aces.

1913
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:58,314
Stop saying no before
you give it a chance.

1914
01:05:58,316 --> 01:05:59,849
Oh, yeah, that's a winner.
Here we go.

1915
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:01,117
Time to light it up forever

1916
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,052
and never go to sleep.
- Let's go.

1917
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:06,123
Can we talk about this
"online, on the line" thing?

1918
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:08,291
Please?
We're gonna follow the morons?

1919
01:06:08,293 --> 01:06:10,627
# Lookin' at, lookin' at,
lookin' at me #

1920
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:13,196
# Look at that, look at how
they lookin' at me #

1921
01:06:13,198 --> 01:06:15,533
# Eyes all sticky
like honey on bees #

1922
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:18,036
# Yeah, uh, uh # Look at that,
look at how they lookin' at me... #

1923
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:27,446
Eh...

1924
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:34,420
<i>Oh, xièxie!</i>

1925
01:06:34,422 --> 01:06:37,322
My friend here says there's

1926
01:06:37,324 --> 01:06:39,425
a dance club down the street
that's supposed to be great.

1927
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:41,026
You're shitting me.
- No, I shit you not.

1928
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:42,361
Come on, let's hit it.

1929
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:44,531
# Driving my car
to a foreign place #

1930
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,166
# Lookin' at me,
now they know my face #

1931
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:48,834
# We want it all now,
we got it all #

1932
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:51,404
# Yes, look at that,
look at how they lookin' at #

1933
01:06:51,406 --> 01:06:53,773
# Look at how they lookin' at,
look at how they lookin' at... #

1934
01:06:57,112 --> 01:06:59,479
# Roll that

1935
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,682
# Roll that

1936
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,287
# Roll that

1937
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,558
# Trust me, trust me

1938
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,894
# I'll give you one night
just to love me #

1939
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,262
# Have your man say, "Fuck me"

1940
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:15,963
# 'Cause I beat
that pussy up ugly #

1941
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,799
<i># Ooh... #
# We gamblin'...</i>

1942
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,469
Are you sure
he said "dance club"?

1943
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:22,270
You know, I was
rocking Mandarin,

1944
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,474
he was rocking Cantonese...
something clearly got confused

1945
01:07:24,476 --> 01:07:26,908
in the middle, but I say,
boom goes the dynamite.

1946
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,845
Happy accident, right?

1947
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:33,116
Show you to your table?

1948
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,955
Great big world
out there, my friend.

1949
01:07:38,957 --> 01:07:42,226
Just three inches up,
I beg you.

1950
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:43,927
Yeah.

1951
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,262
Any questions?

1952
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:48,298
Oh... wow.

1953
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,833
Holy...

1954
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:51,503
shit, that's deep.

1955
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:56,441
All right, I think
that's our cue. Here we go.

1956
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:57,942
- Okay. - Great. Deal with it.
- Yes.

1957
01:07:57,944 --> 01:07:59,711
Come on! Whoo!
- This is... this is good.

1958
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:00,779
I mean,
it's totally cool.

1959
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:02,248
It's great.

1960
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,982
You okay there,
firecracker?

1961
01:08:03,984 --> 01:08:05,450
What? Yeah. Totally.
- All right.

1962
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:07,419
What? This...
this is my jam.

1963
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:09,054
I mean, this... this here is my shit.
- No, look, I know

1964
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:10,389
this is your shit,
but look, if you don't

1965
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:12,024
want to be here,
I'll go grab those guys

1966
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:13,125
by their little boners,
and we'll drag them,

1967
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:14,894
we'll all go back on the bus.

1968
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:17,730
Yeah, we can...
- No, no, no, don't do that, don't do that.

1969
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:19,099
It's just, um...

1970
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,835
I've only read
about this stuff, okay?

1971
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:26,173
<i>Craigslist casual encounters.
Twilight fan fiction. Hentai.</i>

1972
01:08:26,175 --> 01:08:27,474
What's Hentai?

1973
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,144
Japanese comic books
where the women

1974
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:32,012
get penetrated
by octopus tentacles.

1975
01:08:32,014 --> 01:08:34,848
Oh. Ah.
- Look,

1976
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:35,883
it's just...

1977
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:37,885
I have imagined... everything.

1978
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:40,722
It's just I've...
I've never done... anything.

1979
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:41,989
Hey, listen,

1980
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:43,391
your secret's safe with us.

1981
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:44,859
And for what it's worth,

1982
01:08:44,861 --> 01:08:47,796
your imagination is so wild,

1983
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:51,032
reality's gonna be a breeze,
if not a letdown.

1984
01:08:51,034 --> 01:08:52,768
Thanks.

1985
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,770
Show you to your
table, cutie?

1986
01:08:54,772 --> 01:08:57,607
# I'd rather lose it all
than take it home without you #

1987
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:58,741
# Roll that

1988
01:09:01,144 --> 01:09:02,344
# Roll the dice.

1989
01:09:13,157 --> 01:09:14,491
Get in here!

1990
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:16,260
Let's go!
It's about time

1991
01:09:16,262 --> 01:09:19,495
this group had a night.
Let the good times roll!

1992
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:22,566
- Bingo...!
- Here you go!

1993
01:09:22,568 --> 01:09:24,535
Bottoms up, Yo-Yo.
- Oh, I-I can't.

1994
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:25,470
I... I can't.

1995
01:09:25,472 --> 01:09:27,205
What?
You're 21, right?

1996
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:30,407
Yeah, but my mom says alcohol
numbs the brain.

1997
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:32,544
Look, I'm not saying
a shot of tequila's

1998
01:09:32,546 --> 01:09:34,713
the first step on the
journey to self-respect,

1999
01:09:34,715 --> 01:09:38,483
but goddamn, maybe it's a
step in the right direction.

2000
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:39,784
Maybe?

2001
01:09:39,786 --> 01:09:41,119
Your call.

2002
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:42,655
One shot.

2003
01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:43,856
- Whoo! All right!
- That-a-boy! - One shot!

2004
01:09:43,858 --> 01:09:45,258
Yeah!
- Bang it, Yo!

2005
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,592
Let's go, baby!
- Yeah! That's it, baby!

2006
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:48,794
To the night you'll
never remember!

2007
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:04,646
Yeah!
- He's getting down, people!

2008
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:06,581
One more!

2009
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,395
Look what we got
cooking here. Ready?

2010
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,000
Exchangeagram moment, bitches!

2011
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:30,172
Ready for your first
lap dance, professor?

2012
01:10:30,174 --> 01:10:31,607
Are you kidding?
Yo-Yo stays ready.

2013
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:33,009
That way,
he doesn't have

2014
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,245
to get ready.
- This is Tapioca.

2015
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:37,646
She's studying
to be a dental assistant.

2016
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:38,915
Enjoy!

2017
01:10:46,724 --> 01:10:49,427
It happens all the time.

2018
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:51,929
Some would say
it's the point.

2019
01:10:56,902 --> 01:10:58,502
It's all good.

2020
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,940
You might want to double up
on the underwear next time.

2021
01:11:01,942 --> 01:11:06,078
# Make that body work,
make-make that body work... #

2022
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,579
I got to tell you,

2023
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:10,182
the reboot time
is impressive.

2024
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,452
Trifecta.

2025
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:15,053
Cheers, bud.
- Hey, cheers. Cheers.

2026
01:11:15,055 --> 01:11:17,790
<i># Hot thing, hot thing, hot thing #

2036
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:46,721
No way. H-Hi.

2037
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:49,224
Is that your dance
teacher from back at Google?

2038
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,627
Go talk to her.

2039
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:53,495
Y - Yeah, for shizzle, you know,

2040
01:11:53,497 --> 01:11:55,597
I just go up and I'm, like,

2041
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:57,500
"Y-Yo, you want to join
the Lyle-High Club?"

2042
01:11:57,502 --> 01:11:59,402
You know, Lyle, sometimes
the most radical move

2043
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:00,870
is just to be yourself.

2044
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:04,373
And I really like the real Lyle.

2045
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,110
Yeah?
- Yeah.

2046
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:09,980
Go on, you're
burning daylight.

2047
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:14,017
Let's do this.

2048
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:22,993
Uh, hi.
- Okay, good.

2049
01:12:22,995 --> 01:12:25,797
Hi.
- Hi.

2050
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:26,798
Hi.

2051
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,799
Hi.
- Hi.

2052
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,501
You were really good up there.

2053
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:32,170
I mean, that was
amaz... I...

2054
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:34,138
Not in... not in,
like, a sexual way.

2055
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,274
Well, kind of in
a sexual way.

2056
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:37,009
It was... you're very talented.

2057
01:12:37,011 --> 01:12:38,477
Everything you do is special,

2058
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,811
is what I'm saying.

2059
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,713
I'm-I'm just...
I'm so embarrassed.

2060
01:12:41,715 --> 01:12:43,182
What? You're embar...
Are you kidding?

2061
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,583
Now we're even,
because dancing

2062
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:46,753
in your class at Google
was one of the most

2063
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:50,022
embarrassing moments
of m'life.

2064
01:12:50,024 --> 01:12:51,286
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

2065
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:53,641
I don't remember anything
specifically awful.

2066
01:12:53,676 --> 01:12:56,830
Oh, poop. You don't
remem... you don't...

2067
01:12:56,832 --> 01:13:00,100
Well, then that means
we're not even, and...

2068
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:02,702
there's only one very
unfortunate way to fix that.

2069
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:04,105
Oh.

2070
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:09,376
Okay, yes, all right,

2071
01:13:09,378 --> 01:13:11,445
that is burned in my memory.
You can stop now.

2072
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:13,180
How about I stop...

2073
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:14,916
if and only if...
- Yes?

2074
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:16,485
I can buy you a drink?

2075
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:20,021
I would love that.

2076
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:21,056
Yeah?
- Yeah.

2077
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:22,090
Shots?

2078
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:24,159
Yes. Shots.
- Shots.

2079
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:26,229
# I can fuck you

2080
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:39,742
# I can fuck you

2081
01:13:39,744 --> 01:13:41,410
# Better, better,
better, better #

2082
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:42,513
# Better, better

2083
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:44,214
# I can fuck you

2084
01:13:55,627 --> 01:13:58,495
# Hey, I heard
you were a wild one #

2085
01:13:58,497 --> 01:14:00,965
# Wild one, wild one, ooh

2086
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:03,368
# Oh, I-I like crazy,
foolish, stupid #

2087
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,004
# Party going wild,
fist-pumping music... #

2088
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:07,472
I... I love teaching
at Google,

2089
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:09,307
but it's only part-time,
and it doesn't cover

2090
01:14:09,309 --> 01:14:10,576
my tuition,
so I augment.

2091
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:12,111
No, don't augment;
you look perfect

2092
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:13,579
the way you are.
- Aw.

2093
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:15,614
Thanks.
- Could I get a dance?

2094
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:17,316
Not now.
- Look, bitch, I don't know

2095
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:18,717
who you think
this geek is,

2096
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,254
<i>but I spend a shitload
of dinerin this place</i>

2097
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,056
and I expect to nut.

2098
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,491
Yeah, I know, I'm totally
a geek, Biff Tannen. Huh?

2099
01:14:25,493 --> 01:14:27,160
Who's Biff Tannen?

2100
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:30,163
<i>You're, um, Biff from
Back to the Future, right?</i>

2101
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,567
You want to take this outside?
- No, I think I'd rather

2102
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,134
stay here and talk
to the pretty girl.

2103
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,936
Yeah, well, let's rock, not talk.
- Hey, man...

2104
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,039
Stop it.
- Hey, is there a problem here?

2105
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:40,608
It looks like somebody needs
their two way older brothers

2106
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,343
to fight for them, huh?

2107
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:45,513
Oh, and it's the
United Colors of Nerd.

2108
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,148
Do all you guys
work together?

2109
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,484
I'm gonna out on a limb
and say it's a tech company.

2110
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:51,019
Free cereal
and ugly people?

2111
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:52,354
Oh, whoa! Hey!

2112
01:14:52,356 --> 01:14:54,121
Come on, take it easy.

2113
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,457
Is this the Jets and the Sharks?

2114
01:14:55,459 --> 01:14:57,025
So why don't you guys
head that way,

2115
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,127
we'll head this way,
and never the twain shall meet.

2116
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:00,697
Have a great night.

2117
01:15:00,699 --> 01:15:03,565
That's a good idea.

2118
01:15:18,783 --> 01:15:21,417
My mother hits harder than you!

2119
01:15:22,822 --> 01:15:25,256
Yeah! Down goes
Frazier! Whoo!

2120
01:15:27,093 --> 01:15:29,361
What's up! Oh, shit!

2121
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,961
See you again!
I'll kill you!

2122
01:15:30,963 --> 01:15:32,763
Hide your kids!
Hide your wife!

2123
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:35,300
That's how you party!

2124
01:15:38,438 --> 01:15:39,739
We're too hot to party...

2125
01:15:39,741 --> 01:15:41,273
that's why they
got to kick us out.

2126
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:42,874
'Cause they're gonna
call the fire department.

2127
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:44,577
Why don't you bring it
outside to party?

2128
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:46,712
No more fun.
Come on.

2129
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:49,615
Look at that view.

2130
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:51,484
Come on, you're
not gonna see that

2131
01:15:51,486 --> 01:15:52,852
on your little
four-inch screen.

2132
01:15:52,854 --> 01:15:55,756
You got to look up.
Yeah.

2133
01:15:55,758 --> 01:15:58,792
Okay, buddy, you were
an animal out there tonight.

2134
01:15:58,794 --> 01:16:00,793
Right.
No, you were.

2135
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:02,529
Did you have a good time?

2136
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:05,165
Yeah, it was all right.
- "It was all right. "

2137
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,433
Why do you do that?

2138
01:16:06,435 --> 01:16:08,136
What do you mean?
Do what?

2139
01:16:08,138 --> 01:16:09,569
Lowball me like that.

2140
01:16:09,571 --> 01:16:11,672
Come on, I'm not
gonna take away your

2141
01:16:11,674 --> 01:16:13,741
"cool guy" card if you
admit you give a shit

2142
01:16:13,743 --> 01:16:17,078
about something or, God forbid,
you had a great time.

2143
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:20,248
Um...

2144
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,350
all right, it was fun.

2145
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:24,119
Stewie...

2146
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,988
What?
- Come on.

2147
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,523
All right, what?
What do you want me to say,

2148
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:28,723
it was the best
night of my life?

2149
01:16:28,725 --> 01:16:30,759
Only if it's true.

2150
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:36,633
All right, it was the
best night of my life.

2151
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,467
My Noogler!

2152
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:41,071
Come here!
- My Noogler.

2153
01:16:41,073 --> 01:16:43,406
Wow, I don't believe there
hasn't been one boyfriend

2154
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:45,308
along the way.
- Nope.

2155
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,976
That's embarrassing.

2156
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:48,978
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed of.

2157
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,682
You got plenty
of time for that.

2158
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:53,718
I mean, you're
the whole package.

2159
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,886
You're beautiful,

2160
01:16:55,888 --> 01:16:57,488
you're smart,
you got great teeth.

2161
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:58,823
You do.

2162
01:16:58,825 --> 01:17:01,425
Unbelievable chompers on
the old girl, I mean it.

2163
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:03,595
For sure. And, uh...

2164
01:17:03,597 --> 01:17:05,464
terrific shoes...
I'm always excited

2165
01:17:05,466 --> 01:17:07,798
to see what kind of getup
you're gonna throw together.

2166
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,501
That part's true.
- Well, it is true.

2167
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,902
A lot of great
things going.

2168
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:12,704
Some guy's gonna find
himself very lucky

2169
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:14,173
to be next to you.

2170
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:15,807
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

2171
01:17:15,809 --> 01:17:19,311
Well, I am. And I've been
around a little bit.

2172
01:17:19,313 --> 01:17:21,314
I'm positive.

2173
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:29,589
# Hot thing, hot thing

2174
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:31,358
# Hot thing,
what up with it, hot thing #

2175
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,727
# What up with it, hot thing... #
Lyle!

2176
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:36,663
Looks like you hit it off
with Saffron tonight.

2177
01:17:36,665 --> 01:17:37,998
I'm texting her
that I love her,

2178
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,900
and I'm sending her
this picture I just took

2179
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:41,803
of little Lyle when
he made pee in the bushes.

2180
01:17:41,805 --> 01:17:43,938
Look, he's winking.
- No, Lyle, Lyle, Lyle,

2181
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,773
that's a horrible idea.

2182
01:17:45,775 --> 01:17:48,410
Please don't do that.
You're drunk off your ass.

2183
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:49,878
I appreciate your concern,

2184
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,080
but I'm flying, baby.

2185
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:53,615
Okay, Lyle,
you're not flying.

2186
01:17:53,617 --> 01:17:55,116
What's 17 squared?

2187
01:17:55,118 --> 01:17:57,152
289. Why?

2188
01:17:57,154 --> 01:17:58,888
Give me a harder
question than that.

2189
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,556
You know where I'm
driving with this.

2190
01:18:00,558 --> 01:18:02,291
Try, uh, maybe square root
of 17.

2191
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:03,691
Like, 4.23, maybe?

2192
01:18:03,693 --> 01:18:05,161
That's the app.

2193
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:07,730
That's the app
we should do right there.

2194
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:09,331
What? - Some quiz question
you got to answer

2195
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:13,569
before you can send a drunk text
or a drunk e-mail or phone call,

2196
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:15,539
something to protect you
from yourself.

2197
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:16,973
That's good.
Can we do that?

2198
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:19,309
Hells, yeah, we could do that.
- Are you shitting me?

2199
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:21,846
I could program the shit
out of that bitch

2200
01:18:21,848 --> 01:18:24,414
on the bus ride home.
Well, I'll take that

2201
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,851
as an overwhelming yes, then!
Come on! - Let's roll!

2202
01:18:26,853 --> 01:18:29,020
Let's get back to HQ!
- Hey, wait, wait.

2203
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:30,822
Let's-let's stay, like,
five minutes, you know?

2204
01:18:30,824 --> 01:18:33,024
Just enjoy the view
a little more.

2205
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,560
All right.

2206
01:18:35,562 --> 01:18:36,561
Yeah?

2207
01:18:36,563 --> 01:18:38,363
Wow. Yeah.

2208
01:18:54,113 --> 01:18:56,049
Oh, the whole world looks like

2209
01:18:56,051 --> 01:18:58,451
a giant pinwheel of death
right now.

2210
01:18:58,453 --> 01:19:00,520
Price of making
memories, Stewie.

2211
01:19:00,522 --> 01:19:02,789
I think my liver hurts.

2212
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:05,693
Astonishingly, your app

2213
01:19:05,695 --> 01:19:07,528
received ten times
more downloads

2214
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:08,929
than any other team's.

2215
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:11,398
It appears
that you have won

2216
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,500
your first challenge.

2217
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:13,667
How about it?

2218
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:15,302
Congratulations.
Oh, yeah!

2219
01:19:15,304 --> 01:19:18,006
Come on, baby.
- The lead!

2220
01:19:20,276 --> 01:19:22,009
Oh, easy there, big guy.

2221
01:19:23,947 --> 01:19:26,448
He gets overexcited.

2222
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,251
Lovely.

2223
01:19:28,253 --> 01:19:30,151
Let it out.

2224
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:31,853
Let it out, little feller.

2225
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,592
That's what I'm
talking about. Right there!

2226
01:19:36,594 --> 01:19:38,693
Yeah! Right there!

2227
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:42,899
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh # All right!</i>

2228
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:45,302
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh #</i>

2229
01:19:45,304 --> 01:19:48,070
# She's coming home to me

2230
01:19:48,072 --> 01:19:49,672
# Because I said

2231
01:19:49,674 --> 01:19:51,742
# "I'm lonely,
darling, please" #

2232
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:53,410
# But instead of waiting...

2233
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:55,112
You got it, you
got it, you got it,

2234
01:19:55,114 --> 01:19:56,281
you got it, you got it.

2235
01:19:56,283 --> 01:19:58,315
Keep going. Come on.
Come on, Neha.

2236
01:19:58,317 --> 01:19:59,750
You got it, you got it.

2237
01:19:59,752 --> 01:20:03,288
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh #</i>

2238
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,622
<i># Whoa, oh-oh... #</i>

2239
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:10,228
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh #</i>

2240
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:14,266
<i># Whoa, oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh... #</i>

2241
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:19,138
Logan, I'd have Jean...

2242
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,340
Our Professor X was
way meaner than this guy.

2243
01:20:21,342 --> 01:20:22,541
You're not kidding.

2244
01:20:22,543 --> 01:20:24,010
It wasn't funny at the time.

2245
01:20:24,012 --> 01:20:25,478
<i># Whoa, oh-oh #</i>

2246
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,713
<i># Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh #</i>

2247
01:20:27,715 --> 01:20:32,519
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh... #</i>

2248
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:33,787
So, you see, what I'm
doing right now

2249
01:20:33,789 --> 01:20:36,790
is I'm supercharging
my CSS and HTML skills,

2250
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:38,592
'cause you can do them
both simultaneously.

2251
01:20:38,594 --> 01:20:40,394
HTML5, right?

2252
01:20:40,396 --> 01:20:44,332
That's one step beyond the HTML5
that they mentioned the other day

2253
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:46,968
with the CSS3, remember?
- No.

2254
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,402
Guys, when it comes
to writing code,

2255
01:20:48,404 --> 01:20:50,404
you've got your choice
of a number of editors.

2256
01:20:50,406 --> 01:20:53,008
Editors such as Emacs,
nano and vi...

2257
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,209
What? What does that mean?

2258
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:55,643
...have features
like syntax highlighting

2259
01:20:55,645 --> 01:20:57,646
and syntax specific
autocomplete.

2260
01:20:57,648 --> 01:20:58,647
Any questions?

2261
01:21:00,617 --> 01:21:04,086
It occurred to me, why not
use Emacs rather than vi

2262
01:21:04,088 --> 01:21:06,388
as the default editor
for Ubuntu?

2263
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:10,493
That's actually...
a very good thought, Nick.

2264
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:11,761
Thank you.

2265
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:13,830
Vi versus Emacs
is a constant debate.

2266
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,865
Moving on...

2267
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:19,837
Let's talk integrated
personal development.

2268
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:23,640
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh # Oh, I love you</i>

2269
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:27,277
<i># Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh # Oh, I love you.</i>

2270
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,217
Sammy.

2271
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:34,251
What, did you forget an insult?

2272
01:21:34,253 --> 01:21:36,755
Billy, you magnificent
son of a bitch.

2273
01:21:36,757 --> 01:21:38,089
How's unemployment?
Listen.

2274
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:40,058
I want you two
to come work for me.

2275
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,727
Sammy, my boy,
I thought you retired.

2276
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,262
I did, Nicky, I did,
but I have stumbled

2277
01:21:44,264 --> 01:21:46,765
onto King Solomon's Mines,
my friends.

2278
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:48,834
Two words:
motorized scooters.

2279
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:50,102
Head down to Modesto.

2280
01:21:50,104 --> 01:21:51,404
Start checking out
the old-age homes.

2281
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,139
Ah, Sammy, we already
have the gig here.

2282
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,874
Whoa, whoa, we-we-we...
we got a new gig.

2283
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,008
Yeah, we're interns
at Google.

2284
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,109
Interns at Google?

2285
01:21:57,111 --> 01:21:58,478
Who are you kidding?

2286
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,479
You're salesmen.

2287
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,981
This is a sales gig.

2288
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:02,915
It's a job.
- Sammy, we've had lots of jobs.

2289
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:04,451
We're trying to build
a future here.

2290
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,253
And I'm trying
to get hard on my own,

2291
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,754
but the Cialis
is a guarantee.

2292
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,724
You finish up
with this "internship,"

2293
01:22:09,726 --> 01:22:11,158
who knows what's
going to happen?

2294
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,626
Exactly. Who knows
what's going to happen?

2295
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,528
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you repeating

2296
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,564
what I'm saying?
- Shh. Time for baby to go night-night.

2297
01:22:16,566 --> 01:22:19,400
No. What? You're...
Billy, you're cutting out. - Shh...

2298
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:20,567
That felt great.

2299
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:27,042
You know what? I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

2300
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:28,343
All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

2301
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,779
You know, if this
is being a workaholic,

2302
01:22:31,782 --> 01:22:33,282
maybe I should get a glass.

2303
01:22:33,284 --> 01:22:35,851
I have 15 minutes
until my next meeting.

2304
01:22:35,853 --> 01:22:37,319
Okay, well, here's the thing.

2305
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:39,289
You know how we were talking
about regret and...

2306
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,223
I remember you talking
about regret.

2307
01:22:41,225 --> 01:22:42,791
Well, I don't want to add

2308
01:22:42,793 --> 01:22:44,427
"not asking you out"
to that list,

2309
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:46,663
because that credit card
is maxed out.

2310
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:48,298
Okay, so can we establish

2311
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,600
you are, in fact,
asking me out on a date?

2312
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:53,169
Yes. And I figure that I'm such
a mountain of mistakes

2313
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:55,873
that going out with me
just once this evening

2314
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,475
will be like
packing ten years

2315
01:22:57,477 --> 01:23:00,678
of bad experiences into,
you know, one night.

2316
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,712
Okay. Fine.

2317
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:03,981
Yes?
- I'm saying yes.

2318
01:23:03,983 --> 01:23:05,584
Great. Great. Okay.
- I'm in.

2319
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:07,952
All right. Yeah.
- Well, I'll leave you to it.

2320
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:09,587
Okay. Tonight. Yes.
- Good. Okay.

2321
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:16,763
Hello, William.

2322
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:17,996
I've been watching you.

2323
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,197
You should choose your words

2324
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,866
a little more carefully
in a bathhouse.

2325
01:23:20,868 --> 01:23:22,935
In the words of Nelly...

2326
01:23:22,937 --> 01:23:25,037
"It's getting hot in herre. "

2327
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:27,205
It's getting hot out there, too.

2328
01:23:27,207 --> 01:23:28,908
You definitely
got my attention.

2329
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:32,044
All right... I'm feeling like
I want to go put my robe on now.

2330
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:33,781
Enough to do
a little research on you.

2331
01:23:33,783 --> 01:23:35,115
What did we find out?

2332
01:23:35,117 --> 01:23:36,849
Let's see.

2333
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:39,153
Your, uh... your company
was shut down.

2334
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:41,121
Your home was foreclosed upon.

2335
01:23:41,123 --> 01:23:43,490
Your credit score
is actually negative.

2336
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:45,260
That's kind of
amazing, Billy.

2337
01:23:45,262 --> 01:23:46,827
That's hard to do.

2338
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:48,729
You try hard, McMahon.

2339
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:51,232
I'll give you that.

2340
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:54,269
But things never quite
work out for you, do they?

2341
01:23:54,271 --> 01:23:57,472
So, I could waste my energy
trying to beat you,

2342
01:23:57,474 --> 01:24:02,878
but it seems, given enough time,
you always find a way to fail.

2343
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,046
I just need to get
out of your way.

2344
01:24:05,048 --> 01:24:07,183
So this is me going.

2345
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:13,957
Only two challenges remain,

2346
01:24:13,959 --> 01:24:16,025
after which
a mere handful of you

2347
01:24:16,027 --> 01:24:18,929
will be offered
full-time employment.

2348
01:24:18,931 --> 01:24:22,566
Now, the next challenge
is manning the Google helpline.

2349
01:24:22,568 --> 01:24:25,969
This is one of the most
difficult jobs we have...

2350
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:28,171
combining both
customer relations

2351
01:24:28,173 --> 01:24:30,241
and product fluency.

2352
01:24:30,243 --> 01:24:33,344
You will be judged on both.

2353
01:24:33,346 --> 01:24:38,449
This is a very tight race
right now.

2354
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,888
I suggest you study up.

2355
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:48,327
All right.
Let's drill it and kill it.

2356
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:50,495
Authorization failure
with Google Drive. Neha.

2357
01:24:50,497 --> 01:24:52,298
Permission's probably changed.

2358
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,032
Request document access.
- Bam!

2359
01:24:54,034 --> 01:24:55,901
Chrome connectivity issue.
Nick.

2360
01:24:55,903 --> 01:24:57,503
Unselect proxy server
for your LAN.

2361
01:24:57,505 --> 01:24:58,872
Nice.

2362
01:24:58,874 --> 01:25:00,974
Billy, I'm locked out
of my Google Wallet account.

2363
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:02,041
Is that under Gmail
or Wallet Help?

2364
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:03,643
"Uh, I don't know, sir.

2365
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:05,645
That's kind of what
I called you for. " - Right.

2366
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:07,680
Here's the deal. I'm pretty
terrific on the phones.

2367
01:25:07,682 --> 01:25:10,217
I could sell prosciutto
to a rabbi, and I have.

2368
01:25:10,219 --> 01:25:11,751
Except you're not here
to sell anything.

2369
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:13,186
Yeah, Billy,
you're not going to be able

2370
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:14,722
to bullshit your way
through this one.

2371
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:16,624
I mean, the only way to nail
this challenge is to study.

2372
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:18,259
You just... you just
got to do it, man.

2373
01:25:18,261 --> 01:25:19,728
Well, great. Then study up
is what I'm going to do.

2374
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,462
I'm going to study up.

2375
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:24,098
Let me ask you, is there,
like, as a general rule,

2376
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,433
like, a blanket statement

2377
01:25:25,435 --> 01:25:26,434
I could say
that could apply

2378
01:25:26,436 --> 01:25:27,736
to literally anything?

2379
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:29,537
And then I'm either
going to shove

2380
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:31,439
product down their face, right,

2381
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:33,241
or I'm going to give them
another hotline?

2382
01:25:33,243 --> 01:25:34,509
What you are exactly
is tech support.

2383
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:35,912
So, if you referred
them to another

2384
01:25:35,914 --> 01:25:37,179
phone number,
what would happen

2385
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:38,915
is that your phone
would ring again,

2386
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:40,682
'cause you'd be the number
that they were referring to.

2387
01:25:40,684 --> 01:25:42,585
What I'm suggesting
is give me the blanket thing

2388
01:25:42,587 --> 01:25:44,387
where I'm not necessarily wrong,
I'm not necessarily right,

2389
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,955
and then I'll either hit them
with another helpline,

2390
01:25:45,957 --> 01:25:48,492
a real helpline, or I'll push
some product on them.

2391
01:25:48,494 --> 01:25:50,026
You want me to shove some
product down their throat?

2392
01:25:50,028 --> 01:25:51,460
'Cause I'll do it.
- Full disclosure:

2393
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:53,363
I think you're working
harder than you have to.

2394
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:56,066
All you have to do is click
the button and read.

2395
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,668
I got it.

2396
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,103
Bam. Done. Read it.

2397
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:01,004
I got it. I'll do it.

2398
01:26:01,006 --> 01:26:02,372
That's my man, Bill.
All right.

2399
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:03,808
It's going to be fine.
- You'll get it.

2400
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,343
How's everybody
else doing?

2401
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:06,844
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

2402
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:11,215
Is it just me,

2403
01:26:11,217 --> 01:26:13,051
or is this food
incredible, right?

2404
01:26:13,053 --> 01:26:14,619
You're a liar.

2405
01:26:14,621 --> 01:26:15,688
What do you mean?

2406
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,623
You were supposed
to be an asshole.

2407
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,424
Come on.

2408
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:21,694
You were supposed to
pack a decade worth

2409
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,863
of jerks and bad dates
into one night.

2410
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:25,864
Yeah.
- Remember?

2411
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:27,100
All right, now I remember. Yes.

2412
01:26:27,102 --> 01:26:28,167
But so far,

2413
01:26:28,169 --> 01:26:30,736
you've been... totally fine.

2414
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:31,972
Totally fine?

2415
01:26:31,974 --> 01:26:33,373
Yeah.
- Wha-wha.

2416
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,708
No, I have dropped the ball.

2417
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:36,676
I did promise that,
and I haven't delivered.

2418
01:26:36,678 --> 01:26:39,713
You know what?
Can we get the check, please?

2419
01:26:39,715 --> 01:26:41,414
May we get the check when you
get a chance, Jennifer?

2420
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:42,749
How'd you know my...?

2421
01:26:42,751 --> 01:26:45,419
Well, it says right here
on this little necklace.

2422
01:26:45,421 --> 01:26:47,420
And now that I got the name,
how about the number?

2423
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:48,489
Ah... I'm just kidding.

2424
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:51,292
Or maybe
I'm not kidding.

2425
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:52,693
You're so cute.

2426
01:26:52,695 --> 01:26:54,196
So beautiful. Wow.

2427
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:56,664
Did you just
hit on the waitress?

2428
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:58,566
I did. Yes, yes.

2429
01:26:58,568 --> 01:27:00,135
The lady asked for a jerk,

2430
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:02,204
and I am trying to live up
to my promise.

2431
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:04,373
I said ten years of assholes,

2432
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,608
so, you know, you got
some ground to cover.

2433
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:09,211
You know what? I think
you've had enough dessert.

2434
01:27:09,213 --> 01:27:11,114
I've been watching you
eat all night.

2435
01:27:11,116 --> 01:27:13,182
Okay, let me take care of this,

2436
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:14,550
because you've got
to watch your figure.

2437
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:15,851
And you're right on
the borderline.

2438
01:27:15,853 --> 01:27:17,020
You know what they say:

2439
01:27:17,022 --> 01:27:19,322
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips," right?

2440
01:27:19,324 --> 01:27:21,190
Mmm, this is divine.

2441
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:23,427
Oh, you do not know
what you are missing.

2442
01:27:23,429 --> 01:27:25,029
It's incredible.
- That's nice. That's nice.

2443
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:27,263
But here's something you
aren't missing... this check.

2444
01:27:27,265 --> 01:27:29,833
Because I got the cab,
so there you go.

2445
01:27:32,838 --> 01:27:34,372
Oh.

2446
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:35,839
Jennifer.

2447
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:37,207
Bullshit!
- Right?

2448
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:39,044
Wow, a little heart
and everything.

2449
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:41,613
- Huh. Now, why don't you
take care of that?

2450
01:27:41,615 --> 01:27:42,914
Because the night
is still young.

2451
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,215
I'm taking you
to see some dogfighting.

2452
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:45,650
Yes, I am.

2453
01:27:45,652 --> 01:27:48,319
Rock and roll.
I think we're up to five years.

2454
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,621
Yeah.

2455
01:27:49,623 --> 01:27:50,489
All right.

2456
01:27:50,491 --> 01:27:51,791
Oh... yeah,
let me get this.

2457
01:27:51,793 --> 01:27:54,993
Oh, that's a... that's amazing.

2458
01:27:58,265 --> 01:27:59,832
<i>Okay...</i>

2459
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:04,103
"In Gmail, a 'bad request'
message shows if... "

2460
01:28:04,105 --> 01:28:06,172
Shows if...

2461
01:28:06,174 --> 01:28:08,175
"Your Internet is down. "

2462
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:11,478
Son of a bitch.

2463
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,013
It shows...
- Jesus Christ!

2464
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:15,015
You scared the shit out of me!

2465
01:28:15,017 --> 01:28:19,120
...if your browser
has a bad or outdated cookie.

2466
01:28:20,456 --> 01:28:22,189
Wait, you could... with...?
- Hmm?

2467
01:28:22,191 --> 01:28:23,724
Yes.

2468
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:25,460
I... I can hear everything.

2469
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:28,162
I'm... I'm not actually
listening to anything.

2470
01:28:28,164 --> 01:28:30,332
This allows me
to be with myself.

2471
01:28:30,334 --> 01:28:33,601
I'm not very good
with other humans.

2472
01:28:35,105 --> 01:28:39,241
Well, I'm not very good
with Gmail Support.

2473
01:28:39,243 --> 01:28:40,577
No, actually,

2474
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:42,044
you're quite horrible.

2475
01:28:43,447 --> 01:28:44,913
You can do this.

2476
01:28:44,915 --> 01:28:46,916
This can be learned.

2477
01:28:46,918 --> 01:28:48,585
But those kids,

2478
01:28:48,587 --> 01:28:52,922
the way that they look at you...
you have a way with people.

2479
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:59,330
That's a lost art.

2480
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:01,998
Go again. Go again.

2481
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:06,036
"In Chrome... "

2482
01:29:06,038 --> 01:29:07,671
For you, this is like

2483
01:29:07,673 --> 01:29:09,907
teaching a little kid
the alphabet, right?

2484
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:13,244
No, actually, it's like
teaching a kid a letter.

2485
01:29:13,246 --> 01:29:15,747
Just one letter.
- Yeah.

2486
01:29:15,749 --> 01:29:17,549
Yeah, you're not...
you're not... your strong point

2487
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:19,118
would not be
communicating to humans.

2488
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,786
I know.

2489
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,894
All right, that was my guy.
All right.

2490
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,730
Give it to me straight.
I like it.

2491
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,365
No chaser.
- We're having fun.

2492
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,100
I am.
I hope you are.

2493
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,127
Well, thank you.

2494
01:29:59,129 --> 01:30:01,462
That was, uh, really awful.

2495
01:30:01,464 --> 01:30:03,064
Oh, you're welcome.

2496
01:30:03,066 --> 01:30:04,266
I aim to please.

2497
01:30:04,268 --> 01:30:05,534
I told you I was
going to deliver

2498
01:30:05,536 --> 01:30:07,368
on ten years of assholes,

2499
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:09,605
and I think I did
a pretty good job.

2500
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:11,140
It was almost a little bit
too convincing at times.

2501
01:30:11,142 --> 01:30:12,374
Was it?

2502
01:30:12,376 --> 01:30:13,442
Mm-hmm.
- That doesn't surprise me.

2503
01:30:13,444 --> 01:30:14,810
When you've been out there

2504
01:30:14,812 --> 01:30:16,612
running and gunning
for as long as I have,

2505
01:30:16,614 --> 01:30:18,414
you learn to
play the game.

2506
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:20,584
Oh. I'd be out there
laying my rap.

2507
01:30:20,586 --> 01:30:22,152
I'd have girls
literally thinking

2508
01:30:22,154 --> 01:30:23,453
I was an astronomer.

2509
01:30:23,455 --> 01:30:25,589
I'd be pointing out
constellations

2510
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:28,291
and harvest moons.

2511
01:30:28,293 --> 01:30:29,492
"Oh, there's Pluto
over there. "

2512
01:30:29,494 --> 01:30:30,760
And then they'd start

2513
01:30:30,762 --> 01:30:32,396
to fact-check you
with the Internet.

2514
01:30:32,398 --> 01:30:33,564
Oh.

2515
01:30:33,566 --> 01:30:35,233
You know, Google
has singlehandedly

2516
01:30:35,235 --> 01:30:37,201
cut into my ability
to bullshit.

2517
01:30:37,203 --> 01:30:39,637
Cramping your style?
- Big-time.

2518
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:41,439
Making you a better person?

2519
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:42,573
Yeah.

2520
01:30:42,575 --> 01:30:45,343
True. 90% Google...

2521
01:30:45,345 --> 01:30:47,078
ten percent you.

2522
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,982
Just ten percent? Really?

2523
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,083
Let's call it 20%.

2524
01:30:51,085 --> 01:30:52,584
Come on.

2525
01:30:56,923 --> 01:30:58,890
You know, I, um...

2526
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:05,164
I really didn't expect
to like you.

2527
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:09,068
I didn't think
you'd like me, either.

2528
01:31:16,511 --> 01:31:18,646
Thank you.

2529
01:31:23,818 --> 01:31:27,321
That was my ride home.

2530
01:31:28,491 --> 01:31:30,659
I know.

2531
01:31:39,636 --> 01:31:41,337
<i>Good morning.</i>

2532
01:31:41,339 --> 01:31:43,171
Welcome to the Google helpline.

2533
01:31:43,173 --> 01:31:45,374
You will man the phones
for exactly one hour.

2534
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:46,509
Now, before you begin...

2535
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:47,843
I'm so ready
for this thing.

2536
01:31:47,845 --> 01:31:49,612
I was up all last
night studying.

2537
01:31:49,614 --> 01:31:52,648
This is where Team Lyle
takes the lead.

2538
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,917
...icon, accessing your account

2539
01:31:54,919 --> 01:31:58,455
so that we can review
your work later.

2540
01:31:58,457 --> 01:32:01,725
The helpline... is open now.

2541
01:32:01,727 --> 01:32:03,293
Google helpline.
My name's Billy.

2542
01:32:03,295 --> 01:32:05,262
How can I help you?
- Google helpline. This is Nick.

2543
01:32:05,264 --> 01:32:06,798
Great, so you're saying that
you're locked out of your Gmail.

2544
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,166
Hello to you.

2545
01:32:08,168 --> 01:32:09,934
Well, the good news
is Uncle Bill here

2546
01:32:09,936 --> 01:32:11,702
happens to keep a key
under the mat.

2547
01:32:11,704 --> 01:32:13,271
But I'm going to play
a hunch here.

2548
01:32:13,273 --> 01:32:14,972
Delete all your cookies.

2549
01:32:14,974 --> 01:32:16,207
Did that work?

2550
01:32:16,209 --> 01:32:17,609
Great. Glad I could help.

2551
01:32:17,611 --> 01:32:19,478
Yeah, what it is,
is you probably just have

2552
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,945
too many Gmails open
at the same time.

2553
01:32:20,947 --> 01:32:22,747
You want to try to go ahead
and close a couple

2554
01:32:22,749 --> 01:32:24,083
of those down
and see if that does the...?

2555
01:32:24,085 --> 01:32:25,784
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

2556
01:32:25,786 --> 01:32:27,219
Call with anything else.
- This is Neha.

2557
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,189
How can I help you?
It's not a problem.

2558
01:32:29,191 --> 01:32:30,923
You're going to click
on the gear icon,

2559
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:32,358
then settings,
then advanced settings.

2560
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,527
Yeah, you can actually have
the same tabs open

2561
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:35,795
across all your devices.
- Yeah.

2562
01:32:35,797 --> 01:32:37,397
So the browser windows
keep on opening,

2563
01:32:37,399 --> 01:32:40,066
and then you're telling me
that that's from Amazon?

2564
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:42,001
Your computer's got malware.
Use an antivirus software.

2565
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:43,703
But here's what I want to do.
I want to help you clear that up

2566
01:32:43,705 --> 01:32:45,338
before the wife gets home.
Am I making sense?

2567
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:46,741
Okay, you're going to want
to sign in to Google Wallet.

2568
01:32:46,743 --> 01:32:48,242
Update your credit card
expiration date.

2569
01:32:48,244 --> 01:32:49,943
That's the problem.
Well, the calendar

2570
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:51,879
sync issue pops up
when you switch time zones.

2571
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:53,280
Are you on vacation?

2572
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:54,782
Miami. Very nice.

2573
01:32:54,784 --> 01:32:56,517
Well, let's get your
browser cache cleared up,

2574
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:57,919
and then I'm going to talk you

2575
01:32:57,921 --> 01:32:59,387
through the best Cuban spots
in town there.

2576
01:32:59,389 --> 01:33:01,288
Google helpline. This is Graham.
How can I help you?

2577
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,892
Okay, your device probably isn't
compatible with Google Play.

2578
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:06,461
And I want to have you out there
salsa-ing, sweating and grinding

2579
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:08,864
up against a complete stranger
that you don't even know,

2580
01:33:08,866 --> 01:33:10,599
having a pretty good time
doing some wrong things.

2581
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:12,067
Are we on the same page?

2582
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:13,936
Okay, see that box
at the bottom of your window?

2583
01:33:13,938 --> 01:33:15,772
Click that twice for me.

2584
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:17,839
# Come on, baby, let me
hear you do that conga #

2585
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:19,475
# You know you can't
control any longer #

2586
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:22,278
Time's up.

2587
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,646
So soon? Man, I was just

2588
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:25,048
getting warmed up here.

2589
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,784
Good going here.
- Is smoke coming off this thing?

2590
01:33:26,786 --> 01:33:28,651
Come on, Ladybug.

2591
01:33:28,653 --> 01:33:30,019
Nice.

2592
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,822
Please submit your log files
so that I may review

2593
01:33:31,824 --> 01:33:33,023
your work later.
All right.

2594
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:35,626
Happily.
Just click the blue button.

2595
01:33:35,628 --> 01:33:36,860
Where's that at?

2596
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:38,128
Click the blue button,
upper left.

2597
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,963
Mine's not blue.
Mine's gray.

2598
01:33:39,965 --> 01:33:41,866
Up in the corner.
It's not... I can't click it.

2599
01:33:41,868 --> 01:33:43,268
What?
No, no, the blue one.

2600
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:44,569
Mine wasn't clicking.
Mine's gray.

2601
01:33:44,571 --> 01:33:45,770
Is anyone else's gray?

2602
01:33:45,772 --> 01:33:47,739
Did you not hear
my opening remarks?

2603
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:49,941
Yeah, no, I heard most
of your opening remarks.

2604
01:33:49,943 --> 01:33:52,076
It's just, I was...
I was getting in the zone.

2605
01:33:52,078 --> 01:33:53,779
I was pre-gaming it.
- I was very clear

2606
01:33:53,781 --> 01:33:55,513
that you had to log
into your account

2607
01:33:55,515 --> 01:33:57,449
so that I could review
your work later.

2608
01:33:58,351 --> 01:33:59,585
Well, the good news

2609
01:33:59,587 --> 01:34:00,920
is that you
reviewed my work now.

2610
01:34:00,922 --> 01:34:02,288
You-you don't need
the instant replay

2611
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,257
because you saw
the touchdown live, in person.

2612
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:06,525
I don't really understand
that analogy,

2613
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:09,796
but I do know
that attention to detail

2614
01:34:09,798 --> 01:34:11,765
is of paramount importance here

2615
01:34:11,767 --> 01:34:14,034
and my instructions
were explicit.

2616
01:34:14,036 --> 01:34:16,069
Now, if there's
no recording,

2617
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:19,005
then it's as if you
didn't even show up today.

2618
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:21,909
Except I did show up.

2619
01:34:21,911 --> 01:34:24,110
I'm-I'm sitting right here,
Chetty.

2620
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:27,748
Well, according to your log,
you're not.

2621
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:30,818
And since every intern
must complete the challenge

2622
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:33,522
in order for your team
to be scored...

2623
01:34:34,756 --> 01:34:36,190
...your team

2624
01:34:36,192 --> 01:34:40,095
will unfortunately receive
a score of zero.

2625
01:34:41,164 --> 01:34:43,198
Zero?

2626
01:34:44,467 --> 01:34:46,568
Well done, Mr. McMahon.

2627
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,571
Perhaps more studying,
less pudding.

2628
01:34:48,573 --> 01:34:50,039
Hmm?
- Chetty, come on.

2629
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:52,408
You're not going to trip us
with a technicality.

2630
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:54,143
He's right here.

2631
01:34:54,145 --> 01:34:56,913
Oh, Billy, Billy,
Billy, what have you done?

2632
01:34:56,915 --> 01:34:59,215
It's you lot I feel bad for.

2633
01:34:59,217 --> 01:35:01,218
It's really hard
to get here.

2634
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,286
Some of you are probably
pretty intelligent.

2635
01:35:03,288 --> 01:35:05,155
You deserve better.

2636
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:07,224
I'm sorry.

2637
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:10,695
It's all right, El Niño.

2638
01:35:10,697 --> 01:35:12,463
We'll get 'em.

2639
01:35:15,967 --> 01:35:18,503
I studied for the test.
I studied for...

2640
01:35:22,642 --> 01:35:23,909
Well, that's great.

2641
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:25,210
That's another win
for Team Graham.

2642
01:35:25,212 --> 01:35:26,945
There's only one challenge left.

2643
01:35:26,947 --> 01:35:28,514
Even if we're perfect,
it won't be enough.

2644
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:29,749
We had 'em, too.

2645
01:35:29,751 --> 01:35:31,249
We did, but, you know, it's just

2646
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:33,519
a little hiccup,
a little adversity, all right?

2647
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:34,754
No, Nick, come on.

2648
01:35:34,756 --> 01:35:36,522
Face it.
Look, Billy's a great guy

2649
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:39,226
and everything, but he kind of
blew it for us today.

2650
01:35:39,228 --> 01:35:41,327
Yeah, I know...
The kids are right, Nick.

2651
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:42,595
I just wanted to...

2652
01:35:42,597 --> 01:35:43,997
come by and let you guys know

2653
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:45,332
that I...
I did study last night.

2654
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:46,500
I tried my best.

2655
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:48,602
It's just, uh, you know,
today on the phones,

2656
01:35:48,604 --> 01:35:50,737
I just... it's my fault.

2657
01:35:50,739 --> 01:35:53,140
And, uh...

2658
01:35:53,142 --> 01:35:55,243
He was right when he said
that you guys deserve better.

2659
01:35:55,245 --> 01:35:57,612
I'm really sorry
that I cost you.

2660
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:09,290
Damn.

2661
01:36:12,796 --> 01:36:14,229
Billy, would you stop?

2662
01:36:14,231 --> 01:36:16,131
Let me go, Nick.
I'm not helping anybody here.

2663
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:17,834
What do you mean,
you're not helping anybody?

2664
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:19,034
You're helping those kids.

2665
01:36:19,036 --> 01:36:20,035
What are you doing?

2666
01:36:20,037 --> 01:36:21,370
Where are you going?

2667
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:23,640
What, you're going to go
radio silence on me?

2668
01:36:23,642 --> 01:36:25,041
Come on,
I'm not going to let you

2669
01:36:25,043 --> 01:36:26,509
ride away from
the Garden of Eden.

2670
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:27,977
I let down the team, Nick.

2671
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:30,046
You didn't let
down the team.

2672
01:36:30,048 --> 01:36:32,082
And who cares if
you made a mistake?

2673
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:34,150
Nick, I'm not taking everyone
down with me.

2674
01:36:34,152 --> 01:36:35,920
Billy, let me turn
these high beams on you.

2675
01:36:35,922 --> 01:36:37,621
Give me a chance to turn you
with a sports metaphor.

2676
01:36:37,623 --> 01:36:38,922
Damn it, Nick,

2677
01:36:38,924 --> 01:36:40,458
it's the best thing
for everybody!

2678
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:43,561
Stop dragging me down
with all your horseshit, man.

2679
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:45,329
You're doing great here, okay?

2680
01:36:45,331 --> 01:36:48,065
I'm not. I got it.

2681
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:50,001
Just get off my back.

2682
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:53,505
How dare you.
How dare you.

2683
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:54,840
Shame on you!

2684
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:56,375
Put this badge back on!

2685
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:58,343
If you're going to quit, quit,

2686
01:36:58,345 --> 01:37:01,546
but don't give me this crap
about it's better for the team.

2687
01:37:01,548 --> 01:37:04,317
Come on, Billy.

2688
01:37:25,373 --> 01:37:26,974
Randy?

2689
01:37:26,976 --> 01:37:29,343
So, I-I'm, uh, Billy McMahon.

2690
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:31,680
Sammy sent me down here.
I'm the new salesman.

2691
01:37:33,315 --> 01:37:35,215
Well, no shit.

2692
01:37:35,217 --> 01:37:37,285
My new partner.

2693
01:37:37,287 --> 01:37:39,888
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it has been</i>

2694
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,691
an impressive summer.

2695
01:37:41,693 --> 01:37:45,193
And one final challenge remains.

2696
01:37:45,195 --> 01:37:47,329
Sales.

2697
01:37:47,331 --> 01:37:50,499
Over a million companies
advertise with Google.

2698
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:52,335
Find one that doesn't.

2699
01:37:52,337 --> 01:37:53,136
Convince them.

2700
01:37:53,138 --> 01:37:54,637
The bigger the sale,

2701
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,606
the more chance you have
of taking this competition.

2702
01:37:57,608 --> 01:37:59,009
The winner will
be announced

2703
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:01,344
at our final meeting
this afternoon.

2704
01:38:01,346 --> 01:38:02,479
Good luck.

2705
01:38:02,481 --> 01:38:03,747
Happy hunting!

2706
01:38:03,749 --> 01:38:05,115
On me.

2707
01:38:10,622 --> 01:38:12,523
Sales, son!

2708
01:38:12,525 --> 01:38:15,593
Man, those other bitches
are going down!

2709
01:38:15,595 --> 01:38:17,228
Wait, where's Billy?

2710
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:18,062
He left.

2711
01:38:18,064 --> 01:38:19,230
What?
- You heard him.

2712
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:20,933
He thought he was
holding us back,

2713
01:38:20,935 --> 01:38:24,035
and he didn't want to talk
about it, that's for sure.

2714
01:38:24,037 --> 01:38:25,838
We got to get him back.

2715
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,140
She's right, we're all a team...
that's what you guys taught us.

2716
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:29,641
I mean, it might have been buried

2717
01:38:29,643 --> 01:38:31,944
under, like, a mountain
of obscure '80s references

2718
01:38:31,946 --> 01:38:33,779
and just,
you know, a ton

2719
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:36,315
of other super inappropriate
bullshit

2720
01:38:36,317 --> 01:38:38,351
that I guess was intended
as life lessons,

2721
01:38:38,353 --> 01:38:39,886
but, I mean,
you did teach us

2722
01:38:39,888 --> 01:38:40,920
how to come together, Nick.

2723
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:41,920
You taught us that.

2724
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:43,790
The problem is, when he makes up

2725
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:47,527
his mind on something,
ol' Billy has a tendency

2726
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:48,863
to really dig in.

2727
01:38:48,865 --> 01:38:49,930
We might have
to get ready

2728
01:38:49,932 --> 01:38:51,197
to do this one without him.

2729
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:54,335
Yeah, but, Nick,
we wouldn't want to.

2730
01:38:54,337 --> 01:38:55,770
Right, guys?

2731
01:39:01,943 --> 01:39:03,144
Hey, Tony!

2732
01:39:04,713 --> 01:39:05,714
Slow it down, man.

2733
01:39:05,716 --> 01:39:06,715
I'm just kidding.

2734
01:39:08,018 --> 01:39:09,618
How long you been
working this territory?

2735
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:10,986
Three years.

2736
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:12,420
It's great, though,
you know.

2737
01:39:12,422 --> 01:39:15,257
You get to build a relationship
with the customer.

2738
01:39:15,259 --> 01:39:16,425
And then they die.

2739
01:39:16,427 --> 01:39:17,994
Suddenly you're reselling

2740
01:39:17,996 --> 01:39:21,229
scooters with 25,
35 miles on them, tops.

2741
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:23,099
Everybody wins.

2742
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:24,600
Hey, hey!

2743
01:39:24,602 --> 01:39:25,835
Look who's back!

2744
01:39:25,837 --> 01:39:27,638
Hey, Randy!
- Randy! How are you?

2745
01:39:28,674 --> 01:39:31,541
How's it going, old-timer?

2746
01:39:31,543 --> 01:39:33,177
Hey, Randy.

2747
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:35,112
What do you want?

2748
01:39:35,114 --> 01:39:36,780
Treat them like shit.

2749
01:39:36,782 --> 01:39:38,949
Only makes them want you more.

2750
01:39:38,951 --> 01:39:41,118
Hey, everybody!
Listen up!

2751
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,153
This is my new tail gunner, Billy.
- Hi.

2752
01:39:43,155 --> 01:39:45,156
Billy, why don't you
tell them about that, uh,

2753
01:39:45,158 --> 01:39:46,858
sweet ride you just
pulled up on?

2754
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,293
Oh, you mean
the, uh, brand-new X-70.

2755
01:39:49,295 --> 01:39:51,329
It's got an eight-hour motor.

2756
01:39:51,331 --> 01:39:53,031
And it's got a rear-mounted
stainless sleeve

2757
01:39:53,033 --> 01:39:54,566
for your oxy tank.

2758
01:39:54,568 --> 01:39:56,602
You have no idea
how much boning

2759
01:39:56,604 --> 01:39:57,702
goes on in this place.

2760
01:39:57,704 --> 01:39:58,970
It's amazing.

2761
01:39:58,972 --> 01:40:00,071
Check this one out.

2762
01:40:00,073 --> 01:40:01,874
Ethel. That's her name.

2763
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:04,243
She calls my junk
"the cocoon. "

2764
01:40:04,245 --> 01:40:05,544
Says it makes her
feel younger.

2765
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:06,946
Actually lowered
her blood pressure.

2766
01:40:06,948 --> 01:40:08,113
I'm not fighting it.

2767
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:09,882
I'm a life-giver
and a lovemaker.

2768
01:40:09,884 --> 01:40:12,085
Ethel! Ethel!

2769
01:40:12,087 --> 01:40:13,920
What's up, girl?!

2770
01:40:13,922 --> 01:40:15,088
Look who's back!

2771
01:40:16,091 --> 01:40:17,424
Come here, boo.
- Oh...

2772
01:40:17,426 --> 01:40:18,692
Who's your friend?
Well, hello there.

2773
01:40:18,694 --> 01:40:20,293
Billy!

2774
01:40:20,295 --> 01:40:22,095
What the hell are
you doing here?

2775
01:40:22,097 --> 01:40:23,965
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

2776
01:40:23,967 --> 01:40:25,032
Billy.

2777
01:40:25,034 --> 01:40:26,233
Hi.

2778
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:27,567
Ethel and, uh, Doris here

2779
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:29,804
tell me they're up for
a little group play.

2780
01:40:29,806 --> 01:40:31,372
Can I count you in?

2781
01:40:32,608 --> 01:40:35,177
What the shit?

2782
01:40:35,179 --> 01:40:37,011
Uh, I'm sorry, Randy.
This is my old partner.

2783
01:40:37,013 --> 01:40:38,212
This is Nick.

2784
01:40:38,214 --> 01:40:39,715
Nick, this is...
this is my new partner.

2785
01:40:39,717 --> 01:40:41,116
This is Randy.

2786
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,819
<i>Welcome to the jungle, ese.</i>

2787
01:40:43,821 --> 01:40:44,820
What do you say, Billy?

2788
01:40:44,822 --> 01:40:46,088
Can I count you in?

2789
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:47,890
Mind giving me
just a second here?

2790
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:48,891
No problem.

2791
01:40:48,893 --> 01:40:49,892
What the hell are you doing?

2792
01:40:49,894 --> 01:40:51,227
New partner, huh?

2793
01:40:51,229 --> 01:40:52,896
I'm a salesman, Nick;
I sell things.

2794
01:40:52,898 --> 01:40:55,464
Yeah, I remember another guy
who was selling some things,

2795
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,401
plying the mattress trade,
when in walks this behemoth...

2796
01:40:58,403 --> 01:41:00,803
big guy, big mouth,
big dream...

2797
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:03,407
and he made this old
son of a gun remember

2798
01:41:03,409 --> 01:41:04,908
there's still some dreams
floating around out there.

2799
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:06,242
It's not too late.

2800
01:41:06,244 --> 01:41:07,578
You just got to reach
out and grab them.

2801
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:09,179
Damn it, Nick,
I reached for my dreams.

2802
01:41:09,181 --> 01:41:10,214
Why don't you just
leave it alone?

2803
01:41:10,216 --> 01:41:11,382
I messed it up for everybody.

2804
01:41:11,384 --> 01:41:12,449
You forgot to
click a button!

2805
01:41:12,451 --> 01:41:14,685
You're not a
computer wizard.

2806
01:41:14,687 --> 01:41:15,486
All right?

2807
01:41:15,488 --> 01:41:17,054
You're also not a pussy.

2808
01:41:17,056 --> 01:41:18,622
You're tough.
You grew up in the '70s.

2809
01:41:18,624 --> 01:41:20,158
Remember what
that was like?

2810
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,526
There weren't
any computers.

2811
01:41:21,528 --> 01:41:22,928
Just like we didn't
have bike helmets

2812
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:24,362
or sunscreens
or seat belts.

2813
01:41:24,364 --> 01:41:25,897
Did you wear a seat belt?

2814
01:41:25,899 --> 01:41:26,965
No.

2815
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:28,833
What was your
seat belt?

2816
01:41:28,835 --> 01:41:30,303
My mom would go like this.

2817
01:41:30,305 --> 01:41:32,038
Yeah. It was your mom
going like that.

2818
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,371
And how'd that work out?

2819
01:41:33,373 --> 01:41:34,706
You know;
I went through the windshield.

2820
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:35,675
89 stitches.

2821
01:41:35,677 --> 01:41:37,143
Made you look like
a little bad-ass

2822
01:41:37,145 --> 01:41:38,644
all of third grade.

2823
01:41:38,646 --> 01:41:41,715
And were you afraid to get back
in that station wagon?

2824
01:41:41,717 --> 01:41:43,649
Nah. Five years later,

2825
01:41:43,651 --> 01:41:47,287
you took out that very same car
without permission from nobody.

2826
01:41:47,289 --> 01:41:49,456
Not your parents,
not Old Man Law.

2827
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:53,727
It was just you and Sally Moran
parked at the point,

2828
01:41:53,729 --> 01:41:55,395
finger-blasting away.

2829
01:41:55,397 --> 01:41:57,397
Didn't even know if you
were doing it right.

2830
01:41:57,399 --> 01:41:59,801
Nick, wh-where you going
with this thing?

2831
01:41:59,803 --> 01:42:02,269
I'm saying life
is that station wagon.

2832
01:42:02,271 --> 01:42:03,404
All right?

2833
01:42:03,406 --> 01:42:04,706
And yeah, sometimes it's gonna

2834
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,507
throw you
through the windshield,

2835
01:42:06,509 --> 01:42:09,812
crack your skull wide open,
maybe even break your heart.

2836
01:42:09,814 --> 01:42:11,346
But every once in a while,

2837
01:42:11,348 --> 01:42:13,548
it's gonna drop a Sally Moran
in your backseat.

2838
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:15,684
Now, we came to Google
for a reason, right?

2839
01:42:15,686 --> 01:42:17,553
I can't promise
we're gonna win,

2840
01:42:17,555 --> 01:42:19,288
but we're going
back there,

2841
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:22,558
and we're gonna see those kids,
and we're gonna see it through.

2842
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,360
You get your ass
back in that car,

2843
01:42:24,362 --> 01:42:25,561

01:44:34,902 --> 01:44:37,302
all those stuffed shirts,
she took a tumble and fell.

2896
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:39,138
You want to hear something
totally nuts?

2897
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,808
She picked herself back up,
she tightened that little ass,

2898
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:44,176
and she pumped her legs,
and she danced herself

2899
01:44:44,178 --> 01:44:45,478
right back into their hearts

2900
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:47,447
and into a slot
at that dance school.

2901
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:50,617
And that's what
we're gonna do.

2902
01:44:50,619 --> 01:44:53,419
Tighten your asses.
Let's go.

2903
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,989
Get her done, boys.

2904
01:44:55,991 --> 01:44:59,393
Listen, guys, we've always
done things the same way:

2905
01:44:59,395 --> 01:45:01,495
<i>Yellow Pages, flyers,
San Jose Mercury News.</i>

2906
01:45:01,497 --> 01:45:02,763
Now, look, we're all

2907
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:04,198
creatures of habit,
am I right, Sal?

2908
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,332
I mean, we all like
what we know.

2909
01:45:05,334 --> 01:45:06,901
There's no
question about it.

2910
01:45:06,903 --> 01:45:09,070
But you know what the
scariest thing in life is?

2911
01:45:09,072 --> 01:45:10,305
Mmm.
- The thing in life

2912
01:45:10,307 --> 01:45:11,640
that frightens
us the most?

2913
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,475
Change.

2914
01:45:13,477 --> 01:45:15,010
Yeah.
- And by the way, I think

2915
01:45:15,012 --> 01:45:16,778
most people are guilty
of getting set in their ways.

2916
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,547
I know I need change
to come along

2917
01:45:18,549 --> 01:45:21,050
and give me a little kick
in the ass to get me moving.

2918
01:45:21,052 --> 01:45:23,685
All right, listen, guys,
I know where you're going.

2919
01:45:23,687 --> 01:45:25,288
But I'm not gonna
change anything.

2920
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:29,692
Like I already told your
friends, we're getting by okay.

2921
01:45:29,694 --> 01:45:31,227
Sal, with all due respect, if
you fight for your limitations,

2922
01:45:31,229 --> 01:45:32,728
you get to keep them.

2923
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:34,030
Do you hear yourself?
You're getting by okay.

2924
01:45:34,032 --> 01:45:35,666
"Okay"? I mean, Jesus!
- "Okay" isn't good.

2925
01:45:35,668 --> 01:45:37,034
I mean, "okay" isn't great.

2926
01:45:37,036 --> 01:45:38,335
I'm starting to think
this guy's selfish.

2927
01:45:38,337 --> 01:45:39,770
"Okay" isn't fantastic!

2928
01:45:39,772 --> 01:45:41,505
Look, I don't want
to get sideways with you.

2929
01:45:41,507 --> 01:45:42,573
You're as big as a barn.

2930
01:45:42,575 --> 01:45:43,774
He looks like
he was carved out

2931
01:45:43,776 --> 01:45:45,108
of a damn mountain,
for God's sakes.

2932
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:46,276
But you're an artist, okay?

2933
01:45:46,278 --> 01:45:47,345
This is great pizza!

2934
01:45:47,347 --> 01:45:48,780
Picasso with pepperoni!

2935
01:45:48,782 --> 01:45:50,247
And, hey, stop it,
do not even

2936
01:45:50,249 --> 01:45:51,315
get me started on the sauce.

2937
01:45:51,317 --> 01:45:52,317
I mean, is there
nutmeg in there?

2938
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:54,018
Something.
- So look-it, I can

2939
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,687
respect the fact that you
don't want to divulge,

2940
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:57,055
but if I'm right,
don't say anything.

2941
01:45:58,692 --> 01:46:00,525
Exactly!
- There's your answer!

2942
01:46:00,527 --> 01:46:03,027
There's your answer!
Sal, come on.

2943
01:46:03,029 --> 01:46:05,698
All I'm saying is, why should
Papa John's make all the dough,

2944
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,666
when Papa Sal's got
the better sauce?

2945
01:46:07,668 --> 01:46:09,101
You know what?

2946
01:46:09,103 --> 01:46:10,736
Now you're starting
to sound like him.

2947
01:46:10,738 --> 01:46:12,805
He wants to open up
a Sal's in Los Gatos.

2948
01:46:12,807 --> 01:46:14,340
The bigger chains are killing us.

2949
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:15,709
We're barely staying afloat.

2950
01:46:15,711 --> 01:46:17,611
When you franchise,
you lose quality.

2951
01:46:17,613 --> 01:46:20,080
You lose the taste
that people trust.

2952
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:21,314
You want to know why
my sauce is better?

2953
01:46:21,316 --> 01:46:22,949
I'll tell you why.

2954
01:46:22,951 --> 01:46:24,718
'Cause I go down to the
farmers' market every day,

2955
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,320
I buy them
tomatoes myself.

2956
01:46:26,322 --> 01:46:29,155
I walk down the street,
I get the basil, the oregano.

2957
01:46:29,157 --> 01:46:31,559
Look, guys, I know these people.

2958
01:46:31,561 --> 01:46:34,829
I'm part of the fabric
of this neighborhood.

2959
01:46:34,831 --> 01:46:36,497
That's good enough for me.

2960
01:46:36,499 --> 01:46:38,299
Sal, that's better
than good enough.

2961
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:39,533
That's the best.

2962
01:46:39,535 --> 01:46:40,768
And we're not
suggesting

2963
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,169
that you abandon the
neighborhood here.

2964
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:44,573
All we're saying is,

2965
01:46:44,575 --> 01:46:46,575
what if your neighborhood
got a little bit bigger?

2966
01:46:46,577 --> 01:46:47,909
Take a look at this, Sal.

2967
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:50,979
These are all just people
that love your pizza.

2968
01:46:50,981 --> 01:46:53,048
Talk about word of mouth, huh?
- Yeah, they're talking

2969
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,651
about you, Sal; don't you
want to talk back to them?

2970
01:46:54,653 --> 01:46:55,918
Did you know there are

2971
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,519
almost as many people
from Los Gatos

2972
01:46:57,521 --> 01:46:59,522
searching for Sal's
as there are from Palo Alto?

2973
01:46:59,524 --> 01:47:00,757
Yeah, and they pop in

2974
01:47:00,759 --> 01:47:02,358
when they're in town,
but if there was

2975
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,460
a location closer to them,
they'd be regulars, right?

2976
01:47:04,462 --> 01:47:06,162
Boom. Check it
out right here.

2977
01:47:06,164 --> 01:47:08,564
I found a great commercial spot
right on Los Gatos Boulevard.

2978
01:47:08,566 --> 01:47:10,267
Just hit the market.
- That's 0.3 miles away

2979
01:47:10,269 --> 01:47:11,635
from the nearest
farmers' market.

2980
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:13,537
You can smell them tomatoes
from your front door.

2981
01:47:13,539 --> 01:47:14,605
Farm to table.

2982
01:47:14,607 --> 01:47:16,040
F to T, baby!
- Baby.

2983
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,107
Come on.
- F to T!

2984
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:19,043
F to T is exactly
right, Gomer Lyle!

2985
01:47:19,045 --> 01:47:20,878
We're not asking you
to abandon the artistry.

2986
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,081
We're just telling you
expand the reach a little bit.

2987
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:24,649
But look-it, Sal,
at the end of the day,

2988
01:47:24,651 --> 01:47:26,350
the kids, they got
their computers,

2989
01:47:26,352 --> 01:47:27,786
they got their information.

2990
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:29,020
It's all accurate.

2991
01:47:29,022 --> 01:47:31,222
I get it, and I
know you do, too.

2992
01:47:31,224 --> 01:47:33,025
I tell you, Sal,

2993
01:47:33,027 --> 01:47:35,226
I can't blame you
for being a little afraid.

2994
01:47:35,228 --> 01:47:37,996
Hell, we were scared
for a long time out there,

2995
01:47:37,998 --> 01:47:39,665
grinding it out
with our heads down.

2996
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:41,067
And Lord knows
I've fallen

2997
01:47:41,069 --> 01:47:43,269
on my ass more than
a time or two.

2998
01:47:43,271 --> 01:47:45,638
But I promise you something.

2999
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,139
You lift your head up...

3000
01:47:48,309 --> 01:47:50,344
...and take a breath,

3001
01:47:50,346 --> 01:47:52,512
there's a lot of great
possibilities out there.

3002
01:47:52,514 --> 01:47:54,180
New customers,

3003
01:47:54,182 --> 01:47:57,884
new franchise... and that's just
the tip of the iceberg, Sal.

3004
01:47:57,886 --> 01:48:00,320
It's all waiting
at the click of a button.

3005
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:04,191
Everybody's searching
for something, Sal.

3006
01:48:04,193 --> 01:48:05,659
They're searching for you.

3007
01:48:05,661 --> 01:48:08,896
We just want to help them
find you.

3008
01:48:15,538 --> 01:48:17,639
TGIF, Nooglers!

3009
01:48:18,642 --> 01:48:19,675
All right!

3010
01:48:21,045 --> 01:48:22,543
Easy, easy.

3011
01:48:22,545 --> 01:48:24,947
It's okay, it's okay.

3012
01:48:24,949 --> 01:48:27,216
Now, today marks not only
the end of the week,

3013
01:48:27,218 --> 01:48:29,452
but the end of
the summer's internships.

3014
01:48:29,454 --> 01:48:30,820
I know.

3015
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:33,422
As you can see
through these images behind me,

3016
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:35,191
it's been quite a journey.

3017
01:48:35,193 --> 01:48:36,559
Lot of memories,

3018
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:37,827
lot of bonds were made.

3019
01:48:37,829 --> 01:48:39,028
Kind of reminds me
of the first time

3020
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:40,631
I owned a personal...
All right.

3021
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:46,303
Today, we reveal the intern team
that will be awarded jobs here.

3022
01:48:46,305 --> 01:48:48,105
Sadly, one team

3023
01:48:48,107 --> 01:48:50,007
has not returned
from their final challenge,

3024
01:48:50,009 --> 01:48:51,809
so, therefore, I'm forced
to calculate the results

3025
01:48:51,811 --> 01:48:54,111
with their score

3026
01:48:54,113 --> 01:48:57,349
as an incomplete.

3027
01:49:01,553 --> 01:49:03,288
We have a victor.

3028
01:49:05,192 --> 01:49:05,991
Congratulations...

3029
01:49:14,969 --> 01:49:17,403
No way!

3030
01:49:17,405 --> 01:49:18,772
What's that?

3031
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,512
What's going on?

3032
01:49:25,514 --> 01:49:28,482
# What a feeling

3033
01:49:28,484 --> 01:49:29,883
<i># I am music now #</i>

3034
01:49:29,885 --> 01:49:32,586
# Being's believing

3035
01:49:32,588 --> 01:49:34,855
Okay, calm down. Come on.

3036
01:49:34,857 --> 01:49:36,624
# Pictures come alive

3037
01:49:36,626 --> 01:49:39,259
# You can dance
right through your life #

3038
01:49:41,898 --> 01:49:44,466
# Take your passion

3039
01:49:44,468 --> 01:49:48,703
# And make it happen

3040
01:49:48,705 --> 01:49:51,039
# Pictures come alive

3041
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:55,244
# You can dance
right through your life #

3042
01:49:55,246 --> 01:49:58,647
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!

3043
01:49:58,649 --> 01:50:00,950
# What a feeling
- Nice!

3044
01:50:04,789 --> 01:50:07,756
# What a feeling

3045
01:50:09,528 --> 01:50:11,995
Come on!

3046
01:50:11,997 --> 01:50:14,532
# Pictures come alive

3047
01:50:14,534 --> 01:50:16,000
# You can dance...

3048
01:50:16,002 --> 01:50:18,735
Extra toppings
on this one, boss.

3049
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:20,404
I see that.

3050
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:21,839
# What a feeling

3051
01:50:21,841 --> 01:50:24,942
<i># I can really have it all #</i>

3052
01:50:24,944 --> 01:50:26,511
# What a feeling...

3053
01:50:26,513 --> 01:50:27,879
Yeah!

3054
01:50:29,015 --> 01:50:30,307
That's enough!

3055
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:32,084
That's enough!

3056
01:50:35,654 --> 01:50:36,822
Yes, lovely theatrics,

3057
01:50:36,824 --> 01:50:37,956
but the jig is up.

3058
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:39,124
It's too late.

3059
01:50:39,126 --> 01:50:40,692
Rules are rules, right, Chetty?

3060
01:50:40,694 --> 01:50:42,562
Yes. Rules are rules.

3061
01:50:43,964 --> 01:50:46,265
And the rules state
that every team has the right

3062
01:50:46,267 --> 01:50:49,102
until the announcement is made
to turn in their sales.

3063
01:50:49,104 --> 01:50:51,704
So, in spite of
Yes!

3064
01:50:51,706 --> 01:50:53,941
your lack of punctuality,
which is astounding,

3065
01:50:53,943 --> 01:50:56,242
I have no choice...

3066
01:50:56,244 --> 01:51:00,481
but to accept this submission
and to recalculate.

3067
01:51:00,483 --> 01:51:01,849
Go ahead.

3068
01:51:01,851 --> 01:51:03,417
Recalculate.

3069
01:51:03,419 --> 01:51:05,753
One sale to a small
family pizza joint's

3070
01:51:05,755 --> 01:51:07,154
not gonna make
a difference anyway.

3071
01:51:07,156 --> 01:51:10,792
It does seem that Mr. Hawtrey
is correct once again.

3072
01:51:10,794 --> 01:51:11,927
Boom.

3073
01:51:11,929 --> 01:51:14,161
Oh.
- The sales from one shop

3074
01:51:14,163 --> 01:51:17,899
on the last challenge are not
enough to put you in the lead.

3075
01:51:17,901 --> 01:51:19,334
I'm sorry, bud.

3076
01:51:20,903 --> 01:51:23,638
But...

3077
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,741
this is not one shop.

3078
01:51:26,743 --> 01:51:28,010
You see,

3079
01:51:28,012 --> 01:51:31,280
this... is
a blossoming franchise

3080
01:51:31,282 --> 01:51:34,784
with endless possibilities,
thanks to you.

3081
01:51:34,786 --> 01:51:36,619
And what you have done as a team

3082
01:51:36,621 --> 01:51:39,122
is connect to people

3083
01:51:39,124 --> 01:51:41,725
and connect those people
to information.

3084
01:51:41,727 --> 01:51:44,661
Which is what we do.

3085
01:51:44,663 --> 01:51:45,929
And more than that,

3086
01:51:45,931 --> 01:51:47,731
you had the courage to dream.

3087
01:51:47,733 --> 01:51:50,168
In spite of your obvious

3088
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:53,637
and astonishing limitations,

3089
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:55,373
you never gave up on that dream.

3090
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,374
No.

3091
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,209
So...

3092
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:59,310
gentlemen...

3093
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,446
...and lady...

3094
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:03,314
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

3095
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:06,585
Chetty, no offense,
you're a glorified babysitter.

3096
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:09,922
Let's get somebody down here
who actually means something.

3097
01:52:09,924 --> 01:52:11,790
I'm right here.

3098
01:52:11,792 --> 01:52:12,925
Terrific.

3099
01:52:15,763 --> 01:52:18,898
Graham, please meet
Mr. Anderson.

3100
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,466
You know this guy?

3101
01:52:20,468 --> 01:52:22,001
I should think I do.

3102
01:52:22,003 --> 01:52:24,170
Andrew here is
the head of Search...

3103
01:52:24,172 --> 01:52:27,073
a rather important position
here at Google.

3104
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:28,943
Honest, it's an honor.

3105
01:52:28,945 --> 01:52:30,076
Look at you, Headphones.

3106
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:31,645
A little mystery
behind the boy.

3107
01:52:31,647 --> 01:52:33,179
What? How-how do you know him?

3108
01:52:33,181 --> 01:52:35,249
We were encouraged to reach out
to experienced Googlers.

3109
01:52:35,251 --> 01:52:37,118
Pretty simple.
Not a big mystery.

3110
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:41,222
To reach out to other Googlers,
not just kiss their asses.

3111
01:52:41,224 --> 01:52:43,691
You see, these interns are

3112
01:52:43,693 --> 01:52:47,696
smart, collaborative, pretty...

3113
01:52:47,698 --> 01:52:48,963
Thank you.

3114
01:52:48,965 --> 01:52:50,832
...and just weird enough

3115
01:52:50,834 --> 01:52:52,834
to make them
interesting.

3116
01:52:52,836 --> 01:52:56,839
Also, they came together
as a team

3117
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:58,907
to do something here.

3118
01:52:58,909 --> 01:53:02,378
Their Googliness
is truly off the charts.

3119
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:04,614
Oh, my God, can you stop
with the "Googliness"?

3120
01:53:04,616 --> 01:53:06,416
Like, what does that
even mean?

3121
01:53:06,418 --> 01:53:09,252
The fact that you don't know
what it means

3122
01:53:09,254 --> 01:53:11,287
is why you will never work here.

3123
01:53:13,158 --> 01:53:17,127
Also, you just
made me use a bunch of words

3124
01:53:17,129 --> 01:53:18,996
in front of a
ton of people.

3125
01:53:18,998 --> 01:53:20,264
Look at me.

3126
01:53:20,266 --> 01:53:21,498
You're a real dick
for doing that.

3127
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,733
Look at me again.

3128
01:53:22,735 --> 01:53:25,670
And I know your accent
is bullshit.

3129
01:53:25,672 --> 01:53:27,504
What?

3130
01:53:28,606 --> 01:53:31,142
So...

3131
01:53:33,913 --> 01:53:36,248
...welcome to Google.

3132
01:53:39,752 --> 01:53:41,387
Yes! Yes!

3133
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,591
Yes!

3134
01:53:52,234 --> 01:53:53,166
Boom!

3135
01:53:53,168 --> 01:53:56,769
I have a job!
I have a job!

3136
01:53:56,771 --> 01:53:58,305
Hey, why are you getting up?

3137
01:53:58,307 --> 01:54:01,208
I should be the winner.
I should be the winner!

3138
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,809
Well, I hope
you're all happy.

3139
01:54:02,811 --> 01:54:04,412
What were you thinking?

3140
01:54:04,414 --> 01:54:06,947
Maybe if I had a team of equals
who contributed once in a while,

3141
01:54:06,949 --> 01:54:08,515
this never would
have happened.

3142
01:54:08,517 --> 01:54:10,852
What about you? What do you
have to say for yourself, eh?

3143
01:54:10,854 --> 01:54:12,186
Huh?

3144
01:54:12,188 --> 01:54:14,088
I think it's time
to fake an injury.

3145
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,223
What are you talking about,
you fat...

3146
01:54:17,327 --> 01:54:18,726
Man down!

3147
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:23,065
Chetty, I appreciate
what you said back there.

3148
01:54:23,067 --> 01:54:25,467
I know you had us figured wrong
from the beginning.

3149
01:54:25,469 --> 01:54:27,569
He voted for you
from the beginning.

3150
01:54:27,571 --> 01:54:28,837
What?

3151
01:54:28,839 --> 01:54:31,608
Mr. Chetty was the deciding vote
on the intern committee.

3152
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:32,876
I didn't have
a fancy education

3153
01:54:32,878 --> 01:54:34,209
like most of
the people here.

3154
01:54:34,211 --> 01:54:37,280
I had to work hard
to get to where I am.

3155
01:54:37,282 --> 01:54:38,748
And I recognized
a similar tenacity

3156
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:41,384
in you two gentlemen,
so I took a chance on you.

3157
01:54:41,386 --> 01:54:45,855
You did test my faith
a few times.

3158
01:54:45,857 --> 01:54:47,257
Basically, the entire time.

3159
01:54:47,259 --> 01:54:50,094
But I'm glad you
proved me right.

3160
01:54:50,096 --> 01:54:53,264
Chetty, thanks
for betting on us.

3161
01:54:54,933 --> 01:54:57,268
Good to see you.

3162
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:58,369
Hey.

3163
01:54:58,371 --> 01:54:59,971
So it looks like
you're gonna be seeing

3164
01:54:59,973 --> 01:55:01,773
a lot more of me
around here.

3165
01:55:01,775 --> 01:55:02,973
So it does.

3166
01:55:02,975 --> 01:55:04,041
Congratulations.

3167
01:55:04,043 --> 01:55:05,710
Thank you.

3168
01:55:05,712 --> 01:55:06,945
Look, the
other night...

3169
01:55:06,947 --> 01:55:08,780
It was fun.

3170
01:55:08,782 --> 01:55:09,815
Yeah, it was fun.

3171
01:55:09,817 --> 01:55:10,817
Right?

3172
01:55:10,819 --> 01:55:13,485
Yeah.

3173
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:17,356
No regrets.

3174
01:55:17,358 --> 01:55:19,692
No.

3175
01:55:31,272 --> 01:55:34,241
All right, let's get
to that warm, fuzzy part.

3176
01:55:34,243 --> 01:55:36,710
Um, that's not
going to happen.

3177
01:55:36,712 --> 01:55:38,546
God, I love him even more.

3178
01:55:38,548 --> 01:55:40,747
He leaves it cold like that.
You know what I mean?

3179
01:55:40,749 --> 01:55:42,216
You keep playing hard to get,

3180
01:55:42,218 --> 01:55:44,118
you're gonna find yourself
all alone.

3181
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,453
We're not gonna
have a beer together.

3182
01:55:45,455 --> 01:55:47,188
We're gonna have
about five of them.

3183
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,189
We're equals now, my friend.
- No, we're not.

3184
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:49,491
Yes, we are.

3185
01:55:49,493 --> 01:55:50,959
No, we're not.
- Let's go pick out

3186
01:55:50,961 --> 01:55:52,727
some other interns and shape
some diamonds in the rough.

3187
01:55:52,729 --> 01:55:54,395
Please stop following me.
Please stop talking to me.

3188
01:55:54,397 --> 01:55:55,564
We're gonna get drunk.

3189
01:56:03,406 --> 01:56:05,174
Have a great senior year, guys.

3190
01:56:05,176 --> 01:56:06,710
We'll keep your desk chairs
warm for you.

3191
01:56:06,712 --> 01:56:07,777
Team Lyle.

3192
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:09,011
Team Lyle!

3193
01:56:09,013 --> 01:56:10,813
That's the spirit.

3194
01:56:10,815 --> 01:56:13,316
Yo-Yo! Come. Now.

3195
01:56:13,318 --> 01:56:14,684
Mom, I need a minute.

3196
01:56:14,686 --> 01:56:16,486
Yo-Yo, I not go. We need to...
- Mom.

3197
01:56:16,488 --> 01:56:18,022
I'm saying good-bye
to my friends.

3198
01:56:18,024 --> 01:56:20,924
I'm taking a minute.

3199
01:56:20,926 --> 01:56:23,361
Okay?

3200
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,301
Look who grew
an eyebrow, Yo-Yo!

3201
01:56:30,303 --> 01:56:32,036
Come on!

3202
01:56:32,038 --> 01:56:33,939
All right, you riffraff,
get out of here.

3203
01:56:33,941 --> 01:56:35,173
See you down the road.
- See you guys.

3204
01:56:35,175 --> 01:56:36,708
See you, bud.
- Thank you, Captain.

3205
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:39,211
Thank you, Big B.

3206
01:56:39,213 --> 01:56:40,579
Bye, guys.

3207
01:56:40,581 --> 01:56:42,047
My Khaleesi.
- My sun and stars.

3208
01:56:43,651 --> 01:56:46,219
What do you say? You want
to go get weird in a nap pod?

3209
01:56:46,221 --> 01:56:47,953
So, um, don't be a stranger.

3210
01:56:47,955 --> 01:56:49,821
Shoot me a text sometime.

3211
01:56:49,823 --> 01:56:50,957
Forget that.

3212
01:56:50,959 --> 01:56:53,226
I'm gonna come
see you in person.

3213
01:56:54,696 --> 01:56:56,496
Yeah, I'd like that.

3214
01:56:56,498 --> 01:56:57,530
Hey, guys, I grew
a pair of balls.

3215
01:56:57,532 --> 01:56:59,365
Did you see them?
- You did!

3216
01:56:59,367 --> 01:57:01,034
You grew a big pair of balls, my man.
- It was amazing.

3217
01:57:01,036 --> 01:57:02,336
They're touching
my ankles. - Okay.

3218
01:57:02,338 --> 01:57:03,671
Well, that...
we don't need that.

3219
01:57:05,473 --> 01:57:06,606
Hey, congratulations, guys.

3220
01:57:06,608 --> 01:57:08,542
Thank you, boss.
- Thank you, boss.

3221
01:57:08,544 --> 01:57:10,778
You know, I did get you
a little something.

3222
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:11,578
Aw.

3223
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,114
Not to get
too sentimental...

3224
01:57:13,116 --> 01:57:15,016
Whoa! Whoa!

3225
01:57:15,018 --> 01:57:16,850
Look at this high roller.

3226
01:57:16,852 --> 01:57:18,252
Busting out the
Pappy on me.

3227
01:57:18,254 --> 01:57:19,721
I figured
we earned a swig.

3228
01:57:19,723 --> 01:57:21,122
Mm-hmm.

3229
01:57:21,124 --> 01:57:22,390
Hell of a summer, bud.

3230
01:57:22,392 --> 01:57:24,727
Hell of a summer.

3231
01:57:42,747 --> 01:57:44,047
# Doo wacko

3232
01:57:53,425 --> 01:57:54,658
# Here's to you, honey

3233
01:57:56,127 --> 01:57:58,730
# But I'm out of your league

3234
01:57:58,732 --> 01:58:00,798
# You're never gonna pass me

3235
01:58:02,167 --> 01:58:03,434
# 'Cause I'm out
of your league #

3236
01:58:03,436 --> 01:58:05,436
# Your league, your league

3237
01:58:05,438 --> 01:58:06,938
# Lookie here, baby

3238
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,475
# You're coming my way

3239
01:58:12,012 --> 01:58:13,845
# But I move like a landslide

3240
01:58:13,847 --> 01:58:16,682
# So get out of my way
and stay away #

3241
01:58:16,684 --> 01:58:19,986
# Up from the floor
on the count of ten #

3242
01:58:19,988 --> 01:58:24,323
# Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again #

3243
01:58:24,325 --> 01:58:26,126
# Up and down
and around again... #

3244
01:58:26,128 --> 01:58:27,127
British.

3245
01:58:27,129 --> 01:58:28,128
Listen, Professor...

3246
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,867
# All right

3247
01:58:35,169 --> 01:58:36,404
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

3248
01:58:39,207 --> 01:58:41,341
# Ooh-ooh-ooh, ow!

3249
01:58:41,343 --> 01:58:43,377
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

3250
01:58:45,213 --> 01:58:47,616
# Time to learn a lesson

3251
01:58:47,618 --> 01:58:51,018
# Like Pavlov's dog

3252
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:53,955
# If same-ing isn't working

3253
01:58:53,957 --> 01:58:57,492
# Why don't you different
instead, instead, instead? #

3254
01:58:57,494 --> 01:59:00,362
# Like Samson and Delilah

3255
01:59:00,364 --> 01:59:02,397
# Attila and the Huns...

3256
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:03,565
Buddy, they can't see us, okay?
- I understand that,

3257
01:59:03,567 --> 01:59:05,068
but here we go.
- Go cheek to cheek.

3258
01:59:05,070 --> 01:59:06,602
Just go like I tell you.
- Okay, don't interrupt me.

3259
01:59:06,604 --> 01:59:07,970
Put your cheek next to mine.
- Yes.

3260
01:59:07,972 --> 01:59:09,672
Yeah, I get it. You got us?
- Hi, my name is Billy.

3261
01:59:09,674 --> 01:59:10,873
Yeah, Nick Campbell.
- Oh, good.

3262
01:59:10,875 --> 01:59:11,908
You can hear me.

3263
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:13,976
# Oh, you get up

3264
01:59:13,978 --> 01:59:16,413
# You get down
and you try it again #

3265
01:59:16,415 --> 01:59:18,715
# Up and down and around again

3266
01:59:18,717 --> 01:59:22,352
# Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again #

3267
01:59:22,354 --> 01:59:24,822
# Round for round

3268
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:28,393
# Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again #

3269
01:59:28,395 --> 01:59:31,061
# Hit the ground

3270
01:59:31,063 --> 01:59:33,965
# Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again #

3271
01:59:33,967 --> 01:59:37,068
# Oh, you get up, you
get down and you try it again #

3272
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:40,038
# Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again #

3273
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,676
# Oh, you get up, you
get down and you try it again. #

3274
01:59:46,146 --> 01:59:48,279
Guys, hi.

3275
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:50,382
Hey.
So, what do you think?

3276
01:59:50,384 --> 01:59:52,952
Cosplay. What can you say?
- I knew you'd love it.

3277
01:59:52,954 --> 01:59:54,220
Stuart totally
loves it, too, now.

3278
01:59:54,222 --> 01:59:56,056
You guys have fun.
Okay, great.

3279
01:59:56,058 --> 01:59:58,023
Don't worry about us.
We're having a great time.

3280
01:59:58,025 --> 01:59:59,125
Don't worry about us.
We're having fun.

3281
01:59:59,127 --> 02:00:01,428
Uh-oh. Here we go.
- Oh, hit it.

3282
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:03,663
<i>Classic Star Wars villain. - Looking on
with Boba Fett. We're just observers.</i>

3283
02:00:03,665 --> 02:00:05,833
We're just here to observe.
- It's me!

3284
02:00:05,835 --> 02:00:07,634
- Kevin.
- What the shit? - Shit.

3285
02:00:07,636 --> 02:00:09,503
Guys. Yeah.
- Kevin!

3286
02:00:09,505 --> 02:00:10,904
What the hell
are you doing here?

3287
02:00:10,906 --> 02:00:13,574
Cosby. It's your
first time at Cosby?

3288
02:00:13,576 --> 02:00:15,610
Excuse me?
- It's my new journey.

3289
02:00:15,612 --> 02:00:16,776
And I have you to thank.

3290
02:00:16,778 --> 02:00:18,513
You really pointed
some things out.

3291
02:00:18,515 --> 02:00:19,881
I was being a
jerk to people.

3292
02:00:19,883 --> 02:00:21,349
'Cause I was hurting inside.

3293
02:00:21,351 --> 02:00:23,252
Well, it takes a big man
to admit he's wrong, Kevin.

3294
02:00:23,254 --> 02:00:25,754
Good for you. - Anyway, I'm going to
dive back into the fun.

3295
02:00:25,756 --> 02:00:27,655
Ooh, check out
this hot little number.

3296
02:00:27,657 --> 02:00:31,059
I don't know if it's a...
Ewok or a space squirrel.

3297
02:00:31,061 --> 02:00:33,195
I can't wait to rip into that.

3298
02:00:33,197 --> 02:00:34,597
How do you know
who's underneath the mask?

3299
02:00:34,599 --> 02:00:36,198
Look, I don't know what's
underneath the hood,

3300
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:37,766
and I don't give a shit.

3301
02:00:37,768 --> 02:00:39,135
I'm insatiable.

3302
02:00:39,137 --> 02:00:41,304
Now, if you excuse me,
old Boba Fett's

3303
02:00:41,306 --> 02:00:43,973
going to give this squirrel
a couple nuts to hide.

3304
02:00:43,975 --> 02:00:45,909
You know Boba Fett...
he always fucked

3305
02:00:45,911 --> 02:00:47,977
the space squirrel
at the end of the movie.

3306
02:00:47,979 --> 02:00:49,913
Audience knew
it was coming.

3307
02:00:49,915 --> 02:00:51,415
Audience wanted it.

3308
02:00:51,417 --> 02:00:52,883
Audience got it.
