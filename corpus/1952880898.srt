00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,200
<i>June 17.</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,700
<i>spent several months since
the death of my wife and daughter.</i>

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,200
<i>wonder every day why God
have been taken from me with one blow.</i>

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,900
<i>I went back to smoking, an invitation
the death of his arms wide open.</i>

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>I feel more alone in this world
I was like never before.</i>

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>I moved closer
my sister for support.</i>

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,500
<i>My editor thought that buying this
house would be a distraction from my pain.</i>

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>An obvious attempt to inspire me
end a long-delayed romance.</i>

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,450
<i>I'm still amazed at how
incredibly cheap this house.</i>

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Even for small-town values.</i>

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,900
<i>Still ...
I hope to be taking the right decision.</i>

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>SILENCE the  CRY</i>

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,900
14 YEARS LATER

15
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,500
Where the hell are you?

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,400
- Sarah?
- What now?

17
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
- Sarah!
- You go, Maggie!

18
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,400
Where are you looking at?

19
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,350
Here you are.

20
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm so attached to you.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
My God.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,150
As you climbed up
here up so easily?

23
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,850
- What are you doing?
- Just look at some old stuff.

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,050
You know, do not cost anything to call me
mother once in a while. What are you looking?

25
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:41,700
You must always be
espiolhar to everything I do?

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm only seeing the
old stuff from Uncle Michael.

27
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,100
What?

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
I miss him, yes?

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,300
This is a very valuable antique.

30
00:03:56,305 --> 00:04:00,300
And I know that Uncle Michael would want
we had very careful with it.

31
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,450
In case you forgetting,
he gave it to me.

32
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,150
I just think you should not use while
you're not a little more responsible.

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,550
What age do you think I am?
I'll be late ...

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Where you going?

35
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,000
Sarah.

36
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,550
Where you going?
When are you coming?

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,900
I told you,
I will spend the night at Emily's house.

38
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:32,400
No. Do not tell me that.

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm tired of you always have to try
have in my life. I'm out of here.

40
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,400
Sarah!

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,350
This conversation is not over yet!

42
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Now you can stop listening.

43
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,600
- Where you going?
- Anywhere but here.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,550
- I thought we were going out together ...
- Jill, we may go another day, okay?

45
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,050
Stop arming you into silly.
I have to go.

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,450
Damn!
You gave me a cagaça!

47
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,950
Sorry, where were you? It was supposed
end we found an hour ago.

48
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:46,500
Yes, I know. Maggie was
again to be herself.

49
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,000
Goat.

50
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,900
So, you brought it?

51
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
Yes ..

52
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,250
Beautiful.

53
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Creed, this place still
I fear hell of a mess.

54
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,850
- What?
- Put yourself.

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I am sure that
was better when your uncle lived here.

56
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,800
Yes, I know, not applicable.

57
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,200
Okay, let's go.

58
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,900
Come on!
Come on, Sarah.

59
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,000
Where'd you get the necklace?

60
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
It was my uncle.

61
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,350
It seems an age or so.

62
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,800
Yes

63
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,250
Maggie was
tease me for having it taken away.

64
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,100
What is her problem?

65
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,600
Same as always.

66
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,850
Attempts to control my life because
basically has no control over his own.

67
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,750
- The same crap as always.
- You know what? Do not worry.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Because I'm here.

69
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,850
That's what I'm here.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,250
I'm here to
remember that we still live ...

71
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:57,500
a city of shit
where there is nothing to do.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Nothing to do ...

73
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,800
Thank you.

74
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
I think.

75
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,900
What abnormal.

76
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Let's get outta here.

77
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,000
Give me your hand.

78
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Can you run?

79
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,800
Thankfully,
because we have a lot to run.

80
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,800
- What do they want?
- To you.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,350
- Stay close to me.
- What do we do?

82
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,250
- We must get away from the streets.
- How?

83
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
We have to go through them.
Are you ready?

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,250
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

85
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,800
Now!

86
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,000
- Jill, I'll leave.
- Mom, this television does not work.

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,700
The cable must be
probably off, dear.

88
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,400
Are you sure you'll be okay?

89
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,100
Leave off,
I'm almost 15 years.

90
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay, I'll have my phone with me.
If you need me, call me, okay?

91
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,000
Jill?

92
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,800
Okay! Goodbye.

93
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,050
Come on ...

94
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,450
Unbelievable.

95
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,600
Shit!

96
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,050
Come back soon.

97
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,900
Jill, make sure that all
doors and windows are locked.

98
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,900
Why? What's up?

99
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,250
- Did something happen?
- Do it! Now!

100
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
Shit ...

101
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
Jill will check
the back door.

102
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,050
- Damn! You gave me a cagaça.
- Attention to language, girl.

103
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on.

104
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,400
My god! Lower yourself.

105
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Get down and stays that way.

106
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,400
Right ...

107
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
We must find
a safer place.

108
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,400
Mom, why do not you tell me
what happens?

109
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,300
Because I do not know what is happening.

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Come on.

111
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
And the car?

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Does not work. Go up the stairs.

113
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,400
<i> June 21. </ i></i>

114
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,150

115
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:18,000

119
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,400
<i> This does not seem to escape the images

122
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
He says: "Hello, Uncle Michael."

123
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Hello

124
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,800
Sarah, how are you?

125
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,100
Can you say it?

126
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,850
Hello

127
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,950
It was not easy when the father of Sarah
left us last year.

128
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,600
I thought my world would end.

129
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,500
I think what
I'm trying to say is that ...

130
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,300
... know how it feels to be alone.

131
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,600
Thanks.

132
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,950
Mom.

133
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,100
What are you doing?

134
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Mommy will catch you!

135
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,300
Mommy will catch you.
He picked up his girl!

136
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,150
My beautiful girl.

137
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
In the old church!
There should be safe!

138
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,300
- It's too far!
- We're almost there!

139
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
They can not enter here.

140
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
This place is too
strong for them.

141
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,650
What is your name?

142
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
Sarah.

143
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,450
I still think that
this is just a bad dream.

144
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
It's more than you can imagine.

145
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,400
Who are you?

146
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,200
Where are you from?

147
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm Jacob.

148
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I need you to trust me.

149
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
My best friend
just died!

150
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,350
You appear out of nowhere ...
and those things ...

151
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,950
Sorry about your friend.

152
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,400
My God, what's that?

153
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Security has been broken!

154
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,600
We must leave here.

Down! Go!

Listen.

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,500
But your concern
should be with what you have.

179
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,100
Do not know what you're talking about.

180
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,500
The rune placed Sayorlean
inside of your silver necklace.

181
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,850
Returns it.

182
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,350
I do not understand.

183
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:40,450
It is precisely for
That must be returned.

184
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,350
You do not understand its power.

185
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,200
Not with your partner
Abes of the sword.

186
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,850
Stay away.

187
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,400
Calm down, child.
Will you give me the rune.

188
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
What makes you think that I ...

189
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,050
Ma can not take, do you?

190
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,400
Now only you have the
power to end this chaos.

191
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,200
Return the paste to the mansion Ekling

192
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,900
and all this madness will end.

193
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
The necklace belongs to me.

194
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,900
It belonged to my uncle.

195
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,100
Stolen from me by it
and so their blood line

196
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:28,050
is cursed forever.

197
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,250
Give me the necklace

198
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:35,050
and I will spare your
family curse it carries.

199
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
And if it fails?

200
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,050
Then I'll send the very essence
with the nightmares that are created

201
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:47,900
until they tear
your decaying flesh.

202
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Sarah.

203
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,300
I am.

204
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
We must continue,
there is an exit on the other side.

205
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Where are we?

206
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,900
Beneath the city. An old camera
rest for church members.

207
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,600
- I lived in this city ever since ...
- Ali ahead!

208
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,950
What? What is that?

209
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,200
- We gotta get outta here!
- Why? What is it?

210
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Do not look back!

211
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,500
- Where are we?
- For output.

212
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
- We have to climb!
- Jacob!

213
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,005
Do not look down!

214
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,100
Ali

215
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,200
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, it's someone at the door.

216
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,500
- I see.
- There may be another thing like that.

217
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,700
- It could be your sister.
- Mom, do not go.

218
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,800
Jill, I have to see if it is Sarah.

219
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,300
Stay here.

220
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,700
Sarah?

221
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
My God ...

222
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,850
Stay away.

223
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,500
Come on,
here we are not safe.

224
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:08,555
What are you ...

225
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,950
Go, go.

226
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,100
Are you sure we
be safe up here?

227
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:35,750
Because if not, we're stuck.

228
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Of course we'll be safe.

229
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,700
I do not see
these things around.

230
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Never trust in your eyes.

231
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,600
All those cries echoing.

232
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,700
Lower yourself.

233
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,950
They're everywhere!

234
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,650
They are hunting us.

235
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,900
- They see us?
- Head toward the woods.

236
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
Stopped.

237
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,100
Can not cross.

238
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,750
Look at them.
Whence come all?

239
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
We need to continue.

240
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,900
You must be kidding.

241
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,800
We have to go through.

242
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,500
Already crossed half.

243
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
They're here.

244
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,800
There, there, did not you?

245
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,750
Run to the other side
and not look back.

246
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:45,150
- Jacob ...
- Now.

247
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,950
Continues!

248
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,100
Gone are all.

249
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,500
I know.

250
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,900
Can we rest now?
We went to run all night.

251
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,300
There under.

252
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,150
A night with a sky so beautiful.
It makes no sense what is happening.

253
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,300
Get it fast!

254
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:42,800
- What?
- Now!

255
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,250
Why?

256
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,950
It's impenetrable,
even for a sword.

257
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
Body contact, was well
they knew where we were.

258
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,150
I have this forever and now you're
say who persecute us because of it?

259
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,000
- When was the first time that you used?
- Just tonight, but I ...

260
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
It's me missing something?

261
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,150
And who the hell are you? And how did you know the
passage beneath the church?

262
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,050
And how you were there in
just when I was attacked?

263
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,050
Not everything is as it seems.

264
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,600
Then answer it.

265
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Are you following me?

266
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,800
Are you hiding something from me.

267
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
And to tell the truth ...

268
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
... scare me.

269
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,400
Got something to see
with all this?

270
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,050
Yes

271
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,000
In what?

272
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,800
My family was
murdered in this city.

273
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,000
<i> I felt there was
something wrong with the house </ i></i>

274
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:18,400
<i> in the day that I and the
My family went to live there. </ i></i>

275
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,750
<i> found an old diary that contained
symbols etched into the pages. </ i></i>

276
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:50,100
<i>It was hidden under 
the loft floor. </ i></i>

277
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,700
<i>There  spells, each with the objective
to induce or protect from evil. </ i></i>

278
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:57,700
<i>This is the source 
the power of the necromancer. </ i></i>

279
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,950
Necromancer?

280
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,600
A magician who can awaken and communicate
with the dead through symbols.

281
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,400
Then this ...

282
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,300
... necromancer is responsible
for all this?

283
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,100
He is able to
create a real nightmare.

284
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,900
You saw it. When?

285
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Beneath the church.

286
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,500
He said his name is Mathias.

287
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:35,100
I did not know what to believe, not
know why you were protecting me ...

288
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:36,700
What did he say?

289
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,550
What ...

290
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,150
... the necklace is yours to him.

291
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,500
The diary was
designs that stone e. ..

292
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,850
... a name for herself,
Sayorlean the rune.

293
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,100
Gave the necromancer power
to control the day and night.

294
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,500
Each night he stays
stronger with his control.

295
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,000
If he makes the day into night,
this town will not survive.

296
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,600
My Uncle Michael
let me die before.

297
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,250
How did you get that necklace?

298
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,900
I do not know.

299
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,550
I was very small.

300
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,700
Where were you living?

301
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,800
At the mansion Ekling
where you found me.

302
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,300
My parents were murdered
shortly after I discovered the diary.

303
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,250
When?

304
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,850
It seems like yesterday.

305
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,950
Did not know
the house had been sold ...

306
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,950
That was quick.

307
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,000
Maggie should already be
going on because of me.

308
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,450
- Maggie?
- My mother, I ...

309
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
... I refuse to call it that.

310
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,600
And Jill, my sister.
Is with her.

311
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,650
At least now
I do not have to deal with them.

312
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,700
I envy you for credentials.

313
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,650
What happened?

314
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,700
Left ...

315
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,900
You think this will end?

316
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,900
Everything has to end, Sarah.

317
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,200
You better get some rest.

318
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,050
Let's wait until the morning.

319
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,700
Mother? Father?

320
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,700
Anna!

321
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,700
What now?

322
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,150
What the hell she wants now?

323
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,900
- Hello
- Hello, Maggie.

324
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,400
We brought you some cookies.

325
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Thanks.

326
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,200
They ...

327
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,150
... seem to be very good.

328
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,700
Can we come?

329
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Sure they can.

330
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,650
So ...

331
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,800
... what brings you here?
- I thought you wanted to get away

332
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:33,300
and go do something.

333
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,550
I have not felt comfortable
get out and do great things ...

334
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,100
... lately.

335
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,900
Your editor did you get
closed here?

336
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,100
No, I have been to ignore it ...

337
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,650
Do not touch that!

338
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
No matter.

339
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,150
Sorry. I do not know what ...

340
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,300
... is happening to me lately.

341
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,950
Michael, are you okay?

342
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Yes, I'm just ...

343
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,100
... a little cranky lately.
That's it.

344
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,350
I understand.

345
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,300
So ...

346
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,550
... what you been up to?
- I. ..

347
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,700
Can I show you.

348
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,100
Okay.

349
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,300
Look at this.

350
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,900
Saw it?

351
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,700
How did you?

352
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,550
You see this? I found it ...

353
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,500
... in the attic ...

354
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,550
... beneath the floorboards
and has all these ...

355
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,000
... explanations of how to do
a date different spells e. ..

356
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,700
Michael ...

357
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
... this is not good.

358
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,600
What do you mean?

359
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
- What do you think I'm doing?
- This is not correct.

360
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,100
Maggie, this is my opportunity
to do something extraordinary.

361
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,300
You know, it's a shame that your
limited mind can not see it.

362
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,600
I think we'd better go.

363
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,450
I agree.

364
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,200
You know what, Maggie?

365
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,700
Not even
I invited you to come here.

366
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,450
Sarah.

367
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,300
Yes?

368
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,250
Gotta go.

369
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,950
All disappeared.

370
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,700
The necromancer does not
has control during the day.

371
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,700
Last night in Ekling ...

372
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,900
... why were there?

373
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,000
To stem the evil.

374
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,750
But what makes
this house so dangerous?

375
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,050
It is where the
Mathias lived there years ago.

376
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,500
Nobody there is welcome
provided that the condition complained.

377
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,050
It's funny.

378
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,450
When I was little, they told me
Always stay away from that place.

379
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:53,200
I always thought
nothing more than an urban myth.

380
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Look.

381
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,650
It's almost as if she
was still in pain.

382
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,050
We must continue.

383
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,400
I do not want this to happen.

384
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Promise me
if this happens, shoot me.

385
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
I'll take you home safely.

386
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,000
Do not believe I'm saying, but
I really miss Maggie and Jill.

387
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,000
What happens if they
become one of those things?

388
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,450
I kill them.

389
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
- Jill, dear.
- My God ...

390
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,300
It's okay.
Just me.

391
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,750
What a fucking nightmare!

392
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,700
Is it safe?

393
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,200
Yes

394
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,950
Down, but see where you put your feet.

395
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,900
Be careful.

396
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,950
This is so disgusting.

397
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,700

Have got to be
My eyes and ears

424
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:56,650
and it rewards me with something.

425
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,800
I have no powers
until they recover the rune.

426
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:03,500
I was robbed by a girl.

427
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,800
She travels with a companion.

428
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,700
Kill them.

429
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
And retrieve the rune.

430
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,750
If we are around, we lose the light.

431
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,800
What?

432
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,450
Run!

433
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,900
What the hell is that?

434
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,150
Shit.

435
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,900
We must come to that barn!

436
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,800
How do we go from here?

437
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,850
No. .. I can not stand ...

438
00:49:07,855 --> 00:49:10,350
Already can not stand the noise.

439
00:49:10,355 --> 00:49:12,600
We'll succeed
I swear I will.

440
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,900
<i> July 5. </ i></i>

441
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,700
<i> This is my first attempt
to awaken the demon Sylathus. </ i></i>

442
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,750
<i> I no longer care more
consequences. </ i></i>

443
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,100
<i>I no longer think 
more in eating or sleeping. </ i></i>

444
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,550
<i> My editor finally gave up
to try to contact me. </ i></i>

445
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,100
<i> immediately recognized him at the bar. </ i></i>

446
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,950
<i>The driver responsible 
the death of my family. </ i></i>

447
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:13,800
<i> I took it to my house
under false pretenses. </ i></i>

448
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,800
<i>He was too drunk 
to recognize me. </ i></i>

449
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,300
When did the girl appears
for a business?

450
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:23,250
<i> I had the clear impression that
he had a twinge of remorse </ i></i>

451
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:25,150
<i> for killing my family. </ i></i>

452
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,950
<i> So
I offered him another drink. </ i></i>

453
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
She descends.

454
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,000
How about another drink
while you wait?

455
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,250
Thanks.

456
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,900
You do not drink anything?

457
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
No, I do not drink.

458
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,950
I quit drinking ...

459
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,900
It's the only thing for which I live.

460
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,950
After a drunk ...

461
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
... have killed my family ...

462
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,400
It changed my
perspective on things.

463
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,700
The worst part is that ...

464
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,900
... he got away
because of one detail.

465
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,800
And walked free.

466
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,400
What the hell is this?

467
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,100
Do not say anything?
Only by chance?

468
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,500
How did it feel ...

469
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,900
... to kill my family ...

470
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,500
... and destroy my life?

471
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,400
Listen ...

472
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,600
What the hell is going on here?

473
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,000
It was an accident.

474
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,250
I'm not here ...

475
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,350
... to apologize
for your family.

476
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,700
I'm out of here.

477
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,900
Not with life.

478
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,500
What?

479
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,050
You'll stab me?

480
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
I already did.

481
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,400
What the hell?

482
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,500
This is it.

483
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,200
Sarah.

484
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,300
We must leave here.

485
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,000
And if that thing is still there?

486
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,700
We can not wait for the night.

487
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,000
I am disappointed, my servant.

488
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,350
Whither fled?

489
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,500
Come.

490
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,850
The Malyhne awaits us.

491
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Okay, this is the last.

492
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,900
Give me a hand?

493
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,600
Jill?

494
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,800
Jill?

495
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,350
Jill?

496
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,000
Jill?

497
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,200
And some of the blood line of Michael.

498
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,400
Mother!

499
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,500
<i> July 9. </ i></i>

500
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:07,500
<i>They spent three days since 
invoking Sylathus. </ i></i>

501
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,900
<i>I fear for my safety

503

504

<i> What are you waiting for? </ i></i>

505
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Michael?

506
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,000
Hello, enters.

507
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,000
Want a glass of water?

508
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,300
- Water ...
- Yes, water is fine.

509
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,550
- Okay, I will get.
- Thanks.

510
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,400
Not expecting to see you,
but I'm glad you left home.

511
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,400
Hello

512
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,450
Sorry ...
you can not come to know.

513
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,700
I will miss you.

514
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,850
Will always be safe.

515
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,950
Shit.

516
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,250
Here you go.

517
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,150
Are you okay?

518
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,200
I'm fine.

519
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,100
Toma.

520
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,700
Michael?

521
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,600
It's a gift for Sarah.
Give him ...

522
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,850
Gives you only when you
old enough.

523
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,200
Okay ...

524
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,100
Just want to say ...

525
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,300
... I regret that.

526
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,650
Michael, it's okay.
I'm just worried about you.

527
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,800
Gotta go.

528
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,700
No, wait.

529
01:00:22,705 --> 01:00:24,221
Maggie?

530
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,900
The whole family together again.

531
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,300
Damn you!

532
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,800
You chose your own destiny.

533
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,200
I advise you ...

534
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,900
... for the safety of
your family ...

535
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,300
... return it to the rune Sayorlean.

536
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,250
- I lost it!
- Very foolish decision.

537
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,750
It was her only hope.

538
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,800
Remove her legs.

539
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,250
So ...

540
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,600
... the child returns.

541
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,650
The sword of Abes.
Strip it to him.

542
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,900
- Leave her alone!
- Come on.

543
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,100
Come on.

544
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,600
What ...

545
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,200
... is more valuable to you?

546
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,600
The rune ...

547
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,350
... or the life of your sister?

548
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,600
Sarah, do not do.

549
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
You promise that the loose?

550
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,900
I give you my word.

551
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,400
Please!

552
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,450
Let her go!

553
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,300
Do you know where to find us.

554
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,400
So long.

555
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,900
Jill!

556
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,400
Sarah ...

557
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,100
... what have you done?

558
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,750
She is my sister.

559
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,000
- She will be fine.
- Where to take?

560
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,400
Back to the mansion Ekling.

561
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,600
Do not say anything, I have
for taking that horrible place.

562
01:03:47,605 --> 01:03:49,850
- You can not.
- She is my sister.

563
01:03:49,855 --> 01:03:51,900
You have no chance to get back there.

564
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,600
She's all alone
without anyone to help.

565
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,100
Will you get it?

566
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,900
Do not leave me much choice.

567
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,900
Sorry no
have trusted you before.

568
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,300
Will I ever see you?

569
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,500
Remember.

570
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,000
How could I forget?

571
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,300
Go inside.

572
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,900
For luck.

573
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,200
Farewell ...

574
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,100
I have to finish with
what started it.

575
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,150
Mathias ...

576
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:43,600
I suppose not
necessary introductions.

577
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,600
Leave behind the texts blacks knowing
that would guarantee my resurrection.

578
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,700
My predestined
tormentor and savior ...

579
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,250
Give me the rune.

580
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,400
And I convey unto thee his
real power

581
01:05:58,405 --> 01:06:01,650
that never was
described in my writing.

582
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,850
- Do not can have.
- I can be quite ...

583
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,700
... convincing.

584
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,450
I'm not afraid of you.

585
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,050
I learned how to destroy it,
you idiot!

586
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:36,350
- Selaste your own destiny.
- I saved my soul ...

587
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,800
... and destroy her with this spell.

588
01:06:39,805 --> 01:06:41,800
Are you sure?

589
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,850
Before you give your last breath ...

590
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,300
... curse your whole family!

591
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,300
Not with this,
sealed his own fate.

592
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,800
Kill him.
The prophecy was not fulfilled.

593
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:01,500
It's the end of the line.

594
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,800
Be careful, Sylathus.

595
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:16,250
The Terhael will need it,
of what remains of it.

596
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,200
Where's Jill?

597
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:21,450
- I am also happy to see you, Maggie.
- Sarah ...

598
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,700
... where is she?

599
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,450
Hear me, Jacob is the
only one who can bring back.

600
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:27,900
He saved my life last night.

601
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,700
I'm not going to sit here waiting
someone who does not even know who he is.

602
01:07:31,705 --> 01:07:35,850
- You really have to stay sober.
- And you have to take you away right now!

603
01:07:35,855 --> 01:07:37,800
Damn it if
I sit here waiting.

604
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,150
- Come on out and we find it.
- Oh yeah?

605
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,750
You're going out there and you're dead!

606
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,500
Where am I?

607
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Come here, child.

608
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,900
Look forward to you.

609
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,250
Tell me what your eyes see.

610
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,000
- It's just the city ...
- No.

611
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,450
This is not an ordinary city, child.

612
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:19,300
You are cursed for
forever for their sins.

613
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,000
Sins?

614
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,900
Against me
against my wife.

615
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,600
And against my unborn son.

616
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,150
And with such a vengeance I replied.

617
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,350
You know what this is?

618
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,950
It belonged to my uncle Michael.

619
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,850
Stolen from me by him.

620
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,700
And so I cursed his
bloodline.

621
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,450
Your blood line.

622
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,300
Notes.

623
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,050
While I darken
again these empty skies.

624
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,900
Maggie, a body is still here.

625
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,300
Open the door, I can handle this.

626
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,600
It's already getting dark.

627
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:51,750
Hurry up!

628
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,100
No!

629
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,650
The night ... returned.

630
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:12,000
It's time to reawaken the beast.

631
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,700
Sylathus.

632
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,800
Kills the intruder.

633
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,700
I returned home.

634
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,000
Nothing ...

635
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,350
What was it?

636
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,950
Maggie ... Maggie, no!

637
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,700
Emily ...

638
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,700
Emily, no!

639
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,000
Close it! Take this!

640
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,800
Michael ...

641
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,900
Spell Protection.

642
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,250
Get down!

643
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,950
They are there.

644
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:13,950
So how did deceived
death so easily?

645
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,650
Are you dead?

646
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,800
Anna!

647
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,350
The last I remember,
a trembling soul eras

648
01:15:40,355 --> 01:15:42,650
that forced his last breath.

649
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,250
Vieste as consideration
by a family murdered

650
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:49,976
whose cries were silenced at night?

651
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,600
Vieste enjoy it.

652
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Preparations were made especially
for you, Spell Protection.

653
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,500
How's your leg?

654
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,400
I'm so cold.

655
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,300
I thought I had not
lost so much blood.

656
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,800
Toma.

657
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,100
Ready.

658
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,500
Thank you.

659
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,850
Do not hear anyone scream.

660
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,900
They got everybody.

661
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,900
I was so afraid that
something you had happened.

662
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,900
I never thought to worry about.

663
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,500
You and Jill were all he had
after your father is gone.

664
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,900
I regret that
you will have felt this way.

665
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:12,700
You'll always be my girl.

666
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,900
Thank you for saving me.

667
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,300
I love you.

668
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:28,200
I love you too, Mom.

669
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,600
Find peace.

670
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,200
Mother, I think we'll be fine.

671
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,400
Since we remain silent,
I think not ...

672
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,000
Mother?

673
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:39,300
Mother, do not. Please, God,
do not let that happen.

674
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,650
No!

675
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,100
Please mother, do not get up!

676
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:48,750
Mother!

677
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,700
No, no ... No!

678
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,150
The sword does not contain Abes
more power in the circle

679
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:56,750
than any other weapon vulgar.

680
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,550
I will end your existence!

681
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,100
You can not hide from me!

682
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,750
Get out of the shadows.

683
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,400
And witness the death of this child.

684
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:40,550
Give your last breath.

685
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,800
Remember, Return Protection,
have no effect on this ...

686
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,900
... circle!

687
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,250
No!

688
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,100
No!

689
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,300
Now die!

690
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,900
Jill?

691
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,400
Are you okay?

692
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,300
Anda.

693
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,900
We'll take you home.

694
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,800
It worked.

695
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:47,350
- The rune has been broken.
- I fell right on top of you.

696
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,350
Nobody would have survived
a fall like that.

697
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,200
Why is he calling you to
"Spell of Protection"?

698
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,950
That's what I am.

699
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,500
Mother?

700
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,600
Mother?

701
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,450
Mother?

702
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,150
Mother!

703
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,650
No. ..

704
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,750
Sarah?

705
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,750
I am very sorry ...

706
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,300
It was supposed
Protection Spell beings.

707
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,650
I know.

708
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,900
Was it for her.

709
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,250
I'm it.

710
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,950
As long as you have,
can bring them back.

711
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,350
Can I bring them back.

712
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,850
Bring them back ...

713
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,400
I told you!

714
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:27,950
You can not kill what is already dead.

715
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,200
The torture you for eternity.

716
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:38,400
Then your heart
is mourning the loss of another

717
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,500
and finally you found
your purpose?

718
01:25:41,505 --> 01:25:42,900
Yes ..

719
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,950
The silence of thy cry!

720
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,500
