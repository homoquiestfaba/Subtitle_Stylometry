00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,356
Hey, Nick.

7
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,524
Hey, how's the trip?

8
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,984
How far are you from the house?

9
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,276
It's OK, I'm still cruising.

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,988
I'm about six hours away still?

11
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,280
Holy shit.

12
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,323
You know this is
why they invented

13
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,533
the thing called planes, right?

14
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,492
So we don't have to
drive everywhere?

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,326
Oh, whatever.

16
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,285
It's not that bad.

17
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,663
I enjoy the solitude.

18
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,832
How's Scott been
since he got there?

19
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:29,420
Not bad, besides thinking I was
one of Mom's old boyfriends.

20
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,840
Or that I was coming
to rob the damn house!

21
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,634
And He's all right.

22
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,718
He's still our old man.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,261
I feel bad for laughing at him.

24
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,346
It breaks Mom's heart.

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,347
Yeah.

26
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,015
We just got to--

27
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:40,807

Shit.

39
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,983
Damn it.

40
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,487
Of course, this
would happen to me.

Dreaming of our escape,
because I can't help it.

55
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,069
It's only me, to stay with me.

56
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,281
Someday I'll be under the way.

57
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,827
This is my dream,
and it's you and me.

58
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,330
I can feel the cheering now.

59

Holding onto heaven, love.

60
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:41,798
I'll take this time,
while we know we'll rise.

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,175
Heaven, love.

62
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,973

it's something for in life.

[upbeat music]

70
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,293
This is going to be good for
the both of us, you know?

71
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,838
The woods, the hiking,
getting away from everything.

72
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,215
Just your heads.

73
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,050
Yeah.

74
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,009
I guess you're right.

75
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,262
We definitely needed this.

76
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,058
Hey, it's going to be OK.

77
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,894
Just try not to think
about it, all right?

78
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,062
I know.

79
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,438
Thanks for bringing me along.

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Oh, don't mention it.

81
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,357
Besides, I can't drive
18 hours on my own.

82
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,235
That's what little
sisters are for.

83
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,613
Hey, so what's the place in
Colorado you told me about,

84
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,488
the one with the waterfall?

85
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,156
Seven Falls?

86
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,074
Yeah, that one.

87
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,116
Oh, it's beautiful.

88
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,242
You're going to love it there.

89
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,120
It's so peaceful
and quiet, and I

90
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,873
know you're going to love
taking pictures there.

91
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,041
That sounds like a lot of fun.

92
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,375
Yeah.

93
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,211
And there's this park
called Inspirational Point.

94
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,254
You got to hike a long
way, but from what I hear,

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,673
it's definitely worth it.

96
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,007
Yeah, I don't know about that.

97
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,467
I think I'll pass.

98
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,343
On what, the hiking?

99
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,596
Yeah, it sounds
like a lot of work.

100
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,430
Come on, we'll do it together.

101
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,264
I don't know.

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,642
Plus, I'm definitely
out of shape.

103
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,644
Well, just so you know,
to get to the falls

104
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,731
you have to go up these
stairs, and they're huge.

105
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,148
There's a lot of steps.

106
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,734
Why do y'all have to
pick the hardest places?

107
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,694
I didn't, everyone goes there.

108
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,614
You can definitely do it.

109
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,741
Come on, cheer up.

110
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,367
OK, what else is there?

111
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,203
Well, there's this place
called Garden of the gods.

112
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,705
That one's a little
easier to get to.

113
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,706
No, no.

114
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,665
Something other than hiking.

115
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,417
Oh!

116
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,254
Well, there's weed farms.

117
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,508
OK, we can do that instead.

118
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,095
Just try to enjoy
it and have fun, OK?

119
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,766
After all, this is the bonding
time you've been asking for.

120
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,892
Yes, I know.

121
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:01,312
I know I've been busy with
work and we haven't really

122
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,273
had a lot of time
to be together,

123
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,067
but it'll be like
the good old times.

124
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,654
Just the two of us, I promise.

125
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:12,658
Ah, just, it sucks that this
had to happen in order for us

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,035
to hang out.

127
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,704
Hey, come on, don't say that.

128
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,289
You know how things are.

129
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,624
Say what?

130
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,292
That your business is
more important than I am?

131
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,169
And that you haven't seen
me in over three years?

132
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,547
Sandra, that's not it at all.

133
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,255
You know this.

134
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,507
I have worked.

135
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:37,516
I-- Look, I understand that
this is a tough time for you,

136
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,686
but it's tough for me too.

137
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,853
I know.

138
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,565
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,240
[music playing]

140
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,619
Dang, look at this place?

141
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,454
Not a house in sight,
not even a gas station.

142
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,290
Nothing but empty roads.

143
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,584
Well, good thing we have gas.

144
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,713
It's not a lot, but
it'll do for now.

145
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,675
So where are we?

146
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:58,429
Well, if you hadn't been asleep
the whole way over, you'd know.

147
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,557
We're in Texas somewhere.

148
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,434
OK, well, this place
is definitely creepy.

149
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,728
Yeah, tell me about it.

150
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,523
I can't remember the
last time I saw anything.

151
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,650
It's like people
don't even live here.

152
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:12,986
Well, I do remember seeing some
abandoned houses back there,

153
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,279
in that weird town?

154
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,739
Oh, that old creepy town?

155
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,281
Yeah.

156
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,741
Oh, god, that's true.

157
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,576
Yeah, it was like a ghost town.

158
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,077
Not a single person
was in sight.

159
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,957
Well, maybe people just got
tired of this place and left.

160
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,084
OK, but do you wonder why?

161
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,003
That I don't know.

00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,925
[whispering voices]

163
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,509

[ominous sounds]

00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,853
Hip, what are you doing?

166
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,820
I don't know I think I
heard someone talking.

167
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,989
I didn't hear anything.

168
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,575
Yeah.

169
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:03,579
Maybe I'm just hearing things.

170
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:04,830
This place is just weird.

171
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:09,125
If I was superstitious, I'd be
really freaked out right now.

172
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,418
OK.

173
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,504
Well, let's not
stay here for long

174
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,799
and get the hell out of here.

175
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,989
Hey.

176
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,115
Hey.

177
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:43,910
Come on, it's your turn.

178
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,496
Ready?

179
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,731
So how long do we have?

180
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,442
Oh, just shut up and drive.

181
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,830
[whispering voices]

182
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,708
I want to do this for him.

183
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,084
What?

184
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,252
Colorado.

185
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,882
The reason why we're going,
I want to do this for him.

186
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,928
Inspirational Point
was on his bucket list.

187
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,012
Really?

188
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:50,727
Yeah, but he never had a
chance to go, and I figured,

189
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,187
we'd go for him.

190
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,315
Ana, he had a great life, and
he went to a lot of places.

191
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,193
Trust me, you don't have to do
any of this to proof for him.

192
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,360
I know that.

193
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,281
I just-- I figured we could
do something in his honor.

194
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,075
Isn't that a little
too late for that?

195
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,994
You should have been there
for him when he was alive.

196
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,038
I have a busy life.

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,332
I have things to take care of.

198
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,124
Yeah.

199
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,375
No, I know.

200
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,919
You've always been too busy
for the people that you love.

201
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,046
And it's just too
late for remorse.

202
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,131
What the fuck is your problem?

203
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,218
I'm here doing this for us,
and you want to say that to me?

204
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,803
Like I was the
worst person Dad--

205
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,303
Do not.

206
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,346
Sleep.

207
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,388
Like I didn't take care of him?

208
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,181
You're not doing this for us.

209
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,015
This is for you!

210
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,769
I'm doing this for
the both of us!

211
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,896
You are back online.

212
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,857
You will reach your
destination by 3:45--

213
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,691
GPS is back on.

214
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:38,483
--AM.

215
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,735
About time.

216
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:40,986
See, what did I tell you?

217
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,195
There's nothing to worry about.

218
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,157
Just follow the GPS
and we'll be fine.

219
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,744
Hey.

220
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:49,703
Hey, I think that's
a gas station!

221
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,787
What, where?

222
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,872
I didn't see it.

223
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,039
Where?

224
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,332
Sandra, turn around.

225
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,208
What are you doing?

226
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,084
I don't know.

227
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,210
Do you think it's
safe to stop there?

228
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:57,628
What?

229
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,129
We need gas.

230
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,506
Don't we have gas in the back?

231
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,048
That was our last one.

232
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,385
We haven't filled any of
them up since this morning.

233
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,470
Ugh, about time we
find a gas station.

234
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,975
Clearly this place doesn't
have a lot of them.

235
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,857
OK, guess we'll do that.

236
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,284
Speaking of creepy places.

237
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,787
[ominous sounds]

238
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,040
Stay close, OK?

239
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,465
[ominous sounds]

240
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:57,896
[birds chirping]

241
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,898
Can I help you ladies?

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,149
Yeah.

243
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,569
We're just looking for
some gas or something.

244
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,654
Are you the owner?

245
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,323
I guess you could say that.

246
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,366
Looking for gas, you said?

247
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,451
Yeah.

248
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,119
Me and my sister were just
traveling to Colorado,

249
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,122
and we're just
looking for some gas.

250
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,668
I could tell you girls
aren't from around town.

251
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,672
No, no, we're just passing by.

252
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,217
You girls shouldn't be here.

253
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,511
I think we should go.

254
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,681
Look, sir, we're just looking
for some gas or something.

255
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,099
That's all.

256
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,351
There's no gas for
50 miles around here.

257
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,311
There's not enough to
go around for everybody.

258
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,606
We don't give gas to strangers.

259
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,023
Excuse me, what do you mean?

260
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,235
There's no other gas
station around here?

261
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,238
Look, we will pay
whatever you ask for, OK?

262
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,322
We just really need gas.

263
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,574
You say you'll pay.

264
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,992
OK?

265
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,577
Look, it's not about money.

266
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,620
OK?

267
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,746
It's about them.

268
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,080
They see me talking to you.

269
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,248
If who sees you?

270
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,125
Look, I said too much.

271
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,085
You shouldn't be
here, just please go!

272
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,086
If who sees you?

273
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:03,670
What are you talking about?

274
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,546
Go!

275
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,089
I can't help you.

276
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,259
Sandra, let's go, go, go!

277
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,511
See you soon.

278
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:13,390
[ominous sounds]

279
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,606
OK, what the fuck just happened?

280
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,439
I have no idea.

281
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,108
But what is wrong
with these people!

282
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,777
They looked psycho.

283
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,444
And that one little girl.

284
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,656
Don't talk about the girl,
she gave me the creeps.

285
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,615
OK.

286
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,324
We need to get the
hell out of this town.

287
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,701
Everything's been weird
since we got here.

288
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,202
How much gas do we have?

289
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,830
We don't have a lot.

290
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,915
OK, let's not panic.

291
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,583
We can just search around
for another gas station.

292
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,752
Ana, that was the only
place we had near us,

293
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,253
and look at what happened?

294
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,838
There's got to be
something else around here.

295
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,632
There has to be.

296
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,551
Oh, shit.

297
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:53,845
I'm not getting any signal.

298
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,306
OK, worst case scenario,
we can just call Theo

299
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,307
and he'd come bring some gas.

300
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,433
No, we're not calling Theo!

301
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,310
I'm just saying,
worst case scenario.

302
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,395
What is he going to do,
drive all the way over here

303
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,439
to drop off some gas?

304
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,483
This trip was a mistake.

305
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,401
Really?

306
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,736
You agreed to this.

307
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,697
Yeah, that's before
we got stranded.

308
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:12,906
We are not stranded.

309
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,282
We just need to find some gas.

310
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,368
Just calm down.

311
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,412
What if we don't find anything?

312
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,914
I don't know, Sandra,
but we'll find a way.

313
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,166
There's got to be
something else around here.

314
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,503
Just, give me your phone.

315
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,924
No frickin' signal.

316
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:31,594
Great.

317
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,763
OK, just keep driving down.

318
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,599
We'll find another
gas station somewhere.

319
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,892
There has to be something
else around here.

320
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,270
We'll be OK.

321
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,400
[instrumental music]

322
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,399
GPS signal lost.

323
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:29,860
Fuck.

324
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,071
Hey, Ana.

325
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:35,781
Hey, wake up.

326
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:36,406
What?

327
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,073
What?

328
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,074
I think we're lost.

329
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,075
What do you mean we're lost?

330
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,410
I don't know what happened.

331
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,620
I accidentally
missed an exit, and I

332
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,288
tried to leave to go
back, but now we're

333
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,414
in the middle of the woods.

334
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,874
OK, OK, OK, OK, just calm down.

335
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,584
I'm sure we haven't
gone too far.

336
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,544
We'll find our way out.

337
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:49,462
Just keep driving.

338
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:58,011
Sandra, Sandra, I can't
leave you alone, can I?

339
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,304
Stop playing.

340
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,931
We don't even know
where we're at.

341
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:01,640
We'll be all right.

342
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,519
Stop being such a drama queen.

343
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:13,819
Ana.

344
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,655
Ana, look.

345

[ominous sounds]

346
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,662
What the hell?

[flies buzzing]

348
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:31,878
I know that's some
weird shit right there.

349
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,129
[flies buzzing]

350
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,423
It's fucking creepy.

351
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,345
[ominous sounds]

352
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,016
So are we?

353
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,518
Just keep driving.

354
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,730
Keep your eyes on the road.

355
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,487
I'm sure we're not too
far from the main road.

356
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,488
It doesn't look like it.

357
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,491
We're surrounded by woods.

358
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,784
Should we stop and go back?

359
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,952
To get more lost!

360
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:04,872
No, thank you.

361
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,837
What the fuck?

362
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,631
Is that the same
thing as before?

363
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,634
What the hell?

364
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,094
That's not supposed to be there.

365
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,514
That's just weird, the GPS
shows a straight road ahead.

366
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:24,180
What do you mean?

367
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,098
I don't know, OK?

368
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,516
That's what it shows!

369
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:26,600
Let me see.

370
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,768
[ominous music]

371
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,685
That's wrong.

372
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:29,895
This is wrong.

373
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,146
Maybe it's just because
of the signal, OK?

374
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,480
Just keep going.

375
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,774
Maybe there was two of them.

376
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,610
[heavy breathing]

377
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,194
Ana, we're going
in fucking circles.

378
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,655
We're going in circles!

379
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:40,656
I know, OK?

380
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,617
I just-- OK, just--

381
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,826
Fuck off.

382
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,119
I think we ran out of gas.

383
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:46,745
What?

384
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:47,829
Try to start it up again!

385
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,164
Ana, I'm trying, OK?

386
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:54,545
How about I just trying,
like I can't turn it on!

387
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:55,671
Fuck!

388
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,047
OK.

389
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,756
OK, OK, OK.

390
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,799
Hey, it's OK.

391
00:20:58,801 --> 00:20:59,550
Look at me.

392
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,050
Look at me.

393
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,678
It's OK.

394
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,344
Let's call Theo.

395
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,805
No!

396
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:05,806
We're not calling Theo,
Ana, we-- he's already

397
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:06,682
been through a lot!

398
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:07,808
It's OK!

399
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,934
It's OK, I'm sure
he'll understand.

400
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,269
You said for emergencies only.

401
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,813
Look around, Sandra!

402
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:15,190
We ran out of gas in
the middle of nowhere.

403
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,024
This is an emergency.

404
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,818
What are you even
going to tell him?

405
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,860
We don't even know
where we're at.

406
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,111
I don't know.

407
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,238
I can somewhat redirect
him here, give him

408
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,281
road signs or something.

409
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:23,990
Ana!

410
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:24,575
I--

411
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,867
Ana, we're both lost.

412
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,243
How is he even
going to get to us?

413
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,662
Let me at least try, OK?

414
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,287
Just do whatever--

415
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,246
Just let me try!

416
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,665
Do whatever you want!

417
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,791
Fuck!

418
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,667
Come on.

419
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:34,626
[wolves howling]

420
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,295
Come on, come on, come on.

421
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,855
Shit.

422
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,106
I'm not getting any signal.

423
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:56,773
What?

424
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:57,816
I'm not getting any signal.

425
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:58,316
I can't call him.

426
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,026
You try.

427
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,195
Well, I still don't
have any service.

428
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,781
Shit.

429
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,406
So what now?

430
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,203
[night sounds]

431
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:09,953
We spend the night here.

432
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,079
Are you fucking crazy?

433
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,998
It's too dark out
to go anywhere.

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,041
We'll try calling again
if we get some signal.

435
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,126
We're just a little lost.

436
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,836
In the morning, we
can go get help.

437
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,046
I'm not spending
a night here, Ana.

438
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,715
What other choice do we have?

439
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,135
Look, the nearest road is
probably not too far from here.

440
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,136
I'm sure we'll be fine.

441
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,846
Tomorrow, we can go get help.

442
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,348
What about the creepy vibes
that we get from this place?

443
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,142
And everything that's
been happening?

444
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,852
And that gas station guy?

445
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,477
Relax!

446
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,979
We'll be fine.

447
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,480
We've just been
driving for a while.

448
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,356
We're both tired.

449
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,775
We just need some rest.

450
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:42,443
We're going to be OK, I promise.

451
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,405
Just don't want to spend
the night here, Ana.

452
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,907
Look at this damn place.

453
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,283
It's pitch dark!

454
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,118
I'm just trying to
be positive, OK?

455
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,079
What other choice do we have?

456
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,081
Look, we'll spend
the night here,

457
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,917
and as soon as
the sun comes out,

458
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,419
we can go look for gas, OK?

459
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,923
[speaking spanish]

460
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,426
[door slams shut]

461
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:09,306
[night sounds]

462
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,604
I have a bad feeling
about this place.

463
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,147
Don't stress.

464
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,107
It's just a couple more
hours till sunrise, anyway.

465
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,944
Yes, and a lot can
happen till then.

466
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,361
What's the worst
that can happen?

467
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,531
We haven't seen anyone all day.

468
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,365
No animal can get inside.

469
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,369
As long as we stay
here, we'll be fine.

470
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,872
Do we have enough
water and food?

471
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:36,998
Yes.

472
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,417
And there're plenty
of snacks too.

473
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,003
We can take it tomorrow
and we can leave early.

474
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,004
Did you bring your knife?

475
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,130
Mm-hmm.

476
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,007
All right here.

477
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:53,139
And if anyone tries to get near
you, I'll slice them up, OK?

478
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,226
Now go to sleep.

479
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:05,529
[crickets chirping]

480
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,499
[voices whispering]

481
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,595
Hey, what's wrong?

482
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,513
Nothing, nothing.

483
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:35,599
Go back to sleep.

484
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,351
What's wrong?

485
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,478
I think I heard someone talking.

486
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,354
Someone talking?

487
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,733
Yeah, like whispering.

488
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,234
What do you think it was?

489
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,193
I don't know.

490
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,654
Maybe an owl or something?

491
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,155
An owl?

492
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,449
Yes, an owl.

493
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,162
Give me your flashlight.

494
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,413
For what?

495
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,790
I'm going to see what it is.

496
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,791
Are you stupid?

497
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:02,167
Why would you go out there?

498
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,418
It could have been
someone walking by.

499
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,545
They could help us.

500
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:05,211
From a stranger?

501
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,462
In the middle of the night?

502
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,675
Do you have any better ideas?

503
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:10,761
Yeah, I thought so.

504
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:18,684
Ana.

505
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,811
Be careful, OK?

506
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:23,396
Stay in the car.

507
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,527
[car door sliding open]

508
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,488

[ominous sounds]

512
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,102
Hello?

513
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,312
My sister and I are stranded.

514
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,898
We need gas?

515
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,274
Hello?

516
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,404

[crunching footsteps]

520
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,298
Ana?

521
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,425
Ana, is that you?

522
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,596
[crunching footsteps]

523
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,472
Ana?

524
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,559
Ana, where are you?

525
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:00,871
Ana!

[ominous beat]

534
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,315
What happened?

535
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:30,941
What happened?

536
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:31,608
I saw someone.

537
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,609
There was someone out there.

538
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:33,443
Lock the door!

539
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:33,944
Are you sure?

540
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:34,611
Yeah!

541
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,571
There was someone out there!

542
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:36,487
I saw a figure!

543
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,531
I don't see anything.

544
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,532
Ana, I'm not seeing things.

545
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,032
There was someone out there!

546
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:39,950
Where?

547
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:40,617
It was right there.

548
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,492
I don't know!

549
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,368
OK, OK, OK, calm down.

550
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:42,994
I believe you, OK?

551
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:43,662
I believe you.

552
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,830
Let's just stay in here, OK?

553
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:45,997
And we'll keep an eye out.

554
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,666
Whatever it is, it
can't get in, OK?

555
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,168
Just calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

556
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,002
OK.

557
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:51,712
It's OK, it's OK.

558
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:54,633
[ominous instrumental sounds]

559
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,678
I don't see or here anything.

560
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I know what I saw, Ana.

561
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:05,183
Maybe it was like a tree,
like a shadow of a tree?

562
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,810
No, it looked like a person.

563
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:10,606
It was an actual person
standing right there.

564
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:12,776
Well, whatever it is,
it's not here anymore.

565
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,655
Yeah.

566
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,574
I don't see anything anymore.

567
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,659
Hey, it's OK.

568
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,619
We're going to be OK.

569
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:24,745
Just try to get some rest.

570
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:25,621
I'll keep watch.

571
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:27,748
Don't worry.

572
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, I'll try.

573
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:30,709
I'm right here.

574
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,544
[inaudible]

575
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,047
Don't worry about it, OK?

576
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,934
[night sounds]

577
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:05,704
Oh!

578
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,045
Sandra?

579
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,048
Sandra, wake up.

580
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,174
Wake up!

581
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,133
What is that?

582
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,176
What's going on?

583
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,343
Come on, let's go.

584
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,680
Let's go!

[heavy breathing]

590
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:00,716
Fuck.

591
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:02,258
What the hell just happened?

592
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,301
I don't know.

593
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,886
We woke up.

594
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,763
We were in the woods,
underneath-- in front of that,

595
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,389
that thing there.

596
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,265
OK.

597
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:10,141
But where are we?

598
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:10,934
Where's the car?

599
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:11,935
I have no idea.

600
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,269
We're deep in the woods.

601
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:13,939
I--

602
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,112
[birds chirping]

603
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,907
This is some evil shit
we got ourselves into.

604
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,077
Don't touch it.

605
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,997
Those things in the trees?

606
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,501
I know what they are,
I saw them on my trip

607
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:38,754
to Cuba in a small village.

608
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,338
It's brujeria.

609
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,966
They're made to guard
against intruders.

610
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:43,842
What does that mean?

611
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,010
It's a warning.

612
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:47,345
It means we're not
supposed to be here.

613
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:47,929
Where are we?

614
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,222
I don't-- I don't know.

615
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:52,976
This whole forest
just seems off.

616
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,854
Maybe we wandered off.

617
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,397
What was that back there?

618
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,524
I don't know, OK?

619
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,066
I woke up just like you did.

620
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,110
I don't know what's happening.

621
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,863
Can you remember anything?

622
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,156
No.

623
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,407
I just remember us being
in the car last night,

624
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,408
and just going to sleep.

625
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,243
But that's all.

626
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,244
Yeah.

627
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,996
Me too.

628
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:17,918
This whole thing is
fricking, fricking weird.

629
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,086
Ana?

630
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,422
I feel like we're being watched.

631
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,174
Ana, I told you.

632
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,510
I told you, we should
just turned back.

633
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,428
And go fucking where?

634
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,430
There's nowhere to go!

635
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,891
Ana, I just wanted to
get away for a while

636
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,142
and enjoy a good time.

637
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,144
Just forget about
this past week.

638
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,896
I didn't ask for any of this!

639
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,314
Oh, and you think I did?

640
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,108
Look, whatever is going on,
we need to figure it out.

641
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,277
I'm just as confused as you are!

642
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,071
OK, but we shouldn't
have stayed here.

643
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,614
We shouldn't have
spent the night here.

644
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,157
We should have seen this coming.

645
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,408
I told you I had a bad
feeling about this place!

646
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,242
Calm down!

647
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,536
Just calm down, OK?

648
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,622
Look, look, we still
have our supplies, right?

649
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:56,582
Neither of us are hurt.

650
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,208
You're not hurt, right?

651
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,126
We just need to figure out
how to get out of this forest

652
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,420
and try to find the car.

653
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,131
OK?

654
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,600

[whispering voices]

656
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,467
Hello?

00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,430
[ominous sounds]

658
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,519
Is anyone there?

659
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,229
Sandra?

660
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:08,444
Sandra?

661
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:12,448
Sandra, is everything OK?

662
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,283
Yeah.

663
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:16,411
I just, I thought
I heard something.

664
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,541
I thought I heard
someone whispering, but--

665
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,419
I didn't hear anything.

666
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:28,048
Come on, let's move.

667
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,219
[ominous music]

668
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,790
Oh.

669
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,749
What?

670
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,461
You're joking with me.

671
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,843
OK, we're going to
need more water.

672
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,764
You know, I had a
dream about this once.

673
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,601
I remember that I
got lost in the woods

674
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:23,228
and I was trying to
look for you or Dad,

675
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,814
but I couldn't find
any of you guys.

676
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:29,192
And then, I just felt
like I was being followed

677
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,527
so I just started to run.

678
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,903
And then, I just ran and I ran.

679
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,948
And I was running in circles,
just like last night.

680
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,325
Stop.

681
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,995
I'm not going to
leave your side.

682
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,456
That's what Dad used to say.

683
00:34:55,846 --> 00:35:00,724
So do you want to cremate him,
or do you want to bury him?

684
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,644
We're obviously burying him.

685
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:04,686
Why?

686
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,647
That's what he would want!

687
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,857
But cremating him
is so much cheaper.

688
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,652
Yes, but no, we're
not going to do that.

689
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:13,529
Are you going to
be paying for it?

690
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:14,782
I don't think so, right?

691
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,620
Do you really not
care about anything?

692
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,830
It's not that I
don't care, Sandra.

693
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,667
Like I said, are you going
to be paying for this?

694
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:28,710
I don't think so, huh?

695
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,420
You know our situation.

696
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,006
Oh, so now it's my
fault, like always.

697
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,926
Because I'm never here, right?

698
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,679
You never were.

699
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,016
The only reason why you
came was because of Dad.

700
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,687
You know I tried my best.

701
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:48,939
OK?

702
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,732
I don't know what your
definition of best

703
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,693
is because that's not it.

704
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:53,443
Ah!

705
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,903
Here we go.

706
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,782
Ana, seriously, when did
you ever give me a call?

707
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,827
Texting me at least, hey,
sister, are you doing OK?

708
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,495
Are you-- is anything-- is
everything good at home?

709
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,496
When?

710
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,415
You never texted me, Ana!

711
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,834
You're thinking
about your business

712
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:12,087
right now, how much money
you're going to make right now,

713
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,006
instead of thinking about
what's going to happen with me!

714
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:19,469
You never fucking
cared about me, Ana!

715
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,848
Phones work both ways.

716
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,435
So we're going to
bury him, and I guess

717
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,812
that's what it's going to be.

718
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:33,024
I'll talk to David and
we'll figure it out somehow.

719
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,443
Now about the house.

720
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,029
We're staying with the house.

721
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,197
What?

722
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,991
We're staying with that, we're
not-- we're staying here.

723
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:43,702
We're not doing
anything to the house.

724
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,829
Are you stupid?

725
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:50,083
Do you know how much this
house would sell on the market?

726
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:54,588
Is that really what you're
thinking about right now?

727
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,714
Money.

728
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,132
What else are we
going to do, Sandra?

729
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,092
Dad is dead.

730
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,094
What are we going to do?

731
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:04,097
What else are we going
to do with this house?

732
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,057
Live in this house?

733
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,851
We're not going to
sell this house, Ana.

734
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,020
I'm not living here.

735
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,523
I can literally
get so many people

736
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,815
to buy this house right now.

737
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:14,983
Are you fucking serious?

738
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:17,611
We're still talking about that?

739
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:18,945
What else do you
want to talk about?

740
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,113
What else is there to say?

741
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,073
You already said you
want to bury him.

742
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,074
Now what?

743
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,954
We're not selling this
house, and that's it.

744
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,915
If we sell this house, we can--

745
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,166
We're not selling this house!

746
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,794
We can easily split it
between the two of us.

747
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:34,922
I don't want the money.

748
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,675
OK, then what's your plan?

749
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,176
We don't sell the
house, then what?

750
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:41,802
We'll figure it out!

751
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:42,844
What are you going to do?

752
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:43,679
We'll figure it out.

753
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:44,179
No, no, no, no,

754
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:44,680
I--

755
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:46,097
No, no, no, no, no.

756
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,348
Not we, I said, what
are you going to do?

757
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,308
What do you mean me?

758
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,894
We're in this together.

759
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:53,939
I have my own life, Sandra.

760
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,732
I have a business to run.

761
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,276
So my question is, what
are you going to do?

762
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,654
So you're leaving?

763
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,656
I can't stay here.

764
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,074
You know that.

765
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:04,783
Why not?

766
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:07,202
I have my own life with David!

767
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,370
OK, but you can be
here with David!

768
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,749
You can come here and we can
figure it out here, all of us

769
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,000
together!

770
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:18,046
Clearly, you don't know
shit about anything.

771
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:21,382
Ana, really, I know you
have a life over there,

772
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,259
and I know that you're happy.

773
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,136
But, Ana, I need you.

774
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,430
I need you to be here with me!

775
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,265
Who gives a shit?

776
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,392
I'm the one that knows how
to put this house for sale,

777
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:33,937
and I'm going to do it
whether you like it or not.

778
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,897
So you need to figure
out what the hell to do,

779
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,440
because you're not staying here.

780
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,861
We're selling this house.

781
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:49,037
[birds chirping]

782
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:57,503
He loved you very, very much.

783
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,337
He would never leave you behind.

784
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,840
You know that's
not what happened.

785
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,885
If you say so.

786
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,177
He had to grow.

787
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:12,768
You know Dad couldn't be still,
and he just had things to do.

788
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,103
After mom died, he just--

789
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,772
he wasn't the same.

790
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:20,025
So what, she just decided to
take off and leave me behind?

791
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,360
She didn't leave you behind.

792
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:27,949
Ana, I was on my own, trying
to survive for four months.

793
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,075
And where were you?

794
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,493
Too stupid to take care of me?

795
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:31,578
I'm sorry, OK?

796
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,871
I'm sorry.

797
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:33,997
I was scared too.

798
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,541
Dad left both of us, remember?

799
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:36,752
Not just you.

800
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,880
I could take it
all back, I would.

801
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:46,426
But I can't, and you know that.

802
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,180
Yeah, I know.

803
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,850
I'm not going to
leave your side.

804
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,268
OK?

805
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,063
I promise.

806
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,859
He wouldn't like to see you
suffering as much, especially

807
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,861
not for him.

808
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,947
Yeah, I know.

809
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,282
Everything's going to be fine.

810
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,619
We're going to find
our way out, OK?

811
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,494
OK.

812
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:14,370
Now, come on.

813
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,081
Let's go.

814
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,084
Ah!

815
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:24,005
We need to find a river
or a lake or something.

816
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,048
We need to find water and--

817
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,007
Shh!

818
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,384
[whispering voices]

819
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:29,177
And water?

820
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,265
[whispering voices]

821
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,746
I'm scared.

822
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,080
What is it?

823
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,582
We keep hearing this
whispering sounds.

824
00:40:58,584 --> 00:40:59,541
What Is it?

825
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:00,626
It's just the wind.

826
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,585
The wind in the trees.

827
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:02,669
Come on, let's go.

828
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,588
It's not the trees.

829
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,255
Keep moving.

830
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,422
Keep moving.

831
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:10,426
It's not the trees,
you know it's not.

832
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:13,263
Ana, they sounded like people.

833
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,640
Like a lot of people
were in there.

834
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:17,601
And there's no one in
this forest but us.

835
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:18,476
I know.

836
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,477
I know, OK?

837
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,105
But we just have to keep moving.

838
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,064
Come on.

839
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,275
[birds chirping loudly]

840
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,277
The weird cross thing.

841
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,444
The whispering.

842
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:31,364
Just the weird
sensation of this place.

843
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:33,241
Everything is going to be fine.

844
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,660
We just have to
find the car and--

845
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,786
Just give it up!

846
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:37,245
Just give it up.

847
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,664
We both know we're not
going to find the car.

848
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,499
We've been walking
for hours, Ana,

849
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,167
and if there was
something nearby,

850
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:45,546
we would have found it by now.

851
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:47,338
You're right.

852
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,509
We're not going to find the car.

853
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,681
Well, at least for now, we just
have to find some water, OK?

854
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,434
We need it really bad.

855
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,610
[water sounds]

856
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,143
Ana, are you sure this is safe?

857
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,270
It's the only other
option we have.

858
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:46,525
It's either this or
we die of thirst.

859
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,787
[humming]

860
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,751
[whispering voices]

861
00:43:04,752 --> 00:43:08,587
What the hell?

862
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:09,713
[whispering voices]

863
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,718
[ominous music]

864
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:19,683
[whispering voices]

865
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,482
[soft crying]

866
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,613
[chanting]

867
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:39,868
Hey, are you OK?

868
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,286
It's blood!

869
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,538
Well, put some pressure on it.

870
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,915
No, it's not mine!

871
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:45,626
It's blood!

872
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:49,419
Did you get it anywhere else?

873
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,839
No, it's just my hands.

874
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,803
[ominous beating]

875
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:10,442
[ominous music]

876
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:27,791
What the fuck?

877
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:30,168
Right.

878
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,003
So what happened, exactly?

879
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,171
I don't know.

880
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,756
I was just putting water,
and out of nowhere, blood

881
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,466
started coming down the river.

882
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:41,012
I saw the amount of blood it
was, and it was a lot, Ana.

883
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:41,888
What was it from?

884
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,015
A dead animal?

885
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,058
No.

886
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,018
OK, well, several animals.

887
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,771
All the scalps that
we've been seeing around.

888
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,648
Maybe.

889
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,901
Maybe it was something else.

890
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:59,155
You're not trying to say
it was human blood, right?

891
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:00,532
I don't know.

892
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,533
It could have been
a million things.

893
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,535
Just try to stay positive, OK?

894
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:04,703
I don't want you to worry.

895
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:08,540
I'm really trying to.

896
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:12,836
[forest sounds]

897
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,671
Let's just follow the trail.

898
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,590
And maybe there's some
water down by the river

899
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,759
and we can find a safe spot.

900
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:20,844
OK, well, you said
that this trail's going

901
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,514
to lead us somewhere, right?

902
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:26,725
But what if it leads us on what
we're not supposed to find?

903
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,143
Like what?

904
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,603
I don't know, Ana.

905
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,605
You said it yourself,
it could be anything!

906
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:33,649
Yeah, but this trail
is our only option.

907
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:36,860
If there's a trail, that means
people have been walking on it.

908
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,779
So that means somewhere
in this woods,

909
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:41,072
there's got to be a
person around here.

910
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,951
Now, if only they're
willing to help.

911
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,999
Ana.

912
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,918
That symbol.

913
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,169
We've seen it before.

914
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,337
[music playing]

915
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,340
On Dad's things.

916
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:00,010
What?

917
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:06,684
[sad music]

918
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,061
It's just weird.

919
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:55,188
One day, he's calling
us and telling us

920
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:00,944
of his adventurous life, and
now he's gone out of nowhere.

921
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:02,779
It's really weird.

922
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,699
Dad was not the
type to get lost.

923
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:10,829
He was hiking for so many years,
and you know he was so safe.

924
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,290
None of this makes sense to me.

925
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:15,878
It really doesn't.

926
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:19,838
Plus, with his
military training,

927
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,509
I doubt he wouldn't be able to
do something to defend himself.

928
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:27,428
Look, we might not ever
know what happened to him.

929
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,223
So let's just let the
police do their job,

930
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,978
and if something comes
up, they'll let us know.

931
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:40,942
But some of these
things are just odd.

932
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,529
It's like Dad had a
whole other life that he

933
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:46,031
didn't want anybody to know.

934
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,991
Ana, we all have secrets.

935
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:49,450
And he traveled a lot.

936
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:52,370
So all that is memories.

937
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:53,830
Yeah?

938
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:54,499
Well, look at this.

939
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,090
Maybe it's not even
him in this picture.

940
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:10,013
Probably someone gave it to him,
or he found it to collect it.

941
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:16,019
Woe to those who call
evil good, good, evil.

942
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:19,189
Isaiah: 520.

943
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,232
What does that even mean?

944
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,276
Well, it's from the Bible.

945
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:25,320
Do you know how
religious he was?

946
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:29,950
Yeah, but Dad liked those
weird parts of the Bible.

947
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:32,077
Those are the best parts.

948
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,121
It makes you think.

949
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:44,299
This is a weird ring.

950
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,594
Where did he get it from?

951
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:50,178
I really don't know.

952
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,682
Maybe from his travels?

953
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,266
What is it?

954
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:59,145
It looks like a circle
with some wavy lines.

955
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:00,524
Let me see.

956
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:09,531
Well, looks like a tree, and
these could be the branches.

957
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,325
I don't know.

958
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:15,328
Creepy.

959
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,081
What do you think it means?

960
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,667
I don't know, but if
Dad had it his stuff,

961
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,753
it must be important to him.

962
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:24,129
No.

963
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,548
This looks too small
to belong to Dad.

964
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,633
What do you mean?

965
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,092
It looks small.

966
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,596
Dad's fingers were
way bigger than this.

967
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:37,100
Yeah, this definitely
belonged to someone else.

968
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,102
Maybe a woman.

969
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:40,604
Maybe it's Mom's.

970
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:42,606
No I don't think so.

971
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,442
Mom would definitely not
wear something like that.

972
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:50,238
Then maybe not hers, the whose?

973
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,949
I don't know.

974
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,503
The ring.

975
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:07,839
The ring had that same symbol.

976
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:09,424
Maybe it just looks like it.

977
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,717
Ana, who you're trying to
convince, me or yourself?

978
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,511
I'm just saying, it
doesn't necessarily

979
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:13,720
mean it's the same symbol.

980
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:14,680
Ana, look at it!

981
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:15,683
It's the same damn symbol!

982
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:23,354
It's weird, but maybe it
can help us figure out

983
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:26,107
what happened to Dad.

984
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:30,153
What, are you crazy?

985
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:32,197
Dad got lost, plain and simple.

986
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,574
The police said it themselves.

987
00:50:33,576 --> 00:50:34,490
Yeah?

988
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:36,159
Is that why he had
holes on his wrist?

989
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:36,868
And is that why he
was begging for help

990
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,869
on the side of the road?

991
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,204
You don't have to do this.

992
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:41,122
Sandra, this has
nothing to do with Dad!

993
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:42,248
I just want answers.

994
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,416
I want to know what
happened to him!

995
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:44,751
I want them too, OK?

996
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,795
But we're not going to
find any by creating them

997
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:48,298
in our own damn head!

998
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,897
How much water do we have left?

999
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:08,525
Just my bottle.

1000
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,320
I hope we can find
more water soon.

1001
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,828
[crickets chirping loudly]

1002
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,459
[flies buzzing]

1003
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,445
[bird caws]

1004
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,283
[ominous sounds]

1005
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:58,869
What the hell?

1006
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:04,915
Sandra!

1007
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:05,791
Sandra!

1008
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:06,502
It's not--

1009
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:11,922
It's a dead body.

1010
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:15,341
[ominous music]

1011
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:17,093
That's the gas station guy.

1012
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:18,094
What is he doing here?

1013
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,096
Why is he here?

1014
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,973
They did this.

1015
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,433
Who?

1016
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:24,601
Remember, he was scared
of someone seeing him.

1017
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:26,477
That's why he wouldn't help us.

1018
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:28,438
Whoever it was, they
did this to him.

1019
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,480
But I don't understand.

1020
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:30,356
Why him?

1021
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:31,107
He was from here.

1022
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,108
He told us about them.

1023
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,027
They didn't want us to know

1024
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,612
So we're next.

1025
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:36,697
We're going to get-- we're
going to get killed next!

1026
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:38,448
No, no, no, I don't think so.

1027
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,866
Think about it.

1028
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:41,492
If they wanted to kill us,
they would have done it by now.

1029
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:43,119
Why didn't they do
it at the cross?

1030
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,580
Why wait this entire day?

1031
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:45,999
Why didn't they
kill us at the car?

1032
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:52,045
They're waiting for
something from us.

1033
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,630
They've been watching us.

1034
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:57,759
This entire time, they've
been one step ahead of us.

1035
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,678
They knew we were
going to cross here.

1036
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,513
They knew we were
going to walk under it.

1037
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:02,848
But how did they know?

1038
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,017
OK, well, maybe they're
trying to send a message.

1039
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,310
Well, what message?

1040
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,437
If they wanted to kill us, they
would have killed us already!

1041
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:10,731
OK.

1042
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:14,025
Maybe they're not allowed to.

1043
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,026
The blood.

1044
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,778
The blood in the river,
it was human blood.

1045
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,114
And the symbol, the ring.

1046
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:21,199
Do you believe me now?

1047
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:25,704
This is definitely about Dad.

1048
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,039
Maybe we're not
dead because of him.

1049
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,124
But who are these people?

1050
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:30,002
What do they want?

1051
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:35,589
OK, let's just-- let's
just follow the trip.

1052
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:36,256
Come on.

1053
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:37,132
What if we get lost?

1054
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,258
Look around, Sandra.

1055
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,928
We've been lost all day!

1056
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,104
[birds chirping]

1057
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,068
[flies buzzing]

1058
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,121
Come on, you need
to walk faster.

1059
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:11,792
I'm trying, Ana, but
I'm tired, I'm thirsty,

1060
00:54:11,794 --> 00:54:13,879
and, Ana, it's so hot.

1061
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,178
I wish I had my phone.

1062
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,305
Yeah, I bet calling
Theo now doesn't sound

1063
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:26,682
like such a bad idea, does it?

1064
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:27,849
I'm sorry, OK?

1065
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,310
I know we should have called
when we had the chance.

1066
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,937
And now we're stuck here.

1067
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,772
We don't even know if we're
going to make it out alive.

1068
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,941
Sandra, you didn't know
this was going to happen.

1069
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,108
Don't blame yourself.

1070
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,069
OK, but what if we
never make it out?

1071
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:39,736
Don't say that!

1072
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:40,987
There's got to be a way out.

1073
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:45,283
We just have to keep searching.

1074
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,785
But for what?

1075
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,663
Ana, you said it yourself,
they're watching us.

1076
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:50,872
They're watching our every move!

1077
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,791
But they don't know
that we're here!

1078
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:53,750
How do you know that?

1079
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,128
I don't know, I just--

1080
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:05,428
Because I'm sure they wouldn't
have wanted us to find that.

1081
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,805
What is it?

1082
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,307
It looks like a house.

1083
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,433
Like one of their houses?

1084
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:11,434
I don't-- I don't know.

1085
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,855
It's the only one around.

1086
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,233
So what do you want to do?

1087
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:20,443
We have to go inside.

1088
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:21,653
You're crazy.

1089
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:22,779
We're not going in there, Ana.

1090
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:23,822
Sandra, you said
you wanted answers.

1091
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:24,781
No, we're not going in there!

1092
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:25,907
You said you wanted answers.

1093
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,117
This is our only chance.

1094
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,786
Come on.

1095
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:33,291
[ominous sounds]

1096
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:00,277
[ominous music]

1097
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:14,917
Ana.

1098
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:20,837
Ana, stop.

1099
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:21,505
Stay here.

1100
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,589
I'll be quick, OK?

1101
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,761
[ominous music]

1102
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:45,238
[wood boards creaking]

1103
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,592
I think it's abandoned.

1104
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:10,136
Yeah, looks like it's been
like that for a while.

1105
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:12,514
We'll just search
around for supplies.

1106
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:13,433
Anything we can take.

1107
00:58:33,471 --> 00:58:34,721
Ana!

1108
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:35,847
Ana, come see this.

1109
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:36,559
What happened?

1110
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,439
Are these missing people?

1111
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,693
That's what they look like.

1112
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,199
What kind of lunatic
will have posters

1113
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:57,202
of missing girls on the wall?

1114
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:58,537
I don't know.

1115
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,331
Whoever lived here must have
had some fucked up mind.

1116
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:05,335
Ana, they're so young.

1117
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:08,505
And they're all women.

1118
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,674
Maybe that's what they like.

1119
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:13,134
Who knows, maybe they're
out there looking for them.

1120
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,177
And for what?

1121
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,429
Some kind of sick self-reward?

1122
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,101
For all we know, maybe they're
missing because of them.

1123
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:23,103
You know what?

1124
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,312
You were right.

1125
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:25,271
This place gives me the creeps.

1126
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:26,272
Maybe we should go.

1127
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:30,487
I don't-- What the fuck?

1128
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,575
What the hell is this?

1129
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,283
Ana!

1130
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:40,954
Is this some kind of sick joke?

1131
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,288
What's going on?

1132
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,375
Why would they have
pictures of us?

1133
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,629
Hello?

1134
00:59:48,631 --> 00:59:50,005
Ana, I want to go home!

1135
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,798
I don't want to be here.

1136
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,883
Ana!

1137
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:53,759
No!

1138
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:54,843
I want to go home!

1139
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:55,426
This can't be happening.

1140
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:56,512
This can't be happening.

1141
00:59:56,514 --> 00:59:57,470
I want to go home, Ana.

1142
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:58,346
This can't be happening!

1143
00:59:58,348 --> 00:59:59,222
Ana, I want to go home.

1144
00:59:59,224 --> 00:59:59,931
I want to go home.

1145
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:00,974
I don't want to die.

1146
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:01,850
I don't want to be here, Ana!

1147
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:02,433
I don't want to be here!

1148
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:03,769
This can't be happening.

1149
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:04,310
I want to go home!

1150
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:05,478
I don't want to die!

1151
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,479
What's happening!

1152
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,356
I don't want to die here, Ana.

1153
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:09,650
I don't want to die.

1154
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:11,610
Ana, Ana, they're killing us.

1155
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,236
They're here, they're here, Ana.

1156
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:14,362
They're here, they're here.

1157
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:15,446
I don't want to die.

1158
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:16,364
Get up!

1159
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,034
[shouting]

1160
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,493
We're not going to die.

1161
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:22,037
We are going to get
the fuck out of here.

1162
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:22,706
Come on!

1163
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:27,793
[drums beating]

1164
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:30,756
[rapid music]

1165
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:35,427
[drum beating once]

1166
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,597
I'm scared.

1167
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,890
Just keep going.

1168
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:42,560
Come on.

1169
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:54,360
Sandra.

1170
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:55,779
Sandra, come here.

1171
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:56,780
Come here.

1172
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,323
Come here.

1173
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,449
I want to go home.

1174
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:00,116
Hey, hey, hey, shh.

1175
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:00,992
I want to go--

1176
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:01,785
I don't want to be here.

1177
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:02,327
Look at me.

1178
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,787
Look at me, Sandra.

1179
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,622
Sandra, you need to
get this together, OK?

1180
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:06,790
We are stronger than this.

1181
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:07,958
I don't want to die here.

1182
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,834
I don't want to die.

1183
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:12,462
Sandra, Sandra,
I'm scared too, OK?

1184
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:13,171
I'm scared.

1185
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,590
I don't want to die.

1186
01:01:14,592 --> 01:01:16,091
We are not going to die.

1187
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:19,010
Sandra, Sandra, we are
not going to die, OK?

1188
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:20,386
We will get through this.

1189
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:22,097
Whatever's going
on, it's not fair.

1190
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,515
We didn't do anything.

1191
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:24,808
OK?

1192
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,434
Whatever is going on,
it's really fucked up.

1193
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,604
It's fucked up.

1194
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:29,855
But this is what they want.

1195
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:30,438
OK?

1196
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,023
This is what they want.

1197
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,900
Whoever's doing this, they
want to see us like this.

1198
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,611
They want us weak and scared.

1199
01:01:35,613 --> 01:01:37,195
We can't let them in, OK?

1200
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:37,988
I don't want--

1201
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:38,989
Don't give in.

1202
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:39,948
And where are they?

1203
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,616
I mean, we--

1204
01:01:40,618 --> 01:01:41,575
I don't know.

1205
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:42,534
They didn't follow us, OK?

1206
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:43,409
They didn't follow us.

1207
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:44,410
It doesn't make sense.

1208
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:45,036
Why wouldn't they follow us?

1209
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,121
I don't know!

1210
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:47,413
There was three of them,
and they didn't even move!

1211
01:01:47,415 --> 01:01:48,499
I want to go home.

1212
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:49,583
Sandra.

1213
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:52,168
Sandra, Sandra, we
can do this, OK?

1214
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,629
We can get out of here.

1215
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:57,841
You have got this, OK?
, Now come on, let's go.

1216
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:59,593
If I'm right, we'll
be out of here soon.

1217
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,136
Come on.

1218
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:02,430
Follow the trail, remember?

1219
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,061
[flies buzzing]

1220
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:17,778
[owl hooting]

1221
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,279
[crickets chirping]

1222
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,281
[night sounds]

1223
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:23,784
It's really dark.

1224
01:02:23,786 --> 01:02:26,494
Ana, who's doing this to us?

1225
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,746
Just try to stay focused.

1226
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,457
Let's not worry
about that right now.

1227
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:34,961
So how big do you
think this place is?

1228
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,797
And when are we going
to get out of here?

1229
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,173
You said we'd be
out of here soon!

1230
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,049
I don't know!

1231
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:41,342
We should have seen
something by now!

1232
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,846
Maybe we're not too far.

1233
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:59,360
There has to be some
reasoning for this.

1234
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:02,698
Dad's pictures, the ring?

1235
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,367
It's probably from
his fucking religion.

1236
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:08,203
Witchcraft?

1237
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,621
Something like that.

1238
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:12,207
Or some other evil shit.

1239
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:14,751
Maybe some sort of
cult. It's just,

1240
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,211
it doesn't make any sense.

1241
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:19,047
Out of all places,
we end up here.

1242
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:19,881
How?

1243
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:23,802
I just don't want
to be here, Ana.

1244
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:24,928
We just have to keep moving.

1245
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,931
Come on, come on.

1246
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:34,189
[ominous music]

1247
01:03:40,946 --> 01:03:43,947
[wind blowing]

1248
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:45,281
I'm not going through there.

1249
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:46,324
We have to keep moving.

1250
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:49,119
No, I'm done listening
to you and to your plans.

1251
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:49,870
Fine.

1252
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:51,454
Stay here then.

1253
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:52,748
I'll go first.

1254
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,457
Are you joking?

1255
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:56,877
I can't stay here alone.

1256
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:00,506
Sandra, we have to keep moving.

1257
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:02,050
Follow the trail, remember?

1258
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:16,690
[ominous music]

1259
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,125
How do you think this got here?

1260
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,879
My guess is as good as yours.

1261
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:46,552
This is definitely witchcraft!

1262
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:48,305
Come on, we have to keep moving.

1263
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,059
What was that verse that Dad
liked to say about the Bible?

1264
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,060
About these things.

1265
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,394
You know it.

1266
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,313
They have mouths but
you cannot speak.

1267
01:04:58,315 --> 01:04:58,897
Yeah, that one.

1268
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,065
Say it, say it, say it.

1269
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,274
Eyes but they cannot see.

1270
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:03,276
They have mouths but
the cannot breathe.

1271
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:04,444
Keep on, keep on, keep on.

1272
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,029
They have ears but
