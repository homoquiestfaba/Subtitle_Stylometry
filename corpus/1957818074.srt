Oh, yeah, here we go.

36
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:31,370
And I'm feeling right.

37
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,301
Oh, yeah, getting close.

38
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,511
Oh, here it is.

39
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:35,730
Ready?

40
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,731
Ready?

41
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:44,186
Fire in the hole.

42
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,184
- I love you.
- Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,953
That made this whole work week worth it.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,069
Glad you enjoyed it.

45
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,170
What, you didn't get anything from that?

46
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,171
What, nothing at all?

47
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:16,493
All right, well, what
would you have liked?

48
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,859
I would like to feel
that we are connecting.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,770
Seriously?

50
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,313
You didn't feel that?

51
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,540
All right, what did I do wrong this time?

52
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,749
You seem to be turning
this into a competition.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,209
I'm not a goal.

54
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,269
See, you don't care how I feel.

55
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,869
It's always about you.

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,703
Oh, come on.

57
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,919
You know I have a sense of humor.

58
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,095
I was just thinking about something funny.

59
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,190
You think this is funny?

60
00:03:49,874 --> 00:03:52,703
I thought you liked it whenever
I took you to pound town?

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,813
Baby, I was joking.

62
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,572
I'm not dealing with this shit.

63
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,573
Fuck this.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,559
So, what, you're gonna go hang out

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,649
with your buddies instead
of dealing with this?

66
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,650
Nope.

67
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,499
Then what are you doing?

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,943
Avoiding this mess.

69
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,320
What does that mean?

70
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,068
I want a divorce.

71
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,609
Come on, I'm not a total dick.

72
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,360
I let you keep the house, didn't I?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,203
How many times do you
have to read the thing?

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,585
Just like that, it's over?

75
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,109
No, you still haven't signed it.

76
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,259
Come on, I got a new girl now.

77
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,724
She's younger, better looking,
does what I want her to,

78
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,197
and complains a whole lot
less than you ever did.

79
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:46,299
Quick and painless.

80
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,913
You're an asshole.

81
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,999
I know.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,373
I'm a free asshole.

83
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Enjoy your life.

84
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,860
I know you're in here.

85
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:01,028
I heard the phone ringing.

86
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,273
Or I can just let myself in.

87
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:11,906
What is this?

88
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:15,179
Are we enjoying a self-pity party?

89
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,529
I need to be alone.

90
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,159
Oh, yeah, because that works.

91
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
It's been a month and honestly,

92
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,029
you look like you're on your
way to alcohol poisoning.

93
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,030
Spill it.

94
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
It's over.

95
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,780
What?

96
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,399
Your hopes, your dreams, world hunger?

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
What's over?

98
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,973
Andrew and I.

99
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:36,329
Oh, God, babe, that was over months ago.

100
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,839
What I need right now
is a "I told you so."

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,789
Oh, yeah, well I mean when
you're right, you're right.

102
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,469
And you staying in and getting
drunk isn't really helping.

103
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,599
We need to get drunk properly.

104
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,927
Come on, we have to get you up.

105
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:49,942
- What?
- And cleaned up, yes, yes.

106
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:51,409
- Oh, no.
- You're coming with me.

107
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,549
We are going out.
Oh, come on.

108
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,716
You're getting dressed now.

109
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,807
I don't want to.

110
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:57,919
We're gonna have fun.

111
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Get dressed.

112
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:01,129
Take a bath, do it.

113
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,619
We're going out.

114
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,609
Hey, sweets.
Hi, Mom.

115
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,415
The delivery guy just dropped this off.

116
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,993
Perfect, just in time.

117
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,379
I had to forge your signature again.

118
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,826
Again?

119
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,619
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go to the mall.

120
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,453
Okay.

121
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,969
All right, be home by nine o'clock.

122
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,749
Why, it's not like you'll be.

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,179
Oh, young lady, you do
as I say, not as I do.

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,509
Come here, give me a kiss.

125
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,066
Oh.

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,789
Go, and nine o'clock!

127
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,971
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, I'm serious.

128
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,049
It's heavy.

129
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,050
This is awesome.

130
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,699
Woo hoo!

131
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,359
What the hell?

132
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,079
Sam, what is this?

133
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,773
I wanna fuck you.

134
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,683
This is your new lover.

135
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,470
A teddy bear?

136
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,799
Well, you're either gonna
make Andrew really angry

137
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,689
with another man or you're
just gonna fuck up your life

138
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,809
with a trail of new losers,
so I figured I'd bring you

139
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,373
something that would make you smile.

140
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,595
And you know what is name is?

141
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,075
It's Bearry.

142
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,559
Oh, oh, oh, wait.

143
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,539
I love you bearry much.

144
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,743
Oh, so cute.

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,399
All right, are you hungry?

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,869
Yeah.

147
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,599
Yeah, let's get outta here.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,283
Oh, I need a drink.

149
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,430
Okay, whew!

150
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,140
Here you go.

151
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:58,040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

152
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,041
- Um.
- Oh.

153
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,950
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,019
Stephen, your girlfriend is at table 16.

155
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Stop it.

156
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,056
Here you are.
Oh.

157
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,129
Is there anything else I can get you?

158
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,573
No, thank you.

159
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,300
Hm, he's cute for an older guy.

160
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,669
Can I just enjoy my meal, please?

161
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,949
You can try.

162
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,889
Oh, this kid.

163
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,723
Hey, Mom.

164
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,699
So, I think I left my purse
in the trunk of your car

165
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,372
or in the locker at the gym,
in which case I might have to

166
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,789
replace your credit card.

167
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,429
So, I'm really hoping it's
in the trunk of your car.

168
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,559
What?

169
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,539
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't attached.

170
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,039
Did you at least remember
to lock the front door?

171
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,073
Yes, Mom, I'm not an idiot.

172
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,596
I'll be back.

173
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,230
Is everything okay?

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,289
Good.

175
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,879
You need anything else, just let me know.

176
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,799
No, I'm good.

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm just checking.

178
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Enjoy.

179
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:34,720
Are you done yet?

180
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:36,653
We need to get you white girl drunk.

181
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,930
Let's go.

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,583
Sam, you forgot these.

183
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,365
Thanks for coming.

184
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:25,026
Anything else?

185
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,697
Okay, ladies, here's your tab.

186
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,865
I think you've had enough.

187
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:50,653
What am I going to do with you?

188
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,393
I guess I'll be snuggling
with you tonight.

189
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,166
I love you bearry much.

190
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,701
Aw.

191
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,702
Mm.

192
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,185
Cute, but I'm not in the mood.

193
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,769
You sure are needy.

194
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,943
Crap, what time is it?

195
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,314
Oh, God.

196
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,182
I'm late.

197
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,973
I can't believe I let Sam set me up.

198
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,359
Let me tell you a
little bit about myself.

199
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,649
I enjoy a rousing fencing tournament,

200
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,839
I am well versed in Shakespeare,

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,289
and I enjoy occasionally the odd cricket,

202
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,029
or the delightful fox hunt.

203
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,839
Now, tell me a little bit about yourself.

204
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,489
You're vegan, am I
understanding that correctly?

205
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,269
Or is it that raw thing?

206
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,103
I don't know.

207
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,389
I enjoy haggis myself.

208
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,223
Oh, my goodness.

209
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,331
Have you ever had haggis?

210
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:19,270
Oh!

211
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,250
No, you got it wrong.

212
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,199
I'm not looking for a girlfriend.

213
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,619
I'm looking for girlfriends.

214
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,780
- How old are you?
- Oh, I'm 18.

215
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,014
I'm legal.

216
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,265
I'm into MILFs.

217
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Wow.

218
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:50,824
You're pretty.

219
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,196
Woo wee!

220
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,249
You're prettier than Betsy.

221
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,250
Who's Betsy?

222
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,189
That's my prize winning heifer.

223
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,573
Move along.

224
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Yes!

225
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,047
Bitch.

226
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,069
I can't believe it.

227
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,489
I might be getting that promotion.

228
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,439
Yes, I'm going to dinner with my boss.

229
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,763
No, it's not a date.

230
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,959
Sam, why do you have to
crap on every good thing

231
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,973
that happens to me?

232
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,099
Yes, he just got out of a marriage.

233
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,259
How long?

234
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,583
I don't know, who cares.

235
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,359
No, it's just business.

236
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,269
Besides if it wasn't, he'd
be better than any of those

237
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,919
losers you tried setting me up with.

238
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
They were horrible.

239
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,999
Sam, come on.

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Whatever.

241
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:14,239
Mm hm.

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,613
Oh, come on.

243
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,429
Be happy I'm getting this promotion.

244
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,263
I earned it and not the way you do.

245
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,180
You support me, don't you, Bearry?

246
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,030
Tasty.

247
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,839
- Hi.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Good to see you.

249
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,100
It's better to see you.

250
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,479
Thanks for considering me.

251
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,549
I figured dinner first, then
we can discuss the position?

252
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm sure there are plenty
of positions you're good at.

253
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,059
I don't think we'll have
a problem finding one.

254
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,610
I really want this promotion.

255
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,973
Well, let's see if you earn it.

256
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,973
Yeah, that's fucked up.

257
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,937
I really know how to pick 'em.

258
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,092
Well, it seems like you
had a lot on your chest

259
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,270
you had to get off of.

260
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,321
Why don't we do this?

261
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,399
Go back to your place, get some drinks,

262
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,409
and I'll help you forget
all about that guy.

263
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,713
You know, earn your promotion.

264
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,470
Excuse me?

265
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,479
Look, lady, if I didn't
earn any trim listening

266
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,759
to that crap, tell me
what do I have to do?

267
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,793
You just wanted to sleep with me?

268
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,373
You're a pig!

269
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,043
So, is that a no?

270
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,827
Look, first you bring
me to this shit hole,

271
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,279
then you dump this crap of a story on me,

272
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,919
and you're telling me I
don't get anything out of it?

273
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,639
Get out of here!

274
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,199
Excuse me?

275
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Get out of here!

276
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,489
Is there a problem?

277
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,490
Yes!

278
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,593
You need to leave.

279
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,183
Oh, well, this place turned
out to be a bust anyway.

280
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,070
Looks like I have to find somebody else

281
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,020
that's more qualified for the position.

282
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,509
Better yet, why don't you take a vacation?

283
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,883
Unpaid, of course.

284
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Fuck you.

285
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:31,483
Hit the road, bitch!

286
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,680
Okay, looks like my shift's over.

287
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:51,379
Are you okay?

288
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,220
What's wrong with me?

289
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:55,513
I don't think there's
anything wrong with you.

290
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,853
Why am I surrounded by losers?

291
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,440
Do you have anyone you can call?

292
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah.

293
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,490
Thank you.

294
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:14,629
All right, I've got something
to finish up in the back,

295
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,633
but I'll be close by if you need anything.

296
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,104
It's Sam, you know what to do.

297
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,723
Sam, call me back.

298
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Hi.

299
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,709
I hate to ask, but would I be able

300
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,060
to get a ride home tonight?

301
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,039
I feel a bit uncomfortable calling

302
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,590
a complete stranger for a ride.

303
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
Sure.

304
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,430
Just let me finish up a few things.

305
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,940
Is there anything I can help with?

306
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,983
Yeah, grab a towel.

307
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,977
You know, I'm sorry you lost your job.

308
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,113
Hey, I can do this tomorrow.

309
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Let's get you home.

310
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
We're here.

311
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:03,593
It's a really nice place you got.

312
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,310
What am I gonna do?

313
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:14,414
Look, I can offer you a job
till you get on your feet.

314
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,837
Thank you, but I'm not a waitress.

315
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:21,079
No, not as a waitress, as a bar back.

316
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,778
You were damn good tonight.

317
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:26,232
Hey, I got a laugh outta you.

318
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,233
There's a start.

319
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,383
If you need anything, I'm here to help.

320
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,039
Thank you.

321
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,082
You love me, don't you, Bearry?

322
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:07,776
I love you bearry much.

323
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:10,480
I know you do.

324
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:23,655
I love you bearry much, too.

325
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,253
Why are all men creeps?

326
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,650
That jackass made me lose my mind tonight.

327
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,033
I wish he'd lose his.

328
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,883
Hey, you need to hire another woman.

329
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,703
That bitch, Chloe, didn't work out.

330
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,903
I took her for an interview for dinner.

331
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,573
She was ungrateful, uptight.

332
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Excuse me?

333
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,079
I got a position for any
woman in this goddamn office!

334
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,163
I'm the boss!

335
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,370
Exactly.

336
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,783
Now you make sure the
next one has big tits.

337
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:39,746
I need something to look at.

338
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,793
I don't know, email me your top three.

339
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,479
I don't have all night.

340
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,579
It's been wasted.

341
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Get the job done.

342
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:57,397
Oh this is it, maybe this one.

343
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:59,705
Yeah, this is the one.

344
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,056
Yeah, you know you want it.

345
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:04,381
You can file some paperwork for daddy.

346
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:07,837
All these women are better
than that prude, Chloe.

347
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,326
I hope she goes further
than her preliminary.

348
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,605
That is a horrible way to die.

349
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,789
Coulda been a fetish thing.

350
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,869
Oh, good, that changes my
whole perspective on him.

351
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,243
He was a pervert.

352
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,609
What do you think this is?

353
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,839
It looks like the perp
might've had on padded gloves.

354
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,190
Yeah, maybe you're right.

355
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,919
So what do we know about our body there?

356
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,303
His last call was to
a business associate.

357
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,270
He said his business date didn't go well.

358
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,533
Uh huh, well then,

359
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,963
we know who we're gonna
talk to next, don't we?

360
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,650
Morning, Bearry.

361
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,178
I love you bearry much.

362
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,477
I love you too.

363
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:43,829
What happened?

364
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,426
You're hurt.

365
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,677
All done.

366
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:08,877
Do you want breakfast, Bearry?

367
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:09,878
I do.

368
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,799
Hi, can I help you?

369
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,859
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,908
We're detectives Clark and Seahorn.

371
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:32,029
We were seeing if we can
ask you some questions.

372
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,969
Uh, sure, would you like to come in?

373
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,419
Thank you, ma'am, that would be great.

374
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,749
This shouldn't take long.

375
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,839
Okay.

376
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,267
Just a few questions.

377
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,719
So, what's this about?

378
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,443
Do you know a Mr. Jeff Hardcastle?

379
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,599
He's my boss.

380
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,879
Well, was my boss.

381
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,912
When was the
last time you saw him?

382
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:15,249
Uh, I saw him last night.

383
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,523
Were you working?

384
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,639
- It was a business meeting.
- Dating?

385
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,620
We aren't dating.

386
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:22,659
It was just dinner after work.

387
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,043
Uh, well, we have witnesses
that say you two were dating.

388
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,929
- What witnesses?
- Work-related witnesses.

389
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,853
They said they two were a thing.

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,379
We're not a thing.

391
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,853
I was up for a promotion.

392
00:27:39,254 --> 00:27:41,749
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

393
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,550
Um, Mr. Hardcastle was
discovered dead last night.

394
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,230
What?

395
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,603
How, I was just-
We'll ask the questions.

396
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,723
What time did
your business dinner conclude?

397
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,583
- Around 9:00.
- Did it go well?

398
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,259
We won't be seeing each other again.

399
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,769
Yes, obviously.

400
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,419
Oh, my God, did you hear the great news?

401
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,816
That motherfucking prick got
exactly what he deserves.

402
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:16,877
And I when that and I thought
to myself, "You go, girl!"

403
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,680
These are the detectives

404
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,083
investigating Jeff's death.

405
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,839
Oh, okay, I actually
didn't mean that she did it.

406
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,449
I just meant that he was a dog
and he got what he deserved.

407
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,510
- Not helping.
- Okay, I'm actually going to

408
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,369
grab the wine and I'll be in the bedroom.

409
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,409
Hold it, who are you?

410
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,379
We may have questions for you later.

411
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,421
Okay, um, talk to my lawyer.

412
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:47,422
Wait a minute!

413
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,104
What the?

414
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,499
You're uh-
Um...

415
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,859
You know your story
has a lot of holes in it.

416
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,529
Would you like to fill in some of them?

417
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,530
Just a few?

418
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,669
We will check out your story, ma'am.

419
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,399
Not saying you're a suspect.

420
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,089
But everybody that knew him is.

421
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,803
I'll cooperate in anyway I can.

422
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,673
What about your friend?

423
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,889
Oh, she drinks a lot.

424
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,553
We're planning an intervention.

425
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:22,819
- Hm.
- Yeah.

426
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,941
We'll be in contact.

427
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:26,359
Thank you, ma'am.

428
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,979
- What the hell?
- I know!

429
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,469
Who the fuck let the cops in?

430
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,859
Bad move, sister.

431
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,509
What was I supposed to do?

432
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,511
Give a girl some warning, please.

433
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,919
So, how's Bearry working out for ya?

434
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,817
He's been a comfort to
me, unlike some people.

435
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:49,839
Harsh.

436
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,843
You know they don't really think it's you.

437
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,739
They probably do now.

438
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,763
Grab a glass.

439
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:58,910
Oh, quit worrying.

440
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,729
You know you'd be in
silver bracelets right now

441
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,709
if they really thought it was you.

442
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,309
They focused on me.

443
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,729
So cops have to do that.

444
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,780
I mean, they have to weed out the guilty.

445
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:11,499
I just hope I never
have to see them again.

446
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,853
Ugh, yeah.

447
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,403
Mm, he's so comfy.

448
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,469
I know, right?

449
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,729
I could just get drunk all day long

450
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,233
and hang out with Bearry.

451
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,369
Back off, sister, he's mine.

452
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,909
And you know, it's definitely a man.

453
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,099
Just the way he was killed.

454
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,293
Whew, brutal.

455
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How was he killed?

456
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,752
He's here.

457
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,431
Oh, my God, we're in the bedroom.

458
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,718
Who?

459
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,302
- Ah, there he is!
- Oh, my God.

460
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,126
What are you doing here?

461
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:47,152
Oh, I hear you have man issues?

462
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:49,091
- Oh, great.
- I'm here to help.

463
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,500
Is all the wine gone?

464
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:54,291
No, we have a
bunch more bottles inside.

465
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:55,940
- Perfect.
- Ooh, yeah.

466
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,970
How did he die?

467
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,269
He lost his mind.

468
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,720
No, like literally, it
went rolling on the floor.

469
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:11,016
There he is.

470
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:14,223
I need to catch up.

471
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,159
And you know, it definitely wasn't you.

472
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,210
You're not that mean.

473
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,099
Okay, so the first batch didn't work out.

474
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,629
So let's get to the second batch.

475
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,463
- No, no more, please.
- There you go.

476
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,909
- You've done enough.
- Yeah, give me her phone.

477
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,529
What?

478
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,869
Mm hm.

479
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,619
Okay, this is a new dating app.

480
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,020
I found many a cute man
to spend my nights with.

481
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,990
I've already set her up
on a few dates already.

482
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:44,991
Oh, what?

483
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,939
So, I think it would be great
if you were to meet my mom

484
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,636
because she says that if I
find a girl who I really like

485
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:57,309
and makes me happy, I'll
always live in happiness.

486
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,359
And I think you look like my mom,

487
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,419
and I really would like
you to meet my mom.

488
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,993
It would be really nice.

489
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:48,324
$50,000.

490
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,630
What's this?

491
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,670
You marry me, I love you
long time, and you rich.

492
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,329
I like my women like
I like my chocolate.

493
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,723
White, mm.

494
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,499
I just got out of a
really bad relationship,

495
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,819
and I was thinking about you
know, trying dating again.

496
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,020
I can understand that.

497
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,853
So, you wanna try this dating thing?

498
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,690
I don't think so.

499
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,180
Hey, you'd look great as
a leading lady in my film.

500
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,100
But I gotta see the goods first.

501
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,679
Sup?

502
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,689
Name's Duane.

503
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,729
Gotta let you know I saw
you from across the room,

504
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,039
and if you want this to work out,

505
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,279
you're gonna have to start working out.

506
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,936
And that's not a problem
'cause I only charge

507
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:52,099
$100 a session.

508
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,709
And once we get that going and we get you

509
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,666
where I need you to be,
we can start dating,

510
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,135
and we can start dating hard.

511
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,279
Maybe some other time.

512
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,113
For real?

513
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:03,113
These could be yours.

514
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,510
Is it wrong to love somebody so much?

515
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I gotta go.

516
00:34:58,985 --> 00:35:00,529
What are you doing here?

517
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,207
How'd you find me?

518
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,869
I followed you.

519
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,609
Why did you leave me?

520
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,809
I thought things were going great.

521
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,939
You better leave now or
I'm calling the police.

522
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,479
Please don't.

523
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,033
My probation officer
will be very mad at me.

524
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:17,539
Come on.

525
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:20,679
We're perfect together.

526
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
I can feel it.

527
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,743
What are you, some kinda Jedi?

528
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,224
Just give me another chance.

529
00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:30,793
Leave now or I'm calling the cops.

530
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
But I love you.

531
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,263
Leave, now!

532
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,173
Fine, I'll leave.

533
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:43,683
But you're gonna regret it.

534
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:49,096
Oh, God.

535
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,623
Look, I am so sorry.

536
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,070
I thought you'd hit it
off with one of them.

537
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,099
That was the biggest group of losers

538
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,223
I've ever encountered.

539
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,353
You'll find a nice guy.

540
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,793
It just takes time.

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,796
Well, at least I have Bearry.

542
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:33,275
Oh, fuckin' bitch.

543
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,356
Look what she's missing.

544
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,009
So, there's this guy at work who

545
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,773
I really want you to meet.

546
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,919
No, no more help.

547
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,649
Well, what if I told you
that I actually liked him,

548
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,281
but he was just way too nice.

549
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,539
Hm.

550
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,819
Yeah, look, I mean if she
rejected him for being decent,

551
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,899
you might wanna jump on that or I will.

552
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,599
No, I've had enough.

553
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,489
Okay, I just started a fantastic new job,

554
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,053
my divorce is final.

555
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,573
Okay, you guys, I'm happy.

556
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,483
I don't need a man right now.

557
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,182
Besides, I have you two.

558
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,759
Well, what if I told
you that I invited him

559
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,959
here for drinks tonight.

560
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,569
- Mm.
- And if you don't meet him

561
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,547
I'm gonna buy a strap-on for Bearry.

562
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,609
- What?
- Yeah, so you're gonna

563
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,623
meet him and you're gonna like him.

564
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,053
I think you need more wine.

565
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,533
I don't wanna do this.

566
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,343
Just go along with it, okay?

567
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,240
It's not like you have to sleep with him.

568
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:16,229
Come here, come on you go.

569
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,586
Hey, guys, this is Ryan.

570
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,996
- Oh, oh, God.
- He works with me.

571
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,713
Hi, guys, nice to meet you.

572
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:27,896
Hi, I'm Luis.

573
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:29,353
Back off, vulture.

574
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,849
Actually, Luis and I, we
have to go tonight to church-

575
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,850
- The mortuary.

576
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,439
We actually meant we have to go

577
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,460
to the mortuary-
Church.

578
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,289
Okay, come on, Luis.

579
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,299
You entertain my friend here.

580
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,697
Take good care of him.

581
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:51,239
That was subtle.

582
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,879
Well, you know what?

583
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,009
I think they're gonna work out.

584
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,683
He was just too nice for me.

585
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,979
I am so sorry about this.

586
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,130
I didn't know about
this until just before.

587
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,629
It's not your fault.

588
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,773
She is who she is.

589
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,969
Do you wanna have a seat?

590
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,970
Sure.

591
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,000
Well, it is refreshing to work with her.

592
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,551
She always does make you laugh.

593
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,313
You seem like a nice guy.

594
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,480
You don't have to stay.

595
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,150
You seem nice too, and I wanna stay.

596
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,449
So, looks like we're
both stuck here together.

597
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,819
Might as well make the most of it, right?

598
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,970
I'm a really good cook.

599
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,419
So, what do you say I say
thank you for your hospitality

600
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,720
by making you a nice meal?

601
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,169
I don't have anything here to cook.

602
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,559
Okay, well, how about
I take you out to dinner?

603
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,829
You pick the place.

604
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,883
Well, there is this restaurant I go to.

605
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,880
I eat there a lot actually.

606
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,947
May I have the honor of
taking you out to dinner?

607
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,369
I'm sorry for talking so much.

608
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,499
No, no, get it off your chest.

609
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,250
It's not good to hold in bad stuff.

610
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:27,299
Did I say something wrong?

611
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,089
No, it's just the last time I had dinner

612
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,107
with someone it didn't end well.

613
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,244
Well, I'm not that guy.

614
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:42,375
An average guy, not as crazy as Sam.

615
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,010
Thank you.

616
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,755
Can I share something?

617
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:54,094
Please do, I would like that.

618
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,842
Are you guys ready to order?

619
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:59,636
- Yeah, are you ready?
- Yeah.

620
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,194
Thank you.

621
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:16,834
I had a really nice time.

622
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:18,286
I'm so glad.

623
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:19,287
I did too.

624
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,839
Now, I've got a request.

625
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,690
What?

626
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,310
I had a really wonderful time.

627
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:33,478
I'd love to see you again.

628
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,456
I will grant that request.

629
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:10,589
Let me tell you about the best date ever!

630
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,061
I can't believe how kind and gentle he is.

631
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:16,961
This one's a keeper I think.

632
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:20,813
And to think he came from Sam.

633
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:43,599
I had so much fun with you last night.

634
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,267
So, when do I get to see you again?

635
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:49,861
Sounds good.

636
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:58,957
I don't know, nothing.

637
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,113
Hey, Chloe, can I call you back?

638
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Thanks.

639
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,629
You know he didn't
come into work either.

640
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,503
Don't read too much into this.

641
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,179
We hit it off so well.

642
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,869
You actually came through
and found me an awesome guy.

643
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,083
He said he'd call back.

644
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,950
Doesn't seem like the type
of person who plays games.

645
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,179
Is he?

646
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,109
I don't know, he's kind of like a loner.

647
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,863
I think he's the type that
just goes off into nature.

648
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,809
Oh, that reminds me.

649
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,959
Dad wanted to go camping next weekend.

650
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,539
Okay, not now, sweetheart.

651
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,639
I didn't say now.

652
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,329
I said next weekend.

653
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,609
Okay, you know what, Angela?

654
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,619
You're gonna go home, do your chores,

655
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,079
or you're gonna be camping
in your room for a month.

656
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,733
Go.

657
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Seriously?

658
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,199
He's a hippie, he'll call you.

659
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,489
I hope so.

660
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,869
I really liked him.

661
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,139
Let's not focus on him not calling.

662
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,650
Let's celebrate the fact
that he's in your life.

663
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,950
Let's go to your favorite
restaurant tonight.

664
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,099
You really are a good friend.

665
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
Better than Luis?

666
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:52,781
Oh!
Oh!

667
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:54,949
Eh, eh, eh.

668
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,759
Ah, shit.

669
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,039
Poor guy.

670
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,030
Looks like he was on the phone

671
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:02,409
with Chloe before he got butchered.

672
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,129
Well, then, I guess that moves her right

673
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,773
to the top of our list.

674
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,859
Evening, officers.

675
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,910
Is it that obvious?

676
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,422
Well, I guess so.

677
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,269
Ah, and I thought we looked just like

678
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,103
a pair of insurance agents.

679
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:35,969
What can I get you guys to eat?

680
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,995
Donuts.

681
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:39,809
And a cup of coffee please, sweets.

682
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,749
And a little information
on one of your patrons.

683
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,406
Do you know this woman?

684
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:46,937
Um, yeah, she's been in
here from time to time.

685
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:48,929
Oh, my God, that is the girl

686
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,143
that you drool over every time.

687
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:57,179
Well, well, well, that is interesting.

688
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,963
So, you've seen her in here with a man?

689
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,940
- Like a date?
- Yes, like a date.

690
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,309
Perhaps with this person?

691
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,899
Yeah, he's been in here.

692
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,769
That guy is a real piece of work!

693
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,770
Kelly!

694
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,209
I'll check on my tables.

695
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,669
What about him?

696
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,999
What do you know about him?

697
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,403
So she's been in here
with different men?

698
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,363
What can I tell you?

699
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,658
I mean, I didn't talk to them.

700
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:25,552
Did it look like
somebody was getting some?

701
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:27,842
It seemed to be going okay.

702
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:28,843
Huh.

703
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,680
Thank you for the information.

704
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:35,731
We'll be in touch.

705
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,299
Well, well, well.

706
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,129
Hello, Chloe.

707
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,477
What are you guys doing here?

708
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:53,123
We came to sample some local cuisine.

709
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,329
We learned a lot about
this spot, didn't we?

710
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,330
Oh, yeah.

711
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,549
We learned a lot.

712
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,089
Were you here last night
and last Wednesday night?

713
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,186
- Well, I-
- No, she was with me,

714
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:07,070
and another friend.

715
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,293
Now, either arrest her or leave her alone.

716
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,469
- What's going on?
- Don't worry about it.

717
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,470
We'll be in touch.

718
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,101
What did you say to those guys?

719
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:21,030
Nothing.

720
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:23,445
Yeah, well, why are
they acting like that?

721
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:26,059
They asked simple questions,
I gave them simple answers.

722
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,539
They asked about that creep
and then the nice guy.

723
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,729
Who?

724
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,609
The nice guy from the other night.

725
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:32,510
What happened to him?

726
00:47:32,511 --> 00:47:34,269
I don't know, they were
fishing hard for something.

727
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,140
I don't know what it is,

728
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:38,009
but you need to figure out your next move.

729
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,010
Come on, let's go.

730
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,969
Why are they thinking you're involved?

731
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,169
Oh, I don't know.

732
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,289
Maybe because they found
my boss dead right after

733
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,449
I went out to dinner with him?

734
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,799
And now Ryan's missing.

735
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,950
Is there something
you're not telling me?

736
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:58,949
What?

737
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,915
Do you think I had
something to do with this?

738
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,630
I'm not accusing you.

739
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,049
It's just that yes,
first, there's your boss.

740
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,329
Then, there's Ryan.

741
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,180
Is there something you wanna tell me?

742
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,670
I just wanna know what happened to Ryan.

743
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,043
Are you sure there isn't more to this?

744
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,543
Yes, Sam, I'm sure!

745
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:27,794
God.

746
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,939
No, I told you everything.

747
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,689
I met him that one time.

748
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,349
He was a fucking creep and I left.

749
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,579
That's it.

750
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,979
These detectives' questions
are borderline harassment.

751
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,813
All right, sweetheart.

752
00:48:45,814 --> 00:48:48,069
Listen, I believe you and
I love you, you know that,

753
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,483
but I have to ask.

754
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:55,799
Just give me a day and
I'll contact my lawyer.

755
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,599
Okay?
Yeah.

756
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,479
Thank you so much, Sam.
Aw, give me a hug.

757
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,279
It's gonna be all right.

758
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,529
What are you doing here?

759
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,829
I have a key.

760
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,889
This is my house.

761
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,949
Yeah, in all your
attempts to get over me,

762
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,583
you never even thought
to change the locks?

763
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,849
Nice to hear about the investigation.

764
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,359
My lawyer is just gonna love that.

765
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,509
May even renegotiate whose house this is.

766
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,503
Get the fuck out.

767
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,149
Baby, you are never
gonna have it as good

768
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,250
as you had it with me.

769
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,429
You know what?

770
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,899
I found someone better than you.

771
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,549
Oh, please.

772
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,979
Quit showing off.

773
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,659
Nobody cares about you.

774
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,509
All that you have is my house

775
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,679
and that neurotic little friend of yours.

776
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,289
I have someone that cares for me.

777
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,123
Oh, yeah?

778
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,123
What's his name?

779
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,263
- His name?
- Yeah.

780
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,150
His name is Stephen.

781
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:04,879
It's that right there.

782
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,499
Right there, you hesitated.

783
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,333
See, I know you.

784
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:09,503
You are lying.
Fuck you.

785
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,118
I'm gonna need your wedding ring.

786
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,909
See, I fucked up with the new girl.

787
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,779
I accidentally called her the
wrong name in the bedroom,

788
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,549
and I gotta play nice.

789
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,923
Absolutely not!

790
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,376
Tell you what.

791
00:50:26,377 --> 00:50:30,409
Either you give me the
ring or I go tell the cops

792
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,914
that you threatened me with a knife.

793
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:34,947
How do you think that's
gonna go over with 'em?

794
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,289
Yeah.

795
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,989
Yeah, good girl.

796
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,140
That's what I thought.

797
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,630
Found it.

798
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,826
Will she ever fucking grow up?

799
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:26,180
Goddamn teddy bear.

800
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,421
I love you bearry much.

801
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:30,603
Eating alone tonight?

802
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
Yeah.

803
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,430
I like it.

804
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
It's peaceful.

805
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,920
I get to enjoy my meal.

806
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,463
I don't like eating alone.

807
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,452
You'll learn to like it.

808
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:58,489
Hey, Chloe.

809
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,490
How are you doing?

810
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,430
I'm feeling kinda down.

811
00:55:04,712 --> 00:55:06,712
Let me buy you dinner.

812
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,963
That's my boy.

813
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,099
It's good to see you laugh.

814
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,499
Yeah, there hasn't been
much laughing lately.

815
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,400
Come on, there's plenty to laugh at.

816
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,780
Stephen, I'm done.

817
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,573
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

818
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:04,229
Good night, Kelly.

819
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,249
See you tomorrow.
Good night.

820
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,750
I'm sure it will be.

821
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:17,133
Would you like to go out with me?

822
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,278
That would be nice.

823
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,853
I feel used.

824
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,119
You looked so peaceful.

825
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,829
I didn't wanna wake you.

826
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,319
So what is this?

827
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,933
A wham, bam, thank you, ma'am?

828
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,600
I'll come by later for
dinner if that's okay.

829
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,163
I'd love that.

830
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,483
Hey, that's my shirt!

831
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,320
Mm, I love you, Bearry.

832
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,333
I love you bearry much.

833
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,319
I think I finally met the right one.

834
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,379
Stephen and Chloe.

835
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,230
It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

836
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,150
I'm really falling for him.

837
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,710
All right.

838
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,243
Thanks.

839
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:30,963
What am I doing?

840
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:34,129
I don't even like these kinda girls.

841
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,833
She's, she's too young.

842
01:00:38,924 --> 01:00:40,463
Oh, but she makes me laugh.

843
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,493
Who am I kidding?

844
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,919
I love her.

845
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,643
What the hell?

846
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,960
First the boss, then the
date, now an ex-husband.

847
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,760
You reckon we got enough
evidence now to arrest her?

848
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,123
Oh, yeah.

849
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Good.

850
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Let's do it.

851
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,479
Hey, Stephen, it's Chloe again.

852
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,959
I've been trying to ahold of
you for the past few hours.

853
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,610
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

854
01:01:55,788 --> 01:01:56,724
Bearry?

855
01:01:56,725 --> 01:01:59,546
I love you bearry much.

856
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:01,504
Bearry?

857
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:53,454
- What are you doing here?
- That fucking teddy bear.

858
01:02:55,582 --> 01:02:56,582
Chloe!

859
01:02:58,883 --> 01:03:01,447
Get!

860
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:12,039
What the fuck are you talking about?

861
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,099
There is nothing wrong
with this bear, okay?

862
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,659
He's fine, look at him.

863
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,510
He's fine.

864
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:17,826
He's just a bear.

865
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,519
I don't understand you guys.

866
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,960
It's just Bearry, okay?

867
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:26,834
- Come on, come on.
- No!

868
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:29,770
I love you bearry much.

869
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,223
Hey, Chloe, have you seen my mom?

870
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,284
Mom?

871
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,432
Mom?

872
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:54,769
Mom!

873
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,203
Mom, are you okay?

874
01:04:56,204 --> 01:04:57,204
Mom!

875
01:04:58,485 --> 01:05:00,438
- Angela.
- Mom!

876
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,400
My beautiful daughter.

877
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:05,983
How was camping?
Mom, what?

878
01:05:05,984 --> 01:05:07,997
Mom, what happened to you?

879
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:08,998
Mom?

880
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:11,341
Mom?

881
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:13,158
Someone help!

882
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,239
Are you okay?

883
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Thank you.

884
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:14,693
Okay, try it.

885
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,260
It's not working.

886
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,433
All right, how about now?

887
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,380
Nothing.

888
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,248
All right, one more time.

889
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:40,794
What happened last night?

890
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:43,204
It's a teddy bear!

891
01:06:43,205 --> 01:06:44,288
Oh, my God.

892
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,363
Oh, my God, she's got a gun.

893
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:49,613
Hey, I've seen you.

894
01:06:50,696 --> 01:06:53,609
Wait, you're the lady
from the restaurant.

895
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,389
There's a teddy bear trying to kill you,

896
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,516
and you're worried
about who the fuck I am!

897
01:06:58,517 --> 01:07:00,487
Wait, it killed her
friend, it stabbed me,

898
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:02,089
and it tried to rape her.

899
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,873
It's killed everyone around us.

900
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,343
We have to get as far
away from here as we can.

901
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,633
Come on, let's go!

902
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:36,059
Goddammit!

903
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,573
We're not going anywhere.

904
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:40,203
Can you fix it?

905
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,179
Not without my tools.

906
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,461
'Cause I've been working on
it when all this shit started.

907
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,699
You know, this might just work.

908
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,963
I mean, we're out in
the middle of nowhere.

909
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,449
Bearry might not be able to find us.

910
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,999
Let's go.

911
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Where?

912
01:07:59,605 --> 01:08:01,882
I know a hunter's shack nearby.

913
01:08:01,883 --> 01:08:03,383
There may be some tools there.

914
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,740
I'll go fist.

915
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:15,299
Do you think she's
using him to get away?

916
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,300
Has to be.

917
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,225
She's running out of options.

918
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:20,959
She knows she's about to be exposed.

919
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,113
Yeah, yeah.

920
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,529
I just don't get it.

921
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:29,563
I mean, she seemed like a
perfectly normal person.

922
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,209
What do you think makes
someone do something like this?

923
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,343
Man, people snap.

924
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,660
Yeah.

925
01:09:37,476 --> 01:09:40,444
This ain't going anywhere soon.

926
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:43,195
Let's just go a little further.

927
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,510
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, stop, stop.

928
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:51,405
Over there.

929
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:56,201
I'll be damned.

930
01:09:56,202 --> 01:09:59,607
That looks like our Hummer.

931
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,950
Let's go get her.

932
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,350
Let's finish this.

933
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,620
Hello?

934
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,045
Is anybody here?

935
01:10:38,513 --> 01:10:41,682
Sit.

936
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:45,189
I don't think anybody lives here.

937
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,190
I know this place.

938
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:52,193
It used to be a testing site for MK Ultra.

939
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,040
It's abandoned.

940
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,560
I don't see any lights.

941
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:02,702
Ah, I go outside and try
and see if there's like

942
01:11:02,703 --> 01:11:06,339
a generator or a breaker or something.

943
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,390
Be careful.

944
01:11:35,222 --> 01:11:36,972
What is this place?

945
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:44,348
Ah, bingo.

946
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,788
Ah, let's see.

947
01:12:08,688 --> 01:12:10,893
- Oh.
- Oh, much better.

948
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
I don't see any tools.

949
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,637
Did you see any fuel outside?

950
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:43,634
Yeah, there's a bunch
of cans by the generator.

951
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:45,533
Okay, let's build a fire.

952
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:06,679
Where'd you learn to
build a fire like that?

953
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,299
You've never been camping?

954
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,769
No, I never got the chance to go,

955
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,827
but I've always wanted to.

956
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:17,460
When all this is over,
I'll take you camping.

957
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:20,980
Sorry about your friends.

958
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:25,982
There will be more.

959
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,447
They can hide like a government fly.

960
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,240
Government?

961
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,660
Fly.

962
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,793
They program them to spy on us.

963
01:13:44,693 --> 01:13:45,693
Okay.

964
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,103
How can he be stopped?

965
01:13:53,747 --> 01:13:55,923
Bearry was a gift
after my daughter died.

966
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,853
He's killed everyone around me.

967
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,100
How?

968
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,140
He was just a normal teddy bear

969
01:14:08,829 --> 01:14:11,223
till I said those magical words.

970
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:15,283
I love you bearry much.

971
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,043
He went from being just
a normal teddy bear,

972
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,593
to being alive.

973
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,241
I just wanna know how.

974
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,729
I don't know.

975
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,549
I've been trying to stop him ever since

976
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,879
I realized what he was.

977
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,569
He always chooses new owners.

978
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,739
Yeah, me.

979
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,777
Not just you.

980
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,943
Bearry's killed many families.

981
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,713
You're just next in line.

982
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:47,729
Between him and the reptilians,

983
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,716
I don't know who's killed more.

984
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:50,617
Reptilians?

985
01:14:50,618 --> 01:14:52,809
Are you fucking crazy?

986
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:56,513
Oh, no, they're building
a new master race.

987
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,515
I don't even know what to make of that.

988
01:15:00,516 --> 01:15:03,529
Look, we have to prepare.

989
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,853
We're not leaving.

990
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,617
How are we going to stop him?

991
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:10,351
How do you kill a teddy bear?

992
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:12,710
With a toy gun?

993
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:19,210
No, we kill him with fire.

994
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:22,443
I love you bearry much.

995
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,643
Go, go, save yourselves.

996
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:27,644
Get the fuck outta here.

997
01:15:29,746 --> 01:15:32,079
Come on, you fucking fucker!

998
01:16:15,044 --> 01:16:19,662
He's right there!

999
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:21,163
Run, run, come on.

1000
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,816
Is she dead?

1001
01:16:31,817 --> 01:16:32,750
Oh, shit.

1002
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:36,304
Oh, no!

1003
01:16:41,485 --> 01:16:42,698
Chloe, run!

1004
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,010
Get outta here!

1005
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:19,570
Oh, man.

1006
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:21,892
Stephen, don't die.

1007
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:30,362
What happened?

1008
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:33,176
You're alive.

1009
01:17:33,177 --> 01:17:34,344
We have to go.

1010
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:38,961
Can you move?

1011
01:17:38,962 --> 01:17:39,962
Yeah.

1012
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:48,249
I love you bearry much.

1013
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,580
That's enough, Bearry!

1014
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:51,581
Stop it!

1015
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:54,926
Please, stop this!

1016
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:57,886
I love you bearry much.

1017
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,570
I love you too, Bearry.

1018
01:18:00,571 --> 01:18:02,738
But you have to stop this.

1019
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:04,575
Please.

1020
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:08,159
For me.

1021
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:13,422
I, I, love you,
be, be, bearry much, much.

1022
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:30,018
I'm sorry.

1023
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,653
Shit, it's a real fuckin' teddy bear.

1024
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:05,547
No one's gonna
believe this shit, right?

1025
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:08,798
Man, I don't even believe it.

1026
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,389
Oh, sorry, my bad.

1027
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:30,432
I just wanted to make sure it was...

1028
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,585
It's a teddy bear.

1029
01:19:32,586 --> 01:19:35,038
Come on, we should take
you to the hospital.

1030
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:37,446
What about everything that happened?

1031
01:19:37,447 --> 01:19:40,637
Ain't nobody gonna believe
there was a real teddy bear.

1032
01:19:40,638 --> 01:19:42,188
Nobody can believe this shit.

1033
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,521
You ring it in.

1034
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:49,437
Why I always gotta ring it
in and look like the idiot?

1035
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:50,838
Why you can't ring it in this time?

1036
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,753
- Is it over?
- It's over.

1037
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,340
Let's get outta here.

1038
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,940
I love you.

1039
01:20:02,418 --> 01:20:07,418
I love you too.
