"Shark Swarm"

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,389
All creatures
we live in this world

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:30,386
We are in balance, with the system

5
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,257
But there are some things

6
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,360
It is a fragile planet

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,262
And this will bring consequences

8
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,333
This will lead us to disaster

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,505
If we do not learn from our mistakes

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,378
The next time we are not surprised

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,294
Do not finish yet?

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,238
You can not have it both contaminate

13
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,332
And now you say that you have conscience?

14
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,300
If I have, all the polluted ocean

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,313
And kill everything

16
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,244
What part does not understand?

17
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,404
Well, now you should just
you mind if something happens

18
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,279
I thought you were gonna take it

19
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,441
If that happens it will do

20
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,224
Well, because this annoying

21
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,351
While not finish

22
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,257
I need you to go and check

23
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,456
We can not miss it

24
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,364
That is very close to the coast

25
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,356
People would see us

26
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:54,362
No matter, is not expected to
No one goes next week

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,305
It is supposed to be closed

28
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,941
You know how much of that thing, will affect?

29
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,506
I do not think that plan is good idea

30
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,312
I hope you like mojarte

31
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,442
Why?

32
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,221
He says he will have to do it

33
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,280
But the water is frozen down there

34
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,446
It is not my problem

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,260
So you freeze, I do not mind

36
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,355
You have to meet
Your responsibilities

37
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,330
And what will you do?

38
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,459
I once dire
but before hit

39
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,426
Get out of here

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:08,475
And go

41
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,310
Mom relax

42
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,511
Now I am ready

43
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,486
Another beautiful day for fishing

44
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,328
I do not recall a season better than this

45
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,371
Has improved by 70% to the last

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:39,310
All the fishermen mention it

47
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:46,249
In this city occurred
a kind of miracle

48
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,451
And this shining a beautiful day

49
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:58,286
It's great to be discovered
Other ways to survive

50
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,225
And now let's see sports

51
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,369

35 thousand gallons

55
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,357
It's much gas

56
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:28,522
And

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,332
Good morning

I did not know we had to clean it

71
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,484
Do not worry, no damage

72
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,326
Do not worry about the police

73
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,286
Everything is out of control

74
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,498
So that is what we have to do?

75
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,336
And do not close it?

76
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,466

With all the skills
that a guy like you have

86
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,243

As you said and I love you '

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,860
About 200 times last night

00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,262
It was a beautiful night

116
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,323

The lawyer brought another copy of the contract

122
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,482

Beware there

131
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,339
That is

132
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,251
Here we go

133
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,353
How this fishing?

134
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,491
In fact today I plan to send other things

135
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,436
It does not seem happy

136
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,444
We will aver morning

137
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,292
Walter spoke hello

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,388
We will be within 2 days

139
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:20,527
Both are invited

140
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,464
If, as we saw yesterday I arrived the letter

141
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,200
Yes, I think we should
sit down and talk

142
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,400
I have classes all day

143
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,436
See you then I see you

144
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,411

You see my hands tied? Come

146
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,416
Another beautiful Sunday

147
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,256
It could be at home, watching the match

148
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,453
Enjoying my day

149
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,489
But here I am

150
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:32,437
Hey, we have already done this,
so we do it again

151
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,304
Well, better take care because

152
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,308
After this

153
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,309
I am not sure about returning to work

154
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,436
Stop whining, we should do

155
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,244
If you already understand

156
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,283
Let us do it

157
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,436
When you see notices

158
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,281
They are in a hole

159
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,340
I see nothing

160
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,350
There's a lot of rubbish

161
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:29,353
It is one of the worst jobs

162
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,364
Then relax

163
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:38,333
This will give me cancer or something

164
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,235
Relax

165
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,242
Oh here this

166
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,311
I see

167
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,246
You know to do

168
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,448
Damn this hard

169
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,256
Come do it with force

170
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,346
Keep your eyes open

171
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,480
Hey

172
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,360
That makes it better

173
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,330
There is something very unusual here

174
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,227
There is something in the water

175
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,271
E slo I hear

176
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,285
These strings are broken

177
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,390
When was the last
go grab it?

178
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,356
They are the sharks

179
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,296
Okay sweetheart, you look anxious

180
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,492
These are the things that are changing rapidly

181
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,503
You know as

182
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:56,263
Happens when something comes to town

183
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,410
I hope you surf better of it

184
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:09,481
Relax

185
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,344
Sorry brother

186
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,518
It looks like a child breast

187
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,268
I'm fine

188
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,534
Newcomers to the city? If

189
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,265
And since we seem silly

190
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,365
My name is Cree

191
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,379
Anyone who tries to kill me is wizer

192
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,240
Hi I'm kim and she's my mom

193
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,316
Nice to know

194
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,318
And what about you?

195
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,287
Surfing?

196
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,483
I'd rather be on earth

197
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,453
Well we're going to the beach looks like a good day

198
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,430
Look

199
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,287
Such a look

200
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,433
It will be a busy day

201
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,493
Rock n roll

202
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,461
So we are certainly

203
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,363
Okay, if we have time

204
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,334
There are good waves for uans
there if they want to see them

205
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,413
You said that?

206
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,308
This is what I hear

207
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,316
Y?

208
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,421
See you later

209
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,452
It looks very nice, as your father

210
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:26,492
What?

211
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,264
What I said?

212
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,330
Hey I should be reviewed

213
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,242
It is what I see

214
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,435
Down here

215
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,377
He is diget

216
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,446
Just repeats the same thing over and over again

217
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,385
What are you going to do?

218
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:08,262
Last week we discussed
the oil on beaches

219
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,466
Look what they did
to nature in the 70

220
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,248
And so far are contaminated

221
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:22,353
You can not clean these shores

222
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,258
Then came pesticides,

223
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,293
Bacterial contamination

224
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,364
Creating toxic substances

225
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,365
Who kill to complete species

226
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,393
And what effect would have on us?

227
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:46,433
We are just at the
stage to clean these areas

228
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:52,375
For these reasons there are oceans

229
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,349
Deserts on the planet

230
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,254
Which affect not only
endangered species

231
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,225
If that does not cause behavioral patterns

232
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,387
In marine species that are adapted

233
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,427
In these conditions

234
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,260
Full costs may change

235
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,428
You can do it, we

236
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,274
Nice work, this finish line

237
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,302
Good job!

238
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:22,508
See you on Friday

239
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,413
Hi heather

240
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,486
Your mom comes a little late, I guess

241
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,454
You do not want to at least try to mojarte?

242
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,491
There is ugly

243
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,235
I tell you something

244
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,343
What if your feet just mojas

245
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:53,506
Be nice?

246
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,244
I promise you do not kill

247
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,526
We're doing very well

248
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,268
Your mother is very proud

249
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,462
You see

250
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,432
There is nothing to fear

251
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,286
Just jump

252
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,487
Salt water now!

253
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,307
Hence these sweetheart

254
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,471
Look at these wet

255
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,474
Be ready for
beach party tomorrow

256
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,344
Ralph Ok, I'm picking up, and I'm going

257
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,482
Mom is something we do not have time sweetheart

258
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,450
If I feel I need a favor

259
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,486
Mum there's something in the water

260
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,431
Mom is talking darling mama!

261
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,457
Honey, I said silence!

262
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,436
Mom! I said silence

263
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,468
If you need more people to what I thought

264
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,421
A state and the entire month

265
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,349
Something is wrong

266
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:51,490
What do you do?

267
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,457
Go north

268
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,231
Ok, what direction is it?

269
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,497
North

270
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,375
There's nothing there,
we are losing time

271
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:17,352
I say we surrender and embrigaremos

272
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,482
Ok, you're right

273
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,418
Come and be back in the morning

274
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,287
Meanwhile I need another beer

275
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,495
Hell no more beer

276
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,405
I remember that there are two wiskies down there

277
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,372
Poe now so you understand

278
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,293
Hurry up jorge

You'll feel so good morning

282
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,513
I do not understand the people

283
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,416
The worst thing is that neither you understand yourself

284
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,392
And it's for you

285
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,462
What the hell is that?

286
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,423
It can be a noise

287
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:42,395
Probably nothing, a
After me away from the coast

288
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,416

00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,378
There is something

290
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,513

Brothers, God has been generous

296
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,310

Grandma said you were going

They are not even tell mom and dad

304
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,451
And what are you waiting for?

305
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,452
Papaya is enough strsado

306
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,260
The idea that his only daughter

307
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,492
Go to college so far

308
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,465
It could kill him

309
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:54,268
Have to tell afternoon

310
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:59,232
By the way I saw that someone you smiling

I think it has a
little interest in you

312
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,372
Grandmother

313
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,347
These blush

314
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,436
Hey teacher wanted to see me

315
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,416
Yes, I was watching your plan
for the next semester

316
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,378
This is so cool

317
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,384
My dad used to collect

318
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,523
All these things are fantastic

319
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,390
The molagro of the microsfot
you can have it all

320
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,402
I keep a few things about

321
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,295
What is

322
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,408
In fact

323
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:11,404
I have access to a sitema
developed by NASA

324
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,286
I can see the coast from here

325
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,287
The government has satellite

326
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,291
They see there is something to show

327
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,465
Without this there is no investors

328
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,435
People look from
their windows to the coast

329
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,349
People have a price

330
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,446
You, me, the people, pay much

331
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,257
Your job is to find him ok?

332
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,422

00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,453
Luce face

00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,380
Certainly the power of this
delighted to be with a

349
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,342
Happy to be here

350
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:59,445
Being on the coast gave me
strange behavior

351
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,350
So I'm happy to be back

352
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,326
Here we are

353
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,232
This is what I want to show

354
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,402
It is a lovely sight,
but already seen before and the

355
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,391

356
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,461
Yes, I know

357
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:20,266
I have a boat with which
I want to explore the coast

358
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,247
This is my last look
research work

359
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,217
I can do much,

360
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,345
But I need someone with experience

361
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,376
Working in the field

362
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:34,357
I want to be my
bequeathed to the university

363
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,385
And I want to work with me

364
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,363
It would be an honor

365
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,297
Thank you

It has some other familiar
who are interested?

368
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,532
Sure, my brother

369
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,275
He knows most of these waters
that anyone in the city

370
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,277
Sounds perfect tell me more

371
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,471
It's my older brother so it's good

372
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:03,320
Give him unlimited access

373
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,515
I need to see their support environmental,

374
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,291
His building permit

375
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,349
And their records of construction also

376
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,284
You show everything

377
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,487
Anything that serves

378
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,297
Sure, but it is a
determination that I did

379
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:21,432
So I have no problem
that is not? For nothing

380
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:28,278
What vere in two hours

381
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,441
If this well because

382
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,343
Handle with care

383
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,482
Because it will be well over north

384
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,427
Here is another

385
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,459
We would eat? No

386
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,285
What happened?

387
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,451
It seems that something step

388
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,262
No boats, to stay

389
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:25,233
A storm is approaching
want not

390
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,395
Come north

391
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,499
Ok captain

392
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,318
The coast is near

393
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:24,320
Something can be toxic salirte other ear

394
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,334
She is the girl

395
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,460
Apology

396
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,440
Today you did

397
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,308
If I was going

398
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,318
You came to see me?

399
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,478
And would like

400
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,382
So give me lessons?

401
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,386
I can teach some things

402
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,432
Then you may return tomorrow

403
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,527
See you

404
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,491

00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,370
Daniel with walter

407
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,510
Just came second

408
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,411
Good work

409
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,322
That's all we looked

410
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:43,473
I had a strange
Registration of a building

411
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,339
I'm not sure that is

412
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,410
Hence this

413
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:57,276
There are some things that always avoids

414
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,481
- While I do not see these records
- Yes, but everything is fine

415
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,361
Sorry, I have to see them

416
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,354
See if historiam
nisquiera this operable

417
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,268
Do not be sitting here my last years

418
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,238
Well

419
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:20,505
I guess that is occupied

420
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,374
Vista casual

421
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:38,227
This is a cookie that is stressed out

422
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,285
And under experiment

423
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,230
We got water in the last week

424
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,271
What is special?
Those with their babies

425
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,397
Lately has been increased

426
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,510
His agresivida of all
species of this coast

427
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,315
If you follow me please

428
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,279
To observe their behavior

429
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,220
Water samples are
where the poor swimming

430
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,457
Have been analyzed and are contaminated

431
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,397
It is disgusting and unforgivable

432
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:22,195
If someone does something to
This kind of returns

433
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,474
It is one of the species that are most

434
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,347
What is this triangle?

435
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,375
It is one that stretches from the coast

436
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,387
In a san francisco california

437
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,321
All the human component

438
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,494
Will be in consideration for fun

439
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:56,372
Well continuing the journey

440
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,309
Agarrense

441
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,250
What the hell was that? Not

442
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,352
I saw something before hitting

443
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,420
Bear with me cuidaod
boat, I do not want holes

444
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:13,484
What the hell is that?

445
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,417
It's a whale

446
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,487
It has been bitten to death

447
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,264
Who would have much force?

448
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,300
So who did it?

449
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,363
One of the big sharks that you see

450
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,441
Something is not right

451
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,260
It is very grand epar
take it, just bring it

452
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,344
Thanks good bye

453
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,409
When you got for me?

454
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,320
A bit of this, of what

455
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,457
A small

456
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,327
I have to clean all this disaster

457
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,266
On my first date 1969

458
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,360
Only me and other people -69?

459
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,338
Some things change

460
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,401
No one cares about
the middle these days

461
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:44,403
Well nobody cares
and for the environment

462
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,353
It seems that nobody cares

463
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,511
To protect the environment

464
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,289
It looks like a treasure,

465
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,350
Let me give you the money that I owe you

466
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,389
We will do a good deal

467
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,300
You know it is?

468
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,272
Hey boss watch to watch

469
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,243
Should be empty

470
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,443
Is monic

471
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,351
I want to go slowly take a look

472
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,445
Chief, what happens?

473
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,482
He would like to know

474
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,370
Hey, I can deal with your ship?

475
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,464
This quiet, I will go to see

476
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,445
Get out and see me

477
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,291
Hear that was
busy for some time

478
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,450
Coming

479
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,476
Looks like we have here a leak

480
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,421
It smells bad

481
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,352
It could be worse

482
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,243
You're a fisherman, you should not frighten it

483
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,388
This is fucking

484
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,355
It will not go anywhere now

485
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,459
This jammed

486
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,421
That look went for help

487
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,492
So you can enter

488
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,400
You probably already left

489
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:24,333
Return to the city and
brings help, I am

490
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,275
That's risky, you can plunge

491
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,471
Trust me, and spent the night in boats Worst

492
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:37,409
Ok, I'll come back with those you love

493
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:45,325
If you need a new,
because it seems broken

494
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,332
Your husband should be
worried about you

495
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,234
It is not safe

496
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,532
Thanks for worry,
if you have something to say

497
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,274
Tell my husband

498
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,366

00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:03,378

500

And this is ...

502
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,516
My boss wants to have lunch with you tomorrow

503
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,356
Why me?

504
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,357

Cool thanks.

518
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,500

Ok, be careful.

Sabias que mi papá

547

Claro que si, sería el

Ni siquiera te fijaste en mi cabello.

561
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,307
Lo note, pero me preocupa,

562
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,384

00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,280
Algo cool como yo

575
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,407
Ok

576
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,284
Déjame ver dónde esta tu abuela

577
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,521
- Cual es tu nombre?
- Qué tal si te lo digo mañana?

578
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,259
Mismo lugar misma hora

579
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,226
Buenas noches

580
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,341
Hola ya te vas?

581
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,506
Tengo clase mañana,

582
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,273
Mentes frescas no quiero estar ebrio

583
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:32,411
Mama aun sigue aquí

584
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,290
Ya se que hay alguien interesado

585
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,361
Si, ya sabia que había algo.

586
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,389
Has visto a dan? No

587
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,456
Se supone que nos ibamos

588
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,500
A encontrar pero no aparece

589
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,496
Si aparece dile que estube aquí

590
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:19,461
Aquí tiene -Gracias

591
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:29,335
Su cabello luce adorable

592
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,279
Pues gracias

593
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,248
Hey dame una mano

594
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:03,279
Hoy s eencontró un animal
en la arena fuera del agua

595
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,264
Daniel esta afuera,

596
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,233
Encontramos un bote abandonado,

597
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,359
Debemos ayudarlo

598
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,300
Despacio, dónde esta Daniel?

599
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,303
Ok, dame las coordenadas, iré a traerlo

600
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,271
Bien, iré contigo

601
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,334
Esta bien

602
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,444
Aun voy

603
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,502
También voy

604
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,374
Seguro que todo estará bien

605
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,252
Debe estar por aquí

606
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,519
Dan soy broke

607
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:35,271
Esta bien, ya estoy bien,

608
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,334
Los guardacostas ya están
buscando por los chicos

609
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,277
Creo que ay se donde están

610
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,440
Que dices?

611
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,314
Qué quieres decir?

612
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,443
Siento escuchar lo de nick

613
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,513
Lo siento jefe, el insistió.

614
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:58,222
Alguien tenia que salvarte

615
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:02,493
Escucha, algo no esta bien,
hasta tu puedes notarlo

616
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:07,234
Por lo que veo, quedarte
aquí fue tu propia culpa

617
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,498
Si sigues el programa no deberías

618
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,238
Haber echado la roja

619
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:13,401
Te dire que mi barco
haría mas de lo que el tuyo

620
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,307
En una semana

621
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,275
Deberías agradecer que haya venido

622
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,312
A salvar tu trasero

623
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,445
Lo que sea que lo mato, sigue en el agua

624
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,457
Hay algo que hablar
cuando lleguemos a casa

625
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,302
Hello

626
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,462
Buenos días

627
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,240
Te despertaste temprano

628
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,276
Dormiste bien

629
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:26,248
No puedo esperar que
lo pongas en su lugar

630
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,319
Eso fue de miedo

631
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,449
Tal ves deberías ir a la ciudad

632
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,423
Qué?

633
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:40,259
Y perderme la oportunidad
de verte luchar, no!

634
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,354
No lo creo

635
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,458
Estaré a tu lado.

636
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,233
Ok, pelearé

637
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,440
- Puedo habalrle un minuto?
- Ahí estas, que sorpresa

638
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,348
No le quitaré mucho
tiempo -Siéntate por favor.

639
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:36,513
Qué pasa?

640
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,482
- Es acerca de la temporada?
- Cómo adivina?

641
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,492
Qué hay de esa?

642
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,354
No sospecha nada de eso?

643
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,366
Por que deberías sospechar?

644
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,460
No piensa que es obvio
que quiera comprar

645
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,259
Todas las propiedades de aquí?

646
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,339
Pronto todo será suyo, es lo que quiere?

647
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,239
Quiero lo mejor para la ciudad.

648
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,436
Quiero saber si sabe lo que es eso

649
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,242
Vamos dani, no es justo

650
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,374
Piensa que su compania

651
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,248
Tiene buenos intereses en esata ciudad?

652
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,480
Dani al menos has
considerado su oferta? If

653
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,291
La considere -Y? --
La respuesta es no

654
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,453
Este negocio significa
mucho dinero para la ciudad

655
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,493
Y sabes que la pesca esta mal

656
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,268
Así que porque no salir
mientras se esta bien?

657
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,330
No me parece correcto ni a mi familia

658
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:36,343
Hara condominios
alrededor y se irá la pesca

659
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:40,248
Sabes que esto de
pescar no es desarrollo

660
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,280
Eso rompe mi corazón.

661
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,377
Es mucho dinero dani

662
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,356
Lo que veo es un hombre

663
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,349
Cque trata de comprar toda una ciudad

664
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,453
Y que la ciudad es tan
estúpida o desesperada

665
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,463
Como para decir no

666
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,266
En serio quiero que reconsideres

667
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,325
Disfrute su desayuno

668
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,224
Bienvenido

669
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,532
Es gracioso que el
gobernador me diga eso

670
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,238
Cuál es su palabra favorita?

671
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:43,277
Su palabra favorita

672
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:49,274
Es vecindario, porque
simboliza comunidad

673
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,283
Y ahí no hay egoísmo

674
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,258
Un espíritu generoso

675
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:06,369
Y e slo que veo y experimento
todos los días aquí

676
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,334
Con toda esta gente

677
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,338
Y puedo verlos ahora

678
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,372
Me gustaría pedirles permiso

679
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,434
Para que haga mi residencia aquí

680
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:26,321
Diculpe sr, viendo el
potencial de la comunidad

681
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,256
El Sr. Daniel señoras y señores

682
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,489
Solo quiero saber si
alguien en este cuarto

683
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,425
Ha visto el plan que este hombre

684
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,234
A puesto en la comunidad?

685
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,235
Vamos usted es el alcalde

686
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:46,401
Si ven su plan veran que quiere quitar

687
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,511
Todo lo que hace de nuestra
comunidad lo que es hoy

688
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:55,477
Ve a nuestra ciudad como
una tienda en el camino

689
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:59,352
Que ahora el quiere sacar todo

690
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,379
Es lo que esta haciendo

691
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:05,292
Todos los que están acá tienen opinión

692
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:09,355
Por qué no dejamos a alguien mas hablar?

693
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,367
Alguien una opinión mas

694
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,426
Gracias dave, esuchenlo

695
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,368
Siéntate!

696
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:19,307
Hemos esperado toda la vida por algo así

697
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,402
Dani metete el dinero al bolsillo

698
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:26,371
Trato de tenerlo en tu
bolsillo donde pertenece

699
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:31,285
Podemos mantener esto
en un tono civilizado?

700
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:37,315
Déjame clararte algo?
Todos los que firmaron

701
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,420
Están en el juego

702
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,454
Tienen empleos también

703
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,323
Nos quedaremos aquí

704
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,494
Y esperamos un nuevo futuro

705
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,332
Estos planes no se
pueden implementar ahora

706
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:57,275
No se pueden implementar sin tu firma

707
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,239
Sabes que tu firma se lo de mi firma

708
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,251
Eso requiere sacrificio

709
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,320
Dejanos sacrificarnos

710
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,344
Deja que mi hermano diga algo?

711
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:12,517
Si yo no firmo, también
enviaras que me amenazen?

712
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:18,299
No simplemente pueden considerarlo?

713
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:21,327
Ustedes no entienden

714
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,235
Este hombre les promete mucho hoy

715
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,468
Ustedes solo firmaron,
como buenos perros

716
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,342
Thank you

717
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,378
El habla del futuro

718
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,479
A el no le improta
nuestro futuro o legado

719
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,280
Quiere comprarnos, hacer
sus condominios y es todo

720
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,393
Escuchen lo que dice

721
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:51,355
Creo que todos aquí ya tienen claro

722
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:55,461
Algunos no vemos la forma en que es

723
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,336
A otros no les importa lo que piensen

724
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:03,334
Todos en este cuarto,
excpeto por mi o hermano

725
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,347
Hemos firmado el contrato sin leerlo

726
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:12,487
Les moestrare lo que
deben hacer con el contrato

727
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,353
Lo que hago con el mío

728
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,448
Es de lo que hablo

729
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,318
Es un documento

730
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,363
Es lo único que te pedimos

731
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,397
Tenemos algo que hablar

732
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,431
Dani no puedes hacer eso cada vez

733
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:30,466
Que alguien no esta de acuerdo contigo

734
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,339
Debes regresar con esa ciudad

735
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,310
No puedes enojarte

736
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,471
Qué hago entonces?,estoy
abierto a sugerencias

737
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,469
Porfavor sugiereme

738
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,414
Deja de actuar como un niño

739
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,477
Es desesperante -Tiene razón

740
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,412
Si sigues así toda la ciudad nos odiará

741
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,357
Bien, ahora estoy de tu lado

742
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,256
Me vas a mirar así todo
el día o vamos a trabajar?

743
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,330
Hola, cómo estas?

744
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:11,310
Cómo están? Están geniales

745
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,475
Bueno dales mis saludos
- Lo haré

746
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:20,387
Bien trataré de verlos algún día

747
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,413
Gracias -Adiós

748
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,374
Puedo ayudarla con algo?

749
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:19,277
Si, bueno estoy buscando,

750
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,408
Usted cree poder llevarme?

751
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,344
Porfavor

752
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,391
Conduciré

753
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:32,259
Thank you

754
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,335
Cómo estas?

755
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,531
No tenemos vavaciones, debemos seguir

756
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,509
Es difícil de decirlo

757
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,312
Encontré algunos problemas

758
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,380
Supongo que debe informar

759

Pero esta no es así

835
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,433
Es porque es de un tiburon tigre

01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,301
Y la otra de uno blanco

837
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,400

Muchos de todos los tamaños? -Si

839
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,281
Significa que el tuyo es
3 veces mas grande que este

840
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,474
Es un gran pez

841
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:13,515

01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:26,481

Pienso que hay un sentido de lugar aquí

882
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:52,312
Me ve como una clase de villano

883
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:56,283
El tienenun buen carácter

884
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,251
Es un alivio

885
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:05,520
Encontré un número aquí
que puede haber una razón

886
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:15,293
Si no me cree, le quiero mostrar algo

887
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:20,272

No puedo decir que fué un ejemplo

896
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:26,398
Tienen que tener cuidado

897
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,334
Y no se averguencen
si tienen miedo abajo

898
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,504

899
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,310
