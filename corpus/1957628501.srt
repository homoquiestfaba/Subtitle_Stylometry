00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,291
-Thank you.
-Would you like something else?

3
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,332
No. No, no, not just yet. I'm waiting.

4
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,707
I'm expecting someone.

5
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,374
Would this be one of your regular haunts?

6
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,041
I don't have any regular haunts.

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,874
Let me see it.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,832
Sometimes I imagine
I still feel it around my neck.

9
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,541
I carried it for so many years.

10
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,041
How does it feel around yours?

11
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,041
We can free each other of it.

12
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,707
Love to chatter, don't they,
our Muggle friends.

13
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,207
Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,124
What you're doing is madness.

15
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,541
It's what we said we'd do.

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,832
-I was young. I was...
-Committed.

17
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,291
To me.

18
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,903
To us.

19
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:08,994
No, I went along because...

20
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,002
Because?

21
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:14,069
Because I was in love with you.

22
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,972
Yes.

23
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,374
But that's not why you went along.

24
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,874
It was you who said
we could reshape the world.

25
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,707
That it was our birthright.

26
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,749
Can you smell it? The stench.

27
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,957
Do you really intend
to turn your back on your own kind?

28
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,916
For these animals?

29
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,999
With or without you,
I'll burn down their world, Albus.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,916
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

31
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,916
Enjoy your cup of tea.

32
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,166
She's ready.

33
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,582
Beautiful.

34
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,332
All right, you two.

35
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,332
Now, the tricky bit.

36
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,041
<i>Accio.</i>

37
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,916
I'm so sorry.

38
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,735
Twins.

39
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,791
You had twins.

40
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:55,082
Leave us.

41
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,957
Show me.

42
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,457
The others, they said it was special.

43
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,999
It's beyond special.

44
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:16,221
See?

45
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,624
See its eyes?

46
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,499
Those eyes see everything.

47
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:28,858
When a Qilin is born, a righteous leader
will rise to change our world forever.

48
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:36,374
Her birth brings change,
Credence, to everything.

49
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,791
You did well.

50
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,581
Go.

51
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:45,873
Rest.

52
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:32,745
There.

53
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:35,758
There.

54
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,791
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me
what this is about, would you?

55
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,957
He just asked that we meet,
and that I be sure to bring you.

56
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:20,201
Right.

57
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,624
Here to meet my brother, I expect.

58
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,666
No, sir.
We're here to see Albus Dumbledore.

59
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,457
That would be my brother.

60
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,957
Sorry. Brilliant.

61
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,916
I'm Newt Scamander,
and this is Theseus...

62
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,457
Up the stairs. First on the left.

63
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,416
<i>Has Newt told you why you're here?</i>

64
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,791
Was he meant to?

65
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,874
No. As a matter of fact.

66
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,291
There's something that we...
That Dumbledore wishes to speak to you about.

67
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,291
It's a proposal.

68
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,249
All right.

69
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,832
You know what this is, of course.

70
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,416
Newt had it in Paris.

71
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:38,082
I can't say I have much
experience with such things...

72
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,041
but it looks to me to be a blood troth.

73
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,749
That would be correct.

74
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,457
And whose blood is contained within?

75
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:47,445
Mine.

76
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,707
And Grindelwald's.

77
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,819
I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?

78
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,423
Yes.

79
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,957
Nor he against me.

80
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,541
Can I ask, what would possess you
to make such a thing?

81
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,018
Love.

82
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,415
Arrogance. Naivete. Pick your poison.

83
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,290
We were young,
we were going to transform the world.

84
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,124
This ensured that we would,
even if one of us had a change of heart.

85
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,874
And what would happen
if you were to fight him?

86
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,916
It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.

87
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,999
Were I to even think about defying it...

88
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,624
It knows, you see.

89
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:03,791
Albus.

90
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,082
It senses the betrayal in my heart.

91
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,499
Albus.

92
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:13,119
Albus.

93
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,457
That would be the least of it.

94
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,874
Young man's magic,
but as you can see...

95
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,582
powerful magic.

96
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,999
It can't be undone.

97
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,457
So this proposal, I take it
the Qilin has something to do with it?

98
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,207
He promises he won't tell a soul.

99
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,416
If we're to defeat him...

100
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,749
the Qilin's only part of it.

101
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,916
The world as we know it is coming undone.

102
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,832
Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.

103
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:21,791
Things that seem unimaginable today
will seem inevitable tomorrow...

104
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,957
if we don't stop him.

105
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,249
Should you agree to do what I ask...

106
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,041
you'll have to trust me.

107
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,541
Even when every instinct tells you not to.

108
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,791
Let's hear it.

109
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,499
Does he send you to spy on me?

110
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,874
No.

111
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,207
But he asks.

112
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,541
What ya thinkin', what ya feeling.

113
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,874
And the others?

114
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,874
Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?

115
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,582
Yes, but it's mostly you.

116
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,957
And do you tell him?

117
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,624
You do.

118
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,207
Who's reading whose mind now?

119
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,291
Tell me what you see.

120
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,832
You're a Dumbledore.

121
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,666
It's an important family.

122
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,499
You know this because he's told you.

123
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:06,624
He's also told you they abandoned you.

124
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,916
That you were a dirty secret.

125
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:18,124
He says Dumbledore abandoned him too,
and he knows how you feel.

126
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,249
And for that reason...

127
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,999
he's asked you to kill him.

128
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,707
I want you to go now, Queenie.

129
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,291
I don't tell him.

130
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,957
Not always.

131
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,832
Not everything.

132
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,749
Hey, we're...

133
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,249
Queenie.

134
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,832
Hi, sweetie.

135
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,707
Honey...

136
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,249
look at your bakery.

137
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,374
It's like a ghost town.

138
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,249
Yeah, well, I missed you.

139
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,041
Oh, baby.

140
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,832
Why don't you come here?

141
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,207
Come here.

142
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:30,740
Hey.

143
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,124
Everything's gonna be all right.

144
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,457
Everything's gonna be just fine.

145
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:11,541
Hey, sweetheart, what brings you downtown?

146
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:16,207
I really hope you didn't spend all day
coming up with that.

147
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,082
You want scary, is that what you want?

148
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,457
You know what it is,
you just aren't menacing enough.

149
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,916
I think I'm plenty menacing.

150
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,791
Am I not menacing?

151
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:36,791
Maybe if you waved your arms around,
you know, like a crazy man...

152
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,416
then you'd appear more menacing.

153
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,291
That's good. A little more.

154
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,916
A little more.

155
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,791
Keep going. Perfect.

156
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,416
Three, two, one.

157
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:58,446
Hey!

158
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,374
That's enough. Get outta here.

159
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,291
What's on your mind, baker boy?

160
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,517
Jeez.

161
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,291
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

162
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,457
Well, we're not.

163
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,041
It's a lady.

164
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,457
I tell you what...

165
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,041
I'll give you the first shot.
Go ahead.

166
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,207
You sure?

167
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,666
Oh, boy.

168
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,957
Last time I ever help that woman out again.

169
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,047
Lally!

170
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,957
Whoopsie, Frank.
Sometimes I forget my own strength.

171
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,374
I'll take it from here.
Thank you!

172
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,457
Welcome.

173
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,707
-Catch you later, Lally.
-Bye, Stanley.

174
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,624
I'll be over for a game
of Befudler Dudley soon.

175
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:43,832
All right.

176
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,999
That's my cousin Stanley. He's a wizard.

177
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,136
No.

178
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,666
Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.

179
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,041
I said I wanted out, and I want out.

180
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,249
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

181
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,832
Can't believe my therapist said
you wizards don't exist.

182
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,166
What a waste of money!

183
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,624
You do know I'm a witch, right?

184
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:02,408
Yeah.

185
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,707
Look, you seem
like a really nice witch.

186
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,624
You don't know what
I've been through with you people.

187
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:11,291
So, could you please get out of my life?

188
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,416
-A little over a year ago...
-Oh, my...

189
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,082
...in the hopes of securing
a small business loan...

190
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,082
you walked through the doors
of the Steen National Bank...

191
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,624
located about six blocks from here.

192
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,249
You then made the acquaintance
of Newt Scamander...

193
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:27,041
the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.

194
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,041
You then learned of a world
you had previously been wholly unaware of.

195
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,624
You met and fell in love
with a witch named Queenie Goldstein...

196
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:36,332
had your brain wiped by means of Obliviation,
only it didn't take.

197
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,999
And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who...

198
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:41,707
after your refusal to marry her...

199
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,457
decided to join Gellert Grindelwald
and his dark army of followers...

200
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,707
who pose the single greatest threat to
both your world and ours in four centuries.

201
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,416
How did I do?

202
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,916
That was good.

203
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,249
Except for the part about Queenie
going over to the dark side.

204
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,957
I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.

205
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,541
But she's got a heart
bigger than this whole crazy island...

206
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,582
and she's so smart, you know?

207
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,332
She can legitimately
read your brain, you know...

208
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,541
she's a whatchamacallit...

209
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,666
-A Legilimens.
-Yeah.

210
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,624
Look...

211
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,249
You see this?

212
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:24,791
You see the pan?
That's me, I'm the pan.

213
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,124
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
I'm just a schmo.

214
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,832
I don't know what kind of crazy ideas
you have in your head there, lady...

215
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,249
but I'm sure as hell
you could do a lot better than me.

216
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,624
Goodbye.

217
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,041
I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski.

218
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,832
You could have ducked under the counter,
but you didn't.

219
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,124
You could have looked the other way,
but you didn't.

220
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:50,249
In fact, you were willing to put yourself
in danger to save a perfect stranger.

221
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,499
Seems to me you're just the kind
of average Joe the world needs right now.

222
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,832
You just don't know it yet.

223
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,249
That's why I had to show you.

224
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,874
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

225
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,082
All right.

226
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,124
Call me Jacob.

227
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,499
-Call me Lally.
-Lally.

228
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:17,832
I gotta lock up.

229
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,332
Thanks.

230
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,082
Much better, Jacob.

231
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,624
I believe you know how this works, Jacob.

232
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,999
What did they say at the Ministry?

233
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,499
Liu or Santos?

234
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,291
Officially, the Ministry takes no position.

235
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,791
Unofficially, smart money's on Santos.

236
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,082
Although anyone would be better than Vogel.

237
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,457
Anyone?

238
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,291
I don't believe he's on the ballot, Kama.

239
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,541
He also happens to be a fugitive.

240
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,124
Is there a difference?

241
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,957
Spinning! Always with the spinning.

242
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,041
Jacob.

243
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,707
Welcome. You brilliant man.

244
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,082
Sorry.

245
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,874
I was absolutely sure
that Professor Hicks would convince you.

246
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,249
Yeah.

247
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,832
You know me, pal.
I can't pass up a good Portkey.

248
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,874
Mr. Scamander.

249
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,374
Professor Hicks.

250
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,666
-At long last.
-At long last.

251
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:04,082
So, Professor Hicks and I,
we've corresponded for many years...

252
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,457
but we've never actually met.

253
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,874
So, her book on advanced charm casting
is a must-read.

254
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,332
Newt is far too kind.

255
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,457
<i>Fantastic Beasts</i> is required reading
for all my fifth years.

256
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,916
Now, let me make some introductions.

257
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,999
So, this is Bunty Broadacre...

258
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,499
my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.

259
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,124
Eight. Years.

260
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,582
And 164 days.

261
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,249
As you can see, indispensable.

262
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,582
And this is...

263
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,624
Yusuf Kama.

264
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,999
Pleasure.

265
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,666
And you, obviously,
already made Jacob's acquaintance.

266
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,041
Newt.

267
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,999
So, this is my brother, Theseus...

268
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,291
and he works for the Ministry.

269
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,749
Actually, head of the British Auror Office.

270
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:51,374
Well, I'll have to ensure
my wand registration's up-to-date.

271
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:52,865
Yes.

272
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,082
Although, strictly speaking,
that doesn't fall within my purview.

273
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:16,832
All right then.

274
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,416
Well, I imagine that you're all
wondering why you find yourselves here.

275
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:25,749
And in anticipation of that,
Dumbledore asked that I convey a message.

276
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:31,082
So, Grindelwald has the ability
to see snatches of the future.

277
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:36,332
So, we have to assume that he'll be able
to anticipate what we do before we do it.

278
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:40,541
So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world...

279
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,332
to save your world, Jacob...

280
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:47,124
then our best hope
is to confuse him.

281
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:50,874
'Scuse me.

282
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:54,457
I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?

283
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,291
Countersight.

284
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,999
Exactly.

285
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,791
The best plan being no plan.

286
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,582
Or, many overlapping plans.

287
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,124
Thus, confusion.

288
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,582
It's working on me right now.

289
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,249
In fact, Dumbledore asked that
I give you something, Jacob.

290
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,541
It's snakewood.

291
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,291
It's somewhat rare.

292
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,374
Are you kiddin' me right now?

293
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,666
Is this thing real?

294
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,968
Yes.

295
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,207
Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.

296
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,166
It's sorta real?

297
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,166
More importantly,
where we're going, you'll need it.

298
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,999
Now, there's something for you too,
I think, Theseus.

299
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,249
Teddy, please let go now.

300
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,624
Teddy, please let go.

301
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,041
No. Teddy, will you behave?

302
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,791
This is Theseus's...

303
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,041
That's...

304
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,666
Well, of course.

305
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,791
Now everything makes sense.

306
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:07,541
Lally, I believe you were given
some reading material?

307
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,707
You know what they say.

308
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,499
A book can take you around
the world and back...

309
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,457
all you have to do is open it.

310
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,624
She ain't kiddin'.

311
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,666
Yes, Bunty...

312
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,332
that's for you.

313
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,457
I was told it was for your eyes only.

314
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,291
And, Kama.

315
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,457
I have what I need.

316
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,249
What about Tina? Is Tina coming?

317
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,041
Tina's not available.

318
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,749
Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...

319
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,832
well, from what I understand.

320
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:54,624
Tina's been made head
of the American Auror Office.

321
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:58,999
We know each other well.
She's quite a remarkable woman.

322
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,624
She is.

323
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,499
So, this is the team
that's gonna take down...

324
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,249
the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.

325
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:09,499
A magizoologist, his indispensable assistant,
a schoolteacher...

326
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,707
a wizard descended from
a very old French family, and...

327
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,457
a Muggle baker with his fake wand.

328
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,332
Hey, we got you too, pal...

329
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,999
and his wand works.
I

330
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,832
Who wouldn't like our chances?

331
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,499
You're all right, little one.

332
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,541
Berlin.

333
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,166
Wonderful.

334
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,541
Kama...

335
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,791
stay safe.

336
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,249
I must be going too now, Newt.

337
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,249
No one can know everything...

338
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,249
not even you.

339
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,957
Right.

340
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,874
Well, here it is.

341
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,582
German Ministry of Magic?

342
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:40,710
Yes.

343
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,791
I take it we're here for a reason.

344
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:50,291
Yes, we have a tea ceremony to attend...

345
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,666
and if we don't hurry up, we'll be late.

346
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,832
Jacob, stay with the group.

347
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,749
Santos! Santos! Santos!

348
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,082
Santos! Santos! Santos!

349
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,457
Evening...

350
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:28,999
Helmut.

351
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,332
Theseus.

352
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,999
Hey, hey.

353
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,749
They're with me.

354
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:53,124
Santos! Santos! Santos!

355
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,207
<i>Incendio.</i>

356
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,582
I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.

357
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,832
No, I have a message to deliver.

358
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,332
A message?

359
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,624
To who?

360
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,957
Mr. Vogel, it's a pleasure to be here.

361
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,457
It's an honor to meet you.

362
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,249
You are joking.

363
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:44,442
No.

364
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,041
What am I even doing here?
Let's go outside.

365
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,874
I'm not very good in these situations.

366
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,082
These situations?

367
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,582
With all the people, the fancy people.

368
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,082
Hello.

369
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,791
I saw you enter the room...

370
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,499
and I thought to myself...

371
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,957
Edith, that's an interesting-looking man.

372
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:06,957
Jacob Kowalski.

373
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,166
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

374
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,207
And where is it you hail from, Mr. Kowalski?

375
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,499
Queens.

376
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,999
Sorry, <i>Herr</i> Vogel.
Sorry, I wonder if I could have a word?

377
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,416
Merlin's beard, it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

378
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,249
<i>Herr</i> Vogel...

379
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:36,249
I have a message from a friend,
and it cannot wait.

380
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,124
Do what is right...

381
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,499
not what is easy.

382
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,082
He said it was important
that I reach you tonight...

383
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,541
that you hear them tonight, the words.

384
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,582
It's time, sir.

385
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,541
Is he here?

386
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,457
In Berlin?

387
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,249
No, of course not.

388
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,832
Why leave Hogwarts
when the world outside is burning?

389
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,999
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

390
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,666
Thank you.

391
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,082
Thank you.

392
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,207
I see many familiar faces here tonight.

393
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,041
Colleagues, friends...

394
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:10,373
foes.

395
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,791
Within the next 48 hours...

396
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:18,499
you, along with the rest of
the Wizarding World...

397
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,999
will choose our next great leader.

398
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,082
A choice that will shape our lives
for generations to come.

399
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,457
I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph...

400
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,954
the Confederation will be in able hands.

401
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,624
Liu Tao.

402
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:45,582
Vicencia Santos.

403
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,374
Thank you, thank you.

404
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,041
It's in moments such as these
we are reminded...

405
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:01,499
that it is this peaceful transfer of power
which marks our humanity...

406
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,582
and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences...

407
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,874
all voices deserve to be heard...

408
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,916
even voices which many may find disagreeable.

409
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,749
Newt.

410
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,124
Any of those lot look familiar to you?

411
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,916
Paris. The night that Leta...

412
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,249
They were with Grindelwald.

413
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:47,332
And so, after an extensive investigation...

414
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:53,541
the Confederation has concluded
that insufficient evidence exists...

415
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,416
to prosecute Gellert Grindelwald...

416
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,999
for the crimes against the Muggle community
of which he was accused.

417
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:09,874
He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.

418
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,999
Are you kidding me?

419
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,957
They're letting the guy off?

420
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,791
I was there, he was killing people.

421
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,082
You're under arrest.

422
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,624
All of you.

423
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,041
Wands down!

424
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:33,666
Theseus.

425
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:36,249
Theseus!

426
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:39,582
Newt, Newt. Not here.

427
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,249
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

428
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,666
Let's go. Newt...

429
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,666
they have the German Ministry.
We've got to go.

430
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,874
It ain't right. That's not justice.

431
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,791
"Extended investigation." I was there.

432
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,666
Were you there? Were you there?
I was there.

433
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,416
-You just let a killer off!
-Jacob.

434
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,624
We have to go. We have to go.

435
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,666
Jacob, let's go.

436
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,666
That's very good.

437
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,457
Her favorite.

438
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,541
Remember how she begged Mother to make it?

439
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:51,082
Ariana.

440
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:56,526
Mother claimed it calmed her,
but I think that was wishful thinking.

441
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:57,832
Albus.

442
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,749
I was there.

443
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,749
I grew up in the same house.

444
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:06,249
Everything you saw, I saw.

445
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,916
Everything.

446
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,666
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

447
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,624
I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.

448
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:39,249
Tell me, what is it?

449
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,874
It's Berlin.

450
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,124
What happened?

451
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:47,332
Vogel has absolved Gellert of all his crimes.

452
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:50,249
He's free. He says there's no proof.

453
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:55,624
He tried to arrest aurors who were there
the night Leta Lestrange was murdered.

454
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,166
Rather disappointing.

455
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,749
I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.

456
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:14,541
Can I impose on you?

457
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,291
Of course.
And, Albus, please be...

458
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,332
I'll do my best.

459
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,374
Evening, Aberforth.

460
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,832
Evening, Minerva.

461
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:27,166
Apologies for calling you a stupid sod.

462
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,999
Apology accepted.

463
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,416
I'm afraid I'll have to
cut our evening short.

464
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,416
Off to save the world, are we?

465
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,707
That will take a better man than me.

466
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,124
Don't ask.

467
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,832
There are thousands in the streets
chanting your name.

468
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,832
You're a free man.

469
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:37,457
Tell the others to prepare to leave.

470
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,041
-Tonight?
-Tomorrow.

471
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,957
We'll have a visitor in the morning.

472
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,041
Why does it stay with him?

473
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,374
It must sense what he's about to do.

474
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:56,707
And you're sure...

475
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,416
that he can kill Dumbledore?

476
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,207
His pain is his power.

477
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:14,124
The man that I am inquiring about
is the head of the British Auror Office.

478
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,541
How can you have misplaced
the head of the British Auror Office?

479
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:24,124
As our contention said,
since he was never in our custody...

480
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:25,499
we never misplaced him.

481
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,582
Sir, there were dozens of people there,
any one of them could corroborate...

482
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,624
-And your name is?
-Let's get out of here.

483
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,416
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

484
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,499
Come here. Come here.

485
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:36,791
Excuse me!

486
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,207
That's the guy.
He knows where Theseus is.

487
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,291
Hello!

488
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,332
Where's Theseus?

489
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,332
That's him.
He knows about Theseus.

490
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:11,791
Newt.

491
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,666
Albus.

492
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,374
Theseus has been taken to the Erkstag.

493
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,874
Wait, no,
but the Erkstag shut down years ago.

494
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:41,707
Yes, well, it's the Ministry's
secret little bed and breakfast now.

495
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,416
You'll need this to see him.

496
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:46,916
And one of these.

497
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,874
And this.

498
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,207
Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,874
I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

500
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,041
Me? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

501
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,499
It's a real pip.

502
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,957
I advise you to keep it close.

503
00:50:07,192 --> 00:50:08,707
-Professor Hicks.
-Dumbledore.

504
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:12,166
Assuming you're not otherwise engaged,
and frankly even if you are...

505
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,916
I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.

506
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,624
Take Mr. Kowalski.

507
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,832
I'm quite certain
there'll be an assassination attempt.

508
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:22,124
Anything you can do to scotch that
will be greatly appreciated.

509
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,291
It's my pleasure.

510
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:24,666
I shall welcome the challenge.

511
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,291
Besides, I'll have Jacob with me.

512
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,041
Not to worry.

513
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:32,457
Professor Hicks's defensive magic is superb.

514
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,541
Until next time.

515
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,166
Such a flatterer.

516
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,082
Well, not really. It is superb.

517
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:40,946
Albus.

518
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,082
I was just wondering...

519
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,582
Yes.

520
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,582
-The case.
-Yes.

521
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:52,582
Rest assured, it's in safe hands.

522
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,499
Can I help you?

523
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:09,609
Yes.

524
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,666
I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.

525
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,291
Certainly.

526
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:19,041
No, you mustn't open it.

527
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:23,166
I mean, it's not necessary.

528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,874
The interior isn't important.

529
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,291
I see no reason I can't make you one.

530
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,624
If you leave it here.

531
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:46,008
No...

532
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,666
I couldn't leave it.

533
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,207
And I'll be needing more than one.

534
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,707
You see...

535
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:59,207
my husband, he's a bit absentminded.

536
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,207
He's always forgetting things.

537
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:03,374
Just the other day,
he forgot he was married to me.

538
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,124
Can you imagine?

539
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,082
But I love him.

540
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,666
Exactly how many were you thinking?

541
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,624
Half a dozen...

542
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,416
and I'll need them in two days' time.

543
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,666
Show your hands.

544
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,249
Who are you?

545
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,916
My name is Yusuf Kama.

546
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,999
Who's our visitor?

547
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:47,499
I'm an admirer.

548
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,291
You murdered his sister.

549
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:53,082
Her name was Leta.

550
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,457
Leta Lestrange.

551
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,447
Yes.

552
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,832
You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.

553
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,374
Shared.

554
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,374
That's the only thing we shared.

555
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,916
Dumbledore sent you, am I right?

556
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,999
He fears you're in possession of a creature.

557
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:14,957
He fears the use you may put it to.

558
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:18,166
He sent me here to spy on you.

559
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:22,249
What would you like me to tell him?

560
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,207
Queenie.

561
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,666
Is he telling the truth?

562
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:43,707
What else?

563
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,624
Even though he believes in you...

564
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:48,541
he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.

565
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,499
He carries her absence with him every day.

566
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:57,499
Every breath he takes
is a reminder that she breathes no more.

567
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:02,791
Then I presume you won't mind
if I relieve you of your sister's memory.

568
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,416
Right?

569
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:11,749
Right.

570
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,749
There.

571
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,916
Better?

572
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,624
I thought so.

573
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:45,124
When we allow ourselves to be consumed
by anger, the only victim is ourself.

574
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,291
Now, we were just about to depart.

575
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,291
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

576
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,291
Come, we can talk some more
about our mutual friend, Dumbledore.

577
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,416
After you.

578
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,791
Hello, Credence.

579
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,874
Do you know what it's like to have no one?

580
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,207
To always be alone?

581
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,791
It's you.

582
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:58,707
You're the one sending messages
in the mirror.

583
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,624
I'm a Dumbledore.

584
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,249
You abandoned me.

585
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:09,749
The same blood that runs my veins runs yours.

586
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:21,374
He's not here for you.

587
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,249
He's here for me.

588
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:12,749
Things are not quite
what they appear, Credence...

589
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:15,874
no matter what you've been told.

590
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,582
My name is Aurelius.

591
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,124
He's lied to you.

592
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:22,916
Kindled your hate.

593
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:26,124
What he's told you isn't true...

594
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:30,499
but we do share the same blood.

595
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:34,457
You are a Dumbledore.

596
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,832
I'm sorry for your pain.

597
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:53,124
We didn't know, I promise.

598
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,291
I've come to see my brother.

599
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,416
His name is Theseus Scamander.

600
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,624
Sorry, that's...

601
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,124
Wand.

602
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,416
That's...

603
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,749
I'm a magizoologist.

604
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:21,916
He's perfectly harmless.

605
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,457
He's just a pet, really.

606
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,124
Sorry.

607
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,207
That's Teddy.

608
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,082
He's a total nightmare, truth be told.

609
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:35,707
They stay here.

610
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,624
So, how will I know where to find him?

611
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:01,666
He's your brother?

612
01:02:02,777 --> 01:02:03,811
Yes.

613
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,666
He will be the one
who looks like your brother.

614
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,707
I will be back, Pick.

615
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,416
On my word.

616
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,499
"I'll be back, Pick.

617
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,082
"On my word."

618
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:27,999
And I'll be Minister of Magic one day.

619
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,957
Take us 'round the back.

620
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,207
It's not safe here.

621
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:12,325
No.

622
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:13,999
Roll it down.

623
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,624
What?

624
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:17,791
The window.

625
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,332
Roll it down.

626
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,582
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

627
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,416
No. No!

628
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,291
<i>Those people...</i>

629
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:51,874
aren't suggesting we listen to them.

630
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:54,041
They aren't asking us to listen.

631
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,041
They're demanding it.

632
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,541
You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?

633
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:01,878
Yes.

634
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,166
Yes, let him stand.

635
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:10,166
Gellert Grindelwald
wants a Muggle-wizard war...

636
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:13,291
and if he gets his wish,
he won't just destroy their world...

637
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,749
he'll destroy ours as well.

638
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,791
Which is why he cannot win.

639
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:19,957
Let him stand as a candidate.

640
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:21,749
Let the people vote.

641
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,082
When he loses, the people will have spoken.

642
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:27,416
But deny them their voices...

643
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:30,207
and those streets will run with blood.

644
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,374
Theseus.

645
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,624
Theseus.

646
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,249
Lally...

647
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,457
the guy with the hair...

648
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:13,249
sitting next to Edith.

649
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,832
He looks like he can kill somebody.

650
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:19,457
He also looks like my Uncle Dominic.

651
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,207
Is your Uncle Dominic
the Norwegian Minister of Magic?

652
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:24,386
No.

653
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,124
Didn't think so.

654
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:56,457
Queenie.

655
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:58,791
Queenie.

656
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,916
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

657
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:15,082
Your supporters are in fine voice.

658
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,666
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

659
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,791
Rescuing me, are you?

660
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,457
That's the general idea.

661
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:44,374
And I presume this...

662
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,416
whatever it is that you are doing,
is strategic.

663
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:49,582
Yes, a technique called limbic mimicry.

664
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:53,124
It discourages violent engagement,
theoretically.

665
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,832
I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.

666
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,707
And the results?

667
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,624
Inconclusive.

668
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,416
Course that was a laboratory setting...

669
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,957
and the conditions were strictly controlled,
and the...

670
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,791
Well, the current conditions
are more volatile...

671
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,832
so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.

672
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,291
The ultimate outcome presumably...

673
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,457
being our survival.

674
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,666
Well done, come on.

675
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:30,749
And the plan is?

676
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,082
Hold this.

677
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,874
What the bloody hell was that for?

678
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,249
We're gonna need some help.

679
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,374
Follow me.

680
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:10,416
Come on.

681
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,749
You're no swiveling properly.

682
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:23,249
Swivel...

683
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,499
swivel, but delicately.

684
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:28,166
I'm swiveling like you're swiveling, Newt.

685
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,374
I don't believe you are.

686
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:50,457
Swivel.

687
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,166
Go to him.

688
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:14,499
Queenie.

689
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,749
Tell him it's all right.

690
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,124
I can see he's failed.

691
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,624
He'll have another chance.

692
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:29,749
It's his loyalty I most value.

693
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,541
Stay here.

694
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,124
Apologies.

695
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,082
Oh, boy.

696
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,124
Let her go.

697
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:58,749
Excuse me?

698
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,457
Assassin!

699
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,374
No, wait.

700
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:37,291
Newt!

701
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,249
<i>Accio!</i>

702
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,374
Grab the tie.

703
01:19:33,403 --> 01:19:34,734
That was a Portkey.

704
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:36,491
Yeah.

705
01:19:39,792 --> 01:19:41,416
Well done, you two.

706
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,332
Not that either of you asked,
but I would highly recommend learning Charms.

707
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:10,416
Lally.

708
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:11,874
What kept you two.

709
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:14,916
We encountered some complications. You?

710
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,957
We encountered some complications.

711
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:23,874
Jacob tried to murder Grindelwald?

712
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,832
It's a long story.

713
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,666
Is it really snakewood?

714
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:29,541
Yes, it's really snakewood.

715
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:30,957
Can I...

716
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,332
Very dangerous.

717
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:35,999
It's very powerful.

718
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,957
It's rare. If it got in the wrong
hands, you know...

719
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:40,082
mess you up.

720
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:41,707
Where did you get it?

721
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,499
I got it for Christmas.

722
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:45,707
Jacob...

723
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:47,124
look who I found.

724
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,291
Hey.

725
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:50,749
It's my wizard friends, Newt and Theseus.

726
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:53,124
We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.

727
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,666
I gotta go.
All right, have fun.

728
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:57,916
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

729
01:20:58,792 --> 01:20:59,832
Can you believe this place?

730
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:02,207
They got pint-sized little witches
and wizards running around here.

731
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,624
You don't say.

732
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,666
I was the assassin.

733
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:08,166
Newt and Theseus both went to Hogwarts.

734
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:10,332
I knew that.
Well, they're being very nice to me.

735
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:12,207
The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.

736
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,207
They're delicious. Who wants one?

737
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,041
I never cared for cockroach clusters
much myself...

738
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:19,749
although Honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.

739
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,666
Off you go.

740
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:28,416
McGonagall.

741
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:30,166
Albus.

742
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,332
Well done.

743
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,041
All of you, well done.

744
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,041
Congratulations.

745
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,707
-Congratulations?
-Indeed.

746
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,124
Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.

747
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:42,374
And you are alive and you are well.

748
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:46,582
The fact that everything didn't go precisely
to plan was precisely the plan.

749
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,166
Countersight 101.

750
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:50,707
Albus, forgive me,
but aren't we back where we started?

751
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,499
Actually, I would argue
that things are...

752
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,832
a great deal worse.

753
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,332
You haven't told them, have you?

754
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,624
Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.

755
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:05,957
-What?
-But how?

756
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:10,166
Because Vogel chose easy over right.

757
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:35,957
It's all right.

758
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:37,541
Bhutan.

759
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,666
Correct. Three points to Hufflepuff.

760
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,041
The kingdom of Bhutan
sits high in the Eastern Himalayas.

761
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:47,916
It's a place of indescribable beauty.

762
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:51,499
Some of our most important magic
has its origins there.

763
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:56,624
They say if you listen carefully enough,
the past whispers to you.

764
01:22:58,042 --> 01:23:00,416
It also happens to be
where the election will be held.

765
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:01,832
He can't win, can he?

766
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:04,249
Only a few days ago
he was a fugitive from justice.

767
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:09,874
Now he is an official candidate in the
International Confederation of Wizards.

768
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,707
Dangerous times favor dangerous men.

769
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,416
By the way, we'll be dining
with my brother in the village.

770
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:23,374
Should you need anything before then,
Minerva is here.

771
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,207
Dumbledore has a brother?

772
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,624
Here we are.

773
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,707
Bunty, you're here.

774
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:52,874
Yes.

775
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:55,666
How is she?

776
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:56,916
She's fine.

777
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,707
What's Alfie done now?

778
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:02,916
Wait, you've not been biting
Timothy's bottom again, have you?

779
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:07,582
Miss Broadacre,
I trust my brother has been a gracious host?

780
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,332
Yes, ever so gracious.

781
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,082
I'm delighted to hear.

782
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:15,499
So, rooms have been arranged for you
in the village...

783
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:19,124
and Aberforth here
will prepare you a delicious dinner...

784
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,832
his own recipe.

785
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:29,499
There's more of that if you want it.

786
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,166
Thank you.

787
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:36,999
Thanks.

788
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:41,624
Astonishing.

789
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:44,999
Never has something that looks so repellent
tasted so delicious.

790
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,124
Who is this little one?

791
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,249
Do you mind?

792
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,874
She's a Qilin, Jacob.

793
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,832
She's incredibly rare.

794
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:55,374
One of the most beloved creatures
in the Wizarding World.

795
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:56,874
Why?

796
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,541
'Cause she can see into your soul.

797
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:04,457
You're kidding me.

798
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:10,457
No. So, if you are good and worthy,
then she'll see that.

799
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:14,207
But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful...

800
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:16,249
then she'll know that too.

801
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:18,457
Oh, yeah?

802
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,207
Does she just tell you that or...

803
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:23,416
Not exactly tells.

804
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:28,291
Well, she bows, but only in the presence
of someone truly pure of heart.

805
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:31,999
I mean, almost none of us are, of course...

806
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,624
no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.

807
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,749
There was actually a time,
many, many years ago...

808
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,332
when the Qilin chose who'd lead us.

809
01:25:43,417 --> 01:25:44,541
No...

810
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,582
Okay. All right, already.

811
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:55,374
Here you go.

812
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:57,461
Thriving.

813
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:59,249
He's just hungry. Look at him.

814
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,082
-She really likes you, Jacob.
-Oh, all right.

815
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:05,624
It's okay.

816
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,499
Come with me.

817
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:19,624
I'll help you.

818
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:23,499
He's your son, Aberforth.

819
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:27,916
He needs you.

820
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,291
Newt.

821
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,082
Come in.

822
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,457
Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.

823
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:01,624
Close the door.

824
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:11,416
It's from Credence, Newt.

825
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,457
The summer Gellert and I fell in love...

826
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:20,124
my brother fell in love as well...

827
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:22,499
with a girl from the Hollow.

828
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,291
She was sent away.

829
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,416
There were rumors about a child.

830
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:32,207
Credence...

831
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,791
He's a Dumbledore.

832
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,207
If I'd been a better friend...

833
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:42,374
to Aberforth,
if I'd been a better brother...

834
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:45,916
he might have confided in me.

835
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:50,832
Perhaps things would have been different,
and this boy...

836
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:54,374
could have been part of our lives,
part of our family.

837
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,374
Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.

838
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:08,041
But he may yet be able to save us.

839
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:15,791
Phoenix ash.

840
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:20,207
The bird comes to him
because he's dying, Newt.

841
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,916
I know the signs.

842
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,166
You see...

843
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:30,291
my sister was an Obscurial.

844
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:34,291
And like Credence,
she never learned to express her magic.

845
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:38,624
Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.

846
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,541
Worst of all, none of us
were capable of easing her pain.

847
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,416
Can you tell me how it is that...

848
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,041
or how it came to an end for her?

849
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:58,707
Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.

850
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:03,416
My brother didn't approve.

851
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:05,791
One night, he confronted us.

852
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:08,666
Voices were raised, threats made.

853
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:12,332
Aberforth drew his wand, which was foolish.

854
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:18,332
I drew my wand, which was even more foolish.

855
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,791
Gellert just laughed.

856
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:26,582
No one heard Ariana coming down the stairs.

857
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:32,041
Can't say for certain it was my...

858
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:34,666
spell.

859
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:41,499
Doesn't really matter.

860
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:46,124
One minute she was there,
and the next she was gone.

861
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:48,957
I'm so sorry, Albus.

862
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:54,666
But if it's of any comfort,
perhaps she was saved some pain...

863
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,291
Don't.

864
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:58,416
Don't disappoint me, Newt.

865
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,291
You of all people.

866
01:30:02,792 --> 01:30:04,999
Your honesty is a gift...

867
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,666
even if at times a painful one.

868
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:17,874
Our friends downstairs will be tired
and wanting to go home.

869
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,166
You should go.

870
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:37,457
Albus, Lally said something earlier...

871
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,541
about most of us being ultimately imperfect.

872
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:45,957
But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...

873
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,082
we can try to make things right.

874
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:54,291
And that's what matters...

875
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,499
trying.

876
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:16,666
We're with you.

877
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:18,416
Thank you.

878
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:29,749
Our time is close, my brothers and sisters.

879
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:32,666
Days of hiding are over.

880
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:37,624
The world will hear our voice.

881
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:42,416
And it will be deafening.

882
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:53,499
You didn't come here to betray Dumbledore...

883
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:57,374
You know in your pure-blood heart...

884
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:00,999
your place is here.

885
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:05,957
To believe in me is to believe in yourself.

886
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,666
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

887
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:45,291
<i>...Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

888
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:50,166
<i>Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

889
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:09,666
There.

890
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,707
There, there.

891
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:15,999
There.

892
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:19,082
Come, look.

893
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:27,536
This is why we are special.

894
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:34,416
To conceal our powers
is not merely an affront to ourselves...

895
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:37,374
it's sinful.

896
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:53,582
Was there another?

897
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,041
Another?

898
01:33:57,458 --> 01:34:00,332
That night, was there another Qilin?

899
01:34:04,167 --> 01:34:05,124
I don't think so...

900
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:08,541
That's twice you failed me.

901
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:12,499
Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?

902
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:18,041
One last chance.

903
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:19,874
Understood?

904
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:24,249
Find it.

905
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:20,204
Hey, Newt.

906
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,666
What is this place?

907
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:25,666
The room we require.

908
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:33,624
I trust you all have the tickets
that Bunty gave you?

909
01:35:33,917 --> 01:35:36,124
You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.

910
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:37,291
What do you think, Newt?

911
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,957
Can you tell which one is yours?

912
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:40,124
No.

913
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:42,791
Good. I’d be worried if you could.

914
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:45,082
I assume the Qilin's in one of these cases.

915
01:35:45,357 --> 01:35:46,323
Yes.

916
01:35:46,542 --> 01:35:48,332
-Well, which one is it?
-Which one indeed.

917
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,874
It's like a three-card Monte thing.

918
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,791
Like a shell game thing.

919
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:53,749
Like a short con.

920
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,999
Never mind, it's a Muggle thing.

921
01:35:58,625 --> 01:36:00,416
Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers...

922
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,874
to get his hands on our rare friend.

923
01:36:03,167 --> 01:36:05,249
Therefore, it's essential that we keep...

924
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:08,499
whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing...

925
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:11,666
so the Qilin gets to the ceremony safely.

926
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:17,541
If, by teatime, the Qilin,
not to mention all of us...

927
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:20,249
are still alive...

928
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:23,207
we should consider our efforts a success.

929
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,707
For the record, nobody ever died
playing three-card Monte.

930
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:30,124
An important distinction.

931
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,999
All right, everybody choose a case
and we'll be on our way.

932
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:37,832
Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.

933
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:39,707
Me?

934
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:45,416
Okay.

935
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:12,291
I'm looking forward
to you educating me a little further...

936
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:15,124
on the finer points
of three-card Monte.

937
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:21,999
My pleasure.

938
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:29,457
Well, good luck, everybody.

939
01:37:32,417 --> 01:37:33,166
Good luck.

940
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:37,166
And you too, Bunty girl.

941
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,416
See you, Bunty.

942
01:37:56,083 --> 01:38:01,749
It is not lost on those of us in leadership
that we are currently a world divided.

943
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:05,457
Each day brings talk of another conspiracy.

944
01:38:06,292 --> 01:38:08,249
<i>Each hour another dark whisper.</i>

945
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:12,207
<i>These whispers have
only increased in recent days...</i>

946
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:15,124
<i>with the-addition of a third candidate.</i>

947
01:38:16,417 --> 01:38:20,332
There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt...

948
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:26,624
that a worthy candidate exists amongst
the three you have been presented.

949
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:48,957
As every schoolboy and girl knows...

950
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:55,791
the Qilin is the purest of creatures
in our wonderful magical world.

951
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:58,374
It cannot be deceived.

952
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:02,541
Let the Qilin unite us.

953
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:24,707
Santos! Santos! Santos!

954
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:51,874
Come.

955
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:57,291
Where to, next?

956
01:39:57,958 --> 01:39:59,582
This is where I leave you.

957
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:02,374
I'm sorry, you're what?

958
01:40:02,667 --> 01:40:03,874
Leaving me?

959
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,666
I have to meet someone else, Mr. Kowalski.

960
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:08,541
Not to worry...

961
01:40:09,542 --> 01:40:10,957
you'll be perfectly safe.

962
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:16,416
You don't have the Qilin.

963
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:20,374
Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.

964
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:24,124
One other thing, if you don't mind me saying.

965
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:26,707
You should stop doubting yourself.

966
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,666
You have something most men
go their entire lives without.

967
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,207
Do you know what that is?

968
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:35,041
A heart that is full.

969
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:37,832
Only a truly brave man...

970
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:42,999
could open himself up
so honestly and completely, as you do.

971
01:41:11,667 --> 01:41:13,249
Santos! Santos! Santos!

972
01:42:26,458 --> 01:42:28,916
Cases, please.

973
01:42:48,167 --> 01:42:48,874
Hey, fellas.

974
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,124
He's angry.

975
01:43:15,208 --> 01:43:15,957
Wait.

976
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:18,124
Open them, make sure it's in there.

977
01:43:18,417 --> 01:43:19,332
Idiots.

978
01:45:05,042 --> 01:45:06,374
How long does he have?

979
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,666
Here. Hey. Hi.

980
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:51,041
You're in danger, all right?

981
01:45:51,333 --> 01:45:52,707
-You need to leave.
-Well...

982
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,291
I can't go, okay?

983
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,874
I can't come home.

984
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:59,249
It's too late for me, all right?

985
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,749
Some mistakes, they're just too big.

986
01:46:02,292 --> 01:46:03,707
Can you listen to me?

987
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:06,082
There's no time. I was followed.

988
01:46:06,833 --> 01:46:09,749
I gave 'em the slip, but it won't
be long before they find me.

989
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:11,416
-They're gonna find us.
-I don't care.

990
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,082
All I got is us.

991
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:15,624
I make no sense without us.

992
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:17,457
Jacob, what? Come on...

993
01:46:18,833 --> 01:46:20,582
I don't love you anymore.
Just get outta here.

994
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,082
You're the worst liar in the world,
Queenie Goldstein.

995
01:46:24,833 --> 01:46:25,707
You hear that?

996
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,332
What? No.

997
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:28,957
That's a sign.

998
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,207
Oh, man.

999
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,291
-Come on.
-Come here, come here.

1000
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,041
Close your eyes.

1001
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:36,832
Please close your eyes.

1002
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,374
You know what Dumbledore said to me?

1003
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:41,999
No.

1004
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:44,957
He said that I got a full heart.

1005
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:50,416
He's wrong.

1006
01:46:51,292 --> 01:46:53,749
I'm always gonna have room in there for you.

1007
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:56,249
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1008
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,666
You know it.

1009
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:00,082
Look at me.

1010
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,582
Queenie Goldstein.

1011
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,541
Mr. Scamander.

1012
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,457
We've never been properly introduced.

1013
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:15,457
Henrietta Fischer...

1014
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:17,166
<i>Herr</i> Vogel's attache.

1015
01:48:18,042 --> 01:48:19,291
Yes...

1016
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:20,332
hello.

1017
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,457
I can take you up.

1018
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:26,249
There's a private entrance
for members of the High Council.

1019
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:29,041
If you just follow me.

1020
01:48:29,333 --> 01:48:30,832
I'm sorry, why would you do that?

1021
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:32,749
Take me up?

1022
01:48:34,292 --> 01:48:35,707
Isn't it obvious?

1023
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:38,416
No, frankly, it's not.

1024
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:44,874
Dumbledore sent me.

1025
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:50,707
I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1026
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:14,041
He should be here any minute.

1027
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,249
What kept you?

1028
01:50:33,917 --> 01:50:36,332
I thank the candidates for their words.

1029
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:42,916
Each represents a distinct vision
of how we will not shape only our world...

1030
01:50:42,917 --> 01:50:45,332
but the non-magical world as well.

1031
01:50:46,792 --> 01:50:51,832
Which brings us to the most important
part of our ceremony...

1032
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:54,166
the walk of the Qilin.

1033
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,874
The Qilin has seen.

1034
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:28,291
Seen goodness...

1035
01:52:28,917 --> 01:52:30,749
strength...

1036
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,582
qualities essential to lead and to guide us.

1037
01:52:37,875 --> 01:52:39,416
Who do you see?

1038
01:52:56,125 --> 01:52:59,957
Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader
of the magical world...

1039
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:01,791
by acclamation.

1040
01:53:41,292 --> 01:53:43,916
This is the man who tried to take my life.

1041
01:53:45,167 --> 01:53:49,207
This man, who has no magic...

1042
01:53:50,208 --> 01:53:53,166
who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood...

1043
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:56,541
create a forbidden union
that would make us less...

1044
01:53:57,458 --> 01:53:59,374
make us weak, like his kind.

1045
01:54:01,542 --> 01:54:03,166
He's not alone, my friends.

1046
01:54:04,792 --> 01:54:07,707
There are thousands who seek to do the same.

1047
01:54:09,583 --> 01:54:12,832
There can only be one response
to such vermin.

1048
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,166
No.

1049
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:27,916
<i>Crucio.</i>

1050
01:54:28,792 --> 01:54:29,499
No!

1051
01:54:32,417 --> 01:54:33,957
Make him stop!

1052
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:39,582
Our war with the Muggles begins today.

1053
01:54:57,792 --> 01:54:58,666
Jacob.

1054
01:55:39,042 --> 01:55:40,749
He's lying to you.

1055
01:55:43,542 --> 01:55:45,624
That creature is dead.

1056
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:55,166
Not now. Wait.

1057
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:01,041
He did it to trick you.

1058
01:56:01,667 --> 01:56:04,249
He killed it and bewitched it...

1059
01:56:04,542 --> 01:56:07,124
so that you might think him worthy to lead.

1060
01:56:09,667 --> 01:56:11,666
But he doesn't want to lead you.

1061
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:16,249
He just wants you to follow.

1062
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:18,207
Words.

1063
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:21,957
Words designed to deceive.

1064
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,791
To make you doubt what you've seen
with your own two eyes.

1065
01:56:25,042 --> 01:56:26,499
There were two Qilins born that night.

1066
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,832
A twin.
And I know that...

1067
01:56:30,333 --> 01:56:31,291
I know that...

1068
01:56:31,542 --> 01:56:32,582
Because?

1069
01:56:37,042 --> 01:56:39,166
Because you have no proof.

1070
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:42,124
Because there was no second Qilin.

1071
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:44,832
Am I not right?

1072
01:56:45,083 --> 01:56:45,999
Its mother had been killed, it...

1073
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,707
Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander?

1074
01:57:14,667 --> 01:57:16,624
No one can know everything, Newt.

1075
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:17,999
Remember?

1076
01:57:48,458 --> 01:57:49,707
I don't get it.

1077
01:58:02,042 --> 01:58:04,291
She can't hear you, little one.

1078
01:58:05,875 --> 01:58:07,166
Not here...

1079
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,374
but perhaps somewhere she's listening.

1080
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,249
This is the true Qilin.

1081
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:19,749
Look at it...

1082
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:22,332
you can see it with your own eyes.

1083
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:24,416
This is the true...

1084
01:58:29,292 --> 01:58:31,582
This can't be allowed to stand.

1085
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:33,332
The vote must be taken again.

1086
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:36,916
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1087
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:06,499
You...

1088
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:08,791
No, no, no, please.

1089
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,957
I'm honored.

1090
01:59:37,208 --> 01:59:40,166
But just as two of you
were born that night...

1091
01:59:40,417 --> 01:59:43,624
there's another here, equally worthy.

1092
01:59:45,208 --> 01:59:46,916
I'm certain of it.

1093
02:00:02,542 --> 02:00:03,749
Thank you.

1094
02:02:56,333 --> 02:02:58,166
Who will love you now, Dumbledore?

1095
02:03:01,292 --> 02:03:02,666
You're all alone.

1096
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:55,082
I was never your enemy.

1097
02:04:02,458 --> 02:04:05,124
Then, or now.

1098
02:04:46,125 --> 02:04:47,999
Did you ever think of me?

1099
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:51,916
Always.

1100
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,707
Come home.

1101
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:50,457
Here she is.

1102
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:54,207
Well done, Bunty.

1103
02:05:58,292 --> 02:05:59,416
Come on, little one.

1104
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:03,332
I'm sorry.
I must have given you an awful fright.

1105
02:06:03,625 --> 02:06:04,707
No, I think...

1106
02:06:04,958 --> 02:06:08,874
sometimes it takes losing something
to realize quite how much it means.

1107
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:13,957
And sometimes you just...

1108
02:06:17,583 --> 02:06:19,457
Sometimes you just know.

1109
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:31,749
Right, in you pop.

1110
02:06:34,083 --> 02:06:36,041
Mr. Kowalski.

1111
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:39,374
I owe you an apology.

1112
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:43,999
It was never my intent
for you to suffer the <i>Cruciatus</i> curse.

1113
02:06:45,125 --> 02:06:46,291
Yeah...

1114
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,707
well, you know, we got Queenie back,
so we're square.

1115
02:06:48,958 --> 02:06:50,832
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1116
02:06:51,917 --> 02:06:53,249
Can I keep this?

1117
02:06:53,542 --> 02:06:55,082
For, like, old times' sake?

1118
02:06:57,708 --> 02:07:01,249
I can't think of anyone more deserving.

1119
02:07:03,708 --> 02:07:05,249
Thanks, Professor.

1120
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:26,957
Remarkable.

1121
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:27,999
But how?

1122
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:29,499
I thought you couldn't
move against one another.

1123
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,832
We didn't.

1124
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:34,291
He sought to kill, I sought to protect.

1125
02:07:34,583 --> 02:07:36,291
Our spells met.

1126
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:39,707
Let's call it fate.

1127
02:07:41,208 --> 02:07:44,457
After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?

1128
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:47,582
Albus.

1129
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:50,999
Promise me.

1130
02:07:53,375 --> 02:07:55,291
You'll find him and you'll stop him.

1131
02:08:23,125 --> 02:08:25,874
Albert, don't forget the pierogis.

1132
02:08:26,208 --> 02:08:27,332
Yes, Mr. K.

1133
02:08:27,583 --> 02:08:29,041
Albert.

1134
02:08:29,292 --> 02:08:31,291
No more than eight minutes on the kolaczkis.

1135
02:08:31,958 --> 02:08:33,082
Yes, Mr. K.

1136
02:08:33,583 --> 02:08:34,582
He's a sweet kid.

1137
02:08:34,875 --> 02:08:37,082
He doesn't know the difference
between paszteciki and golabki.

1138
02:08:37,333 --> 02:08:38,374
-Hey, sweetheart.
-What?

1139
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:39,916
Newt doesn't know what you're talking about.

1140
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,416
I don't know what you're talking about.

1141
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:44,582
And you are not working today, remember?

1142
02:08:46,167 --> 02:08:47,916
Are you all right, honey?

1143
02:08:48,167 --> 02:08:49,874
You're nervous about the speech.
Don't be nervous.

1144
02:08:50,125 --> 02:08:50,957
Tell him, honey.

1145
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:52,124
Don't be nervous about the speech.

1146
02:08:52,417 --> 02:08:53,207
I'm not nervous.

1147
02:08:53,458 --> 02:08:56,499
What is the smell?
Why is there burning? Albert?

1148
02:08:59,750 --> 02:09:01,999
Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?

1149
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,916
I can't imagine what you're talking about.

1150
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,332
So, the day that I first met Jacob...

1151
02:09:22,792 --> 02:09:26,249
The day that I first met Jacob, we were both
sitting in the Steen National Bank.

1152
02:09:28,167 --> 02:09:29,291
Never would I...

1153
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,791
The maid of honor, I presume?

1154
02:09:47,958 --> 02:09:50,124
The best man, I gather?

1155
02:09:52,125 --> 02:09:54,332
-You've done something to your hair.
-No.

1156
02:09:57,708 --> 02:09:59,624
Well, yes, actually, just...

1157
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:00,916
Just for tonight.

1158
02:10:01,208 --> 02:10:02,707
-Well, it suits you.
-Thank you, Newt.

1159
02:10:08,542 --> 02:10:09,624
-Hello.
-Hi.

1160
02:10:09,917 --> 02:10:10,832
Look who's...

1161
02:10:11,508 --> 02:10:12,206
Hi.

1162
02:10:13,542 --> 02:10:15,249
So good to see you.

1163
02:10:15,542 --> 02:10:16,791
-Hi.
-How are you?

1164
02:10:17,083 --> 02:10:17,999
You look wonderful, Lally.

1165
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:20,332
Well, thank you, Newt. I appreciate it.

1166
02:10:20,667 --> 02:10:21,457
Good luck.

1167
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:22,624
Tina, come on.

1168
02:10:22,875 --> 02:10:24,749
-You must tell me how MACUSA's been.
-See you inside.

1169
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,166
What about me? How do I look?

1170
02:10:33,208 --> 02:10:34,499
-You all right?
-You look fine.

1171
02:10:34,792 --> 02:10:35,541
You okay?

1172
02:10:35,833 --> 02:10:36,624
Yeah, I'm all right.

1173
02:10:36,917 --> 02:10:38,124
You're not nervous, are you?

1174
02:10:39,625 --> 02:10:42,207
Can't be nervous about
a speech after saving the world.

1175
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:01,124
It's a historic day.

1176
02:11:02,583 --> 02:11:07,041
Where once was before,
there will now be after.

1177
02:11:10,083 --> 02:11:13,832
Funny how historic days seem so ordinary
when you're living them.

1178
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,457
Well, perhaps that's what happens
when the world gets things right.

1179
02:11:17,958 --> 02:11:20,666
It's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.

1180
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:26,582
I didn't know if I'd see you here.

1181
02:11:27,625 --> 02:11:28,999
I wasn't sure you would, either.

1182
02:11:29,292 --> 02:11:30,291
Hey, Newt.

1183
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:31,374
Yes.

1184
02:11:31,667 --> 02:11:33,499
Jacob seems to think he's lost the ring.

1185
02:11:33,792 --> 02:11:34,666
Please tell me you've got it.

1186
02:11:34,958 --> 02:11:36,749
No, it's all good. Yep.

1187
02:11:38,292 --> 02:11:39,749
That scared me. Jacob!

1188
02:11:42,708 --> 02:11:43,666
Good man, Pick.

1189
02:11:49,083 --> 02:11:50,416
I should probably...

1190
02:11:52,208 --> 02:11:53,332
Thank you, Newt.

1191
02:11:55,042 --> 02:11:55,999
What for?

1192
02:11:56,292 --> 02:11:57,666
Pick your poison.

1193
02:12:00,042 --> 02:12:02,457
I really couldn't have done it without you.

1194
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:11,749
I'd do it again, by the way.

1195
02:12:13,667 --> 02:12:15,082
Should you ask.

1196
02:12:30,438 --> 02:12:31,355
Okay.

1197
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:34,619
Hey.

1198
02:12:45,708 --> 02:12:46,499
-Hey!
-Hello!

1199
02:12:47,083 --> 02:12:48,457
Bunty!

1200
02:12:49,375 --> 02:12:50,791
Bunty!

1201
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:13,582
Wow, you're so beautiful.

1202
02:13:21,333 --> 02:13:23,249
I can't believe it.

1203
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:45,457
This is Albert.

1204
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:47,041
I don't know if you've met Albert, yet?

1205
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:48,624
Have you met Lally?

1206
