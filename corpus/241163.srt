1
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,553
Such a tragedy.

2
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,319
A whole family.

3
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,395
Who told them to ride a bicycle
50 feet in the air?

4
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,724
And they're from Roma.

5
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,695
They should
have been buried in Roma.

6
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,027
Just because they die here

7
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,534
doesn't give them the right
to clutter up our cemetery.

8
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,880
<i>- Buon Giorno!
- Buon Giorno!</i>

9
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,175
How long has the doctor
been here?

10
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,676
About 20 minutes.

11
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,303
I don't think it's serious.

12
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,684
That poor man.

13
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,688
He doesn't know whether to
pray for her to get better or worse.

14
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,350
You don't pray for someone
to get worse.

15
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,359
God doesn't like that.

16
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,861
So you know what God
likes and doesn't like?

17
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,988
He doesn't like me
to win at cards.

18
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,066
Hah hah hah!

19
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,030
What happened?
What's wrong?

20
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,364
She was coughing.

21
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,938
It's nothing, Marcello.

22
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,870
Cecilia shouldn't have
bothered the doctor.

23
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,339
So why did you?

24
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,876
She's my sister.

25
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,207
I have a right to call
when you're not here, as usual.

26
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,678
What do you mean, "as usual"?

27
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,544
Well, who's been
waiting tables all day?

28
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,278
I don't know, but there are
four men downstairs who need coffee.

29
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,854
Well, let them get their own.
I don't get paid for this, you know.

30
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,821
Marcello, was that necessary?

31
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,421
I'm sorry, but I see the doctor's car
and I get palpitations.

32
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,502
Take the poor man downstairs
and give him a drink.

33
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,538
He was up all night
at the Borglione house.

34
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,368
She had twins.

35
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,340
Healthy? No complications?

36
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,842
They're all fine. Relax.

37
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,239
How was the funeral?

38
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,837
It was a funeral...

39
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,544
a lot of tears, a lot of sighs,
and into the ground.

40
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,348
Now only three more graves left.

41
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,356
And Pavone and Aprea
are heading for two of them.

42
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,289
How is Pavone?
Any improvement?

43
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,259
There is nothing I can do for him.

44
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,852
You could call a specialist.

45
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,865
The only specialist he needs
is a stone mason.

46
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,025
What about Aprea?

47
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,534
Does he need blood?
I'll give him blood.

48
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,898
No, no, no, no, Marcello.

49
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,030
You can't give any more blood.
You gave blood yesterday.

50
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,439
You can't keep everyone
in the whole town alive.

51
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,568
I can try.

52
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,577
Roseanna's right.

53
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,210
You can't play God.

54
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,950
Anyone in Trevento could
drop dead at any minute...

55
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,491
heart attack,

56
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,993
lungs collapsing,
kidney failure,

57
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,326
brain tumor,
blood poisoning...

58
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,195
Then you're not doing your job!

59
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,706
What's the matter?

60
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,640
It's on the high end
of normal.

61
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,006
That good?

62
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,847
It means you're stressed.

63
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,110
I'll give you some pills.

64
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,551
You're a nice man, Sergio.
Have a Fernet-Branca.

65
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,350
I'd rather get paid.

66
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,017
Why don't people
pay their doctor?

67
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,526
Is it because
I don't leave anything behind?

68
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,493
You'd pay me if I delivered
tomatoes or veal chops.

69
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,031
People don't pay you
because they have no money

70
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,327
and they think you have a lot.

71
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,368
A gynecologist in Roma
has a lot.

72
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,199
A plastic surgeon in Milan.

73
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,797
I don't have enough to take my wife
to the sea for a few days...

74
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,240
...so you know where we're going?
- Where?

75
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,868
The attic of our house.

76
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,641
There's a window
that faces the sea.

77
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,976
It's 30 kilometers away,

78
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,745
but we are going to pray
for a very high tide.

79
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,320
Sergio, when you leave,

80
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,389
go out the back
and take a couple of eggs.

81
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,958
You owe me 10,000 eggs.

82
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,256
Then take the chicken
and bring it back when we're even.

83
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,634
<i>Corpus Cristo.</i>

84
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,829
- Roseanna.
- Father.

85
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,159
How are you doing?

86
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,165
We're still discussing that with God.

87
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,565
And I'm sure He's listening.

88
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,500
<i>Ciao.</i>

89
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,838
Eh, Cecilia, do you
remember me? Antonio.

90
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,002
I know who you are.

91
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,339
I thought you might have forgotten.

92
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,346
I've been away a long time.

93
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,245
- Law school, wasn't it?
- Yes.

94
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,716
Stop! Stop! Stop!

95
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,343
What is Marcello doing?

96
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,922
My sister is very ill.

97
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,183
She has a bad heart,

98
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,020
and her one wish is to be buried
in the cemetery,

99
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,354
and there's only
a few graves left.

100
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,088
And Marcello doesn't want
anyone else to die.

101
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,857
He doesn't want any accidents.

102
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,523
Helmet! Helmet!

103
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,069
Helmet, you guys!
You guys could get killed!

104
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,826
That is very moving.

105
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,668
It's absurd, and it's
all your uncle's fault.

106
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,934
My uncle?

107
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,374
Well, you know he owns the land
next to the cemetery,

108
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,207
and the church has offered
to buy, and he won't sell.

109
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,371
Not even half an acre.

110
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,642
This... this is the first
I've heard of it.

111
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,911
<i>Scusi. Scusi. I think I'd like
to go home now, eh?</i>

112
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,043
Of course.

113
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,120
<i>Buon Giorno.</i>

114
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,957
Antonio.

115
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,019
Stop it! Stop it!

116
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,700
Seatbelt! Seatbelt!

117
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,259
Seatbelt!
Ha ha ha ha! Seatbelt!

118
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,697
<i>Buon Giorno!</i>

119
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,700
Nice of you to join us.

120
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,030
What do you mean by that?

121
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,367
We need another waiter
more than we need a traffic cop.

122
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,066
Cecilia, you should remember
you're a guest in my house.

123
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,233
Oh, really?

124
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,868
I thought I was my sister's nurse
and unpaid waitress.

125
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,537
I didn't realize I was a guest.

126
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,239
Perhaps tomorrow
you bring me breakfast in bed

127
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,976
with fresh orange juice.

128
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,384
Hey, hey, why are you
always fighting with Cecilia?

129
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,716
She's family.

130
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,723
I don't want her to feel like family.

131
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,555
I want her to feel like a guest.
Like then I can ask her to leave.

132
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,926
Marcello! She gave up
her life in Rome to look after me.

133
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,557
I can look after you.

134
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,569
When did she last see a movie
or go out on a date, eh?

135
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,071
She's such a princess.
She says to me once,

136
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,405
"I don't want to be with a man
with dirt under his nails,"

137
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,411
which rules out almost
every man in this province.

138
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,912
Antonio has beautiful hands,

139
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,916
and he was making sheep's eyes
at her at church this morning.

140
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,509
Typical of your sister
to impress a Capestro.

141
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,349
- Too much oregano.
- She's a beautiful woman.

142
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,359
No. You are a beautiful woman.

143
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,862
You walk into a room,
and you take all the light, mmm.

144
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,695
Cecilia, she has a certain, uh...

145
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,770
you know,
sexy thing going for her.

146
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,498
Sexy?

147
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,233
She has, uh...

148
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,332
she has certain assets,

149
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,843
but what she's got,
she makes the men too aware of.

150
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,677
I didn't realize you were aware
of my sister's assets.

151
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,842
- I'm not.
- You just said you were.

152
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,544
How did this start?

153
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,881
You just said
you thought she was sexy.

154
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,387
L... I didn't.

155
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,323
I meant other men do.
Some men, not me.

156
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,407
So...

157
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,448
did you talk to Capestro again?

158
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,814
I've raised the offer...
50 million lire.

159
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,854
50 million lire? That is twice
what the land is worth.

160
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,047
Marcello!

161
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>- More vino.
- No more vino!</i>

162
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,589
<i>- What do you mean, no more vino?
- You have a long drive home!</i>

163
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,257
You smoke too much.

164
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,833
Marcello!

165
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,902
So, can you go higher?

166
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,369
There is no more money.

167
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,202
We'll buy Emilio Fela's land
for a new cemetery.

168
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,003
It's up in the hills above the town.

169
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,307
But it's Roseanna's dying wish.

170
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,007
I know. I know.

171
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,749
I'm coming.

172
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,391
What are you doing?

173
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,731
I was just thinking
I'll never wear this again.

174
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,896
I wonder how much
I could get for it.

175
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,337
I won't hear of it.
It's a family treasure.

176
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,840
It belonged to your grandmother.

177
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,171
I'll sell a kidney.

178
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,007
It's only been
in the family 43 years.

179
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,381
In America, a person
can reserve a grave in advance.

180
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,351
Doesn't surprise me.

181
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,016
In America, you can do everything
without getting out of your car.

182
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,025
I always wanted to see New York.

183
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,357
I always promised to take you there.

184
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,021
And I will.

185
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,529
- First class?
- Of course first class.

186
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,865
We will need three seats...

187
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,371
one for you,
and two for my coffin.

188
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,872
We don't talk like that.

189
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,705
As long as there is life,
there are dreams.

190
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,871
All right. After New York,
we go to Paris.

191
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,505
It's full of French people.

192
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,516
Why put ourselves through that?

193
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,549
No, but really, what do you think
I could get for this, eh? Huh?

194
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,854
I don't know, eh, but for
100,000 lire, I'll give you a kiss.

195
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,186
What do you have for 200,000?

196
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,327
Eh, what's wrong?

197
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,496
Cecilia,
she can hear everything.

198
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,336
It's another reason
I hate guests in the house.

199
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,342
Who cares?
Don't think about it.

200
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,346
I can't. A moment ago
I was like a rod, and now...

201
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,522
Marcello, Marcello, slow down.
Slow down, eh?

202
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,031
It's the music.
Change the station.

203
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,069
The station...
the station...

204
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,268
Good morning, Gianna.
How is he?

205
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,202
I've been reading about emphysema.

206
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,834
You don't always die from it.

207
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,970
Once will be enough.

208
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,345
Italy has the worst air in Europe...

209
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,851
so many cars, motorbikes,
French restaurants.

210
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,614
You should move to Scottsdale.

211
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,350
- Where?
- It's the capital of Arizona.

212
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,426
Arizona? In America?

213
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,518
It's a big open space with no cars.

214
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,961
The air is clear, the days warm,

215
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,364
the nights cool,
the sky filled with stars.

216
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,461
So healthy.

217
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,575
If only we had the money...

218
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,107
Eh, I go and get the vase.

219
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,576
Think of it...
swimming pools,

220
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,050
cable television,

221
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,314
28 flavors of ice cream.

222
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,083
In two months,
you'll be bowling!

223
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,819
I don't want to be buried
under cactus.

224
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,395
I want to die in Italy.

225
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,839
Pavone, what are you doing?!
Are you crazy or what?

226
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,341
Are you trying to kill yourself
and everybody else?

227
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,275
That's oxygen in your nose!

228
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,370
I'm going to die anyway.

229
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,507
Yes, but you'll blow up
your nose, then your head,

230
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,017
then the whole hospital.

231
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,021
And in one minute you'll fill up
the old cemetery and the new one!

232
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,595
Gianna, you talk to him.

233
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,369
I just heard. I'm sorry.

234
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,497
- I gave him blood, you know.
- We are in your debt.

235
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,472
It's the least I could do.

236
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,373
He was a wonderful man.

237
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,641
When he worked for us as a waiter,
the tourists loved him.

238
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,147
The way he flirted with them,

239
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,978
they all felt
he wanted to marry them.

240
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,619
But of course he didn't.
You'd already captured his heart.

241
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,859
So when will they...

242
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,922
Soon.

243
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,498
May I say good-bye?

244
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,833
Good-bye, my old friend.

245
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,703
Godspeed till we meet again.

246
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,245
What?

247
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,038
- What?
- What?

248
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,048
Nothing.
I just thought I heard...

249
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,174
What?

250
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,742
I don't know.
It sounded like "bye-bye. "

251
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,187
Paolo! Paolo!

252
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,281
Go call the doctor, quick!

253
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,189
It was probably nothing.

254
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,785
Maybe I just got excited
when he squeezed my hand.

255
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,023
He squeezed your hand?

256
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,828
I don't want to
raise false hopes if it's time.

257
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,927
One second ago,
he squeezed his hand.

258
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,335
He spoke!
He's coming back to life!

259
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,930
It's a miracle!
He's said "bye-bye"!

260
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,135
- Maybe it was just a belch.
- It's a miracle!

261
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,003
Hello, my baby.

262
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,336
God gave you tightrope walkers
to play with, huh?

263
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,602
Don't stand under them.

264
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,338
All right, let me see...

265
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:46,349
The news... Lilia Palumbo
was confirmed on Sunday.

266
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,783
Oh, darling,
she looked so beautiful.

267
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,855
White dress.

268
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,857
Maybe a little bit
too much lace on it.

269
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,722
You know her mother.

270
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,228
Oh, my darling...

271
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,269
Little girl.

272
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,238
Your papa and I miss you so much.

273
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,915
Only the thought of being with you
makes me less afraid.

274
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,716
And I am going to be
right here next to you.

275
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,916
Your father is seeing to that.

276
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,620
Because he's a magnificent man.

277
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,261
A little crazy...

278
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,296
but magnificent.

279
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
<i>Puccini. La Traviata.</i>

280
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,152
Caruso?

281
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,654
Pavarotti.

282
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,288
What are you doing here?

283
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,362
The door was open.

284
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,160
Such a beautiful house.
I don't think I have ever been inside.

285
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,968
No accident.

286
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,367
State your business.

287
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,710
You have disliked me
for many years, Virgilio.

288
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,041
No secret.

289
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,311
I know the reason, of course.

290
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,818
You blame me for your fall.

291
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,319
What fall?

292
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,855
The cycle race.

293
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,357
The last bend
on the downhill run.

294
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,991
- It cost me the race.
- You could be right, huh.

295
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,225
May I sit?
This is not easy for me.

296
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,137
Lately I've been having dreams,

297
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,709
the same dream each time.

298
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,835
I see the race
as if it was yesterday.

299
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,505
I hear the crowd,
I see the bikes flashing by.

300
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,176
But, uh, when the winner
breaks the tape,

301
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,810
it is you, Virgilio.

302
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,850
I suppose my conscience
is telling me that, uh,

303
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,357
you could have won.

304
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,361
You were the best.

305
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,923
Why are you telling me
this now?

306
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,867
Maybe because of
my wife's illness.

307
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,098
A man becomes aware
of mortality,

308
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,072
a man wants to set
the record straight.

309
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,145
He doesn't want to live
with a lie in his heart.

310
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,212
Ahh.

311
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,407
This is for you, Virgilio.

312
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,721
You should have had it
all those years ago.

313
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,326
It's certainly Roseanna's illness
that brought you here,

314
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,828
but if you think I'm selling
my land to the church,

315
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,024
you are a fool,
as well as a bullshitter.

316
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,967
How can you turn down
50 million lire for half an acre of wheat?

317
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,367
You could travel with that money.

318
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,270
You could go to La Scala, Milano,
and see Pavarotti up close,

319
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,741
with all those big ladies
with fat chests.

320
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,212
I would rather ride
across my land.

321
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,044
If you don't own any,

322
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,618
you don't know what
it means to a man.

323
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:52,213
Just tell me this...
how much will it take?

324
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,888
More than you'll ever have.

325
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,991
Now... get out
before I piss in your cup.

326
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,001
You know something,
Capestro?

327
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,810
If I had padlocked both of my wheels
and ridden without a saddle,

328
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,749
I would have still whipped your ass.

329
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,011
There you go, laccoponi.

330
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,383
The sum total of your life.

331
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,352
90,000 lire?

332
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,120
I never walked around
with as little as this in my pocket.

333
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,217
Where's the rest of it?

334
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,660
That's all there was.

335
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,456
You're all thieves.

336
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,401
But we don't kidnap people
and cut off their ears.

337
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,472
One ear.

338
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,904
And the guy got it back.

339
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,475
So where are you going,
old man?

340
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,674
South, maybe.

341
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,011
Get some sun
on these old bones.

342
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,381
Get a chair on the beach,
a liter of wine, watch the sunset.

343
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,181
And dig up the ransom money?

344
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,018
What are you talking about?

345
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,614
They never found it.

346
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,354
You bet your ass the cops did,
and never filed a report.

347
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,523
Those sons of bitches
probably carved it up

348
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,396
and bought villas in Portofino,

349
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,401
and what have I got?

350
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,334
A watch that don't go...

351
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,339
a corkscrew...

352
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,571
and a ticket for shoe repairs
I took in 20 years ago.

353
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,545
You're gonna need them.

354
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,621
You shouldn't have gone there.
That man despises us.

355
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,788
How could you expose
yourself to his contempt?

356
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,298
You know why I went.
I'll try anything.

357
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,461
There are limits!
Where is your pride?

358
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,801
What's pride got to do with it?

359
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,874
I thought he might
listen to reason.

360
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,605
He is dead to reason!
He's not half the man you are!

361
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,442
Then why are we fighting?

362
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,981
We're not fighting!

363
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,914
I just get angry sometimes.

364
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,060
I get angry at the doctors.

365
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,652
I get angry at my body.

366
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,924
I get angry at God.

367
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,437
Oh, darling,
what's happening to us?

368
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,506
First we lose our daughter,
and now we're losing each other.

369
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,410
We'll never lose each other.

370
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,910
Listen to me, Marcello.

371
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,755
You are a man
who should be married.

372
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,793
I am married.

373
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,796
I don't want you to be alone.

374
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,867
I don't want you to end up
a lonely old man

375
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,798
with photographs and memories.

376
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,632
I want you to live.

377
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,036
I don't want to think about it.

378
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,631
I want you to think
about it, Marcello.

379
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,472
I'm worried about you.

380
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,808
I'm worried about Cecilia.

381
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,313
Don't worry about her.

382
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,508
She'll go back to Roma
and marry a hairdresser.

383
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,643
She's a beautiful woman.
She's sensitive.

384
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,346
She doesn't dust off shelves.

385
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,789
She would make you
a wonderful wife.

386
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,318
Did they change
your medication today,

387
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,796
or did you smoke that stuff
the Dutch tourists left behind?

388
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,298
I'm serious, Marcello.

389
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,062
I don't even like her.

390
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,399
Well, of course I like her.
She's your sister.

391
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,405
But not in that way.

392
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,135
You already said that
you thought that she was sexy.

393
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,302
I didn't. You tricked me.

394
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,904
And if you want me to marry again,
at least give me a choice.

395
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,710
Why? You have
someone in mind?

396
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,785
- Yes.
- Oh!

397
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,184
Is it that girl
who cleans your teeth?

398
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,096
He had breakfast,
bought some things in a pharmacy,

399
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,064
and now he's in a shoe store.

400
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,932
He's arguing.

401
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,376
He's making a move.

402
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,648
Police. The guy
who was just here...

403
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,950
did he pick something up?

404
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:57,357
He brought in a ticket
for shoe repairs from 20 years ago.

405
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,020
What did you tell him?

406
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,428
I could see you arguing
through the window.

407
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,025
I told him
they'd be ready Tuesday.

408
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,440
How much are the melons
today, Gigi?

409
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,747
500 to you.
1,200 to the tourists.

410
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,082
I'll have four.

411
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,955
<i>Mi scusi. They are selling
for 400 in Gevarro.</i>

412
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,459
How about it, Gigi?
400 each.

413
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,963
And who will you thank,
me or your lawyer?

414
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,965
I didn't know I'd hired one.

415
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,625
It's a deal then.

416
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,327
Today you look like a lawyer.

417
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,564
This is my first week.

418
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,073
What, looking after
your uncle's tax problems?

419
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,738
Listen, Cecilia,

420
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,745
I hope you won't let
your feelings for my uncle

421
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,405
affect your feelings for me.

422
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,504
Feelings?

423
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,914
I was hoping
we could have dinner tonight.

424
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,508
I have to work.

425
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,585
You're not making this
very easy for me.

426
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,420
Maybe another time?

427
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,853
Antonio.

428
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,159
What kind of fish do you like?

429
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,337
Signor Rossi, telephone.

430
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,675
Rossi. Hello?

431
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,853
Hello, Bruno.

432
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,855
It's Fredo laccoponi.

433
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,754
Fredo!

434
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,617
Where are you?

435
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,266
You... you'll be here when?

436
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,305
I'm gonna take a leak,

437
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,815
and then I'm getting
the 11:30 train to Roma.

438
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,977
Maybe you want
to call your wives,

439
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,350
tell them you won't
be home for dinner.

440
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,196
What will Marcello say
when you tell him

441
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,198
you invited
a Capestro to dinner?

442
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,235
He's not his son.
Only his nephew.

443
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,736
Think I put too much garlic
in this sauce?

444
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,738
You can't put
too much garlic in anything.

445
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,240
- You like him?
- Not especially.

446
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,901
Why did you invite him?

447
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,911
Because he likes me,
and maybe I can convince him

448
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,913
to talk some sense
into his uncle.

449
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,846
Shame on you.

450
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,919
When did you become
such a person?

451
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,011
When the family Tanzini
left the high wire.

452
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,090
Hmm.

453
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,557
<i>Maybe you and Marcello
are made for each other.</i>

454
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,457
Not again, Rosa, please.

455
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,929
Why? Why do you always
object to him that way?

456
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,932
He's a beautiful man.

457
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,435
The first time I came in here
when I was a girl,

458
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,766
he served me coffee,

459
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,204
I couldn't get my hand
to take it from him.

460
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,576
I froze.

461
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,168
You ever had that?

462
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,943
Just for a moment,
the world stops.

463
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,483
For you, Roseanna.

464
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,486
<i>Marcello doesn't even make
my world slow down.</i>

465
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,317
- What, you hate him?
- No.

466
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,152
All right. That's a start.

467
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,726
You haven't said
anything to him about this?

468
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,989
No, no, of course not.

469
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,229
Roseanna asked me,
and I told her the church

470
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,497
would have no problem
if you married her sister.

471
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,971
Is there anyone
she hasn't talked to about this?

472
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,974
I heard rumors.

473
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,509
You know something?

474
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,169
If I give the slightest sign

475
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,509
I thought it was a good idea,
she'd be furious.

476
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,843
I don't understand.

477
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,247
It's a test.

478
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,649
Celibacy is so uncomplicated.

479
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,655
Father, Marcello,
come quickly.

480
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,985
What is it?

481
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,649
It's Pasquale!
He climbed the tower!

482
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,625
And he's threatening to jump!

483
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,601
I'm gonna jump!

484
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,932
- Pasquale, what are you doing?
- I'll talk to him.

485
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,507
I'm gonna jump!

486
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,166
He's worried about his exams.

487
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,676
Pasquale, what's this nonsense
about your exams?

488
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,044
I know they're a pain in the ass,
but let me tell you something...

489
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,049
I've never passed
an exam in my life,

490
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,119
and look what I am today.

491
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,714
Okay, that wasn't
a very good example.

492
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,059
But you can be
anything you wish! Believe me!

493
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,151
But everybody hates me!

494
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,889
No, they don't! They don't!

495
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,522
Look at all these people!
We're all your friends!

496
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,100
And think of your father!

497
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,227
Only last night, he told me
how proud he is of you!

498
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,202
But my father's in Torino.

499
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,534
We spoke on the phone!
Listen!

500
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,474
Pasquale,
you come down! Now!

501
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,813
Okay.

502
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,385
What's going on?

503
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,802
Marcello, Marcello!

504
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,314
Roseanna, where are those pills
the doctor gave me?

505
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,044
What pills?

506
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,347
The ones to calm me down.

507
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,547
Which are mine,
and which are yours?

508
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,419
I can't see
without my glasses.

509
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,355
They're both mine.

510
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,860
I need them.

511
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,364
Do you know what those kids
did to my blood pressure?

512
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,866
I'm calling their fathers
and the school principal.

513
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,996
And then I come home and I find
a Capestro is coming to dinner.

514
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,097
Try the closet on the landing, hmm.

515
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,142
Roseanna, Roseanna,
Roseanna...

516
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,644
Why are you getting
your own towels?

517
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,273
You're a guest in my house.
Guests don't get their own towels.

518
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,151
Hmm.

519
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,778
Hmm.

520
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,355
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

521
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,916
You find them?

522
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,625
Are you angry because
her guest is a Capestro

523
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,200
or because he's another man?

524
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,269
Am I what? Are you crazy?

525
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,067
Then try to be nice.
She's doing this for me, Marcello.

526
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,507
Try to be charming.
And give him your good wine.

527
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,635
I'd sooner give him rat poison.

528
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,543
And then we lose another grave.

529
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,766
<i>- Yes?
- Bruno. It's me.</i>

530
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,337
Oh! Francesca.

531
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,996
<i>What's wrong?
You sound strange.</i>

532
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,165
No, no, no. I'm all right.

533
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,005
It's just...
this isn't a good time.

534
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,510
<i>Can we go to Sardinia?</i>

535
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,343
Of course. I'm excited.

536
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,349
I can't wait to see you.

537
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,782
Let me call you later.

538
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,853
<i>H'm not in.</i>

539
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,785
<i>- You'll be out?
- With my brother.</i>

540
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,857
<i>- Tomorrow, then.
- Ciao.</i>

541
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,214
You went away.
You saw the world.

542
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,716
Why did you come back here?

543
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,377
It's home.
I always missed it.

544
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,388
I couldn't wait to get away. I only
came back because of my sister.

545
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,516
Marcello's lucky to have
two such beautiful women in his life.

546
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,994
Yes, he often goes to church
to make a special offering of thanks.

547
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,295
So what do you think?
They're happy?

548
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,561
- Good. Good.
- Yeah?

549
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,199
- Oh, Marcello!
- We were having fun.

550
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,444
- This is not right.
- What is not right?

551
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,215
Cecilia prostituting herself
for your grave.

552
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,486
Maybe she'll succeed
where the priest and Marcello failed.

553
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,289
You know, a few years ago,

554
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,193
I wouldn't have
believed this possible.

555
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,290
You seemed so aloof and unobtainable,
surrounded by admirers.

556
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,801
- Where's this?
- At school.

557
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,370
I was very shy.

558
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,371
L... I wore glasses.
Of course, you were...

559
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,772
The Risotto alla Cecilia.
Her own recipe.

560
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,579
I'm very flattered.

561
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,196
I don't have a car,
and I can't afford a hotel room.

562
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,096
I'm sure I have something
for whatever you've got.

563
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,400
It's been a long time.

564
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,910
You might have to
remind me how it's done.

565
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,447
It'll come back to you.

566
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,382
- More wine, Antonio?
- Oh, I don't think so.

567
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,889
- I have to work tomorrow.
- For justice or for your uncle?

568
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,892
The trouble with working for my uncle
is he always expects a discount.

569
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,894
It's funny how the rich
always get a discount

570
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,861
and the poor
have to pay full price.

571
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,933
Well, I'm sure he trusts you.

572
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,331
He seems to trust so few people.

573
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,960
Cecilia.

574
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,471
Is this evening about the land?

575
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,165
What do you mean?

576
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,209
The candlelight. The music.

577
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,041
Is this for me or because
you think I'll influence my uncle?

578
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,342
It's for you.

579
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,283
Well, maybe I was hoping
it could be for both.

580
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,786
This is our best grappa.
20 years old.

581
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,789
We call it the piss of the goat.

582
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,519
So. How is it going
with you two, huh?

583
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,089
I think we understand
each other.

584
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,428
Fantastic. So you'll talk
to your uncle tomorrow.

585
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,434
Perhaps another time.

586
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,199
Good night, Cecilia.

587
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,276
Good night.

588
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,040
What's happening here?
Did I say something?

589
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,243
You're a fool, Marcello,
and he isn't.

590
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,752
And you know something?
I shouldn't have done this.

591
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,564
Antonio, I'm sorry.

592
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,597
Half an acre! That's all they want
off the miserable son of a bitch!

593
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,054
It's me. I can get a train

594
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
and be with you
in a couple of hours.

595
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,149
Why not?

596
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,058
I need time.

597
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,222
I made investments.

598
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,892
I need 24 hours
to give you cash.

599
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,161
Okay.

600
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,746
- It's good sauce, huh?
- Yes.

601
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,076
Cecilia made it.

602
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,778
She didn't make it.
You made it.

603
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,218
Will you stop this?

604
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,424
Marcello, come quick. It's Rossi.
He's drunk, and he's out of control.

605
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:11,862
He's crazy!

606
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,795
- Why does this happen to me?!
- What's going on?

607
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,662
I just had to be happy!

608
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,598
Stop breaking my dishes!

609
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,104
Here! Buy more dishes,
buy glasses, buy plates!

610
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,469
What's wrong with him?

611
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,372
It's something about a woman.

612
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,876
Bruno, you are distraught.

613
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,206
We're your friends.

614
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,871
What is this all about?

615
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,881
A man looks at his life

616
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,178
and wonders where
all his dreams went.

617
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,777
But you have a good life.
You have a good position.

618
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,482
I'm a big fish in a very small pond.

619
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,684
Nothing wrong with
living in a small pond.

620
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,161
Ask him about the mistress.

621
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,222
What? Is it true?

622
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,398
You have a mistress?

623
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,198
It's true.

624
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,432
Oh, she's beautiful.

625
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,869
Firm breasts...
soft thighs...

626
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,973
Bruno, you're
a widower, remember?

627
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,641
She sounds wonderful!
Bring her over! Bring...

628
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,913
<i>Oh Dio...</i>

629
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,749
She was my mistress
when Nina was alive.

630
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,823
<i>Si. Si.</i>

631
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,859
She was the girl in the beauty shop!
Francesca! I remember!

632
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,189
I remember!

633
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,820
My God.

634
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,558
So why are you acting like this?

635
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,425
Because she has ruined my life!

636
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:29,973
Aah!

637
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,576
Yaa!

638
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,077
He's mad!

639
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,316
Bruno! Bruno, wait!

640
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,920
Wait! You're
too drunk to drive.

641
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,512
You'll kill yourself.

642
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,425
What's the difference?
I'm gonna die anyway!

643
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,292
Not before Roseanna, you're not.

644
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,964
Stop torturing yourself.

645
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,700
See the priest,
do your penance,

646
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,708
then you can
call her your girlfriend.

647
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,834
Where is she?

648
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,879
In the apartment
I bought for her in Rome.

649
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,709
You bought her an apartment?

650
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,782
Yes.

651
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,148
And what, she still stays alone
and waits for you?

652
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,551
No, her brother moved in.

653
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,453
They're a very loving family.

654
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,584
But we go on trips.

655
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,628
This week we are
leaving for Sardinia.

656
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,526
Where did you find
the money for this?

657
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,201
Don't tell me. You've been
stealing from the bank.

658
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,430
Worse! Worse.

659
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,063
Worse?

660
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,667
Twenty years ago, I look after
some money for some kidnappers.

661
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,939
When they went to jail,

662
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,311
I was supposed to invest it,
build interest.

663
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,249
And for five years, I did that,
Marcello, I swear it. I swear it!

664
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,616
I believe you,
I believe you! Calm down!

665
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,349
Calm down!

666
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,984
Then I met Francesca,
and my life changed.

667
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,029
I told myself,
They'll die in jail.

668
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,928
Eh, so I started
spending money on her.

669
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,466
But one of them didn't die!

670
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,002
He's out,
and he wants his money!

671
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,128
How much are we
talking about?

672
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,500
750 million lire.

673
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,801
Shit, how much is left?

674
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,275
Not enough to make him happy.

675
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,676
He's going to kill me,
Marcello!

676
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,372
You've got to get away
from here.

677
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,178
You're right.
I'll see you later.

678
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,609
No!

679
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,116
Are you all right?

680
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,455
Can you stand?

681
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,436
I lost a shoe.

682
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,436
Oh, you're lucky
it wasn't your life.

683
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,005
Thank you, God.

684
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,186
Bruno!

685
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,759
Please don't be dead.

686
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:08,954
Please don't be dead.

687
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,499
Bruno...

688
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,997
Oh, what was that?

689
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,161
Oh, please.

690
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,296
I don't feel so good.

691
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,466
Oh, I'm going to find a phone
and call the hospital.

692
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,476
If you need blood,
I'll give you mine.

693
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,173
Marcello, I want to be buried
with Nina in the cemetery.

694
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,012
Oh, don't ask me that.
It's booked.

695
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,420
I have some money left,

696
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,787
money you could offer
to Capestro for his land.

697
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,359
Where?

698
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,419
First, you must promise to bury me
with my beloved Nina.

699
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,523
Oh, but there are
only three plots left.

700
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,469
Promise me, or that money
will rot where it's hidden.

701
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,039
Okay, I promise you.

702
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,141
- I promise you.
- Take an oath.

703
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,081
I take a solemn oath to bury you
in the cemetery with Nina.

704
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,014
So where is it?

705
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,915
It's under my wife.

706
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,750
Under your wife?

707
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:08,655
My dear Nina,
whose memory I shamed.

708
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,751
It's in her grave.

709
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,231
Bruno.

710
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,934
Bruno.

711
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,206
Bruno.

712
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,363
We still have to work on it.

713
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,763
But it will be
better on Sunday

714
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,132
if you move your lips,
Pasquale.

715
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,804
Father, something terrible
has happened.

716
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,966
I know, I know.
I'm on my way.

717
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,575
But how do you know?

718
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,544
The hospital telephoned.

719
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,173
At least his wife
had time to prepare herself.

720
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,308
Poor Gianna.

721
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,284
Are you
talking about Pavone?

722
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,856
Yes, and poor Aprea
will be next.

723
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,686
Then the cemetery will be full.

724
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,851
No, there are three places left.

725
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,191
Yes, but if
somebody else died.

726
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,764
Who else?

727
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,199
I don't know,
but, uh, these things happen.

728
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:31,172
Father, can you say
the last rites

729
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,765
after somebody is dead?

730
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,400
Well, I always
believed that the soul

731
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,308
does not leave the body
just like that.

732
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,437
There is time.

733
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,209
Good, but what do you say
when you give the last rites?

734
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,545
Marcello, don't worry.

735
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,553
When Roseanna's time comes,
I'll be there.

736
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,623
Thank you, but what do you say

737
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,692
if the time comes
and you're not there?

738
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,728
I say, "God bless this soul.
Take her into your kingdom. "

739
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,888
That kind of thing.

740
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,226
Thank you.

741
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,352
Forgive me, Nina.
It's only temporary.

742
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,272
God bless this soul
and take him into your kingdom.

743
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,239
He didn't get a chance
to atone for his sins,

744
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,969
but he would have atoned.

745
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,544
He wasn't a terrible person,

746
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,443
but as far as I know,
he was a good husband.

747
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,016
You've seen Francesca.
Who can blame him?

748
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,690
I forgot to say
this soul is Bruno Rossi.

749
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,185
Where have you been?

750
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,614
Where have I been?

751
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,450
You know where I've been.
I drove Rossi home.

752
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,114
That was four hours ago.

753
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,351
He needed to talk man to man.

754
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,825
About Francesca?

755
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,123
You shouldn't be up.
You need your sleep.

756
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,002
He has done something
he shouldn't.

757
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,632
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

758
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,335
I hope he's not cheating on you.

759
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,573
Cheating on me?
You're his wife. I'm only his guest.

760
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,547
Did he ever cheat on you?

761
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,580
I don't think so.
You know Marcello.

762
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,816
I know men.
Can you swear he never has?

763
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,491
Not with his whole body.
Just with his eyes.

764
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,863
With his lips, once or twice,
but never with the private.

765
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,230
You sure?

766
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,997
About the eyes, the lips,
or the private?

767
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,629
All of them.

768
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,672
Yeah, I'm sure.
I've seen him look.

769
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,440
Once I saw him kiss.

770
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,311
Mmm. But I knew in my heart

771
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,580
that the private
never left the barracks.

772
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,615
You all right, Roseanna?

773
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,476
Poor Rossi.
What a way to go.

774
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,611
He'd been drinking
all day and all night.

775
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,623
When the fire hit
all that alcohol... poof.

776
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,250
It must have been
quick and beautiful.

777
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,330
Ohh. Ahh.

778
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,265
I don't understand it.

779
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,358
There's no trace of a body.

780
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:59,038
Marcello, I hear you were
the last person to see Rossi.

781
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,109
Is that right?

782
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,178
Maybe, maybe not.

783
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,806
- But you drove him home.
- Yes.

784
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,907
And did you drive the car back?

785
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,007
No.

786
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,384
Look, he was drunk.

787
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,787
While he was asleep,
somebody stole the car.

788
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,061
Well, he's not in his house.
His bed was not slept in.

789
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,222
How do you explain that?

790
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,233
He got back in the car,
drove back to town,

791
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,633
but he was drunk,
and he crashed.

792
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,964
We found this
at the side of the road.

793
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:35,101
Look, when I was
driving him home,

794
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,578
he got desperate
and had to take a leak.

795
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,808
And that... that is when
he must have lost his shoe.

796
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,374
And maybe that is what
he was driving back to look for.

797
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,078
Then where is he?

798
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:48,157
Wandering about the countryside
with only one shoe.

799
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,988
Dazed, living on
rainwater and insects.

800
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,151
Please, mother,
you know it's for the best.

801
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,779
God doesn't want a man
to live that kind of death.

802
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,984
Milano 3, Roma 2.

803
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,959
Napoli 1, Torino 1.

804
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,029
What are you doing?

805
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,530
Reading him soccer results.

806
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:30,657
Why?

807
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,564
- He asked me to.
- He did?

808
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,330
Don't listen to him, mother.

809
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,905
The only thing alive
in this room is that machine.

810
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,339
She's right.
There are no life signs.

811
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,437
It's wrong for him
to lie here like a battery.

812
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,678
Life and death should be
in the hands of the Lord.

813
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,155
The Lord turned us on.
Only He should turn us off.

814
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,225
<i>Scusi.</i>

815
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,255
This is none
of your business, Marcello.

816
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,059
I love this man.
Of course his life is my business.

817
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,690
<i>Scusi.</i>

818
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,860
His death is mine!

819
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,200
Maybe we
should listen to Marcello.

820
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,206
- She's right.
- She's wrong.

821
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,106
<i>A mother is never wrong.
Scusi.</i>

822
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,613
For God's sake, you'll fuse
the whole bloody hospital.

823
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,273
Let him die, will you?

824
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,654
Good-bye, old friend.
I fought for you till the end.

825
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,693
Good-bye, my darling.

826
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,959
Good-bye, Papa.

827
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,566
Bye-bye.

828
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,900
He said bye-bye.

829
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,416
Bravo!

830
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,285
Sisters! Sisters!

831
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,982
Bye-bye.

832
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:07,921
No, I'm afraid I don't know
where Signor Rossi is.

833
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,124
Nobody does.

834
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,909
Please conclude
your summing up.

835
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,515
Are you finished?

836
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,522
Uh, no, sir.

837
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,888
The dog has been
a great source of comfort

838
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:41,430
to my client since his wife
tragically passed away six years ago,

839
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:45,126
and in my opinion,
he should not be put down.

840
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,170
He's wrong.
Bring my chickens back!

841
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,171
The dog must be kept chained.

842
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,264
Case dismissed.

843
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,211
Congratulations.

844
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:06,777
Yes. A major triumph
for justice and civil liberties.

845
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,484
So the dog is under
permanent house arrest, huh?

846
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,650
So why did you come?

847
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,820
I just wanted to apologize
for the other night.

848
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,956
Do you accept, or do you wish
to confer with someone?

849
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,193
Look, I'm sorry.

850
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,327
It's fine. It's okay.

851
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,932
Just for the record,
I was having a good time.

852
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,703
So was I.
And just for the record,

853
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,676
I did talk to my uncle
about the land.

854
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,905
That's not why I came.

855
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:32,345
But you know,
I'm not so sure it's about money.

856
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,713
It's about something else,
and he won't tell me what.

857
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,910
Well, it was nice of you to ask.

858
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,784
But tonight, we won't
talk about it anymore.

859
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,584
Tonight?

860
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,852
Unless you have another date?

861
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,411
- Amen.
- Amen.

862
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,251
Under your wife.

863
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,351
You can't have
put the money here.

864
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,124
What happened when you
bought your mistress a new dress

865
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,791
or took her on a trip?

866
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,837
Did you come here in the middle
of the night with a shovel? Huh?

867
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,273
Under your wife.

868
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,612
Under your wife.

869
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,421
What were you doing
back there?

870
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,620
I was talking to Rossi's wife.

871
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,253
You were talking to Rossi's wife?

872
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,457
Yes. I was telling her
about the accident.

873
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,399
But I said not to worry,
I'm sure he will turn up.

874
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,527
You're not going to work today.

875
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,129
- I have to.
- No! You're coming with me. Come.

876
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,957
What are you thinking?

877
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,859
I am thinking
that we're young,

878
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,330
and it's the first time
that we came up here.

879
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,596
And afterwards, you took my hand,

880
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:38,037
and you made me run
all the way down the hill with you.

881
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,145
Run with me again, huh?

882
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,049
You running?

883
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,877
I'm running.

884
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,146
- What?
- I tripped.

885
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,891
- Ahh!
- Ahh.

886
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,986
It's a long time
since we did nothing together.

887
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,801
Don't die, Roseanna.

888
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,145
Only if it's God's will.

889
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,249
I've never been so sure
about God's will

890
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,943
since He took our daughter.

891
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:38,093
This is a beautiful spot
for a cemetery. Huh?

892
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,659
Maybe they could move
Marcellina up here to be with me.

893
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,932
I asked. They said no.

894
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,940
Who said no? Why?

895
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,509
It's the law of the province.

896
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,677
Then we have to accept it.

897
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,445
I made a promise to you.

898
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,782
I know, but this is madness.
I don't want to kill you, too.

899
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,015
Why?
Who else have you killed?

900
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,461
Capestro would sell
if you offer him enough money.

901
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,228
There is no more money.

902
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,232
Francesca.

903
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,527
God, you really were afraid.

904
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:25,774
Nina.

905
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,328
Thanks for saving me
the trouble.

906
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,828
Oh, my God!

907
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,830
That's my money.

908
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,423
I've thought of nothing else
for 20 years,

909
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,368
except for wondering whether
that pig Rossi had spent it.

910
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,435
He might have spent
some of it.

911
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,403
Is this all?

912
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,811
<i>Jesucristo.
Where's the rest of it?</i>

913
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:06,882
I don't have it.

914
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,008
Don't shit me,
you son of a bitch.

915
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,346
He spent it.

916
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,751
He couldn't have spent
750 million lire!

917
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:15,790
Well, it's possible.
He has a girl. Look.

918
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,589
Expensive car.

919
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,156
Expensive clothes.

920
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,467
Expensive vacations.

921
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,559
And is he
with this whore now?

922
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,801
I'll find him.
I'll track him down.

923
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,705
But where is he?

924
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,914
Through here.

925
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:44,346
Don't screw with me.
I'm not in the mood.

926
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,545
This won't improve it.

927
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:53,095
You killed him
and took the money!

928
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,596
No, he killed himself
because there was no money,

929
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,393
because he knew
you were coming.

930
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:04,196
And this is how he choose to die?
He locks himself in a freezer?

931
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:07,276
Not exactly. I put him
in the freezer because...

932
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,572
It's another story.
You don't need to hear it.

933
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:22,181
For 20 years,
I've rotted my life away

934
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,316
with lowlifes and scumbags.

935
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:28,420
And you cheated me
out of my salvation!

936
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,226
Look, you have your freedom,

937
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,234
the sky, the trees,
the scent of the earth.

938
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,894
Money can't buy that.

939
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:38,872
So you thought you
could escape me by dying.

940
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,010
I don't think that was his plan.

941
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,603
He thought he'd
be safe from me in hell.

942
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,242
Well, he made a big mistake.

943
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,946
Here I come,
you son of a bitch.

944
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,783
No!

945
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,491
How could you do this to me?

946
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:03,190
What's wrong with you people?

947
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,859
Why? What?

948
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,163
L... what, uh!

949
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,066
God bless this soul
and take him to your kingdom.

950
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,465
You know the rest.

951
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,413
Marcello, I'm glad you're here.
I want to show you something.

952
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,744
- I really should get back.
- It won't take a moment.

953
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,555
The skid marks are here,

954
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,888
yet the car went
off the road over there.

955
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,256
What do you think?

956
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,592
- A deer.
- A deer?

957
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,894
Startled by his headlights.
He swerves across the road.

958
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,902
He thinks he hit the deer,
gets out to check,

959
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,802
forgets the hand brake,
the car rolls down the hill.

960
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,135
Then where is he?

961
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,904
We haven't found him
wandering around the countryside.

962
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,980
I have a theory
about that, too.

963
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,048
A man like Rossi spent his life

964
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,344
bound by office hours
and convention,

965
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,510
and then something snapped.

966
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,781
He's probably halfway to Tahiti,

967
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,357
where he will live in a hut
and paint nudes.

968
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,425
Nudes.

969
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,553
Nudes!

970
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,266
Marcello, where have
you been all day?

971
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,311
I've been attending
to business.

972
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,405
- Is Roseanna at the hospital?
- I don't think so.

973
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,110
When she gets back, tell her
I'm going to be late tonight.

974
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,812
You're going out again.
We're always busy tonight.

975
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,821
- I have something to do.
- Like what?

976
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,483
What's with all these questions?
You sound like my wife.

977
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,614
Marcello.
Marcello Beatto.

978
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,021
Who's that?

979
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:19,424
Francesca. Remember me?

980
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,860
Of course I remember you.

981
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,363
Bruno isn't here, you know.

982
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,195
What you doing here anyway?

983
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:27,964
He asked me to feed his cat.

984
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,937
His cat? I never knew
he had a cat.

985
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,770
Not many people do. He's kind of
private about things like that.

986
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,106
So where the hell is he?
I've been calling him for two days.

987
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,611
I don't know.
I thought he was with you.

988
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,078
He was supposed to be, eh?

989
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,979
I've been waiting
at Rome Airport for four hours.

990
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:44,416
So I've driven over
to this dump.

991
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,285
I will wipe my feet
on the way out.

992
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,492
So, he told you about me, huh?

993
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,225
He mentioned you, yes.

994
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,857
I'm surprised.

995
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,129
I was always
his little secret on the side.

996
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,798
Even after his sainted wife died,
he never wanted me to come here.

997
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,375
Maybe the place
is too full of memories.

998
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,206
It's too full
of mildew by the look of it.

999
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,672
<i>Cristo.</i>

1000
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,080
This wine's awful.

1001
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,082
Do you think he's found
another woman?

1002
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,182
Do you think one piece of ass
is not enough for him?

1003
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,420
Maybe he's on a cruise

1004
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,520
with some little slut
from the bank.

1005
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,098
Well, it's possible.

1006
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,224
Women find him
very attractive.

1007
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,632
<i>Excuse me.
Scusi. Hello!</i>

1008
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:38,036
He's middle-aged,
he's balding, he's a banker!

1009
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,335
I got to use the bathroom.

1010
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:43,737
Uh, here.

1011
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,410
Don't use the one downstairs.
It's not for a lady from Roma.

1012
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,756
Ahh.

1013
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,758
Where did you get that?

1014
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,794
He must have bought it
for me, eh?

1015
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:37,354
And if he didn't, the piece of shit,
he should have done.

1016
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:47,133
Wait! I want to see you
with it on. Please.

1017
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,142
Oh, you're right.
It's made for you.

1018
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,546
You look superb,
like a movie star.

1019
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,017
May I say one thing...
if Rossi's cheating on you,

1020
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,089
the man is a fool.

1021
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,949
If you're ever in Roma,
look me up.

1022
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,230
<i>Ciao.</i>

1023
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,695
What a bitch!

1024
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:28,314
How did you find that?

1025
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,818
I'm asking the questions here.
Where's it come from?

1026
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,550
It was ransom money
from a long time ago.

1027
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,490
Rossi gave it to me
just before he died.

1028
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,027
- He died?
- Yes.

1029
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,927
- How?
- He was hit by his car.

1030
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,296
I didn't say anything.
He'd take up a grave.

1031
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,801
Half the province
is looking for him.

1032
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,803
- Where is he?
- I put him in his deep freeze.

1033
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:50,963
What?

1034
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,701
To keep him fresh,
but don't worry,

1035
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,243
I promised to bury him
next to his beloved Nina.

1036
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:59,314
Maybe not next to her.
Maybe on the top.

1037
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,680
You're going to bury a man
on top of his wife?

1038
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:05,049
Well, it's not
an entirely unusual position.

1039
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,918
Marcello,
what are you thinking of?

1040
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,457
If he's not found,
he'll be a missing person.

1041
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,789
There'd be no inheritance
for his children.

1042
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,090
And he's got to have
a proper Christian burial.

1043
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,495
Roseanna's right.
You can't deny a Catholic that.

1044
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,533
- You heard all this?
- I couldn't help it.

1045
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:20,727
God damn it!

1046
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,771
I hate having people in this house
who are not married to me!

1047
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:27,399
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
We're all in this together.

1048
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,239
Yes, but what
are we going to do?

1049
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,405
He's been in the freezer
for two days.

1050
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,645
First thing we'll do
is pay a visit to the doctor.

1051
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,580
Roseanna,

1052
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,091
the timing on a death certificate,
it is crucial.

1053
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,684
It has to be precise.

1054
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,730
What difference does it make
if it's a few days off?

1055
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,959
He's dead.
He can't come back to life.

1056
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,728
I could lose my license,
my patients.

1057
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,770
Nobody pays you
anyway, Sergio.

1058
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,731
Why would Marcello do this?

1059
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,639
You know why.

1060
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,041
I'm sorry, Roseanna.

1061
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,048
It's too important a document.

1062
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,209
It's a piece of paper.

1063
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,048
Do you think
a death certificate

1064
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:15,453
should cause unnecessary
suffering to the living?

1065
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,323
You look a little tired.

1066
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,420
<i>You look exhausted.</i>

1067
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,556
Sergio, take a vacation, eh?

1068
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,566
You and Isabella.

1069
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,158
Go to Capri.

1070
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,329
In our dreams.

1071
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,999
What if we settle our account?

1072
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,837
Did you bring the chicken?

1073
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,157
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1074
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,595
I want to thank you, Cecilia.

1075
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,098
I can't think of another girl
who would have done this.

1076
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,602
I think it helps to have company
when you're defrosting a corpse.

1077
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,603
I have a lot to thank you for.

1078
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,508
And I'm sorry for
what I said last night

1079
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,774
about not wanting you
in my house.

1080
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,942
I understand. It's difficult
when people live that close.

1081
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,782
Do you hear a lot
of what we talk about?

1082
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:23,449
I know what Roseanna
has in mind for you and me.

1083
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,550
Oh, that.
Look, I have to tell you...

1084
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,289
Listen, you don't have to
apologize for not wanting me.

1085
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,661
Of course I want you!

1086
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,165
Any man would.

1087
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,859
What am I saying?

1088
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,904
Listen, with people
it's a question of chemistry,

1089
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,472
and it's not there.

1090
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,474
Are you saying
I have no chemistry?

1091
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:43,670
No, Marcello. You could
ignite a thousand hearts.

1092
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:47,215
But admit it, there's
nothing between you and me.

1093
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,910
I suppose so.

1094
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,417
It's a relief, huh?

1095
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,044
Definitely.

1096
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,924
Now we can be friends, huh?

1097
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,357
That would be nice.

1098
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,492
How is he?

1099
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,570
Medium rare.

1100
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,003
Another hour.

1101
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:19,805
So...

1102
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:22,145
what were you
doing here, Marcello?

1103
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,947
I came to feed the chickens,
like a friend would.

1104
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,954
Then I saw him.
Was a terrible shock.

1105
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:30,388
Then why is he sitting there?

1106
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:31,823
It was his favorite spot.

1107
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,157
Think of it. He knows
his life is slipping away,

1108
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,424
and this is the picture
he wants to take with him.

1109
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,160
Ah, yesterday you said
he was halfway to Tahiti.

1110
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,462
And the day before,

1111
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,161
I told you he was wandering about,
dazed and confused.

1112
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,171
And I was right.

1113
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,138
What about the sock?

1114
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,008
What about it?

1115
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,510
Does it look like
the sock of a man

1116
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,342
who's been wandering
around the countryside?

1117
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,313
My friend is dead,
and you're worrying about...

1118
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,716
the state of his socks?

1119
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,015
Doctor, you're the expert.

1120
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:04,115
In your professional opinion,
what time did he die?

1121
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,625
I'd say...

1122
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,786
a few hours ago.

1123
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,955
I'd like to call an ambulance.

1124
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,032
Very well.

1125
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,500
- I won't be gone long.
- Where are you going?

1126
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,238
Not to the hospital,
looking like that.

1127
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,973
Roseanna.

1128
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,143
May I come in?

1129
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,618
Yes.

1130
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,696
It wasn't easy for me
to come here.

1131
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:58,094
This place hasn't changed
in 20 years.

1132
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:01,004
There was never a woman
worth changing it for.

1133
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,616
You could have been
the richest woman in Trevento,

1134
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,057
and you chose a cyclist with a bar.

1135
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:22,130
Virgilio,
we cannot argue fate.

1136
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,494
Mine was Marcello.

1137
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:28,126
And see how fate turns around.

1138
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,136
He took the one thing I wanted,

1139
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:31,603
and I have
the one thing he wants.

1140
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,074
Then for the sake of the feelings
that you once had for me,

1141
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,610
give it to him.

1142
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:42,444
And will you give me back
20 years of happiness?

1143
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,110
Virgilio,

1144
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,654
I beg you,

1145
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,747
let the land go.

1146
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,258
All right.

1147
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,159
But first
I want an admission,

1148
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,499
an admission
that you made a mistake,

1149
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,267
that when you turned me down,
it was not only an insult,

1150
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,103
it was... stupid.

1151
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,508
That you married a man
who had nothing 20 years ago

1152
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:11,977
and has nothing now.

1153
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,447
That if you married me,
you would have had...

1154
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,108
everything.

1155
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,620
That I could have provided you
with better doctors than he did,

1156
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,122
and that your child
would still be alive.

1157
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,624
Admit that.

1158
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,854
Then you can have your land.

1159
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,399
This is so sad.

1160
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:35,965
You are so sad.

1161
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:40,132
Look at this house
that you live in.

1162
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,938
There is no soul.

1163
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,137
There is no joy.

1164
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,647
There is no peace.

1165
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:52,413
My life with Marcello
has been filled with these things.

1166
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,386
Step outside
of this opera you are living in.

1167
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,518
It is not me
you are angry with.

1168
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,857
It's you.

1169
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,988
Amen.

1170
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,125
He had a good life.

1171
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,600
His chickens,

1172
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,261
custom-made shirts,

1173
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,633
and a mistress.

1174
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,639
I'm not sure
she was a blessing.

1175
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,641
She didn't send flowers.

1176
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,143
Of course not.
His children were there.

1177
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:52,611
He'll be missed.

1178
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:53,681
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1179
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:57,081
We need a fourth for cards.

1180
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,585
You look beautiful
in black, Cecilia.

1181
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,089
It's just as well. It's the color
this town wears most.

1182
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,022
Strange way to die,
don't you think?

1183
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,093
No.

1184
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,095
Sergeant Baggio
had a word with me about it.

1185
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,186
Why?

1186
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,596
I'm a lawyer with some
criminal experience.

1187
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,602
He thinks we don't know
the whole story.

1188
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,104
- What does he think?
- Between ourselves?

1189
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,640
He thinks the Mafia
are involved.

1190
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,627
Roseanna, what's wrong?

1191
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,927
Nothing. It's just
one of my bad days.

1192
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,466
Do you need a pill?

1193
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,468
I just took one.

1194
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,128
Do you need the doctor?
He's in the bar.

1195
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,035
No, no, no.

1196
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,903
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1197
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,382
Roseanna, I'm going to
take the rest of Rossi's money

1198
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,007
and offer it to Capestro.

1199
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,949
It's no use, Marcello.

1200
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,325
Listen,
I have something to tell you.

1201
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,602
You know that I adore you.

1202
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,402
The first time I met you,

1203
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,636
you touched my soul.

1204
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:36,249
But there was a time
before I knew you.

1205
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,444
Is it possible?

1206
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:42,114
You know that I lived
on the Capestro estate

1207
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:46,125
with my parents,
who were servants there.

1208
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,286
I was 16

1209
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:51,763
when Virgilio came back
from the university.

1210
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:54,630
And he was...

1211
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:56,636
he was very handsome,

1212
01:22:56,738 --> 01:23:01,573
with all the arrogance
of wealth and youth.

1213
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:05,077
I don't think I'm going to like
what you're going to tell me.

1214
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,614
No, You're not.

1215
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,082
He seduced you.

1216
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,113
Not exactly.

1217
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,015
I'm sorry.

1218
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,584
I'm sorry, Marcello.

1219
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,596
I was very young,

1220
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:27,600
and I was flattered
by the attention of such a man.

1221
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,966
He asked me to marry him.

1222
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,539
Why didn't you?

1223
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,475
I met you.
It's that simple.

1224
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,615
So, you see,

1225
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,777
this is the anger
that he has in his heart for you,

1226
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,481
and money cannot
make this go away.

1227
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:54,662
You've done
everything you could.

1228
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,329
You have to let go now.

1229
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,583
Amen.

1230
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:44,512
Capestro!

1231
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,985
Half an acre.

1232
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,020
That's all that was
ever asked of you.

1233
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,679
Not only for my wife,

1234
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,280
but for all
the people of Trevento

1235
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:00,555
who wanted to be buried
where their ancestors were.

1236
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,062
If you have business with me,

1237
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,132
you come to me on a Monday

1238
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:07,667
and you talk to my lawyer.

1239
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:11,136
In front of God,
you're a sick man,

1240
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,139
consumed with
jealousy and hatred

1241
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,141
because of the woman
you couldn't have.

1242
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,870
Please, stop this.

1243
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,809
Stop this right now.

1244
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:22,007
I would be buried
10,000 kilometers from my daughter

1245
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,518
before I would take one thing
from the hand of this man.

1246
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,485
If you were half of what you are

1247
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,648
and he was twice what he is,

1248
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:30,951
you would still be ten...

1249
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,550
you would st...

1250
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,663
you would still be
ten times the man he is!

1251
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,399
Get the doctor! Quickly!

1252
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:42,902
I'm here, Marcello!
I'm here.

1253
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:47,475
Roseanna.

1254
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,534
Roseanna.

1255
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:48,168
I'm very sorry to tell you,
but Roseanna,

1256
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,100
my wife,

1257
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,173
my beloved,

1258
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:56,607
the most wonderful woman
that ever lived,

1259
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,611
has passed away

1260
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:03,115
This is not the time for weeping,

1261
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,618
it's a time for joy,

1262
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,280
because she will be buried

1263
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:11,688
in the last grave
of the cemetery with her...

1264
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,696
Marcellina.

1265
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,861
This she wanted more than life.

1266
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,267
This God has granted her.

1267
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,573
This makes me happy.

1268
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,045
Roseanna has her dying wish.

1269
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:24,623
I would have gone,

1270
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:28,059
but I thought
they wouldn't want me.

1271
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:30,562
You're probably right.

1272
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:35,635
I want you to draw up papers

1273
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:38,137
transferring the necessary land

1274
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,969
from my estate to the church.

1275
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:43,009
A deed of gift.

1276
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:47,639
Maybe now you'll
hate that family less.

1277
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:51,150
I also want you to know
I'm in love with Cecilia...

1278
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,652
and I intend to ask her
to marry me.

1279
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:57,524
Antonio...

1280
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,621
I loved her.

1281
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,167
It ruined my life.

1282
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,072
Hey, Cecilia!

1283
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,015
Hey, Cecilia!

1284
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,279
Cecilia!

1285
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,260
- Where is everybody?
- Gone.

1286
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:41,555
Well, gone where?

1287
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:44,130
Marcello wanted to get away.

1288
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:47,395
He has a cousin in Como.
Who can blame him?

1289
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,471
- And Cecilia?
- She took him to the station.

1290
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,095
I think she is going with him.

1291
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,042
Why not?
It was her sister's wish.

1292
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:25,137
Cecilia!

1293
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:31,871
- Antonio.
- Marcello, forgive me.

1294
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:33,640
Is this true?
Is she going with you?

1295
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:35,807
What is this all about, Antonio?

1296
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,111
You could at least
have said good-bye!

1297
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:39,243
There were so many things
I wanted to say to you,

1298
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:42,117
and I waited, out of respect,
until your sister had passed on.

1299
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,623
Why don't you put this in a letter?

1300
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,352
You're doing this out of duty!

1301
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,620
You don't love each other!

1302
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,356
And I do love you, Cecilia.
I really do.

1303
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,267
You are wrong, Antonio.

1304
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,639
We love each other
very much.

1305
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,936
Roseanna, I mean...
what's going on?

1306
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:04,944
<i>Ay yi! We were
almost on the train!</i>

1307
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,809
I have my grave reserved for me,

1308
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,178
but it can wait
until I am ready for it.

1309
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:12,650
In the meantime, Marcello
and I have some living to do.

1310
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,485
And Cecilia?
I mean, where is she?

1311
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,494
Keeping out of the way.
You can see her tonight.

1312
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,029
It's our secret,

1313
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,894
and if you care
about Cecilia, be part of it.

1314
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,636
Have a good life, huh?

1315
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:42,549
Marcello.

1316
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,631
Menu, sir?

1317
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:02,703
No, thank you. We'll be dining
on the plane to New York.

1318
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:06,935
You say that as if
you do this all the time,

1319
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,407
and you've never been
on a plane in your life.

1320
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:17,240
- We did it!
- Yes!

1321
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:23,452
But the first thing we have to do
when we go to New York

1322
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:27,118
is find a church and confess
to the priest for being so wicked.

1323
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:28,627
Have we been so wicked?

1324
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:31,630
Of course, or else
it wouldn't feel so good.

1325
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,135
Tell me something...

1326
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:39,638
is the mayor of New York
still Italian?

1327
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,402
Why would anybody want
to stop being Italian?
