that my mother's records were lost in a fire.

I was Googling on the Web, and I saw
that they were tearing down Fort Lambert.

She came into my room at bedtime.

156
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:56,812
It was two weeks before my 10th birthday.
It was a Sunday night, February 27, 1969.

157
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,015
She told me that she worked
at Fort Lambert.

158
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,752
She told me that there was something
locked away underneath the base.

159
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,020
Something bad.

160
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,793
And that it was up to me
to make sure that it never got disturbed.

161
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,764
She said it was in Sublevel 3, Vault 12.

162
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,932
And then she killed my father.

163
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,565

separate searches,

170
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,173

of the name Sears... It's nothing.

171
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,147
MAITLAND: Mr. and Mrs. Freeborn...

172
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,546
Your report says Sublevel 3 was cleared
10 days ago.

173
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,415
Vault 12 was empty.

174

- We wanna have another look.
- Washington has no record

175
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,459
of an Eleanore Sears
in the employ of the US Military.

176

177

Carrie and I found gaps
in the documentation of the activities

180
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,435
on this base during the summer of 1958.

181
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,869
High electricity consumption,
material deliveries

182
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,877
when official records
show no programs in operation.

183
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,242
And how does that impact
the accomplishment of our mission?

184
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,509
- Here. Today.
- Potentially in every way.

185
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,885
We suspect a secret program
was staged here in 1958.

186
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,417
There's no hard evidence yet,

187
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,517
but the residue of such a program
might still exist.

188
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,858
We can't ignore
what Frank Sears is telling us.

189
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:58,170
The 1950s was the black hole
of secret Cold War programs.

190
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,177
After Hiroshima, our military believed

191
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,339
future wars would be won
in a laboratory, not on a battlefield.

192
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,279
Unknown billions were spent,

193
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,580
secret laboratories set up
all over the country,

194
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,846
the best scientific minds enlisted to create
the warfare techniques of the future.

195
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,024
Discoveries were utilized
or written off as failures,

196
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,125
or deemed so hideous
they were shut down.

197
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,932
The very knowledge of their existence
buried in a labyrinth of

198
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,372
classified paperwork,
decades of blackout blocks of redacted text

199
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,538
and documents that always seemed
to end up lost or destroyed.

200

we thought the Army must know,

201

at some level, everything it's ever done.

It's 10 miles south, headed in.

Evacuate!

Carrie, I'm so sorry.

345
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:34,656
It's biological. Living tissue.
Growth rate off any known scale.

346
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,791
That thing?
That's what my mother knew about?

347
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,195
She said don't disturb it.

348
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,271
She wasn't crazy.

349
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,407
You know more about this.
You need to tell me everything!

350
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,344
I told you all I know. I said don't disturb it,

351
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,779
and you did. It's not about me anymore.

352
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,078
Sublevel 3, Vault 12
contained a sealed tank.

353
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,619
Inside that tank
was a diseased body of a man.

354
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,882
The organism grew out of this man's body.

355
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,857
What you saw grew out of this man.

356
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,027
- Where did you get this?
- The face, Frank. Look at it.

357

Your mother worked here
nine months before that.

- Colonel Maitland, sir.

Set up a command post in here.
Board up that plate glass.

00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,536
I want a secure line to weapon command.

- Yes, sir.
- Shourt! Fernandes!

Sir! Colonel Maitland.

372

Establish perimeter control.
Keep those civilians back.

- Kinoshita.
- Sir.

Put spotters on the roofs.
I want one there... There and there.

Yes, sir.

Sir,

377
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,417
the civilian, Frank Sears,
is connected to the organism.

378
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,987
His past might help us understand
the nature of the organism.

379
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,225
Specialist Freeborn,
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

380
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,498
We need cooperation at the highest level.

- Teegarden.
- Sir.

384
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,882
That civilian is still a prisoner.
Set up a brig inside.

It is now a contain and destroy operation.
Those are my orders.

388

You'll report to Sergeant Kinoshita
for supply duty until further notice.

389
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,735
Is that understood?

All right, let's get these tables cleared off.
Put the maps over there, radio here.

Supply staff, set up over there.

393
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,718
I need every civilian out of here, right now.

394

Quickly, quickly. Secure the back door...

This morning...

00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,845
The old Indian across the street,
he looked at me like... Like he knew me.

397
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,277
The man in the tank was your father, Frank.

398
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,944
Your biological father.

399
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,616
He knew my face.

400
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,887
He knew your father.

401
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,809
Sergeant Kinoshita's asking
for you now, sir.

00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,070
MAN: Army dude says it's a drill.

403
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,698
WOMAN: They brought in toxic waste
and dumped it.

'Cause the Feds don't wanna give the land
to our people.

- Screw you!

They're jumpy today.

All right.

409
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,197
- Can I help you folks?
- You recognized my face.

410
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,933
Sir, did you live here in 1959?

411
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:12,204
Grandpa, you know you've always
lived here, since you were born.

412
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,870
Kaz, go to the stockroom
and finish sweeping.

413
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,845
Look at my face.

414
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,712
A man worked at Fort Lambert in 1959.
He looked a lot like me.

415
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,814
I don't know anything about the base.

416
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:30,087
You used to work at Fort Lambert.
He's got a little forgetfulness issues.

417
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,162
But he's on meds and I help him.

We need to find out what it is right now,
before anyone else dies.

What happened in 1959 at Fort Lambert?

426
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,692
- The government swore me to secrecy.
- Well, the secret's out.

427
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,625
We opened Vault 12.

The government set him up at Lambert.

My job was feeding the monkeys,
cleaning up after them.

433

Toward the end, Yevgeni got sick.

434

Two days before he died,
he gave me a package.

435

He said never open it...

436
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,492
Unless a day like this would come.

437
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,862
The bridge is washed out.
We have to walk up this way.

438

01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,735
Initiate Mike 86 warning protocol.
Proceed with attack plan.

847
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:38,835
Roger that, sir.

848

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Aircraft, flying</i>
<i>in Fort Lambert, heading on zero-five-niner,</i>

01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,085
<i>you are in violation of restricted airspace.</i>

850
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:50,386
You need to immediately change course
to heading one-niner-zero.

851
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:53,757
<i>To repeat, heading one-niner-zero.</i>
<i>And leave that...</i>

852
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:13,375
<i>You are in violation</i>
<i>of government-restricted airspace.</i>

853
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,347
<i>Turn to one-niner-zero immediately.</i>

854
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,887
<i>You face an immediate military strike</i>
<i>on your aircraft.</i>

855
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,582

857
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,853
<i>There will be no further communication.</i>

858
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,865
They're still heading zero-five-niner, sir.
They're not moving.

859
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,640
- Take them down.
- Roger that.

860
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,351
I've got to put this down! Brace yourself!

861
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,511
This goes down to Sublevel 3.

862
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,423
Bullets didn't matter.

863
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,592
Knives.

864
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,224
Guy has the touch, though. Didn't hurt him.

865
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:43,470
The thing frigging died
when he put his hands on it.

866
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,972
Teegarden, what the hell
are you talking about?

867
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,805
He's got the touch.

868
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:54,041
He saved my life.

869
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,784
Stop here and set up a Sat-link.

870
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:02,787
I want pictures.

You got the coordinates set?

874
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:20,289
Yes, sir.

875
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,758

MCQUEEN: This is Fort Lambert, two minutes
ago. Last pass of the satellite.

879
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,698
Widen the view.

880
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,775
SHOURT: Crap!

881
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,048
MAITLAND: Zoom in. Track that movement
to the left.

882
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,914
MCQUEEN: Look, there they are.

883
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,347
Oh, my God. They're alive.

884
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,370
Vault 12 is that way, at the end.

885
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:32,423
Glenn! Glenn! Glenn!

886
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,240

890
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,036
Help, Frank, help!

Help! Frank!

892
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,486
Sir, something's happening.

893
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,129
The sucker's dying.

894
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,540
<i>MAN ON RADIO: Proceed south immediately.</i>

895
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,278
Make sure Air Force Regional Command
is seeing this.

896
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,911
- Yes, sir.
- Bombers incoming, sir.

897
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,196
This is Colonel Erik Maitland,
United States Army.

898
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,602
Request emergency interrupt
for General Torrence.

899
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,767
Look at your IRSat incoming.

900
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,741
The organism is dying.

901
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:46,905
I have personnel trapped
inside the blast zone.

902
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:50,473
Sir, strongly recommend
you abort mission.

903
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:52,544
Over.

01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:25,179
Could they have survived?

909
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:30,109
Whether they made it or not,
we're gonna be the ones to pull them out.

910
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,920
- Let's move out.
- Yes, sir!

911
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,007
