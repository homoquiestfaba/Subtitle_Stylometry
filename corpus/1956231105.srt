you're so sexy.

00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,836
I love dancing for you, babe.

199
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,134
CHARLIE: I love when you
dance for me, it's awesome.

200
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:58,469
I know.

201
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,401
CHARLIE: Are you
excited that we're going

202
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:00,636
to Mount Misery Road tomorrow?

203
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:02,369
BUZI: So excited.

204
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,202
I'm so excited.

205
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:05,903
I can't wait for that.

206
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,002
CHARLIE: We're gonna
have a great time.

207
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:07,871
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

208
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,569
You wanna sit down
and get some food?

209
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,167
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's
have something, I'm hungry.

210
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,271
- I'm starving.
- All right.

211
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,237
(WHISTLING)

212
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:27,268
So yeah, they have great
specials here, babe.

213
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,969
I come here many years ago,

214
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,101
it's the first time I've
been back here in a while.

215
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,602
They've got the shrimp
on Tuesday nights,

216
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,569
- they've got Monday night...
- Excuse me.

217
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:37,134
I didn't wanna be rude but
I thought I overheard you

218
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,939
talking about Mount Misery Road.

219
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,269
Yeah.

220
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,235
That's on Long Island,
that's where I'm from.

221
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,801
- Huntington.
- Really?

222
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:45,970
Really.

223
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:47,702
Interesting,
what a coincidence.

224
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:49,602
We're actually going
up there tomorrow.

225
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:52,569
We've been planning
our trip for months now

226
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,836
and we have this thing
about ghosts and orbs.

227
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,067
Really?

228
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,302
We're looking to see
if we can find some

229
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,170
in the woods over there
on Mount Misery Road.

230
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,772
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sure.

231
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,034
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Curt.

232
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:08,969
CHARLIE: This is Buzi.

233
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:09,871
- Hi Buzi.
- Hi, hi Curt.

234
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:14,835
So, I'm interested,

235
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:17,203
what can you tell me
about Mount Misery Road?

236
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:20,435
Well, Mount Misery
Road got its name

237
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:23,070
from the settlers
that were trying to,

238
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,402
you know, take their
wagons up the slopes

239
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:27,669
and on the rocky road.

240
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,135
That's why they named
it Mount Misery Road.

241
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,770
- (LAUGHING)
- Interesting.

242
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:32,605
Tell me more.

243
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,936
There were rumors of
strange lights in the sky

244
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:41,238
and sightings in the sky also.

245
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:45,401
There's a sighting
of a hell hound

246
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:49,034
or a man beast creature
that roams those hills

247
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:51,502
with red, glowing eyes.

248
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:52,568
- You believe this, Buzi?
- Really.

249
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,268
Yeah, that's creepy.

250
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,034
CHARLIE: It's
definitely creepy.

251
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:57,104
CURT: Yeah, it is.

252
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,070
CHARLIE: What else, Curt?

253
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,068
Then, in the 1840s,

254
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,504
there was an asylum built
on the top of the hill

255
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,068
for the insane, they kept
the insane in the asylum

256
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,969
because that was the
only way they could

257
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,870
treat them back then.

258
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,336
There was a patient named Mary.

259
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,402
Somehow she started
a fire in her room

260
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,835
and the fire burned
down the asylum,

261
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,835
killing all the workers

262
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:27,168
and all the patients.

263
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,402
- No way!
- Yes.

264
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:30,602
CHARLIE: That
crazy bitch, my god.

265
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,902
And then 10 years later,

266
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:36,101
they built another
asylum on the same spot.

267
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:39,702
But three months later after
that asylum was finished,

268
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,502
it burned to the ground also.

269
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,236
- You kidding me?
- No.

270
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:44,468
Not kidding.

271
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,269
CHARLIE: That's the
legend of that area?

272
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,503
That's the legend.

273
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,569
CHARLIE: That's
a coincidence, wow,

274
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,402
that's very fascinating.

275
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,436
And it's been said
that they can still

276
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,005
smell the burning building,

277
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:59,568
hear the screams of the
victims in the woods.

278
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,068
CHARLIE: You
believe that, Buzi?

279
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,901
That's scary.

280
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,838
CURT: It is creepy.

281
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,869
CHARLIE: Go on, tell us more.

282
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,735
There has been many
instances of mutilated bodies

283
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:12,035
and slaughtered animals
found in those woods.

284
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,269
The local residents
think that it's the work

285
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:16,069
of the man beast,

286
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:20,135
the hell hound that roams
those woods to this day.

287
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,035
CHARLIE: That beast with
those red, glowing eyes?

288
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,235
Red, glowing eyes.

289
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:24,703
CHARLIE: Hmm,
babe, that's the beast

290
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:26,636
- that we saw on that computer.
- Ew.

291
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,303
CHARLIE: My god,
that thing's ugly.

292
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:30,235
So that thing's still in
the woods, you think, today?

293
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,835
That's what they say.

294
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,835
CHARLIE: Really,
how do you know this?

295
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,337
Well, I read the
reports about this

296
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,035
when I researched
Mount Misery Road.

297
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:43,436
And that was mentioned about
the man beast creature,

298
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,304
the hell hound.

299
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,538
Well, from all
that I've told you,

300
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,669
my suggestion would be to stay
away from Mount Misery Road.

301
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:56,104
It's considered one of the
most haunted places in America.

302
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,102
There's been people that
have gone into the woods

303
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:02,302
and that they never
saw them again.

304
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,736
My god.
(LAUGHING)

305
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,969
CHARLIE: You know, we're
going up there tomorrow

306
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:09,736
and we're really, really
excited about this trip.

307
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,901
With all the shit
that's been going on there

308
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,104
that I've told you about,

309
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,603
the white lady with the robe

310
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,635
and the mutilated bodies

311
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:20,935
and the slaughtered animals,

312
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,102
it's not a safe place.

313
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:25,001
You have no business
going there.

314
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:26,405
What are you going there for?

315
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:29,602
The reason why
we're going up there

316
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:32,368
is that we are
ghost enthusiasts.

317
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,736
We like going to haunted places

318
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,904
to see if we can
find orbs and ghosts.

319
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,468
We like ghosts.

320
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,834
Right?

321
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:42,104
(LAUGHING)

322
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:48,570
Well, I'm warning you, stay
away from Mount Misery Road.

323
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,669
That land is cursed.

324
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:53,934
You and your girlfriend
can go into those woods

325
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:56,269
and never be seen again.

326
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,105
It's haunted.

327
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,738
Why would you and
your girlfriend

328
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,105
wanna be in there?

329
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,005
Okay, Curt, I really appreciate
what you're telling us.

330
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:08,834
You know, we've been
planning this trip for months

331
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,402
and it's taken us a
while to get this trip

332
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,005
and the money together to do it.

333
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,504
So, you know, we're even
meeting with a local historian

334
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,336
named Mike Gallagher, the
guy's well known in that area.

335
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,536
We've already confirmed the
appointment, he called us today.

336
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:24,835
So we can't back out now.

337
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:26,868
There's just too much
time invested in this,

338
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,569
too much money invested in this.

339
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,868
We're gonna go.

340
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,336
We're looking forward
to seeing if we can find

341
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:34,702
some orbs and, you know,
ghosts in the woods.

342
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:35,869
I can't wait either.

343
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,736
She's excited, I'm excited.

344
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:39,835
So we're really
not gonna back out.

345
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:42,770
We're not gonna cancel our trip.

346
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:47,201
You should listen
to what I'm saying,

347
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:48,468
to stay away from there.

348
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,734
You don't need to go there

349
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,635
because it's a
very haunted place.

350
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,268
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

351
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,735
I'm warning you, stay away
from Mount Misery Road.

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,268
Maybe we can see Mary
floating through the woods

532
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,702
during the day.

533
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:42,934
Do you know how many
times I've talked to people

534
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,534
about these things
over the years?

535
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,234
Seriously, you are
wasting my time

536
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:50,703
getting me up here on a
freezing Saturday morning.

537
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:53,936
These things,

538
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,769
whether they exist or not,

539
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,267
I don't know.

540
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,435
I've spent decades of my
life chasing these things,

541
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:02,301
these things you're
talking about,

542
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,970
these moth men and Mary.

543
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:08,068
There are all kinds of accounts.

544
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,234
The only thing, the only
thing that's factual is

545
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:14,401
a statistically high
number of people

546
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:17,933
have died or disappeared, I
don't even know if they've died,

547
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,534
I just know they're gone.

548
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,068
Vanished.

549
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,201
I'm here to tell you that I
wanna wash my hands of this,

550
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,101
I don't wanna talk to
people about this anymore,

551
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,601
I don't wanna draw
people to this area.

552
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:32,501
I don't want any
more people to die.

553
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,667
Okay, Mike, I really appreciate
what you're telling us

554
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,701
and I really respect that.

555
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:41,200
I was curious about the
asylum, Mary in the woods,

556
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:44,901
the old asylum that
burned down many years.

557
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:47,368
We've heard stories
of a hell hound

558
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,934
with these red, glowing eyes
that lives in the woods.

559
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:53,271
Just don't go
into those woods.

00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,568
CHARLIE: So
what you're saying,

561
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,934
it's a very dangerous
place to go.

562
00:37:56,936 --> 00:38:00,034
It's extremely
dangerous, in my opinion,

563
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,037
extremely dangerous.

564
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:05,301
You have to be a
certain level of stupid

565
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:06,434
to walk in there at this point,

566
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:07,969
after everything I've told you.

567
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:13,204
Don't do it.

568
00:38:15,036 --> 00:38:17,137
CHARLIE: What can happen
if we go in there at night?

569
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:20,671
You never know

570
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,335

00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,037
So what are you thinking?

575
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:47,901
I don't know, he
was very negative

576
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:49,571
on us going down
to Mount Misery.

577
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:51,270
BUZI: I know.

578
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:53,935
That wasn't really
a good meeting,

579

I thought it was
gonna be better.

kind of scary, I mean,

about it any more.

What are we doing?

583
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,235
Well, we came all
the way from Florida,

584
00:39:04,237 --> 00:39:06,801
so we might as well go down
there and check it out.

585
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:07,638
We're here.

586
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,638

587
00:39:10,537 --> 00:39:11,834
Yeah, I think we should do it,

588

we came all the way
from Florida to do this

589
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,200
so let's make it happen.

590
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:16,969

all right then.

00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,000

some ghosts anyway.

built by these people today,

these houses are basically
built on cursed land

and the people probably
don't even know it.

Look at the windows,
they're very creepy looking.

very, very spooky.

607
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:28,200
I read about this story though

608
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:29,470
about these two children,

609
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:31,769
supposedly they went missing

610
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,701
and the townspeople
would actually come here

611
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,867
and sit around the fireplace,

612
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,301

gonna have a search

613
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,437

705
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:03,900
Wow, this is the
top of the mountain.

706
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:04,869
- This is it.
- Wow.

707
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,833
It's amazing.
(LAUGHING)

708
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,270
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

709
00:45:22,535 --> 00:45:24,602
It seems like there's
nobody but us here.

710
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:27,169
CHARLIE: I know,
the place looks empty.

711
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:30,500
I guess we're the
only people here.

712
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:33,103
BUZI: Yeah, there is not
even one person walking.

713
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,369
Babe, give me the camera,
I want to film you now.

714
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:44,767
CHARLIE: Wow,
check that ravine out.

715
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,302
BUZI: Oh my god.

716
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:48,101
CHARLIE: Check
this out over here.

717
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:49,301
Look at this.

718
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:50,736
BUZI: Oh my
god, it goes down.

719
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:55,868
CHARLIE: This is why they
call it Mount Misery Road,

720
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,401
look at this ravine.

721
00:45:57,403 --> 00:45:58,236
BUZI: Wow.

722
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:01,334
CHARLIE: Try to
get a wagon train

723
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:04,300
coming up this valley
here, forget it.

724
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:06,202
- That's spooky.
- It's very spooky.

725
00:46:06,204 --> 00:46:07,201
(LAUGHING)

726
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:08,667
- Hey babe.
- Hey Buzi.

727
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:10,068
- Hey babe.
- Hey babe.

728
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,600
- Hey.
- Cold.

729
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,433
- I know!
- It's cold here today.

730
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:15,435
BUZI: I know, I know.

731
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:18,737
CHARLIE: Let's go up this
road over here, babe, come on.

732
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,168
BUZI: Oh my god, babe, look!

733
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,800
CHARLIE: Look, a cross.

734
00:46:32,802 --> 00:46:34,100
BUZI: Oh shit!

735
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:37,235
Wow, a black
cross in the woods.

736
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:39,102
BUZI: Oh shit, oh my god.

737
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:40,767
That's creepy.

738
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:43,200
CHARLIE: That's
definitely creepy, man.

739
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:45,000
Maybe that's a warning?

740
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,235
BUZI: That's creepy.

741
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:49,303
- Let's get outta here, babe.
- Okay.

742
00:46:55,736 --> 00:46:58,503
Babe, babe, come
here, come here!

743
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:05,369
Babe, come over here, oh my god.

744
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,370
Look at this.

745
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:11,134
- What is that?
- Wow.

746
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:12,699
BUZI: Oh my
god, what is that?

747
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:16,134
Is this a part of that
hospital, you think?

748
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:17,467
CHARLIE: Yes, it could
be part of the asylum.

749
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,500
- Yes.
- Like one of the posts.

750
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:20,801
- The wood posts.
- Look here!

751
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,600
- Look here.
- It's amazing.

752
00:47:22,602 --> 00:47:24,303
BUZI: It's all,
like, you know?

753
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,034
CHARLIE: Oh, it's
cool that you found that.

754
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:28,070
Wow, yeah.

755
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:31,070
Let's go find some more stuff.

756
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:44,768
Come on, babe.

757
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,135
CHARLIE: I'm right
behind you, Buzi.

758
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:48,402
(LAUGHING)

759
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,034
Buzi, it's gotta be
here in these woods.

760
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,403
BUZI: Yeah, I know.

761
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,601
Because we were walking
for like two hours

762
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:58,904
by now and nothing.

763
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:02,068
CHARLIE: The maps
say it's in this area.

764
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,703
I can't believe
we can't find it.

765
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:07,501
BUZI: I hope we're
gonna find something today.

766
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:09,903
CHARLIE: It's gotta
be around here somewhere.

767
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:17,302
- Be careful!
- Yeah.

768
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:25,267
Oh my god, babe, what's this?

769
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,334
Do you see this?

770
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:28,833
Holy shit.

771
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:30,266
CHARLIE: Whoa whoa, that
looks like an outcropping

772
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:31,901
of foundation stones.

773
00:48:31,903 --> 00:48:33,467
BUZI: Wow!

774
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:34,901
(SQUEALING)

775
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:36,000
CHARLIE: Oh my god.

776
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:37,199
BUZI: Oh my god.

777
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:39,467
Oh my god, look at that!

778
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:42,701
CHARLIE: It looks like it
could be pieces of the asylum.

779
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:43,503
Oh my god.

780
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:46,800
That's the foundation
of the hospital.

781
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,467
I'm sure!

782
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:49,435
Oh wow!

783
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:51,701
That's so cool!

784
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:54,070
CHARLIE: That's gotta
be pieces of the asylum.

785
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:57,403
Wow, god.

786
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,134
It looks like the
foundation of the hospital.

787
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:02,634
CHARLIE: You know, that's
exactly what I think it is.

788
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:04,001
Yeah.

789
00:49:04,003 --> 00:49:05,501
- It's gotta be.
- Look at that over there!

790
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:06,867
CHARLIE: Look, there's
more of it over there.

791
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:09,702
BUZI: Oh my
god, let's go look.

792
00:49:11,937 --> 00:49:14,034
CHARLIE: It looks like the
front entrance of something.

793
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:15,203
It was here.

794
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:18,569
(MURMURING)

795
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:22,234
Look at this.

796
00:49:22,236 --> 00:49:24,701
Look, it looks like a,

797
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:25,904
like a burn.

798
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,101
Is there some markings?

799
00:49:29,103 --> 00:49:29,768
CHARLIE: There's a
marking over there as well.

800
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,034
BUZI: Yes.

801
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:32,434
- In the cement.
- Here?

802
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,270
CHARLIE: Yes.

803
00:49:34,803 --> 00:49:39,133
BUZI: Look, look, I'm
sure it means something.

804
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:41,533
CHARLIE: Wow, I
can't believe this.

805
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:42,370
That's amazing.

806
00:49:45,334 --> 00:49:47,068
BUZI: What is that,
is that dirt or a burn?

807
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,200
CHARLIE: Looks
like it's burnt.

808
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,901
BUZI: It's burned, right?

809
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,466
- Huh.
- Wow.

810
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,566
That's awesome, babe!
(SQUEALING)

811
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,535
CHARLIE: That looks
like a burnt mark.

812
00:49:57,936 --> 00:50:00,070
BUZI: This is what we were
looking for all this time.

813
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:02,333
CHARLIE: Let's see
what else we can find.

814
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:03,168
BUZI: Okay.

815
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:09,533
Babe, I'm getting tired.

816
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,099
Do you have reception
on your phone?

817
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:12,968
CHARLIE: No, the
reception doesn't work here.

818
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,367
I just checked it a second
ago and it doesn't work.

819
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:16,169
BUZI: Shit.

820
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:19,603
I hope you know the way back.

821
00:50:20,736 --> 00:50:22,366
I don't wanna get lost.

822
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:23,633
CHARLIE: Well, I'm
sure we'll be able

823
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:24,903
to get outta here somehow.

824
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,065
Hey, Charlie?

825
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:41,566
CHARLIE: Yeah, Buzi?

826
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:43,200
Can I ask you something?

827
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:44,934
CHARLIE: Yeah, what's up?

828
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,766
I have a question
because I heard

829
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:50,267
that in these woods, you know,

830
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:53,501
when there was a fire in
that hospital building?

831
00:50:53,503 --> 00:50:56,833
There was some woman and
she was really depressed

832
00:50:56,835 --> 00:50:59,300
and obsessed and I don't know

833
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,334
what's going on
with that woman but

834
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,900
do you know anything about it?

835
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:05,366
Like what was her
name, anything?

836
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:06,601
CHARLIE: Yeah,
her name was Mary.

837
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:08,133
- Mary was the psycho.
- Okay.

838
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,933
CHARLIE: She
was the crazy girl,

839
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:14,801
supposedly, that she burned
all the people in the hospital.

840
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:16,067
No!

841
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:19,801
- Oh my god.
- 25 patients burned with her,

842
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:22,900
or supposedly she got
out and she survived.

843
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:26,233
But the whole thing
behind Mount Misery

844
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:29,132
is that she is seen
in the woods, walking.

845
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:30,334
- This is from, you know...
- No!

846
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:31,601
CHARLIE: Two, three
hundred years ago.

847
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:33,099
She's seen in the
woods still walking?

848
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:35,901
CHARLIE: Supposedly she
wears a white hospital robe.

849
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,199
- And she has this...
- Oh my god.

850
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:39,935
CHARLIE: Ghostly appearance

851
00:51:39,937 --> 00:51:42,603
and she hovers or
lurks in the woods.

852
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:44,800
Are you serious?

853
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:47,166
- Oh my god.
- And there's been screams

854
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:49,999
and howls and moans
from other patients

855
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:51,768
that walk the woods
and supposedly...

856
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,601
- Oh my god.
- People have seen them

857
00:51:53,603 --> 00:51:56,065
- around the area here.
- I can't hear it anymore.

858
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:57,566
Are you serious about it?

859
00:51:57,568 --> 00:51:59,866
She's like walking around
like that, like a ghost,

860
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:00,770
like a real ghost?

861
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:03,801
Oh my god, I wanna
get out of here, babe.

862
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:06,334
I mean, let's get out of here.

863
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:07,467
I'm really,

864
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:08,934
I'm really scared.

865
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:10,100
CHARLIE: I've gotta remember
where we are though, first.

866
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:11,333
I don't know where we are.

867
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:13,166
I don't know, let's
just go, let's just go.

868
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:14,400
CHARLIE: All right,
hold, all right?

869
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:15,633
We've gotta get our
bearings straight here

870
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:16,567
because I don't
know where we are,

871
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:18,099
we're gonna get lost now.

872
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,466
We're deep into the woods here.

873
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:22,133
Walk behind me, okay?

874
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:23,100
CHARLIE: I don't
know if we're going

875
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:24,466
the right way though, babe.

876
00:52:24,468 --> 00:52:27,333
I think, this doesn't
