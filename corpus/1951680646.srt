1
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,995
No!

2
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,844
I silence, small.

3
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,319
I believe that we will put you Billy Bob...

4
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,218
Yes, Billy Bob Hackford.

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
Royce, clean the table.

6
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,313
Carefully, and don't forget
of skinning the teats.

7
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:29,980
I need the two nipples.

8
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,361
Yes, I need the two nipples
so that you grow strong and big.

9
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,764
You are very important.

10
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,271
Put it in the table.

11
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,876
It continues fighting...

12
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,876
and I swear you for god that I will leave you
of the ass to the ear.

13
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,176
That thought.
Not you are silly.

14
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,123
Behind.

15
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,857
Calm down.

16
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,789
He/she thinks of our baby.

17
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,766
Degenerate bastard.

18
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,903
All that you have made for anything.

19
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,832
You hear me: anything!

20
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,771
Neither me neither my baby!

21
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,843
No!

22
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:39,825
It was stopped for my window

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:45,161
In a cloudy day

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,859
When I saw the coach coming closer

25
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,273
To be taken to my mother

26
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,942
Will it break the circle?

27
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,843
Somebody will break it

28
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,790
KNOTS OF IT BLEEDS

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,186
There is a better home in the sky.

30
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,803
25 YEARS LATER
IN A REMOTE PLACE DE KENTUCKY

31
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,036
You the full thing?

32
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,981
Aél.

33
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,167
How is my baby?

34
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,140
As that hurts my ass
of the road.

35
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,744
Amber Lynn.

36
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,778
I sit down it.

37
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,007
Where are you?

38
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:21,810
In a gasolineria of...
of the Highway 22

39
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,220
in front of a closed American.

40
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,121
As at three hours of the school.

41
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,089
How is Osito?

42
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,823
Tristeando like puppy
since you left.

43
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,133
He/she had never seen it that sad
since mom and dad died.

44
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,998
You see, he/she knew it.
This was an error, I will return.

45
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,774
Undoubtedly not.
Not I raised a defeatist.

46
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,839
Osito will be well.

47
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,010
 And if I don't achieve it?

48
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,815
Pamplinas Amber.

49
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,856
We already speak to it, you are only nervous
as always.

50
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,893
He/she looks, baby believes that they would give him/her a scholarship
to somebody that doesn't deserve it?

51
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,300
I suppose that not.

52
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,066
Which is our motto?

53
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,096
The force is of Strickland.

54
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,039
He is always and you don't forget it.

55
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,012
I dare and I always support you.

56
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,772
You are the best, brother.

57
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,111
You tell to Osito
that I loved my gift?

58
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,921
I will tell it to him, baby. We love you.

59
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,816
You call us as soon as you arrive
to the school.

60
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,925
I will make it, I promise it.

61
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,226
Good-bye.

62
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,797
Full.

63
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,103
How much do I owe him/her?

64
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,938
20.

65
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,789
Where is the bathroom?

66
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,756
Over there.

67
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,163
Carajo.

68
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,828
Oh carajo.

69
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,080
My mouth not, for heaven's sake.

70
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,350
What rays you didn't hear me
hitting leathers?

71
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,320
Well, put it with the other ones.

72
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,798
 And where prostitutes
is your brother?

73
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,166
Tell him/her that it takes out him/her the hooter
to the goats

74
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,168
and that it enlists the hole.

75
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,398
You go.

76
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,800
Long. It was.

77
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,872
lmbécil of the carajo.

78
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,185
Billy Bob, Squirm always makes that.

79
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,147
You need to train him better to that dog.

80
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,824
He/she is not an incestuous bastard a dog.

81
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,155
Not you can make he/she swims well.

82
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:12,259
Not you have finished?
Because me neither.

83
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,074
Do you think of those shit prostitutes?

84
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,850
I don't want them here.

85
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,848
Not it cares if you want,
what it cares is what wants pa.

86
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:34,189
That is a madness,
you send in the family, non pa.

87
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,862
I want us to have a baby.

88
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,057
You are crazy!
You are my sister, carajo.

89
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,963
You want more imbecile as
Royce and Squirm?

90
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,232
Now you go for your cortamierdas
and we continue him/her. We go.

91
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,137
Hour of working.

92
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,066
Commissary to base,
I go with Strickland.

93
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,283
Brody.

94
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,218
Feel commissary.

95
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,998
We call to the school,
their partners say that it didn't arrive.

96
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,826
 And the police of the school?

97
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,029
Did you report it, certain?

98
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,009
Brody, I have the tied hands
48 hours.

99
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,143
Not it is officially missing.

100
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,912
Perhaps he/she got lost.

101
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,250
Not it would be strange in university student.

102
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,122
Amber is not anyone!

103
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,916
Not we can make more.

104
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,090
Yes, because there is something
that I can make.

105
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,859
He/she listens, I will call you if I know something.

106
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,808
We will find the baby.

107
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,087
Did they want to see me?

108
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,026
Oh yes. Tell to your pa that takes charge
until we return.

109
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,827
I have many clients for tomorrow.
The arch season opens up.

110
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,274
To where do they go?

111
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,979
To hunt.

112
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,888
Hello pa.

113
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,157
We gather the girls
as you requested us.

114
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,202
Soon you will plant your seed.

115
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,842
She watches over them.

116
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,811
Yes Mister.

117
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,911
He/she only rests.

118
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,119
I love you.

119
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,787
Oh, princess woke up.

120
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,166
Where am I?

121
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,943
Hear, hear.

122
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,785
Do you want them to hear you?

123
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,753
Thinking it well, you call them.

124
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,024
Sure they like more than to me.

125
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,792
Be quiet incontinent dog!
You take two days crying.

126
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:15,356
 Which is your problem?
It is traumatized.

127
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:20,102
I care a carajo.
I am fed up with hearing it.

128
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,107
Good, I take conscious five minutes
and I am fed up with hearing you.

129
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
So leave alone it.

130
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,371
Or?

131
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,012
Or I will force you.

132
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,921
It is a threat
or a promise, prostitute.

133
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,022
Don't play me.

134
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,226
I sit down it.

135
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,393
I sit down it

136
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,133
the ones.

137
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,774
He/she closes the mamavergas.

138
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,030
Don't worry.
Everything will be well.

139
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,393
How do you call yourself?

140
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,133
Jenny.

141
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,369
Hello, Jenny, I am Amber.

142
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,009
 How much do you take here?

143
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,079
Two days. I believe.

144
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,320
 And her?

145
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,384
More...
But I am not sure.

146
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,369
They killed him,
they killed my boyfriend.

147
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,980
Jenny, Jenny,
I sit down it, really,

148
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,609
but I need you to concentrate.

149
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,779
Not I can think of this.

150
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:57,428
He/she listens, I can get rid
but I need you to help me.

151
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,024
Can you take out us?

152
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,956
Yes, but I need to know how many they are.

153
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,841
I only saw at three... but there is more.
I heard them around to my.

154
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,416
When do they bring the food?

155
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:25,855
A couple of hours after the dawn
and at dusk.

156
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,916
We have some four hours
after it dawns, so he/she sleeps.

157
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,451
Will you take me?

158
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,179
Yes.

159
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,414
Do you promise it to me?

160
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,184
Jenny, I promise it to you.

161
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,825
Now he/she sleeps a little.

162
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,382
Follow me closely.

163
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,088
 And Shawna?

164
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,820
We will have to send to the commissary.
To take out you is already difficult.

165
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,794
Very well, we go.

166
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,115
Don't become unstuck.

167
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,843
 What do you make?
We go

168
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,844
He/she waits one second.

169
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,417
Oh God.

170
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,968
Jenny, not!

171
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,910
Amber!

172
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,399
-Full
-Yes, Mister.

173
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,893
 Do you take charge?

174
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,339
Me alone for 30 years.
Since my dad died.

175
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,972
Did it pass this girl here?

176
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,944
No. Not I have seen this way anybody for here.

177
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,072
Sure he/she would remember it.

178
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,113
Yes, Mister, it is this way.

179
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,820
Does it also revise me the oil?

180
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,063
He/she hears, don't play.

181
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,705
ldiota.

182
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,351
Bear! Calm.

183
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,391
The picture that I taught you
he/she is our baby,

184
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,359
where is it?

185
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,154
They will kill me.

186
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,764
Not they will have opportunity.

187
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,932
I will only ask once again it,
where is my baby?

188
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,373
With Hackford...
they have it Hackford.

189
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,140
 And where the encounter?

190
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,814
He/she will never find them.

191
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,280
They are amid a thousand acres
of forests.

192
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,214
No road takes to its property.

193
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,817
You like the pain, old.

194
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:54,021
Follow the one on the way to the right,
that is all that I know.

195
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,926
They bring things so that the bandage.

196
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,834
Leave it.

197
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:13,780
He/she entered with some bad types.

198
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,852
Not he/she knows what is bad.

199
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,738
Jenny, is well.

200
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,912
But if you are the list.

201
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,090
He/she looks, I like rather silly.

202
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,219
Leave alone it.

203
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,557
I sit down it.
Not he/she means that he/she has forgotten.

204
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,009
Now, he/she gives me curiosity to know,

205
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,204
which of two o'clock he/she had the balls
of planning this escape?

206
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,955
Me. She didn't have anything to see.

207
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,050
Don't put it, yes, I was me.

208
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:31,925
Lower it.

209
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,099
As for you.

210
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,084
Are you one he/she will fear brave not?

211
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,231
And do you smell almost perfect you know?

212
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,207
Most of the girls vomits
for the scent of swiming in shit.

213
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,312
You don't care Ati.
You are special.

214
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,790
Squirm, lower it.

215
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,260
Leave it tied.

216
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,076
What the amusement begins.

217
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,876
He/she hears, leave alone it.

218
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,054
Let us go!

219
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,123
Don't come closer me, phenomenon.

220
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,204
Better he/she learns to behaving
and to play clean...

221
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,078
Candy! Below!

222
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,316
Why do you only have a good time?

223
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,012
And what carajos faces in the floor.

224
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,749
I care a carajo.
I asked you you to make something simple.

225
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,526
You are in the mistaken room.

226
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,763
They are the other girls!

227
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,992
Are you a cachorrita golfa and brave not?

228
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,381
They are my cream and cream.

229
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,251
Carajo.

230
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,484
You would prefer to violate a bell
that to leave that you joda my plan.

231
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,227
This shit will put an end to the family.
It won't improve it.

232
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,957
Everything because pa convinced you.

233
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:55,966
It obeys.

234
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,400
Good, the phenomena finished,
already leave to the carajo.

235
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,014
Crazy dog.

236
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,160
Jennny, loosen.

237
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,191
 What do you believe that it will happen?

238
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,899
Not I want to discover it.

239
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,062
Untie it.

240
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,535
I believe that it is better this way.

241
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,244
Not it cares how so cruel it is.

242
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,208
It continues belonging one to us
and we are meetings in this.

243
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,214
So you go and untie it.

244
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,363
They have the baby.

245
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,200
It only cares the family.

246
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,972
Life or death. This continues.

247
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:44,873
We go for her.

248
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,216
Silence.

249
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,524
Now, these are the rules:
there are not rules.

250
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,354
They will fight to death.

251
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,524
Have a good time.

252
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,956
Now, this is the situation:

253
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,463
One will kill to the other one
or I will kill them at two o'clock.

254
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,464
Now stop to lose my time.

255
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,743
Who does want to survive?

256
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:18,450
We have a winner.

257
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,992
We have more fights.

258
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,128
Take to the survivor
to my room.

259
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,336
It is hour of the reproduction.

260
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,974
 What does it happen?
Porfavor helps me.

261
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,317
Oh, I will help you.

262
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,090
In nine months,

263
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,967
after you have my son,
I will cut you the throat.

264
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,246
Is it enough he/she helps?

265
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,120
Now I will be the first that proves.

266
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,536
How you are.

267
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,319
What is that?

268
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,053
Cover you the hearings. Not listen.

269
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,362
Yes, that will work.

270
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:42,134
Make as if you were of purchases.

271
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,337
He/she should have left gagged you.

272
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:52,481
Oh yes. Then gag me.

273
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,312
Does he/she hear you are a Hackford?

274
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,483
Bear!

275
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,932
He/she takes care of your answers, boy.

276
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,194
Where is my baby?

277
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,070
 How do you go?

278
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,353
Amber, I don't want to die.

279
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,258
Not you will die, I won't allow it.

280
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,068
What you see, golfa campirana.

281
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,913
A dead one
or maybe a sexual toy.

282
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,423
Play well.

283
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,273
Good-bye.

284
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,848
Put to the crazy dog in their hole.

285
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,154
Jenny! They come here.

286
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:15,066
My name is Amber. She is Jenny.

287
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,006
How do you call yourself?

288
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,305
Dawn...

289
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:27,343
It is clear that it hurts you
but... what did it happen?

290
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,818
God. They made me kill a girl.

291
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,084
What?

292
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:43,194
It violated me...it violated me!

293
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,000
Degenerate bastards!

294
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,199
Calm down. He/she calms down.

295
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,535
They are playing with us.

296
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,304
They will make you kill her.

297
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,240
Then it grabs and you...

298
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,311
It is well, it is well.

299
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,797
Is it?

300
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,526
You want that
does it explode your ass again?

301
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,800
You think that you are the first he-goat
that it forces me?

302
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,942
Carajo, takes your number.

303
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,779
He/she takes care of what you say.

304
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,950
Her.

305
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,459
No...

306
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,284
Take to me... to me.

307
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,895
In this damned house, I choose.

308
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,830
But since you want to die
right now, we go.

309
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,459
I have just made I eat up you taught, pa.

310
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,494
You will have some beautiful children.

311
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:17,943
Not it is so bad.
If you are lucky and you win.

312
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,434
No!

313
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,997
Now, dogs...

314
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:05,891
who does want to live?.

315
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,878
Porfavor doesn't put under an obligation.

316
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,374
He/she leaves of pendejear
and it kills that dog.

317
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,320
Finish it.

318
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,361
I will kill you!

319
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,235
Do you like games?

320
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,566
I will catch and until
rotate your eyes in the nape.

321
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,933
And believe me piruja,
this donkey hooter will charge it.

322
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,041
No, dog;
I want it awake.

323
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,786
Take it with the other ones,
when he/she wakes up, I will be waiting for it.

324
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,118
And it takes out at last o'clock.
We have a fight more.

325
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,149
Amber!

326
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,225
No, no, Amber. No, Amber!

327
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,830
Have a good time, boys.

328
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,243
Don't force me to leave.

329
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,521
Here yes there are winners.

330
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,749
Peléen!

331
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:57,397
You make me be very bad.

332
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:02,063
 Do you want to fight?
Not you do want to fight?

333
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,951
Candy why you don't take me
to this thing to the room. Good-bye.

334
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,858
Royce, Squirm! I have them a gift.

335
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,590
They have like one hour
before he/she cools down.

336
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,066
Here not, take it to the other room.

337
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,553
Now, all world to the carajo.

338
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,758
Well donkey,
hour of another cavalcade.

339
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,444
Ah, how bad. I believed that you had died.

340
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,943
Yes, I also missed you.

341
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,559
Dawn and Jenny?

342
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:34,558
They are catching it to him out.

343
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,241
Weak prostitute.
Not you go anywhere.

344
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,768
-I have to go for Jenny.
-But if it is a dead dog.

345
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,508
Move!

346
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,210
My brother will kill me
if I allow leave again.

347
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,182
What?

348
00:55:56,252 --> 00:56:00,086
Yes, he likes variety

349
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,427
Candy is so soft and warm.

350
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,023
And I am hard and fry.

351
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,991
But he/she loves us at two o'clock.

352
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:21,375
Very well, the blood is thicker
that the water...

353
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,849
I was about being kind,
but they are not human.

354
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,391
Carajo.

355
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:42,059
I Go for Jenny. Don't move,
I return for you.

356
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,236
Why do you make this?

357
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,139
He/she closes the hole.

358
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,246
-What?
-Get undressed.

359
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,407
Please, porfavor,
don't make this.

360
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,814
Silence!

361
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:49,228
Now...do you want to continue speaking?

362
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,360
Well.

363
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,570
They will hear you.

364
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,334
Behind of you!

365
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,414
I see that my brother likes you.

366
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,485
I want my time of game.

367
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,054
Yes that your sister thought.

368
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,971
I already gorged of playing.

369
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,948
We only go for Dawn
and we will release ourselves.

370
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,022
Where is it?

371
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,184
In the other room.

372
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,015
Oh, Bear. Oh, Bear.

373
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,211
Where is Dawn?

374
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,288
Where the girl is
that it was in this room?

375
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,187
Where is Brody?

376
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,287
Very well. We will look for them.

377
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:52,575
Die!

378
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:11,091
It is hour of leaving.
Well, we go.

379
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,800
Oh, Amber.
Oh God. You are well.

380
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,110
 Against how many Hackford
do we face?

381
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,413
Not I know, they are a clan.

382
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,287
Is there smaller?

383
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,513
No; they are dead.

384
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,455
Very well.

385
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,757
Here the van is.

386
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,990
We should move 5 kms. to the northeast
for the forests to arrive.

387
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,231
Well. I dare and I will lag behind
to distract them.

388
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,496
I won't leave them in the absolute thing.

389
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,301
He/she listens, Amber, you have to make it.
It is necessary to liberate these girls.

390
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,803
Don't worry.

391
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,869
We have our things, we will rediscover ourselves
in the van. I promise it to you.

392
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,905
Well.

393
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,078
Well, we go, we go.

394
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,489
Candy!

395
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:57,895
The goose is already greased.
I am clever to catch.

396
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,983
Slower, I don't understand you.

397
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,352
 What? Royce.

398
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,100
They are dead, you hear me,
dead, carajo.

399
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,741
Go for the cousins!

400
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,468
Listen: they escaped again
those old cabronas.

401
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,277
I want them to bring them of turn
and live.

402
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,404
It is my future.

403
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,014
Go for them.

404
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,166
Not we will escape, brother.
It is hour of fighting.

405
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,050
Allow them to go.
We will reach them in one second.

406
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,086
Ahead.

407
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,329
Wait! Not I can continue.

408
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,396
They already come.
Not we can stop.

409
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:17,030
Very well, Dawn, is well.
Will we achieve it Yes?

410
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,932
Not you desconcentres.

411
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,939
It recovers the encouragement,
then we have that we move.

412
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,935
Well?

413
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:26,943
Well.

414
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,450
We lack it less than kilometer and half
for the car.

415
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,251
Will it achieve it?

416
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:44,125
It will achieve it, have this way to load it.

417
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,991
 What was that?

418
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,070
In march!

419
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,950
Now listen to me, boy.
Anything good it will leave this.

420
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:12,825
The best thing that can make
it is to protect your sister and to leave of here.

421
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:17,259
Don't worry about me.
I will be well.

422
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,231
You have always been strong.

423
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,436
Now I need you stronger than never
to protect your sister at all cost.

424
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,270
Well. I love you, boy.

425
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,242
Now ahead and salt of here.

426
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,108
Hour of correcting errors.

427
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,964
High!

428
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,241
This is my earth, he-goats.

429
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:21,954
Tell to pa that I will fix this.

430
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,377
We go, we go.

431
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,886
Very well, I will help my siblings.

432
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,092
So I will have to leave them one minute.

433
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,362
No, you cannot leave us.
Not I can alone.

434
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,802
Jenny, I need you to be strong.

435
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:41,234
I didn't abandon them to you.
And I won't abandon them to them.

436
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:50,112
He/she takes. He/she will give you value.
You will be strong as this bear.

437
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,522
Well.
We will be here when you return.

438
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:00,895
What?

439
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,328
We will be well.

440
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,867
Not I can tolerate!
It is too much.

441
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,100
Some minutes have only passed.
It is dark and they are too many forests.

442
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,438
Not he/she will return.
It looks for the keys and vámonos of here.

443
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,501
He/she always returns.

444
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,442
 What do you make?

445
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:28,983
I release myself of here.

446
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,814
We won't leave.

447
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,086
They are them! They are them!

448
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,788
Hurry!

449
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,431
Curse.

450
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,559
Not I can see anything!
Where are they?

451
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,562
Calm down. I look for the keys.

452
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,430
Not I want to die.

453
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,607
I found them.

454
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:58,540
No!

455
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:16,826
Grab it.

456
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,272
No! Aella not, carajo.

457
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,538
Prostitute's son.

458
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,746
Prostitute

459
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:40,946
Curse.
Catch it, imbecile!

460
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,334
No...

461
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:10,606
I go...

462
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,410
to run!

463
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:16,784
He/she dies, he/she dies.

464
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,753
He/she hears, calm. I am me.

465
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,159
I killed him, I killed him.

466
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,294
I know it. I already know.

467
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,466
But you made well.

468
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,901
But we have to leave. Do you understand?

469
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,781
We go, we go.

470
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:07,763
Bear!

471
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:13,537
Oh Bear, what pleasure he/she gives me to see you.

472
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,106
Where is Brody?

473
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:27,588
No...Brody not.

474
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,226
Good, I suppose that I still have you.

475
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,521
Hour of dying.

476
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,258
Oh, curse, does that hurt not?

477
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:27,441
No, Osito, I need you,
please you don't leave me.

478
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:31,106
I need you, Osito,
please you don't leave me.

479
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,581
Why carajos don't you die?

480
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,293
Because I am a Strickland
incestuous bastard.

481
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,362
Those are my uncles,
rustic prostitute.

482
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,103
 And is all that you have?

483
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,243
That yes it is a pretty one
face of the carajo the one that you have.

484
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:19,751
Now yes, dog.

485
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,575
He/she will have a good time me to catch.
You are so tight.

486
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,991
Go, square.

487
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,458
Hour of the reproduction, dog.

488
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:13,807
Not I can wait
to crack, golfa.

489
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,062
The heat finished.

490
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:07,459
 What did it happen?

491
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,399
He/she finished. All are dead.

492
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,099
It is only a thing to make.

493
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,263
What?

494
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:20,271
To gather to my family.

495
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:42,887
Thanks to God.
I believed that both had died.

496
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:46,231
Baby, is needed more than
an incestuous one to be taken to a Strickland.

497
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:53,404
Calm. Your brother and me
we will need time to heal.

498
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:54,566
Yes.

499
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:57,210
It seems that they had practiced it.

500
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,913
They were very well.

501
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,039
-Not you are the only cabrona in the family.
-No.

502
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,319
We go home.

503
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,018
Yes Mister.

504
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,924
I no longer need this.

505
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:23,095
You made me strong.
And I will always have here that.

506
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:30,202
Good, as always I say:
the force is with Strickland.

507
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,810
I help you.
