1
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,993
Don't you think I have
too much make-up on?

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,732
No, you look great.

3
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,969
Could you
open up your jacket?

4
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,943
Just, you know,
pull it open.

5
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,570
That's it.

6
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,239
Put your arm back
where it was.

7
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,976
Give us
a nice look.

8
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,881
Does this
seem strange to you?

9
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,982
No, it's high fashion.
It's sophisticated.

10
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,118
It's totally hot.

11
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,653
But my dress...
I feel sort of...

12
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,598
I thought you said
you liked this designer.

13
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,499
I do.
I'm just not sure.

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,538
I just don't feel
quite like myself.

15
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,539
Who does?

16
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,876
- Got your bathing suit?
- Yep.

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,543
- Your book?
- Yep.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,416
Got your jacket?

19
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,797
MC Whitie
or Winky Fresh?

20
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,998
Winky Fresh.

21
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,556
Excuse me...

22
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,222
do you know if
the buyer's here today?

23
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,232
What can I help you with?

24
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,325
I was wondering if the store
might be interested

25
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,393
in these things
that I made.

26
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,336
- Let's see.
- Okay.

27
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,409
This one has
a bird in a nest.

28
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,779
- Oh, delicate.
- Yeah.

29
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,784
What are these?
They're nice.

30
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,114
Thanks.

31
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,054
Don't you wish we were
little enough to sit in them?

32
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,227
Michelle Marks?

33
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,197
- Oh my God!
- Debbie Waldman?

34
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,857
Emerson Junior High.

35
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,425
- God, you look great.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,028
- What are you doing here?
- I made these chairs

37
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,665
and I was hoping the store
might want to sell them.

38
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,232
- Oh, they're so cute!
- Thanks.

39
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,371
What about you?
What are you up to?

40
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,938
I'm a pediatrician.

41
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,847
Are you kidding me?

42
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,783
No... why?

43
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,754
Oh, I don't know.
It just seems...

44
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,291
- it seems too fast.
- We're 36.

45
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,827
I know,
but we're not 36, 36.

46
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,920
Ahem...

47
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,522
How much would you
sell them for?

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,160
I would need to make
about $50 on each one.

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,965
That's a bargain.

50
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,975
Well,
I could take 40 maybe.

51
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,713
They're not
for us anyway.

52
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,748
Okay.

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,614
Remember that guy?
He made these little tables

54
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,486
- out of string.
- Yes, I remember him.

55
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,889
Nobody bought them.

56
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,993
Bitch!

57
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,690
Excuse me?

58
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,665
Nothing.

59
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,598
Dr. Waldman...

60
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,869
Yes...

61
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,002
- It was great seeing you.
- You too.

62
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,103
- You were always so creative.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,741
No, it was...
I just ran into someone...

64
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,217
I'll be there
in 10 minutes or so.

65
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,488
Annie? Hey!

66
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,522
How are you doing?

67
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,064
Are you ready
for our first date?

68
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,793
Pick you up later.

69
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,062
I want
to stay with you.

70
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,604
Honey, if you're having a bad time,
call me.

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,934
I want you to push off.
Push off with your feet

72
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,306
and reach out for me,
okay?

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,474
Good!
Reach out for me...

74
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,144
Yes!
Good, see?

75
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,619
How's you get
your hair to do that?

76
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,782
- Do what?
- Be so straight?

77
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,553
I straightened it.
I fried it like straw.

78
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,390
Feel it.

79
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,726
- Ew!
- Told you!

80
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,460
Okay, now I want
you to go for me

81
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,263
- to the other side.
- Okay.

82
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,997
All right, go.

83
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,663
Do it!

84
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,707
Kick, kick!

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,802
Tell your mom to wear
a bathing cap in there, okay?

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,246
What did she say?

87
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,648
She said you need to wear
a bathing cap in the pool.

88
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,822
You don't understand,
Paul.

89
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,361
I looked insane.

90
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,921
I was wearing this weird
see-through designer thing.

91
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,728
I felt like an idiot.

92
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,735
And I tried,
I really did,

93
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,930
but the fashion stylist
was so intimidating.

94
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,405
You should have seen the color
they had on my lips.

95
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,171
I can’t believe I'm
going to be in Vogue Magazine

96
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,270
- looking like that!
- Maybe you shouldn't have done it.

97
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,679
How can you
say that?

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,082
It's publicity for the movie.
I have to do it.

99
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,347
Posing
for a fashion magazine

100
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,254
has nothing
to do with acting.

101
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,916
So if some magazine
called and said

102
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,983
they were doing an article
on nature journalists

103
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,926
and wanted your picture,
you'd say no?

104
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,191
- Right.
- You're so high and mighty.

105
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,324
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

106
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,699
Everyone wants their picture
in a magazine.

107
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,705
- They do?
- Yes, if they admit it.

108
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,638
I just think...

109
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,166
if it's going to make you upset,
you shouldn't do it.

110
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,908
Maybe you think I'm
not attractive enough

111
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,212
to ever look good
having my picture taken?

112
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,954
I know you think
my arms are flabby.

113
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,724
I'm going
to the bathroom.

114
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,921
Like it?

115
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,964
It costs too much
but I think it's so pretty.

116
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,761
I don't see why
you need it.

117
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,634
Because nothing else picks up
the dark tones in the chair.

118
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,433
There's nowhere
to lie down.

119
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,070
I take them off
if I want to lie down.

120
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,513
Maybe I should
be making pillows.

121
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,949
Any luck
at the gift store?

122
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,987
No.

123
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,887
But I ran
into Debbie Waldman.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,117
Who?

125
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,557
Debbie Waldman.

126
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,423
From Emerson.

127
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,397
She used to be
such a loser.

128
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,093
Maybe you should
just get a job.

129
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,691
You know...
a job job.

130
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,259
Thanks
for your support.

131
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,634
Hi, honey.

132
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,105
Why are you eating
cookies before dinner?

133
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,573
They're the fat-free ones.

134
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,974
Doesn't make any difference.
They're high in calories.

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,977
Mom!

136
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,014
I didn't put them
in her hand.

137
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,946
- You bought them.
- She begged me.

138
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,809
- You're the mother!
- Still.

139
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,980
I thought
these weren't the bad kind.

140
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,724
- Let's go home. Bye.
- Bye.

141
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,038
- Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight.

142
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,343
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.

143
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,823
I hate my life.

144
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,296
You need
more of one.

145
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,491
Blah, blah!

146
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,864
Arturo stole
my commission today.

147
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,630
Are you serious?

148
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,103
Did you tell him
to fuck off?

149
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,436
Of course not. I have to work
with him every day.

150
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,068
Well, I would
still tell him.

151
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,436
- Oh my God!
- What?

152
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,812
It's my sister's movie.
She's in the ad.

153
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,851
She doesn't even have
a big part.

154
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,491
Hey, you're in Jane Magazine.

155
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,357
In an ad for your movie.

156
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,760
- Really? It must be tiny.
- No, it's big.

157
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,422
I mean your head is...

158
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,296
is half an inch big.

159
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,392
But it doesn't really
look like you.

160
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,232
I don't think
it's your hair.

161
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,603
Well, whose hair is it?

162
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,505
It's a little
Phyllis Diller-y.

163
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,600
It's frizzy?

164
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,645
No, it's not frizzy.
It's just...

165
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,840
- I don't know. Go buy it.
- I think I'll skip it.

166
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,180
Why are you panting?

167
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,243
Paul's over.
We're doing yoga.

168
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,222
What's so funny?

169
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,918
You guys
do yoga together?

170
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,427
- I'm hanging up.
- Bye.

171
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,998
She wasn’t excited?

172
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,863
No, she's not even
going to get it.

173
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,697
She said
your hair looked bad?

174
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,794
Like Phyllis Diller.

175
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,736
Was she jealous?

176
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,933
Are you kidding?

177
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,306
My sister's jealous
of everything.

178
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,436
Hey baby,
how's it healing?

179
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,212
You make $200,000
a year?

180
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,120
- Sometimes.
- Wow! God!

181
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,317
You could get
a personal trainer.

182
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,156
- I like running with you.
- Aw, still.

183
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,391
I tried to sell my chairs
the other day.

184
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,899
Nobody wanted them.

185
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,764
What a drag.

186
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,269
What does Bill say?

187
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,670
Oh, he thinks they're
an enormous waste of time.

188
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,073
He stepped on one
once by accident.

189
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,135
- If you can be freelance, do it.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,239
I worked so hard last year,
I hardly saw Jessie.

191
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,876
She spent almost
every weekend with her dad.

192
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,785
- Was he into it?
- He’s crazy about her.

193
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,621
When we
were growing up

194
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,855
I saw my father
maybe twice a year.

195
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,055
And he lived
like 10 blocks away.

196
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,564
Jessie's lucky.

197
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,532
Did your mom
ever remarry?

198
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,195
Oh no, unfortunately.

199
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,864
She hasn't been with anybody
in a really long time.

200
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,804
I think she's pretty lonely.

201
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,437
- How did you get this?
- I had a mole removed.

202
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,707
I see.

203
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,874
We're gonna do
a little here.

204
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,780
I don't want to do you
with the wrong pen.

205
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,183
- You're gonna draw on me?
- I'm gonna draw on you.

206
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,417
- We're gonna do a little here.
- That tickles.

207
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,254
This is the hard part.
Just look forward, okay?

208
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,295
You'll have a chance to look at
my arts and crafts in a minute.

209
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,126
Then we'll do
a little on this side

210
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,496
so that
you're not lopsided.

211
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,398
Then we do
a bigger chunk

212
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,903
right here in front

213
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,768
with a happy face on it.

214
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,936
I really should
exercise more.

215
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,378
It's not lack of exercise.

216
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,746
It's loss of elasticity.

217
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,751
Mother Nature.

218
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,811
You can expect to lose a little
weight through skin loss alone.

219
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,981
- Skin loss?
- Yes.

220
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:09,221
We're going to tighten
your skin here

221
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,991
and then down here
where it's stretched.

222
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,124
What do you do with the skin
when you're through with it?

223
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,328
We send it to pathology.

224
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,070
One option is donating it
to a burn center.

225
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,810
Sorry, I feel a little dizzy.

226
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,246
- Oops!
- Sorry.

227
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,285
Have a seat.

228
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,445
Put your head
between your knees.

229
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,785
Hold your head.
That's it. Much better.

230
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,519
Come on, Vince.
Come on.

231
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,254
Vince?

232
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,319
Can't you smell it?

233
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,594
Are you going to come
to the premiere with me?

234
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,228
You should take someone
you'll have more fun with.

235
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,903
I want to take you.

236
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,738
Then I'm there.

237
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,211
Good doggy,
yes you are.

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,111
Good dog.

239
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,548
- Sweetie?
- Yeah.

240
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,219
How many dogs are you
going to have?

241
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,891
I don't know.

242
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,360
- You're kind.
- You think I'm an idiot.

243
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,091
I think you spend
too much time saving lost dogs.

244
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,913
Thanks, Gina.

245
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,917
Did you ever cheat on Dad?

246
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,252
No.

247
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,257
Why not?

248
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,123
I don't know.

249
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,890
We did this threesome
thing once,

250
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,364
but it was more of a joke
than anything else.

251
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,891
A threesome?

252
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,905
Don't look at me that way.
Everybody was doing it.

253
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,497
You shouldn't
tell me shit like that.

254
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,601
Maybe you should try it.
Loosen up a little.

255
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,238
- Ha ha!
- What do you think?

256
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,883
They're a size eight.
Should I buy them as a reward?

257
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,976
How do you know
you'll be that small?

258
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,350
Dr. Crane said so.

259
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,116
Can you believe it?

260
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,020
I'm finally gonna get rid
of my gut!

261
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,889
I don't understand.
Nobody sees you naked anyway.

262
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,795
Will you take care of Annie
while I'm in the hospital?

263
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,428
- I thought it was out-patient.
- It is,

264
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,869
but I won't be well enough
to do anything for two days.

265
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,635
So that's how long she'd stay
with you. Is that okay?

266
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,610
It's a lot with two kids, Mom.
Can't Elizabeth do it?

267
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,976
You have no job

268
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,709
and Maddy has a ton
of play dates.

269
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,251
Okay, I'll do it.

270
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,413
Don't expect me to do it
with joy all over me.

271
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,786
I won't.

272
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,984
It's a lot, that's all.

273
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,959
You mean Annie's a lot.

274
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,120
Mom, I'll do it,
okay?

275
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,094
- What's it for?
- The hell of it.

276
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,666
- You're so sweet.
- No, I'm not. I'm regifting.

277
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,611
It has self-esteem
and tranquility or something.

278
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,739
I'm so happy
for it.

279
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,806
No, jerk, you burn it

280
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,250
and it helps you have
self-esteem and tranquility.

281
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,912
- Should I be offended?
- Hell no.

282
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,785
I have them burning
all over my house.

283
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,825
Listen,
I have good news.

284
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,292
They want you back
on Riot Act.

285
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,797
I can’t believe it.
I didn't think I did that well.

286
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,561
Well enough, obviously.
They want you to meet with Kevin.

287
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,727
- You're kidding me?
- No.

288
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,795
- Oh my God.
- This would be the best break.

289
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,273
I'll never get it.

290
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,333
They want to see
the two of you together.

291
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,076
You mean he wants
to read with me?

292
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,583
Yeah, but mostly
to see if you guys are...

293
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,812
you know, hot together.

294
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,787
It's a chemistry read.

295
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,084
Don't look at me.
I think he's gross.

296
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,861
Mom.

297
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,367
- What?
- Come read with me.

298
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,337
Come watch Hickory Dog.

299
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,236
- Hi.
- Hi.

300
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,078
How was work?

301
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,052
Where's Maddy?

302
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,919
Reading in her room.
Come sit with me.

303
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,661
- What are you watching?
- Hickory Dog.

304
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,634
We haven't had sex
in so long.

305
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,073
It hasn't been
that long.

306
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,111
Yes it has.

307
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,840
Donna says, how often
do you guys have sex?

308
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,144
I'm too embarrassed
to tell her the truth.

309
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,186
Why does Donna want to know
how often we have sex?

310
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,687
Just talking.

311
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,690
So you want to have sex

312
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,953
so that you could have
a good answer for Donna?

313
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,698
Why do you have to be
such a prick?

314
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,700
I don't understand.
Are you saying

315
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,169
that you want to have sex
with me, that you miss it?

316
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,035
Or are you accusing me
of something?

317
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,801
Because that's what
it feels like.

318
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,905
How could you?

319
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,111
- I don't understand.
- Is that him?

320
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,915
Yeah.

321
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,512
Do you think he's sexy?

322
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,114
He's a movie star,
everyone thinks he's sexy.

323
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,057
I think he's repellent.

324
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,220
So does my agent.
Don't tickle.

325
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,992
- I'm not.
- That tickles.

326
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,330
My meeting with him
is on Thursday.

327
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,371
I have no idea
what I'm gonna wear.

328
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:58,103
- It doesn't matter what you wear.
- Of course it matters.

329
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,008
I have to be sexy.

330
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,912
It's all based on whether
or not we have chemistry.

331
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,040
Clothes have nothing
to do with chemistry.

332
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,744
He'll think you're sexy
or he won't.

333
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,583
You're being naive. I have to put
some energy into what...

334
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,419
Oww! You stuck
your nails into my back.

335
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,959
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tickle.

336
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,828
Why are you
so against me?

337
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,961
What?
I said it was an accident.

338
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,939
No, what you said about
my audition, my clothes.

339
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,941
I have a deadline.
I have to work.

340
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,772
That's all.

341
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,280
I’ll call you
tomorrow.

342
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,745
The truth
should be known.

343
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,588
Mom,
what's a "lippen section"?

344
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,789
It's a procedure they do
to make you look thinner.

345
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,231
Why?

346
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,463
So I can look better,
feel better about myself.

347
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,505
It's an improvement.

348
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,343
I want to tear
my skin off.

349
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,879
What?

350
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,211
I want it to be
the same as yours.

351
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,548
You're skin's gorgeous.

352
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,588
But I like yours.

353
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,885
But mine is wrinkled
and old and saggy.

354
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,289
Why would you want
to have skin like that?

355
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,089
Mom, they’re clean
already.

356
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,466
A man flirted with me today.
He was at the drycleaner's.

357
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,305
You spend too much on dry-cleaning.
You should hand-wash.

358
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,867
Is that really the point?

359
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,606
What is the point?

360
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,807
Nobody wants my chairs.

361
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,409
- Did you try a lot of places?
- Just one.

362
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,511
Part of me is relieved.

363
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,522
I think deep down
I just want to keep them.

364
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,420
Why does it
make you mad?

365
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,520
Because
you're not nine.

366
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,758
- Oh!
- You need to make a living.

367
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,767
That's probably why
you don't want to sleep with me.

368
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,531
First of all,
you got that bladder infection.

369
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,596
Then you had
that yeast infection.

370
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,665
Oh, God!
You make me sound so appealing.

371
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,903
Why don't you just admit

372
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,208
you're not attracted
to me anymore?

373
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,680
I'm still
attracted to you.

374
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,585
I am.

375
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,370
- Hi.
- Hi.

376
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,202
Mom's getting
cut up now?

377
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,712
- In surgery?
- Pretty soon.

378
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,805
Do you want to know
what she did the other day?

379
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,814
What?

380
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,283
She was taking me
to my date with Lorraine.

381
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,119
She got into the car and tried to
drive but forgot to turn the car on.

382
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,388
- She's a mess.
- Like what do you mean?

383
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,224
She's totally
out of it.

384
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,161
Like what
do you mean?

385
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,165
It's a choice.

386
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,669
She goes through life in a daze so
she won't have to deal with reality.

387
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,262
And what's reality?

388
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,638
Reality is what is.
It's like the facts of your life.

389
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,405
Mom doesn't like the facts
of her life so she tunes them out.

390
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,344
What's wrong
with her life?

391
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,382
Nothing, if you consider
that she has one.

392
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,212
She's not alive?

393
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,879
Never mind.

394
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,258
I'll see you in recovery.
It'll be a piece of cake.

395
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,923
What kind... mocha?

396
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,002
God, I can’t believe
I just said that.

397
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,471
He's not
interested in me.

398
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,235
He's probably married.

399
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,005
And no offense, Mom, but this man
will be seeing your fat.

400
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,603
- Yeah, but you know.
- There's no "yeah, but. "

401
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,013
It's not like he'll be seeing you
in a bathing suit.

402
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,349
He'll be seeing your yellow,
puffy, lumpy fat.

403
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,058
Right. He probably
dates 20-year-olds.

404
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,458
Yeah, probably.

405
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,690
So how are you
and Paul doing?

406
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,392
I don't know.
He won't give me a break.

407
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,401
He's withholding.

408
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,664
Why do you say that?

409
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,206
He knows what you need.
He won't give it to you.

410
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,141
He doesn't have the patience
for my insecurities.

411
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,303
That's so manipulative.
It's as if he wants you

412
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,971
feeling uneasy.

413
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,107
- Okay.
- Oh, here we go.

414
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,153
- See you later.
- I hope so.

415
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,780
- Good luck on your audition.
- Thanks.

416
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,791
If Kevin McCabe doesn't like you,
he's a fag.

417
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,421
Bye, Mom.

418
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,958
- That was outstanding.
- It's so good to meet.

419
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,901
- You did a fantastic job.
- You were so funny.

420
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,631
What a pro!

421
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,866
Thank you for coming.

422
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,536
- We'll keep in touch.
- We'll be talking to you.

423
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,579
You're not
leaving town are you?

424
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,807
No, she's not
going anywhere.

425
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,440
She's staying right here.

426
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,281
- Bye.
- Thanks again.

427
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,150
Elizabeth,
are you ready?

428
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,712
- Yes.
- Come on in.

429
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,260
He was great with actors.

430
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,262
Everyone thought
he was great.

431
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,730
It was a great
experience.

432
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,391
I heard it was
a great movie.

433
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,230
- Great.
- Great.

434
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,862
Did I say "great"
a lot?

435
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,396
I guess I'm just
a little nervous.

436
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,136
Nervous is cute.

437
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,611
So Elizabeth,

438
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
what do you think
is sexy?

439
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,813
U mm...

440
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,411
Sunset walks
and candlelight dinners.

441
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,457
What kind of sex do you have
with your boyfriend?

442
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,919
You heard me.

443
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,330
That's private.

444
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,699
You're right.

445
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,968
Forgive me. I was just just trying
to get a feel for what you find sexy.

446
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,236
Why don't we try
reading the scene?

447
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,777
Let's do this,
okay?

448
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,073
Okay.

449
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,982
What we need
here is hot.

450
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,416
You two are about to rip
each other’s clothes off.

451
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,475
Okay? Okay.

452
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,646
Gotcha.

453
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,317
- Ready?
- Yeah.

454
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,862
How do you know
they'll find us?

455
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,956
Maybe we'll be hiding
here for the rest...

456
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,228
No, no...
hotter, hotter.

457
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,735
Seduce him.

458
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,799
How do you know
they'll find us?

459
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,643
Maybe we'll be hiding here
for the rest of our lives.

460
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,306
Would that be so bad?

461
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,145
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

462
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,518
On what we'll be doing...

463
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,489
while we're hiding.

464
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,354
What if we did this?

465
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,228
Don't be scared of me.

466
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,398
Remember, I'm a stock broker,
not a movie star

467
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,375
and you want to fuck me
more than you’ve ever wanted

468
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,002
to fuck anyone
in your life.

469
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,980
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay?

470
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,642
Let's take it from
"depends on what we'll be doing. "

471
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,980
It depends on what we'll be doing
while we're hiding.

472
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,252
What if we did this?

473
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,511
Maddy, come here.
I want to put sun-screen on you.

474
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,640
Jessie, you too.
You're gonna burn.

475
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,245
Should I put some on?

476
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,415
Lucky you,
you don't need sun-screen.

477
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,015
That's right,
you're lucky.

478
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,617
Why don't
I need sun-screen?

479
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,959
'Cause your skin can’t burn,
it's already brown.

480
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,727
It's so incredible
what your mother did.

481
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,496
She must be a saint.

482
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,731
She did it for herself.
She was lonely.

483
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,705
Still,
it's so much work.

484
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,868
I don't know anyone who would
adopt a kid at that age.

485
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,775
She saved that girl's life.

486
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,279
She does do a lot for her.

487
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,816
- Okay.
- Okay.

488
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,711
Look, Mommy,
look at me.

489
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,256
That's nice, honey.
That's good.

490
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,791
That's so good.

491
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,254
Is she all right?

492
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,728
She's playing.

493
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,200
Oh.

494
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,035
She can hold her breath
a long time.

495
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,268
Yeah, she just
wants our attention.

496
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,401
Annie?

497
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,679
Annie!
Stop it.

498
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,010
What!

499
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,578
That's not funny.
You made us nervous.

500
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,021
Sorry.

501
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,656
It was definitely the hardest thing
I’ve ever done.

502
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,165
But I felt like I really
accomplished something.

503
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,464
I asked for the epidural
when I wasn’t even dilated.

504
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,504
I didn't mind the pain.

505
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,972
I felt like a different person
when it was over.

506
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,238
If I could tolerate that,
I could tolerate anything.

507
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,006
- You made it.
- Hey, guys.

508
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,274
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Daddy.

509
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:34,478
I had no idea your brave wife
did natural childbirth.

510
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,918
- She's phobic about medication.

511
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,319
That's not why.

512
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,529
They sell wrapping paper
already made, you know?

513
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,895
This is handmade
wrapping paper.

514
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,797
Let's go visit Mom.

515
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,496
She's still in recovery.
We'll go later.

516
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,162
I want to be there
first thing.

517
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,070
We have to wait
for Bill to get back.

518
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,073
Where is he?

519
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,168
He went to help Donna
get a stereo.

520
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,703
- I want to go now.
- No, later.

521
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,716
You're not the boss of me.

522
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,877
I am too,
when Mom's not here.

523
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,079
Fuck you.

524
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,253
Fuck you.

525
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,390
Hello.

526
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,523
Oh, hi.
Is she out yet?

527
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,205
Hi, Mama.

528
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,798
Is it over?

529
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,206
Yeah.

530
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,212
- How do you feel?
- Nauseous.

531
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,148
I hurt so much.
I never should have done this.

532
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,845
How are we doing,
Jane?

533
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,785
I might throw up.

534
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,517
It hurts too much.

535
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,116
You're gonna
feel better soon.

536
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,493
We're gonna have to keep
your mom here a couple of days.

537
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,055
Because she's nauseous?

538
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,533
She needs IV fluids
for the dehydration

539
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,469
which resulted from fluid shifts
that occurred during the surgery.

540
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,029
It's not uncommon.

541
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,011
I did...
I'm happy to tell you...

542
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,069
remove 10 pounds
of fat.

543
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,084
I think you'll be
very pleased.

544
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,379
You're welcome.

545
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,049
I thought it was supposed
to be outpatient.

546
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,059
Supposedly,
it's not that big a deal.

547
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,958
Lots of patients
have to stay over.

548
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,656
It sucks because Mom said
the nurses don't want

549
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,700
to pay attention to her because
she had cosmetic surgery.

550
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,794
Her doctor's gorgeous.

551
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,339
Mom's lying there
and you're looking at her doctor?

552
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,567
It's not like I can’t do
two things at once.

553
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,631
Still.

554
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,678
There's no still.
Thank you.

555
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,009
This food
looks disgusting.

556
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,844
I think it looks good.

557
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,143
That's so weird.
He should be home by now.

558
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,017
I know, yeah...

559
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,887
Don't worry,
I'm sure everything is fine.

560
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,051
He probably just went
to do some errands.

561
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,288
I'm sure
he'll be home soon.

562
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,923
That's awful
about your mom.

563
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,162
Okay, take care.

564
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,432
- What's wrong with her mom?
- I don't know.

565
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,905
Let's go.

566
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,465
But I want to stay
with Mommy.

567
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,671
You can’t, Annie.
We’ll come back tomorrow.

568
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,374
Then I want
to go home.

569
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,178
You can’t do that either.
We're going over to my house.

570
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,151
I want to sleep
in my own room.

571
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,245
I'll sleep there
with you if you want.

572
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,017
- You will?
- Sure.

573
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,489
Can we get ice-cream?

574
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,527
You just ate
an enormous lunch.

575
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,118
But I'm still hungry.

576
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,562
You're not going
to understand this now,

577
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,429
but being a fat teenager
would not be a fun thing.

578
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,093
God, leave her alone.

579
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,138
Just like Mom.
Nobody wants to take control.

580
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,174
Were you a fat teenager?

581
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,937
- She was the Homecoming Queen.
- What's that?

582
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,841
Don't listen
to what she's saying.

583
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,709
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

584
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,511
I do too. You should see
what this kid eats.

585
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,643
What are you
staring at?

586
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,091
She seems so indifferent
sometimes.

587
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,253
I think if Jessie and Maddy
weren't so close

588
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,729
I wouldn't hang out
with her as much.

589
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,460
Did she buy
an expensive stereo?

590
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,865
Mid-range.

591
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,802
Where'd you go after
you dropped her off?

592
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,669
Had to wash the car.

593
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,506
I'm really worried
about Mom.

594
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,809
I'm sure
she'll be fine.

595
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,474
How do you know?

596
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,950
I don't.

597
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,351
I guess it's just
what you say.

598
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,550
Wow!

599
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,026
Oops!

600
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,326
Why don't you just fucking stick
a knife in my back?

601
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,129
It was an accident.

602
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,329
- This is the second time.
- It was on the floor.

603
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,428
I was working on it.

604
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,599
I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.

605
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,769
I had a horrible day at work.
I'm really sorry.

606
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,870
Why, what happened
at work?

607
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,939
Arturo basically
stole my commission again.

608
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,985
You should tell that guy
to fuck off.

609
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:01,916
I can’t.

610
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,920
Why not?
He takes advantage of you.

611
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,512
You don't understand.

612
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,820
What don't I understand?
You don't stick up for yourself.

613
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,827
Sometimes,
that's not the priority.

614
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:14,661
- What's more important than that?
- Keeping my job.

615
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,498
- You're the manager.
- And Arturo is the boss' nephew.

616
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,093
Still.

617
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:22,838
What?

618
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,967
You can’t just run around
telling people to fuck off.

619
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,671
Oh yeah?

620
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,542
Fuck off.

621
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,549
You've got a lot of nerve
telling me how to act at work

622
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,915
when you haven't had a job
since I met you.

623
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,216
You were suppose to contribute
once Maddy went to school.

624
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,813
I'm trying
to sell my art, Bill.

625
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,756
Fuck your art!

626
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,854
You stepped on this
on purpose.

627
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,187
- Hi.
- Hi.

628
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,832
You can’t sleep
on that pillow.

629
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,336
Why not?
She's got 5,000.

630
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,965
That's one
you can sleep on.

631
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,125
I don't think
Michelle likes me.

632
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,524
Oh, honey...

633
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,291
Michelle just
doesn't like herself.

634
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,566
Did you have breakfast yet?

635
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,761
No.

636
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,827
When were they
suppose to come?

637
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,339
I saw them walking around
with trays an hour ago.

638
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,000
Excuse me...

639
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,566
Hey!

640
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,306
- Want me to get you something?
- No, I'll wait.

641
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,405
You guys should go.
It's a nice day.

642
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,279
I was gonna
take Annie to Lorraine's

643
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,410
but maybe we should cancel
and stay with you.

644
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,113
Yeah, maybe we
should stay with you.

645
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,746
No way,
go have your date.

646
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,053
I have an appointment
but I'll go another day.

647
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,356
Get out of here.
I get to watch trash TV.

648
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,760
All right.

649
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,297
Ouch!

650
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,593
Sorry.

651
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:31,967
Bye.

652
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,936
Just think,
10 pounds of fat!

653
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,707
Hey, so did
you get that job?

654
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,109
I don't know.
My agent hasn’t called me back.

655
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,841
Bye.

656
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,947
When I was a kid

657
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,418
you sold some
of my artwork here.

658
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,853
Oh, I didn't
work here then.

659
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,187
I know.
I'm just saying...

660
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,126
Anyway, this one
has little ducks on it.

661
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,096
Oh, look
at the little ducks.

662
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,761
This one's...

663
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,166
What is that one?
It looks like a little...

664
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,171
it looks like a little turd.

665
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,174
It's not a turd.
It's a rose.

666
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,800
Ah, good.

667
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,811
I don't know how
to tell you this,

668
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,211
but nobody is going to buy
handmade wrapping paper.

669
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,112
It's too expensive.

670
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:23,142
Well, it's for people who
don't really care about money.

671
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,086
But that's absurd,
isn't it?

672
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,622
Listen, mister,
this shit is pretty.

673
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,684
Then I suggest
you try someplace else.

674
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,592
- Thank you.
- Okay, fine.

675
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,528
If you don't like it,
it's your loss.

676
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,294
Get out of my store.

677
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,925
- Asshole.
- Freak.

678
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,527
That little bitch!

679
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,866
Hi, I'd like
to apply for the job.

680
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,540
No way!

681
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,545
Why not?

682
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,808
You look like my mom.

683
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,279
If I haven't developed pictures
before, will somebody train me?

684
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,515
- I will.
- Don't look at me like that.

685
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,957
- You said I look like your mom.
- My mom’s cute.

686
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,862
Can I have this job or not?
Whom do I have to talk to?

687
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,901
My dad owns this place.
Aren't you gonna give me a smile?

688
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,628
If I'm gonna
give you the job...

689
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,765
- You're hired.
- Thanks.

690
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,578
Are you sure your mom said
it was okay to do this?

691
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,874
Yeah.

692
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:02,316
My mom didn't let me get my hair
straightened until I was 15.

693
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,481
Do you know
your real mom, Annie?

694
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,584
- You mean my birth mom?
- Yeah.

695
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,289
She couldn’t take care of me
because she was a crack head.

696
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,832
Man...

697
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,266
that's a lot
to grow up with.

698
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,897
Well, my older sisters
have it hard too.

699
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,739
They didn't know their dad anymore.
He's not even a drug addict.

700
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,143
And Elizabeth... she's an actress
but can’t get good parts

701
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,943
because she needs
better muscles.

702
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,246
And my other sister
has it hard too

703
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,377
because her husband
wants her to get a better job

704
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,115
and stop making hobbies.

705
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,250
Guess what, Annie?
You've got it harder.

706
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,289
Why,
because I'm fat?

707
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,697
Because you're Black.

708
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,828
But Mom's rich.

709
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,772
That doesn't
make any difference.

710
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,436
Do you know the one about
the kid who had the Black mother

711
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,069
and the Jewish father?

712
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,138
Should you be going around
telling Jewish jokes?

713
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,308
Why not?

714
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,751
I don't know.
Because people might get mad.

715
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,515
I'm Jewish.

716
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,648
You are?

717
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,419
I think so.

718
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,655
Oh.

719
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,163
Well, go ahead.

720
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,325
So the kid
goes up to his mom

721
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,029
and says,
"Am I Black or am I Jewish?"

722
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,435
And the mom says,
"Why do you want to know?"

723
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,269
And the kid says,

724
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,639
"There's this bike
that I want

725
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,940
and I don't know whether
to bargain them down

726
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,502
or steal it. "

727
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,909
Don't you have
a sense of humor?

728
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,818
I'll be back.

729
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,221
This has to stay on
for 20 minutes.

730
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,020
Okay, whatever you say.

731
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,366
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming in?

732
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,029
I have a lunch
in 10 minutes.

733
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,539
- I brought you something.
- What's it for?

734
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,235
I'm regifting.
Just kidding.

735
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,036
- This is so cool.
- My sister makes them.

736
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,173
She wants to sell them
so I'm helping her.

737
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,114
Plus, you're always
buying me things.

738
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,982
I love it, thank you.

739
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,918
I know I shouldn't just pop in
but I hadn't heard from you.

740
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,926
It's not going
any farther.

741
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,392
What did they say?

742
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,026
They said you were great
but not quite right.

743
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,538
I can’t believe it.
They told me I blew them away.

744
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,437
I'm sure they were
impressed with you.

745
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,100
They just want
to keep looking.

746
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,279
- I'm shocked.
- Don't take it personally.

747
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,905
Should I?

748
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,242
I just said not to.

749
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,378
I wasn't going to
until you said that.

750
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,523
What did they say about me?
I want to know.

751
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,459
They said you were great.

752
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,722
Come on!

753
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,526
They said
you weren't quite right.

754
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:04,901
More.

755
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,800
They said...

756
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,101
you weren't sexy.

757
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,369
They said I wasn't sexy?

758
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,277
Kevin McCabe
is a weasel.

759
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,350
Who is it that actually
said I wasn't sexy?

760
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,354
Did they use
those words?

761
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,251
- Was it the director or...
- Elizabeth?

762
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,316
Who the hell knows?
Who cares?

763
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,198
I can’t do this anymore.

764
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,825
- I just can’t.
- Be positive.

765
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,893
You're in a movie
that just about to open.

766
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,835
I play the neighbor.
I have two scenes.

767
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,134
You're in the poster.

768
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,437
You know how many people
would kill for that?

769
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,003
I think you're sexy.

770
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,048
- Can you get me a job?
- I can have sex with you.

771
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,141
Don't joke.
This is hideous.

772
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,810
The profession is hideous.

773
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,459
Didn't he go out with Rosie Campbell?
She's not pretty.

774
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,719
What?

775
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,698
I have to work.

776
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,565
You don't have a lot
of sympathy for me.

777
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,629
Since I chose
this profession,

778
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,538
I shouldn't feel bad when
I get rejected?

779
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,907
This is so boring.

780
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,275
Boring?

781
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,541
Elizabeth,
it's not personal.

782
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:30,519
Maybe you should
date an actor or something.

783
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,046
Someone who goes through
the same things as you.

784
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,648
You don't want
to see me anymore?

785
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,923
I don't think
I can give you what you want.

786
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,859
What is it that
you think I want?

787
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,491
You want a girlfriend.

788
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,163
Someone you can talk
about your upper arms with.

789
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,703
That's so mean.

790
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,927
- What happened to your hair?
- Do you like it?

791
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,098
- It’s cute, isn't it?
- Yeah.

792
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,536
- Did you do this?
- Her mother said it was okay.

793
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,772
No way she said it was okay.
She’s eight.

794
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,407
- Don't look at me.
- Who am I suppose to look at?

795
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,883
- You were taking care of her.
- She said it was okay.

796
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,681
I trusted her.

797
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,418
Pull it in...
and then out

798
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,586
and then press in.

799
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,199
Hey, Splooge!
Splooge!

800
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,233
The pictures ready yet?

801
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:56,740
You probably splooged
all over them, didn't you?

802
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,537
You like the one
of Jennifer topless, don't you?

803
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,579
Was that before
or after her boob job?

804
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,444
Real perceptive
for "cock boy. "

805
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,676
Fuck you.

806
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,742
One-hour photo boy
said fuck you.

807
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,412
Some of us have to work,
dickwad.

808
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,046
Work?

809
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,216
Does that include splooging
all over pictures

810
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,759
of my girlfriend?

811
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,955
I didn't look at them.
I didn't splooge on them. I hate you.

812
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,622
Yeah, sure.

813
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,294
Hey, assholes,
you forgot to pay me.

814
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,972
Idiots.

815
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,509
I really worry about Annie
if I died.

816
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,347
You're not gonna die.

817
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,717
You're gonna have
a flat stomach.

818
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:48,383
No, but one day,
if I die before I'm really old.

819
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,223
I got two daughters,
but I don't know.

820
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,595
One of them
is really fucked up,

821
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,657
and the other one
isn't married.

822
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,202
I think about the things Annie
will have to face in her life...

823
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:08,403
and I just want to cry.

824
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,777
She's lucky to have you.

825
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,248
She's not lucky.
She’s entitled.

826
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,979
Every child's entitled
to a mother.

827
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,680
This is coming along fine.

828
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,246
I'm gonna send the nurse in
to change the dressing.

829
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,655
- Thanks.
- Okay.

830
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,261
Jane,
you're gonna be fine.

831
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,855
And you're
gonna look great.

832
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,513
- Hello.
- He just flirted with me.

833
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,212
You're deluded.

834
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,414
I'm not kidding.
I think he might like me.

835
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,581
What are you, 14?

836
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,488
Why couldn’t
he be interested in me?

837
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,995
The guy is your liposuction doctor.
Leave it at that.

838
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,089
- Don't be so negative.
- God, this is depressing me.

839
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,657
I gotta go.

840
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,600
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

841
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,695
Where've you been?

842
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,234
- What do you mean?
- It's 9:00 and you didn’t call.

843
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,336
I told you I went
to the movies with Jay.

844
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,903
You didn't tell me
anything.

845
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:22,441
You forgot.

846
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,551
I got a job.

847
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,194
It pays $8 an hour.

848
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,362
What is it?

849
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,059
I work at
a one-hour photo.

850
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,193
There were no toll-booths
in the area?

851
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,033
Hey, I took a job.
Happy?

852
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,939
Did you take it so
you could talk to me like that?

853
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,239
I took the job because you wanted
me to work. Now I'm working.

854
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,746
- Good for you.
- Good for you!

855
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,190
Jesus!

856
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,590
Nurse!

857
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,096
Nurse,
I know it's only lipo,

858
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,928
but would somebody
please come and help me?

859
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,360
$ 10,000 fucking dollars

860
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,906
and I'm laying here
on the fucking floor.

861
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,243
Some nurse came by after about
15 minutes and she was rude.

862
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,576
That infuriates me.
I wish you’d called me.

863
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:25,842
I couldn’t move.

864
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,577
Does your doctor know
what he's doing?

865
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,553
It seems like it. He says I can
go home in a few more days.

866
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,084
Aw, I'd give anything
to take a shit.

867
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,822
Is your insurance
paying for this?

868
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,887
No, I'm going broke.

869
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,132
Listen...

870
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,898
you will take care of Annie
when I die, right?

871
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,599
Mom, you already
know that.

872
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,835
I hope nothing happens
to you

873
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,844
because Michelle's not
really an option.

874
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,277
I'll say.

875
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,246
What about Paul?

876
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,579
How would he feel
about it?

877
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,620
Why are you smoking?

878
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,489
Paul and I broke up.

879
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,528
What is his problem?

880
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,893
Why do you assume it's
his problem?

881
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,023
Maybe it's my problem.

882
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,498
You don't have
any problems.

883
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,230
You think I'm perfect?

884
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,967
I think you're lovely
and amazing.

885
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,703
I'm narcissistic.

886
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,109
- You are not.
- It makes Paul sick.

887
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,171
He makes you feel bad
about yourself.

888
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,412
I felt bad about myself
long before I met him.

889
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,419
Well, if he loved you

890
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,978
he'd make you realize
how wonderful you are.

891
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,890
Forget it, Mom.

892
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,327
I saw an old man with a tube
coming out of his throat.

893
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,935
I can barely
look at you.

894
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:56,939
- Mom, it's an improvement!
- It is not an improvement.

895
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,998
I loved your hair.

896
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,566
When are you coming home?

897
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,441
Soon.

898
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:08,109
Why'd you have to come here
in the first place?

899
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,050
Elizabeth,
take Annie somewhere else.

900
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,553
Do something fun.

901
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,887
Come on, Annie,
let's go.

902
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,591
Bye, Mom.

903
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,292
And buy her a hat.

904
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,799
- How many came out?
- All 36.

905
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,601
Thanks.

906
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:35,236
Jesus, you'd think they'd send
these to a better lab.

907
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,044
So...

908
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,310
what does your husband do?

909
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,318
He's a personal
sound engineer.

910
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,819
What the hell is that?

911
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,323
He installs stereos
for rich people.

912
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,053
You're kidding. I need a C D player.
Could he get me a deal?

913
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,152
Why should he get you
a deal?

914
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,164
Because I'm
his wife's boss.

915
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,290
Good point.

916
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,927
Those guys that came in here
the other day...

917
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,939
they paid me back.
It’s cool.

918
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,942
- I'm shocked.
- They're all right.

919
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,910
They were just showing off
in front of you.

920
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,412
I see...

921
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,449
You have
a lot of friends?

922
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,246
Oh yeah.

923
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,220
You could say...

924
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,450
you know,
kind of a cult thing.

925
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,992
Oh yeah.

926
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,550
I see.

927
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,653
Do you have
a lot of friends?

928
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,723
No actually, I think people
are too self-involved.

929
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,497
Don't they know
how cute you are?

930
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,698
I think I'm too old
to be cute.

931
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,640
No way,
you're pretty cute.

932
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,447
This girl has it harder
than this girl.

933
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,450
Why?

934
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,953
Look at her hair. She can’t get
a job with it like this.

935
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,081
Of course she can.
She has an Afro, that's all.

936
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,920
She looks like a clown.

937
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,620
No she doesn't.
She looks fine.

938
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,662
What are you doing,
a survey?

939
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,061
Oh, hi.

940
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,655
Hi.

941
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,167
We gotta go.
Come on, Annie.

942
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,102
Wait a minute.

943
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,639
- Hold on. Not so fast.
- What?

944
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,540
What?
It wasn't my fault.

945
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,635
The director had final say.

946
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,737
- He did?
- Yeah, I loved you.

947
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,874
Couldn't you tell?
I got a boner, for Christ's sake.

948
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,754
- Well, it's a style.
- What's your name?

949
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:29,917
Annie.

950
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,086
Hi Annie, I'm Kevin.
I like your hair.

951
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,062
She's my little sister.

952
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,033
That is a great organization.
Good for you.

953
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,729
Listen, that part
in the movie...

954
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,398
you shouldn't stress
about shit like that.

955
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,499
- I know.
- You want to get a drink?

956
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:51,275
- How about dinner?
- I can’t.

957
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,872
You can take me
to Lorraine's.

958
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,849
Please?

959
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,352
A way of saying I'm sorry
you didn't get the part.

960
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,514
Who did?

961
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,990
Rosie Campbell...
it wasn't my decision.

962
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,093
I need to see some I. D.

963
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,496
He's 22,
I’ll vouch for him.

964
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,363
When were you born?

965
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,871
1947.

966
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,763
What do you want?

967
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,935
I'll have a scotch
on the rocks.

968
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,070
I'll have a glass
of merlot, please.

969
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:25,944
My first wife had no idea
how to handle it.

970
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,814
She couldn’t understand why
I had to go away on location.

971
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,978
She hated
my whole profession.

972
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,351
That's how Paul seemed.

973
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,483
He thought it was a waste of time
for me to care about how I look.

974
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,255
I wish!

975
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,955
They don't get it.

976
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,295
He acted as if I have a choice.
There is no choice.

977
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,237
Are you one of those actresses
who don’t eat?

978
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,273
I never eat, ever.
In fact, I'm dead.

979
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,538
- You're killing me.
- Yeah. So...

980
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,410
I like to make things
and paint things,

981
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,847
like...

982
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,146
- I paint too.
- You do? Wow!

983
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,811
But you were saying...

984
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,821
Just small things like

985
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,380
little plates and bud vases.

986
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,857
Stuff like that.

987
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:13,760
Wrapping paper was just a new idea
that I'm not going to pursue.

988
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,560
Not exactly
a can’t-live-without item.

989
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,760
- I draw.
- Oh yeah?

990
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,271
I want to do
CD covers one day.

991
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,330
But I don't think
I'm that good.

992
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,431
Oh!

993
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,002
I love animals.

994
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,139
I have a sort
of personal animal shelter.

995
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,842
Really?
Are you kidding me?

996
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,351
Because I have this cat
and it shits on everything.

997
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,286
- I was about to give it to the pound.
- I only have dogs.

998
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,881
Couldn't you take a cat?
She's great. You'll love her.

999
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,482
She shits on everything.

1000
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,154
That's at my house. Maybe
he wouldn't do that at your house.

1001
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,891
She's probably doing it
because she's angry.

1002
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,128
Who cares? Am I supposed to care
about my cat’s feelings?

1003
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,864
I do care. I do.
I was kidding. I love him.

1004
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,872
I feel like I'm doing
a very bad thing.

1005
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,744
I've had
a drink before.

1006
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,716
When you have
as many zits as I do

1007
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:11,345
you’re entitled to get hammered
once in a while.

1008
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,116
You don't have
that many zits.

1009
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,023
I bet you had no zits
when you were in high school.

1010
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,295
You're right.
I had an excellent complexion.

1011
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,388
And I bet
you were popular.

1012
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,365
I was the Homecoming Queen.

1013
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,361
Fuck you,
you're kidding, right?

1014
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,961
No.

1015
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,065
Cool, I'm out
with the Homecoming Queen.

1016
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,348
Where do you get
your dogs?

1017
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,616
Sometimes I'll find one
that someone's abandoned.

1018
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,715
Or the pound'll call me
if they have one that needs a home.

1019
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,885
That kind of thing.

1020
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,293
You must have
a tremendous amount

1021
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,558
of pet hair
on your furniture.

1022
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,736
Promise me,
never get a boob job.

1023
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,914
Is that advice?
A compliment?

1024
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,578
Just promise me.

1025
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,679
Why would you care?

1026
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,190
Because
you're an original.

1027
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,124
An original what...
asshole?

1028
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,128
- An original beauty.
- I am not.

1029
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,891
You are.

1030
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:34,130
Hey, I could be your own
personal lint roller.

1031
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,582
Ouch!

1032
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,517
- Ouch!
- What?

1033
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,025
Oh!

1034
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,289
- This is gorgeous.
- Thanks.

1035
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,732
I'd buy this from you
in a second.

1036
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,825
Really?

1037
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,613
I'm gonna
take that class

1038
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,674
even though I hear
the teacher's boring.

1039
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,685
You already have
too many credits.

1040
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,244
I could never keep up with
so many classes.

1041
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,484
I don't know.
I'm used to it.

1042
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,426
Annie?

1043
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,326
Annie!

1044
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,401
You can’t do that.
You can’t play that game.

1045
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,640
- I was floating.
- Didn't you hear me?

1046
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,149
- No.
- You heard me perfectly well.

1047
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,082
- You were laughing.
- It was funny.

1048
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,620
It was not funny.
Come on, out of the pool.

1049
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,023
No more swimming.

1050
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,684
Out! Out!

1051
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,592
What are you
looking at?

1052
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,961
Don't look away,
you're the fat girl.

1053
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,160
- You're the fat girl.
- You can’t act like that.

1054
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,373
Feeling guilty
about your boyfriend?

1055
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,340
A little.
We broke up.

1056
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,572
- When?
- Two days ago.

1057
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,273
A long mourning period,
I see.

1058
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:29,182
You didn't have to ditch him
so you could sleep with me.

1059
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,947
He probably
wouldn't have minded.

1060
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,385
How's that?

1061
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:35,151
A movie star.
Different role.

1062
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,988
Go on.

1063
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,994
You don't know
how many boyfriends

1064
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,530
will forgive you for cheating
with somebody famous.

1065
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,691
And when two famous people
cheat with each other

1066
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,462
they cancel each other out.

1067
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,231
I see.

1068
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,364
Come on,
you look good.

1069
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,931
Do I?

1070
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,971
Do you...

1071
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,140
think that
I am sexy person?

1072
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,386
No, I think
you're a cow.

1073
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,980
Let me ask you something,
I've been seeing this trainer

1074
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,184
and I think he doesn't
know his shit.

1075
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,888
Look at my stomach. I told him
I want it narrow and hard.

1076
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,398
Instead,
I'm getting wide and pumped.

1077
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,328
What do you think?

1078
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,565
No, it's fine.

1079
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,969
If I asked you to do something weird,
would you maybe do it?

1080
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,446
Oh, absolutely.

1081
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,951
I'm gonna stand there...

1082
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:42,080
and you're gonna tell me
everything that's wrong with me.

1083
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,286
You can also say
what's good with me.

1084
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,761
But I hardly know you.

1085
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:51,699
I mean about my looks,
my body, my face.

1086
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,328
Whoa, no way,
girlie.

1087
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,304
Are you kidding?
No.

1088
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:59,705
You don't understand.
You'd be doing me a favor.

1089
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,539
- No.
- I won't be mad at you.

1090
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,977
- Not a chance.
- I want to hear your opinion.

1091
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,208
I won't get upset.

1092
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,977
This is some kind
of trick.

1093
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,349
Why do you want me
to do this?

1094
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,082
I just do.

1095
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,420
Good and bad?

1096
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,054
Your opinion.

1097
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,598
Yeah, well, hmm...

1098
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,539
You got nice hips,

1099
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,977
nice flat stomach,

1100
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,981
sexy belly button.

1101
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,984
You're definitely on
the skinny side, kind of bony.

1102
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,782
Okay, the bush is big.

1103
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,756
Big bush.

1104
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,520
It could use a little trim.

1105
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,993
You could trim
the trim.

1106
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,327
This is so weird.

1107
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,135
Okay...

1108
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,473
I like your breasts.
One's a little bigger than the other

1109
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,979
but they're really pretty.
Perfect from the front.

1110
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,639
Turn to the side.

1111
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,017
They're a little droopy
from the side.

1112
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,815
N ice nipples though.
Good color.

1113
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,719
You're bowlegged.

1114
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,417
It seems like your knees

1115
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,926
are thicker than...

1116
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,859
Turn around.

1117
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,931
In a perfect world,
your ass would be rounder.

1118
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:39,566
But overall,
your body is in good proportion.

1119
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,873
You've got smooth skin, kind of pale.
You could use some sun.

1120
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:46,074
You have a really sweet smile,
very charming.

1121
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,741
Your teeth are yellow, though.

1122
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,877
I should give you
the number of my dentist.

1123
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,888
You have pretty eyes...

1124
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:56,187
although one of them
is bigger than the other.

1125
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,318
Your hair is flat
and thin,

1126
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,419
but you've got
a real nice neck.

1127
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,829
It's long and smooth,
happens to smell good too.

1128
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,765
What about my arms?

1129
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,463
- Your arms?
- Yes, my arms.

1130
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,631
I don't know,
they seem fine.

1131
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,209
Oh, yeah,

1132
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,677
they're a little loose
right at the top.

1133
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,271
They could be
a little more toned.

1134
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,409
- They're kind of flabby.
- Is that it?

1135
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,386
You want more?

1136
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,514
Is there more?

1137
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,753
No, I think
that's probably about it.

1138
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,920
Okay.

1139
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,697
Thank you.

1140
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,296
- You're not upset?
- No.

1141
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,034
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

1142
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,474
Should I get you
something to eat?

1143
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,977
- No thanks.
- Tea?

1144
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,844
No, I've got to pick up
my little sister.

1145
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,213
Was this some sort
of sick fetish thing?

1146
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,577
No.

1147
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,958
I like your dress too.

1148
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,926
Thanks.

1149
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:16,096
Bye.

1150
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,472
You sure you're not mad?

1151
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,171
I'm not mad.

1152
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,941
Oh good!

1153
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,039
Because that was
sort of refreshing.

1154
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,495
She pretended she was dead
in the pool,

1155
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:52,166
which scared the hell out of me
and every one else.

1156
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,209
Then she teased
some poor girl.

1157
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,404
Honestly, I didn't
know how to handle it.

1158
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,310
She has
no sense of humor.

1159
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,043
I'm sorry.

1160
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:04,109
I know she's
going through a lot.

1161
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,417
Her mom's in the hospital
and everything.

1162
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,924
So, shall I bring her by
on Friday?

1163
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,359
I don't think so.

1164
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,693
I don't think I can take
this kind of thing on.

1165
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,062
This kind of thing?

1166
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:20,261
It's not like she doesn't have
any real sisters.

1167
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,634
When I signed up
to be a Big Sister

1168
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,265
I thought I would get
somebody poor from a bad family.

1169
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:26,899
This is sort of weird.

1170
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,274
Why is it weird?
She needs to have a relationship

1171
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,869
with somebody who's Black.

1172
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:34,439
Well,
this Black somebody

1173
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,042
doesn't want
to do it anymore.

1174
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,228
Did you have dinner
with that gross guy?

1175
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,094
Yeah.

1176
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,602
- You're wearing a real Baldesaro?
- Yeah, who is that?

1177
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,541
I don't know. I think he's good.
Are they giving it to you?

1178
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,772
No, lending it to me
for the premiere.

1179
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:06,212
- Who are you taking?
- I thought I'd take Annie.

1180
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,842
Can I come?
I don't have to work today.

1181
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,115
Okay.
You'll have to meet us there.

1182
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,179
- I can do that.
- Good.

1183
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,055
What do you do?
You develop pictures?

1184
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,219
Yeah, it's fun.

1185
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,162
You went to college.
I mean, how much can you make?

1186
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,392
Eight bucks an hour.

1187
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,765
And your boss is 17?

1188
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:27,996
So?

1189
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,095
He's probably got
a huge crush on you.

1190
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,767
How are you and Bill?

1191
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,037
I don't know why
he ever married me.

1192
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,635
You were pregnant.

1193
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,515
Where's Mom?

1194
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,654
She's in the hospital. How could she be worse?

1195
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,814
I don't understand.
Is she gonna be all right?

1196
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,415
Your mother's blood cultures
came back positive

1197
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,484
indicating she's
bacteremic.

1198
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,224
- She's ia comama.
- Yeah.

1199
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,823
She's most definitely
not in a coma.

1200
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,733
The infection is causing
confusion and delirium, that's all.

1201
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,101
I don't believe this.
She had liposuction.

1202
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,299
Whenever you do surgery
there is a risk.

1203
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,639
We're giving her strong
antibiotics for an infection.

1204
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,709
This is bullshit.

1205
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,342
- I'm sorry.
- You'd better be.

1206
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,443
- Elizabeth, stop this.
- Stop what?

1207
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,114
It's probably because the nurses
didn't pay attention to her.

1208
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,089
Elizabeth, your mother
is going to recover.

1209
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,955
Toward that end,
the less noise

1210
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,960
and the less stress,
the better.

1211
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,356
Excuse me.

1212
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,001
Asshole!

1213
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,102
It's not your fault, babe.

1214
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,804
I did tell her
her stomach was flabby.

1215
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,940
You didn't tell her
to have an operation.

1216
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,916
Everybody has
these operations.

1217
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,010
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

1218
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,215
- That means they should?
- I don't give a shit if they should.

1219
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,588
I just know my mother
is really sick.

1220
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,684
And you're acting
like you don’t care.

1221
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,695
You care, Daddy.

1222
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,697
Of course I care.

1223
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,892
But the doctor said
she'd be fine.

1224
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,831
Wow!

1225
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,037
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1226
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,416
It looks amazing. It’s very flattering.

1227
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,850
Are you kidding?
This looks disgusting.

1228
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,411
Did he leave me
anything else?

1229
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,081
No, just this.

1230
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,421
He picked it out
especially for you.

1231
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,984
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to try it with this?

1232
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:34,222
No, please no.

1233
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:41,864
Hi,
is Jordan home?

1234
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,463
Oh, uh, yeah.

1235
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,600
He just got home from school.
Can I help you with something?

1236
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:50,771
No, I'm a friend of his.

1237
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,313
Thanks.

1238
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,445
<i>Turn the pain...</i>

1239
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,788
Jordan, there's someone
here to see you.

1240
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:06,794
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

1241
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,588
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

1242
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:14,966
<i>When you're just
another waiter...</i>

1243
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,801
This is so incredibly
humiliating.

1244
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:18,805
Why?

1245
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,240
Look at my room.

1246
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,278
I know how old you are.

1247
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,712
Is it okay
that I came here?

1248
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,043
Are you depressed?

1249
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,486
- Is it me?
- No, my mom's really sick.

1250
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,525
Was she old?

1251
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:39,425
No, she had a cosmetic
surgery operation

1252
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,429
and her fluid shifted

1253
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,728
and I don't know...
she's got some infection.

1254
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,358
In her nose?

1255
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,703
No, it wasn't a nose job.
It was her stomach.

1256
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,343
- My dad is dead.
- He is?

1257
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,209
I thought he owned
the one-hour photo.

1258
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,181
That's my step dad.
My real dad died when I was 10.

1259
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,583
10?
That's horrible.

1260
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,918
I miss him a lot. My mom and I
don’t even talk about him.

1261
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,720
I don't really
have a dad either.

1262
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,852
I mean he's alive

1263
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,419
but we have
no relationship.

1264
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,459
Doesn't he want one?

1265
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,471
I guess not.

1266
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,099
I don't think
he ever really liked us.

1267
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,372
Or me, I should say,
he never liked me.

1268
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,642
He has to like you.
He's your dad.

1269
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,542
Sometimes I think
I used to be nicer.

1270
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,485
You're so nice.

1271
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,422
I have a problem
with anger.

1272
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,084
Do you want
to stay over for dinner?

1273
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,686
My mom’s cooking
Chicken Payard.

1274
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,594
Are you kidding?

1275
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,031
Did you see the way
she looked at me?

1276
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:55,298
I have to go somewhere
with my sister anyway.

1277
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,602
Will you meet me later?
Spend the night with me?

1278
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:01,969
How?

1279
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:05,343
We could pick a place,
I don't know.

1280
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,780
- A hotel or...
- No.

1281
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,250
My daughter would freak.

1282
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,378
I've never spent the night
away from her.

1283
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,582
She's with her dad.

1284
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,989
That's true.
But...

1285
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,051
Okay.

1286
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,397
I gotta get my bag.

1287
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,708
- You were great.
- Thanks.

1288
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,472
- I loved the movie.
- I'm so glad.

1289
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,070
Who are your dates?

1290
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,742
These are my sisters,
Michelle and Annie.

1291
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,377
Are you proud of your sister?

1292
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,921
- I didn't have a big part.
- Don't tell him that.

1293
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,651
It's true.
You just saw it.

1294
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,818
- You made it.
- Hey.

1295
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,459
No, this is mine.

1296
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,056
How did I do?

1297
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,727
Hey, you guys,
this is Cindy, my agent.

1298
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,793
These are my sisters,
Michelle and Annie.

1299
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,771
Hi, nice to meet you.

1300
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,467
I didn't know
you had two sisters.

1301
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,703
I've told you
a million times.

1302
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,268
- You did?
- Yeah.

1303
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,008
Are you upset
your part was cut down?

1304
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,209
Yeah, a little,
you know.

1305
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,345
I only
had two scenes so...

1306
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,889
You know how hard I pushed
to get you that part?

1307
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,686
It's better than nothing.

1308
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,624
Courtney, hi.

1309
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,990
You should tell her
to fuck off.

1310
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,329
I gave her one of your chairs.
She liked it.

1311
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,426
Really?
You think she liked it?

1312
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,528
Yeah.

1313
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,336
Which one of you
is older?

1314
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,108
She is.

1315
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:23,812
What do you do? You're thin enough
to be an actress.

1316
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,319
I'm an artist.

1317
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,184
I thought you worked
at a one-hour photo.

1318
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:30,123
That's an interesting job.

1319
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,319
I take my pictures
to a one-hour photo.

1320
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,364
It takes about an hour.

1321
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:37,694
Yeah.

1322
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,996
What are you going
to be doing next?

1323
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,469
I'm not sure really.
I'm getting offered some stuff.

1324
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:43,698
I'm bored.

1325
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,505
We told you
you'd be bored.

1326
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,908
- I am.
- Want to eat something?

1327
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,539
The food is weird.
I want to go home.

1328
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,674
All right.

1329
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,583
- But it’s early.
- What do you want me to do?

1330
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,644
Annie,
can't you just be patient?

1331
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,246
I'm tired.

1332
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,757
I wouldn't mind going home.
I'm worried about Mom.

1333
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,192
- I don't want to go yet.
- Well, stay.

1334
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,231
- Really?
- If you want to.

1335
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,095
You don't think
it'd be weird?

1336
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,828
No, kind of, but...

1337
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,166
no, stay.

1338
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:17,603
Okay.

1339
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

1340
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,235
- Have fun.
- Bye.

1341
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,793
You're too young to be wearing
all that make-up.

1342
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,627
My butt itches.

1343
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,033
Look at the poor pup.

1344
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,033
So dirty.

1345
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:52,998
Come on.

1346
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,035
You have enough dogs.

1347
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,883
Come on, puppy.

1348
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,045
Hey, baby.

1349
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,782
Aah!

1350
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,891
Help!
Someone please help!

1351
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,551
Please help!

1352
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,688
It's strange because
it's not like me.

1353
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,288
But I didn't
mind the pain.

1354
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:21,166
I mean I minded,
but it was worth it.

1355
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,397
I guess you women
have a raw deal.

1356
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:26,771
Oh no, no.
Childbirth is incredible.

1357
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,901
What I went through
made me a stronger person.

1358
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,912
I'll always feel
really proud of that.

1359
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,505
I didn't scream for the drugs.
And that's saying a lot.

1360
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,623
- So...
- Excuse us.

1361
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,055
Oh, yeah.

1362
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,864
Cindy,
hi, how are you?

1363
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,629
Do I know you?

1364
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,432
I'm Michelle.
Elizabeth's sister.

1365
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,302
Oh, right.

1366
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,205
You know...

1367
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,676
you're sister
is a neurotic mess.

1368
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,950
My sister is insecure.
Is that a crime?

1369
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,114
Fuck off!

1370
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:20,823
<i>Down to the store tonight</i>

1371
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:27,465
<i>Can you still
see my face</i>

1372
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:32,235
<i>Next to my eyes?</i>

1373
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,494
You're going to have to get
a series of rabies injections.

1374
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:02,502
What made you go after
a strange dog like that?

1375
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,532
He looked lost.

1376
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,087
- Hi.
- Hi.

1377
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,061
I've been waiting so long,
I didn't think you would come.

1378
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,462
I'm sorry,
I can’t go to a motel with you.

1379
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,092
No, a hotel...
someplace nice.

1380
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,762
I can’t.
I don't know what we're doing.

1381
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,635
We're having a relationship.

1382
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,640
I'm married.

1383
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,699
I'm old.

1384
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,711
I've been thinking about you
all night.

1385
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,747
About spending the night
with you.

1386
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,714
It's not gonna happen.

1387
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,612
Please?
Let me be with you.

1388
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:02,729
Jordan!

1389
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:03,890
- Jordan!
- Hmm hmm.

1390
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,900
- Get out of this car.
- Oh.

1391
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:09,904
Oh, Mom,
you remember Michelle?

1392
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:13,874
Hi, I know this looks weird,
but it's not what you think.

1393
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,672
- Michelle's my lover.
- Jordan, we're friends.

1394
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,511
We're not...
we're a lot more than friends.

1395
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,278
Jordan, get out of the car
and go to your room.

1396
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,785
- No.
- Now!

1397
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,480
It's okay.
You should go.

1398
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,386
I can’t believe this!
What...

1399
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,982
That's funny,
I have that same robe.

1400
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,617
What?

1401
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,355
Who cares what kind
of robe she's...

1402
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,226
- Is this some kind of joke to you?
- No.

1403
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,027
I just think
you should go inside.

1404
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,665
God!

1405
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,097
License
and registration, please.

1406
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,767
We weren't driving.

1407
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,039
License and registration,
please.

1408
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,637
Look, my mom...

1409
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:56,582
I don't know what she told you
but she’s crazy,

1410
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,313
so like...

1411
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,288
Please step out
of the vehicle.

1412
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,651
Step around
to the back of the car.

1413
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,218
Place your hands
on the hood.

1414
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,734
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Are you kidding?

1415
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,701
- What did she do?
- You're handcuffing me?

1416
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,933
- What did she do?
- Statutory rape is illegal.

1417
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,839
- What? She didn’t even rape me.
- You have the right...

1418
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,345
...to have an attorney present...
- We didn't do anything.

1419
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,143
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

1420
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,807
Do you understand
these rights?

1421
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:32,047
- Yes.
- I wanted to be here.

1422
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,054
We're in a relationship.

1423
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,852
Son, please go back
into the house.

1424
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,093
- Michelle:
- Watch your head.

1425
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,892
Please don't talk to me
like that, Bill.

1426
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,870
I know what
you've been doing.

1427
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,406
Of course, I know.
I'm not an idiot.

1428
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,474
Don’t even threaten me
with something like that.

1429
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,879
It was just a fling.
This had nothing to do with Maddy.

1430
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,611
Did Donna have anything
to do with Maddy?

1431
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,550
You go to hell!

1432
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:10,156
He wants to take
my daughter from me.

1433
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,022
That's rough.

1434
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:16,690
I'd die, you know.
She’s everything.

1435
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,824
She's the best thing
I ever did.

1436
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,876
Annie, don't forget
to brush your teeth.

1437
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,944
And not just
for two seconds, okay?

1438
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:46,527
Annie?

1439
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,655
Annie.

1440
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,600
Annie!

1441
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,430
Annie!

1442
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,834
Annie?

1443
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,922
My sister's missing.
She's only eight.

1444
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,357
I thought she was
in the house with me.

1445
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:23,189
No, no, I have no idea
where she'd go.

1446
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,411
You'll be notified by the court
if charges are pressed.

1447
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,381
I think it's broken.

1448
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,067
Could you
let me off here, please?

1449
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,246
Can I take your order?

1450
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,750
How many nuggets
in a large?

1451
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,785
20.

1452
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:21,220
20?
How big are they?

1453
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,953
U mm...

1454
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,755
Thanks.

1455
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:44,702
I won't finish it all.

1456
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,748
I just couldn’t decide
what to order.

1457
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,010
What are you doing here?

1458
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,552
I was hungry.

1459
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,253
Where's Elizabeth?

1460
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,256
Home.

1461
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:58,087
How did you get here?

1462
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,025
Walked.

1463
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,825
You walked here
by yourself?

1464
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,492
Yeah.

1465
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,762
Does Elizabeth
know you're here?

1466
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,565
No.

1467
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,503
Annie!

1468
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,513
Hi, it's me.
I'm with Annie.

1469
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,210
No, she's fine,
she's fine.

1470
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,719
Mc Donald's.

1471
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:29,086
Yeah. Okay, okay.
All right, bye.

1472
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,090
Annie,

1473
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:34,026
do you have any idea
how dangerous this was?

1474
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:37,121
Elizabeth is hysterical.

1475
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,599
Are you going
to drink that?

1476
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,303
No.

1477
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,641
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna finish it.

1478
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,151
I don’t care.
Have more.

1479
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,993
I just got arrested.

1480
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,144
Do you like
my straight hair?

1481
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,276
I do, I really do.

1482
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,787
I think it looks pretty
up like that too.

1483
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,255
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1484
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,809
It's funny,
do you ever...

1485
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,606
wonder what things
you might inherit?

1486
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,648
I mean, you're Mom's kid
and everything

1487
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,910
but you've got
different genes.

1488
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,384
You could inherit
all kinds of things

1489
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,421
that would make you
so different from us.

1490
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,355
No, I mean better.

1491
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,327
Like your dad, he could be
a genius or something.

1492
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:17,991
Your mom...
who knows what your mom was?

1493
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:21,399
My mom
was a crack addict.

1494
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,664
True.

1495
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,571
But I'm sure she was
a lot of other things too.

1496
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,268
Some of them
must be good.

1497
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,039
Maybe she was
a good swimmer.

1498
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,678
Yeah, exactly.

1499
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:44,581
All right,
I better call a cab.

1500
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,396
Maddy.

1501
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,695
Maddy, come on.

1502
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:56,896
I'm gonna take you
to Grandma's house, okay?

1503
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,873
Come on, big girl.

1504
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:03,733
Whoa!

1505
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,975
Let's try not
to wake up Daddy.

1506
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,921
Hey!

1507
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,968
Dr. Crane.

1508
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,207
Dr. Crane.

1509
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:38,677
Jane.

1510
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,812
Can you
see me all right?

1511
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,215
Yes, I can see you.

1512
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:47,618
- Dr. Crane.
- How do you feel?

1513
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,748
Better.

1514
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,657
You know you've been sleeping
for quite some time.

1515
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,126
What?

1516
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,129
Who's the president
of our country?

1517
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,893
Dr. Crane.

1518
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,764
Dr. Crane isn't here.

1519
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,303
He'll be happy
to see you're feeling better.

1520
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,340
Where is he?

1521
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,968
I'm sure he's at home.

1522
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,978
With his wife?

1523
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,673
I imagine so.

1524
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,111
Asshole.

1525
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,967
- Hello.
- Elizabeth, it's Kevin.

1526
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,367
Who?

1527
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:38,133
Kevin McCabe.

1528
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,470
Oh, God.
Hi.

1529
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,670
How did you
get this number?

1530
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,146
From your agent.
Not without a fight, though.

1531
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,513
So what are you doing?

1532
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,381
Sleeping.

1533
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,750
Alone?

1534
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,880
Of course, alone.

1535
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,321
You're talking funny.

1536
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,325
I had an accident.

1537
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,361
What's up?

1538
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,397
You left
your black camisole here.

1539
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,229
I don't have
a black camisole.

1540
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:07,962
Oh.

1541
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,436
Never mind, Elizabeth.

1542
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,838
I like you.
I want to sleep with you again.

1543
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,671
Thanks.

1544
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,075
So what do you say?

1545
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:20,080
How about we get together
this weekend?

1546
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,213
I don't think
I can do it this weekend.

1547
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,879
It's because of what
you made me do, isn't it?

1548
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,981
I knew it was a trick.
It's what I said about your teeth.

1549
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,458
Kevin, I'm getting another call.

1550
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,688
I gotta go.

1551
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,923
Well, all right.

1552
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,398
- Thanks for calling.
- You're welcome.

1553
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:42,863
Hello.

1554
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,671
Yes.

1555
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,867
He's paranoid.

1556
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,002
He's so convinced
the tiger's gonna eat him

1557
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,944
that he can’t stop
running around.

1558
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,710
If he'd stay still, the tiger
wouldn't know he was there.

1559
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,944
- It's pathetic.
- Yeah.

1560
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,990
We can go get Mom.

1561
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,235
This is Annie.
She was six here.

1562
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,602
It was about a year
after she came to me.

1563
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,300
She's adorable.

1564
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,969
She's gonna be
a heartbreaker...

1565
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:25,740
or an arm-breaker.

1566
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,475
God, she loved that jacket.
It's so dirty.

1567
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,643
You know,
I have a 10-year-old.

1568
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,879
She won’t even
let me shop for her.

1569
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,286
These are
my two older girls.

1570
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,586
This was taken
when we went to the beach.

1571
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,321
That was a great day,

1572
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,260
more or less.

1573
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,531
What's she doing in there?

1574
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,501
Checkout time is noon.

1575
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,305
Annie!

1576
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,207
Annie.

1577
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,338
<i>You worry on</i>

1578
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,707
<i>Hurting anybody anymore</i>

1579
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,739
<i>You worry on</i>

1580
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,546
<i>Small comfort</i>

1581
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:15,988
<i>One of us
seems not to tremble</i>

1582
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,686
<i>You make a rift
inside me</i>

1583
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:23,424
<i>Every day</i>

1584
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:26,797
<i>And did he
choose to stay?</i>

1585
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:30,668
<i>I walked the ocean</i>

1586
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:33,536
<i>Pushing white earth</i>

1587
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:37,704
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1588
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:41,010
<i>I open all my doors</i>

1589
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,516
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1590
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:46,451
<i>What a heart is for</i>

1591
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:48,546
<i>I am no martyr</i>

1592
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:51,649
<i>You give me reason</i>

1593
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:54,354
<i>I try harder</i>

1594
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:58,229
<i>And wait
for a warmer season</i>

1595
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:02,167
<i>Meanwhile</i>

1596
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:06,263
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1597
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:20,648
<i>I hear a soft noise</i>

1598
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,054
<i>Like a sigh</i>

1599
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:28,494
<i>A singing
like a lullaby</i>

1600
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,828
<i>It is my heart</i>

1601
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:35,926
<i>It is its will</i>

1602
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:38,631
<i>That blows through</i>

1603
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:43,040
<i>Where you
held me closer</i>

1604
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:47,639
<i>Where we whispered</i>

1605
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,979
<i>This is</i>

1606
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,679
<i>This is true</i>

1607
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,256
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1608
01:29:57,325 --> 01:30:00,852
<i>I open
all my doors</i>

1609
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:03,488
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1610
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:06,829
<i>What a heart is for</i>

1611
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:11,167
<i>I am no martyr
but you give me reason</i>

1612
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,299
<i>I try harder</i>

1613
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:18,505
<i>And wait
for a warmer season</i>

1614
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:22,071
<i>And meanwhile</i>

1615
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,846
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1616
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,355
<i>I open all my doors</i>

1617
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,687
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1618
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,818
<i>What a heart is for</i>

1619
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:38,594
<i>I am no martyr,
you give me reason</i>

1620
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,635
<i>I try harder</i>

1621
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:47,004
<i>And wait
for a warmer season</i>

1622
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,474
<i>And meanwhile</i>

1623
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:53,571
<i>You are forgiven</i>

1624
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:56,913
<i>You are</i>

1625
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,316
<i>Forgiven.</i>
