1
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:39,908
HAVE FUN!

2
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:41,865
Thank you.

3
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,928
Thanks very much and…

4
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,969
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a friend here tonight…

5
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:51,232
…who like me, she’s a long way from home.

6
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,700
And if it’s okay with you…

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,917
I was wondering if you’d like her
to play one of her songs.

8
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:58,980
Is that okay? Yeah?

9
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:01,513
Gretta, will you come up here please.

10
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,865
Chờ tôi một chút.

11
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,885
Just give me a moment.

12
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,602
I think it’d be a really good idea
if you’d come up here…

13
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:10,954
and sing one of your songs.

14
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,306
I think it’d be a really fucking bad idea.

15
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,907
Gretta, come on. This is New York.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,896
No.

17
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,151
You want to hear it, right?

18
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,600
You’re gonna be amazing.

19
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:24,886
Hi.

20
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:30,488
This is a new song
so it might be kind of rough.

21
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:34,886
It’s for anyone
who’s ever been alone in the city.

earlier that day…

40
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,803
It’s seven AM. Good Morning, New York…

41
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:04,928
and welcome to the second hour of Potsy
and Andy in the morning!

42
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,042
Hey Potsy, did you read about the dog?

43
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,711
The Korean restaurant thing?

44
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,844
Oh, I certainly did.
Did you hear about that, Katie?

45
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,865
Fresh prospects, let’s hear it.
What do you got for me?

46
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,770
No, no.

47
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,990
Who’s next on this delightful journey?

48
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:31,875
No, no, no. No, man.
You can’t! No! You can’t!

49
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,803
It’s shit. It’s shit!

50
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,907
Get fucking out of my car.

51
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,211
Give me anything. A song. A hook.

52
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,922
Anything I can work with..
 I’m not asking for much.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,032
That’s something. That’s good.

54
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:59,359
Until you started to sing!

55
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:33,803
Where’s mom?

56
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,823
Where’s my daughter?

57
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:37,875
What do you mean?

58
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,980
Your mom has a deadline.
She asked me to watch you today.

59
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:46,659
Let’s go.

60
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,928
So where do you want to go?
The Museum of Natural History?

61
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,948
You want to go to the park
and get some ice cream, or what?

62
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,823
Why would I want to do that? I’m not a kid.

63
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,855
What’s that smell?

64
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,765
Oh, that’s gasoline.
I was filling up the car with gasoline…

65
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,011
and I spilled a little on my pant leg.

66
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,399
That isn’t alcohol.

67
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:18,921
I think I’ve got a meeting here.

68
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,629
You want to wait here
or you want to come with me.

69
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,816
You think you have a meeting?
Do you or not?

70
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,378
Let’s see.

71
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:30,948
This is fun, right?

72
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,917
When we came into this neighborhood in ’92…

73
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,886
there was nobody here.
It was like a war-zone.

74
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,666
Hookers. Crack.
Now it’s totally gentrified.

75
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:39,803
I know, Dad.

76
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,938
I’ve had the tour.

77
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,021
Okay, we’re going to go up here.
Just be quiet.

78
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,938
I think it’s a great way
to generate revenue for the company.

79
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,538
Was there bad traffic?

80
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,032
No, traffic was actually pretty good.
I was just passing by.

81
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:04,990
We were just closing up
about the audio commentary piece.

82
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,886
Yeah, shit idea.

83
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,975
It was a shit idea then.
Still a shit idea. It didn’t age well.

84
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,562
We appreciate your candor.

85
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,423
We had a different view of it here though.

86
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,669
Musicians for the most part
are pretty much…

87
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:21,678
monosyllabic teenagers
who really don’t have much to say…

88
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,675
and that’s the good ones, right?

89
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,775
So what are we doing here?

90
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,772
The music industry is fine.
It’s always going to be fine.

91
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,766
We always have been fine.

92
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,865
Maybe the kids are right.
Maybe music should be free anyway.

93
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:34,969
That’s an alarming thing to hear…

94
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,514
the head of a record company say.

95
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,539
What? The truth?

96
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:44,928
Thanks so much Karen. Let’s talk more.

97
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, of course.

98
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:47,990
Great meeting you.

99
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,834
I’m glad we got it all figured out.

100
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:56,803
The band doing audio commentary
on their own music...

101
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,938
Is so fucking lame, Saul, and you know it.

102
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,032
Ten years ago, man,
you would have shit on that idea.

103
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,064
It’s something. It’s an idea.

104
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,276
It’s something that helps keep the lights on.
It’s something.

105
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,798
We need vision, not gimmicks.

106
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:10,842
That’s us.

107
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,348
I’ve been following you, Mr. Mulligan.

108
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,927
Down a track on every long shot…

109
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,990
you’ve been bringing in here
for the last five years.

110
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,938
And which one of them has come in.

111
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,148
Which one?

112
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,928
Dan.

113
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,575
Dan.

114
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:33,534
See you later, brother Saul.

115
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,159
Dan.

116
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,378
We need to talk, man.

117
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,850
Come back here.
Don’t you walk away from me.

118
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:46,881
You can’t do this shit, man.

119
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,735
You can’t pull this shit, dude.

120
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,798
You can’t pull this shit.

121
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,902
Don’t do this here.

122
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,608
I’m going to do it right fucking here.

123
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,162
All right, then let’s do it then!

124
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,819
Let’s go! Cause they know.
These people know...

125
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,798
that they are sitting behind those desks...

126
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,798
because I started
an independent record label.

127
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,860
Above that bar, Saul.

128
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,419
And we changed the way
things are going to be done, man.

129
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,498
Nurture and foster.

130
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,566
Things change. Times change.

131
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:16,735
People gotta change with them, Dan.

132
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,777
It’s not working.

133
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,050
You gotta go.

134
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,151
I don’t have time for this.

135
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,819
I’ve got my own shit going on, all right?

136
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,694
I’m taking my client list.

137
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,860
I’m out of here, man.
I am fucking out of here.

138
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,725
What are you talking about?
They signed to us.

139
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,819
Don’t bother her.

140
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,694
Jerry McGuire.

141
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:40,319
Dad, let’s go.

142
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,314
I’m taking my art then. That’s it.
I’m taking the art.

143
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,819
It’s my art. I paid for it.
I bought it. I picked it out.

144
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:55,857
I got it.

145
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:56,819
No you don’t.

146
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,746
Okay. Leave it there.

147
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,714
I’m coming back for that.

148
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:07,829
It’s mine.

149
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:09,819
All of that’s mine.

150
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,586
Come on, baby.

151
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:12,860
You want another one?

152
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,798
Ah, I do but I won’t. I mustn’t. I can’t.

153
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:21,798
How could he fire me
when I set the whole fucking thing up?

154
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:22,912
Did you?

155
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:26,294
Don’t you know anything about your father?

156
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,704
Yeah.

157
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:28,812
I do.

158
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:30,829
I know what mom says.

159
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,714
What does mom say?

160
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,046
She says you’re a pathetic loser.

161
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:40,194
She says that affectionately.

162
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,077
What about you?

163
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,189
What do you think?

164
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,346
I don’t really know you

165
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,851
Two years is a long time
in the life of a teenager.

166
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:57,194
Where’d you learn to talk like that?

167
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:58,533
My psychiatrist.

168
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,923
Psychiatrist. You have a psychiatrist now.

169
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,287
I do. Mom thought it’d be a good idea.

170
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:06,923
I was acting strange.

171
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,123
There’s nothing strange about you.
You’re 15-years-old.

172
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,256
You don’t need a fucking psychiatrist.

173
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,777
Believe me, I know.
I know you better than anybody.

174
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:18,902
Yeah, you sure do, dad.

175
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,691
How old did you say I was?

176
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,660
Did I say you were 15?

177
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,307
I meant you were 14.

178
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,912
Did I say 15?

179
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,002
You got money to pay for these beers?

180
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:37,103
I’m a kid. I don’t have any money on me!

181
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,423
What happened to your pocket money?

182
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:40,063
Well, I spent that on condoms.

183
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,798
What? No, no, no, no, no.

184
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,923
Too much information.

185
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:51,777
You ready?

186
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:52,839
For what?

187
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,714
That was fun, right? Don’t smile.

188
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:08,735
It was fun, dad.

189
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,912
Yeah. You had a good time.

190
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,798
We haven’t run like that
since we were little. That was good.

191
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:14,912
This your daddy.

192
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,850
I’m glad you’re here cause
I was just going to the car...

193
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,302
Are you okay?

194
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,760
I’m fine.

195
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,777
I’m sorry, my bad. Have a great day.

196
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,860
I could have taken that guy.
He still had to make a scene.

197
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:36,808
Do me a favor, all right?
Don’t tell your mom I lost my job today.

198
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:37,891
Listen to me.

199
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,881
Thanks for a really normal day, dad.

200
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:42,766
What?

201
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,621
Hello, everyone.

202
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:54,713
- Hi

203
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,694
How’s work?

204
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:00,829
Fine.

205
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,808
You look hungry.

206
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,860
Her teachers are really worried about her.

207
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:14,704
No girls like her at school.
She is distant.

208
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:16,933
And the only people
who want to hang out with her...

209
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,111
are older boys who want to fuck her.

210
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,214
Oh really?
And you find that a big surprise...

211
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,819
seeing how you let her
walk out of the house looking like...

212
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:27,026
like Jodie Foster from “Taxi Driver”?

213
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,902
She dresses the way she wants to.

214
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:31,602
And any daughter who dresses like that
only wants one thing.

215
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:32,781
A pimp?

216
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,016
No, Dan. Think about it.

217
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,787
A daddy.

218
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,871
That is fucking bullshit.

219
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,850
She needs some guidance for fucking sake.

220
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:42,798
Well, guide her. Guide her.

221
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:45,829
You waltz in here like a fucking clown.

222
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,819
You tell me how to raise my kid.

223
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,912
The kid that you pick up once a month...

224
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,988
and decide you have a fucking conscience about

225
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:56,291
You know what?
Thirty seconds after you’re gone...

226
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,412
we’ll have totally forgotten
you were ever here.

227
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,094
Thank you.

228
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,860
I thought there was no hope.

229
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,022
I thought there were no answers.

230
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,333
And then I found God.

231
00:15:57,287 --> 00:16:00,194
God may not always be on our time

232
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,273
But he’s on time.

233
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,381
We’re never alone.

234
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:05,725
Sir?

235
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:10,704
Go, have a talk with God.

236
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,167
Right, Man. Okay.

237
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,735
I’m gonna have a little talk with God,
all right?

238
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,798
Thank you.

239
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,756
What if he doesn’t answer?

240
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,902
Attention. Due to a signal malfunction
at Jay Street...

241
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,902
the next uptown train
will arrive in 20 minutes.

242
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:57,912
Give me a bourbon. Hurry up.

243
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,694
What kind of bourbon you want?

244
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,798
I don’t care.

245
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:08,694
and I was wondering
if it’d be okay if she sang a song.

246
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,871
Is that okay? Yeah? Gretta,
would you come up here please?

247
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:16,850
Hi.

248
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:20,798
So, this is a new song
so it might be kind of rough.

249
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:25,746
It’s for anyone
who’s ever been alone in the city.

I’m in.

287
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:57,699
What?

288
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,324
I want to make records with you.
I want to produce you.

289
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:04,714
I want to sign you.
We’re meant to work together.

290
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,491
Sorry, didn’t you just see
what happened up there?

291
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,745
Yeah, what?
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?

292
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,900
No, I like my music. I mean who cares
if they don’t get it, right?

293
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:15,120
You just need to work
on your performance a little bit.

294
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:17,439
I’m not a performer.
I just write songs from time to time.

295
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,352
And are those songs as good as that one?

296
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,450
Are you really an A and R man?

297
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,408
You just look more like a homeless man.

298
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,554
I’ve been out celebrating all week.

299
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,780
And I just signed a band
and we got carried away.

300
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:28,509
That’s some song you’ve got there.

301
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,678
I promise you it could be a big hit.
Plus you’re beautiful.

302
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,142
Sorry, what does beauty
got to do with anything?

303
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,743
Jesus, you’re tricky aren’t you?

304
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:39,735
No, I actually just think that
music is about ears not eyes.

305
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:43,450
And I’m not Judy Garland just off
a Greyhound bus...

306
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:46,387
looking for stardom, but really, thank you.

307
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:52,880
Okay, bye.

308
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:54,798
Bye.

309
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,629
SO BEFORE YOU GO...

310
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,491
ENJOY MY SHOW.

311
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:13,232
Okay here’s the truth.
I couldn’t have signed you if I wanted to.

312
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,318
Okay.

313
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,418
I didn’t come from a signing tonight.

314
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,366
I haven’t signed anybody in seven years.

315
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:20,470
My label has completely lost all faith in me.

316
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:22,129
So why did you give me your card?

317
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,450
Force of habit.

318
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,491
If I look homeless
it’s because I practically am.

319
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,460
I left my home about a year or so ago.

320
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:29,738
I’m sleeping on a shitty mattress
in some shitty apartment.

321
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,822
And I wasn’t celebrating tonight.

322
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,554
I was drinking my ass off standing on
a subway platform...

323
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,661
ready to kill myself.

324
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,149
And then I heard your song.

325
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,085
Want to get a beer?

326
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:40,835
Sure.

327
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:41,804
Yeah, come on.

328
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,170
“Dan Mulligan. Born 1966”

329
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,779
“Headed A&R department at Island Records
for two years.”

330
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:52,723
“Left to co-found
indie label Distressed Records...

331
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:55,068
with Harvard classmate, Saul Byron.”

332
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,770
So, you own Distressed Records?

333
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:59,491
I sold all my interest
due to emotional difficulties.

334
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,090
What emotional difficulties?

335
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,408
I was too emotional. Read on.

336
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,720
“Very active on the hip-hop scene
in New York in the early 90s...

337
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,266
the pair were responsible for discovering...

338
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:13,938
numerous break-through artists.
on two Grammys as producer.”

339
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:16,055
“Lives in New York with wife...

340
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:18,418
music journalist Miriam Hart,
and their daughter.”

341
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,266
What happened to the Grammys?

342
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:23,418
I pawned them.

343
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,218
You pawned them?
How much did you get for them?

344
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,397
A hundred and twenty five
for the both of them.

345
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,852
Which got me wasted one weekend
a couple months ago.

346
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,892
Were you drunk when you heard my song?

347
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,203
Absolutely, babe.
That’s when the magic happens.

348
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,491
What magic?

349
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:36,735
I hear things.

350
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:37,947
You hear things?

351
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:40,750
Arrangements.
ou need to be drunk for that sort of thing.

352
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,429
You must have been drunk tonight...

353
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,937
because nobody else heard anything.

354
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,782
No, your song’s good. It’s you.

355
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,325
Standing up there like a tomboy.

356
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:50,450
I don’t mean to be offensive...

357
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:52,430
but don’t you think that looks a little passé?

358
00:23:52,502 --> 00:23:53,009
Really?

359
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:55,491
Seriously. We get you a look.

360
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:58,522
And a killer video.
And you’ll go straight to the top.

361
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:02,512
I’m thinking Nora Jones.
Singersongwriter thing...

362
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:05,387
at a piano. Or the Cardigans.

363
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:09,408
Back in the day
when they first came to America.

364
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,377
Maybe even Debra Harry.

365
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,439
A male band behind you. -- What?

366
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:15,973
You find that amusing?

367
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,012
No, I’m sorry.
Something went down the wrong way.

368
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:21,554
No, you were saying?
Me with a cardigan on? Nora Jones?

369
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,457
Babe, who the fuck do you think you are?

370
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,098
What? You gonna stand up on a stage
with a beat-up guitar...

371
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:29,397
and you think you’re
the new Carole-fucking-King?

372
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:32,377
No. I just think that an A&R man
telling an artist...

373
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:34,911
how they should dress
or come across is total bullshit.

374
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,192
People don’t want that.
They want authenticity.

375
00:24:37,254 --> 00:24:39,222
Okay, babe. Authenticity.

376
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,460
Give me the name of one artist...

377
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:44,345
that you think passes
your authenticity test.

378
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:47,236
Dylan.

379
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:51,377
Dylan. That is the most cultivated artist
you could have thought of.

380
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:54,572
His hair. His sunglasses.
He changes his look every decade.

381
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:55,986
Randy Newman.

382
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,522
I fucking love Randy Newman.
Okay, you got me on that.

383
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:01,845
Listen to me.

384
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,377
I am not saying that you can’t be...

385
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,897
a real bona fide motherfucker
in this business.

386
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,748
But you got to do whatever it takes...

387
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:10,897
and get people in to see your shows...

388
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,543
where the music can start
to do its real work.

389
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:17,670
Oh my God. What were we even talking about?

390
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:21,512
You can’t sign me.
And I don’t want to be signed.

391
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,533
That’s right. What’s not to like?

392
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,533
Come on, let’s get out of here.

393
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:30,959
Ah, shit. You’re gonna.
 have to get these beers, though.

394
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,408
It was really nice to meet you.

395
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,460
Where you going?

396
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,533
To sleep. I have a plane to catch tomorrow.

397
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,151
Where?

398
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:47,141
- Home.
- Why?

399
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,852
Because I’m sick of this city
and I want to go back to Uni.

400
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:53,384
Oh, come on. No one comes to New York...

401
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,756
and just leaves
without something terrible happening.

402
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,512
What happened to you?

403
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:05,066
Come on. You can share with me.
I’m no stranger to misery.

404
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:14,387
Just come to my label
and let me play your demo to my partner.

405
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,543
If it doesn’t work out...

406
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,554
I will personally pay
to change your ticket.

407
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:19,920
What’s one more day in New York,
for crying out loud?

408
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:22,491
You’re just probably gonna go home
and mope around anyway.

409
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,554
All right.

410
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,073
I’m gonna go home and think about it.

411
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,260
And, I’ll call you either way tomorrow.

412
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,416
Okay?

413
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,387
Good answer.

414
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,464
-It was very nice to meet you.
- Yes, pleasure.

415
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:38,576
Pleasure’s mine.

416
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:40,704
You’ve got my number, right?

417
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:41,757
Yeah.

418
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:21,826
-Hi, Dave?
-Yes

419
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:24,470
Hi, I’m Jill.
I work in hospitality with the label.

420
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,333
Right this way. Thank you, Marco.

421
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:27,784
Nice to meet you.

422
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,964
Right this way. Thank you, Marco.

423
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:33,446
I think you’re really gonna like
the apartment.

424
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,141
It’s very high end.

425
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:40,184
I’m sorry. You’re Dave Kohl.

426
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:41,194
Yes.

427
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,771
Yeah. I told you guys!

428
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:46,248
We saw your film the other day.
I so love your songs in it.

429
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:50,564
Thank you. This is Gretta, my girlfriend.
She writes songs too.

430
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,170
Oh, would you mind taking our photograph?

431
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:55,436
That’d be so awesome.
Just that button right there.

432
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:01,419
Yeah, it’s a good one.

433
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:06,181
You’re gonna have to get used to that,
I’m afraid.

434
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,481
This movie is selling out all over town.
It’s pretty crazy.

435
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:10,556
- Unbelievable.
- Oh no, it’s real.

436
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,884
All right, here we are.

437
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:15,335
We hope you like.

438
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:18,665
Your fridge in here is stocked with food.

439
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,895
There are two sets of keys
on the table in there.

440
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:24,111
This is your driver’s number
and my cell phone number.

441
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:25,429
I’ll leave that here.

442
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,977
You’re due at the label later
this afternoon to meet everyone.

443
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,516
And then we’ll take a tour
around the studio.

444
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,480
So, probably want to catch up
on your sleep before then.

445
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,387
I’ll leave you to it. Okay?

446
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,800
Pleased to meet you, Gretta.

447
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:45,656
This place is a shithole.

448
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:58,119
Biggest fridge I’ve ever seen.

449
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,012
Oh my God. Come here.

450
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:04,631
- Hey. Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

451
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,746
Should I have come over in a week or two...

452
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,925
and let you settle in first
and get used to everything?

453
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,950
No.

454
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:11,975
Are you sure?

455
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:14,191
Yeah. I don’t know
if I could do this without you.

456
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,346
It’s kind of scary.

457
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:18,012
Am I a wimp for saying that?

458
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,210
Hey, there he is.

459
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:30,210
Big Dave. What’s up, kid?

460
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:33,138
Good to see you. Gretta?

461
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:34,619
Come on in, guys.

462
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,853
Put Dave at the head of the table.

463
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:36,994
All right. I like it.

464
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,043
You guys meet everyone?

465
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,996
Hi, everybody.

466
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,200
My assistant, Mim. The beautiful Mim.

467
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:44,179
This is Mildred from Marketing.

468
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:45,861
Billy there is Social Media

469
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,165
The rest of the gang,
you’ll meet. Spend time with.

470
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,751
So, Gretta you’re gonna play guitar
on a track or two, I hope.

471
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:53,470
Oh yeah, sure. If Dave wants.

472
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:54,562
Yeah.

473
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,017
Gretta and I have been writing together
for a couple years now.

474
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:58,304
Even before the film came along.

475
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:01,263
So, I would love for us to try
a couple of her songs.

476
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:04,190
Did you write on the film with him?

477
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,335
No, no.

478
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,573
That’s the sound we’re after is
from the movie, right? Dave?

479
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,389
Of course.

480
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:11,003
- Oui? Si?
- Yes. Yes!

481
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,036
- Capice?
- Yes

482
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:16,283
Gretta’s very much apart
of the inspiration behind everything.

483
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,555
She’s not just my girlfriend.
We’re partners almost.

484
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,053
I just wanted to include her.

485
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:26,346
Just to be completely clear.
I’m just tagging along on this.

486
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:28,923
I’m really happy to be here.

487
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:31,321
And happy to accompany Dave
on a couple of tracks.

488
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:34,263
How sweet is this girl? I love that.

489
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,045
How great are these guys? I love them.

490
00:31:57,937 --> 00:32:00,854
Yeah, I’m going on tour with the band.

491
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:02,856
“Rolling Stone.”

492
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:07,311
Yeah. Thank you so much.
It was great talking to you. Thanks.

493
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:09,335
What’s that?

494
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:10,770
That’s matcha tea.

495
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:11,923
Matcha tea?

496
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,983
It’s got like four million antioxidants in it.

497
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:16,625
Oh my God, it tastes like piss.

498
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:17,832
I like it.

499
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,001
The samurais used to drink it
before they went into battle.

500
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,021
You’re not a samurai. You’re a songwriter.

501
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:23,648
Well, I’m kind of like a samurai.

502
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:24,734
Are you?

503
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:27,936
I’m gonna give these to the guys.

504
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,499
Oh, hey. We gotta go to LA
for a week on Monday.

505
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,798
We’re going to LA?

506
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,335
No. Sorry.
It’s just with some of the label guys.

507
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:35,367
They have an office out there.

508
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,224
They want me to meet
this video director guy.

509
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:40,966
But, in the meantime, I’d really like you
to listen to this. So, yes?

510
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:44,059
Yes, I’m sorry. I’ll deliver coffee.

511
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,298
Hey guys, can we do this again, please?

512
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:51,821
Take two. And rolling.

♪ CAUSE THERE’S NO ONE ELSE LIKE... ♪

525
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:13,555
Thank you.

526
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:30,140
Look at you!

527
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:35,561
He has the studio for three months.

528
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:38,164
And then we go on tour.
So I think we’re staying for six?

529
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:40,633
This is unbelievable.
You’re total rock stars.

530
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:43,221
Which studio is he working with?

531
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:44,200
Electric Lady?

532
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:45,210
Oh fuck off.

533
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,709
It’s really cool, isn’t it?

534
00:34:46,744 --> 00:34:47,671
Are you serious?

535
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:49,704
So this is me.

536
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,315
Oh, this is lovely.

537
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,377
Yeah, it’s like that old joke.

538
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:54,270
You put the key in the door,
you break a window.

539
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:57,033
My God, look at all this stuff.

540
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,603
Yeah a lot of the studios are upgrading.

541
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:03,772
So practically giving stuff away.
I can record an album here soon.

542
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:04,765
Well, that’d be cool.

543
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,788
Look at you, you’ve got CDs.

544
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,806
Yeah. I just phased out all my cassettes.
Sit down.

545
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:12,897
How retro of you.

546
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:15,970
I have whiskey. Or water.

547
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,924
Whiskey, please!

548
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,007
Of course you will.

549
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:21,346
Look what you’ve got.

550
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:24,356
People are going crazy for that here.

551
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:27,228
When I play a show and the people know...

552
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:28,711
I went to college in Bristol...

553
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,021
the first thing they ask is
if I know your boyfriend.

554
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,283
Yeah, tell me about it.

555
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,294
I’m becoming “Dave Kohl’s girlfriend”
back home.

556
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:35,920
I’m like, “Hello, we used to be a team.
What happened?”

557
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,997
Oh, you know what they say.
Get your songs in a movie.

558
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:41,308
So, this is me. This is where I’ve been
for God knows how long.

559
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,056
I love it.

560
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:42,926
Do you?

561
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:44,926
Did you see the bed?
I made that bed. That bed is mine.

562
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,669
That’s very impressive.
How’d you get up there?

563
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:47,976
I vault.

564
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:50,236
You vault? With a pole?

565
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:54,513
No, no pole. I do it in one straight...
one straight luge.

566
00:35:55,377 --> 00:35:59,252
Unless I’m drunk. In which case.
It’s off on a dismount.

567
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:03,304
It’s the back I like.
It’s like he’s holding a guitar.

568
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:06,422
But he wants you to think it’s his penis.

569
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:08,155
He’s saying, “Look, it’s a guitar.

570
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:11,158
But it’s not.
This is the actual size of my penis.”

571
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:13,200
Why, no?

572
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:15,325
I am gonna shoot this
because you have to play that...

573
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,294
exactly the way you just played it.

574
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:17,609
Okay, you play the guitar.

575
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:19,875
Because I can’t do that
when that thing’s on.

576
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,169
It’s in G.

577
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:24,874
- I know G.
- I don’t like that.

578
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,286
It doesn’t matter. And you know what?
You have to get over this.

579
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,148
This is an exercise.

580
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:30,283

And I think it’s incredible.

Or, it’s not about
your other boyfriend, right?

615
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:28,863
I don’t know if it’s about you
but it’s definitely for you.

616
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:29,821
I’ll take it.

617
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:30,904

What did you do?

629
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:04,732
Nothing, really.
I just kind of hung around here.

630
00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:07,316
And I went to some botanical gardens.

631
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:08,883
It was very lovely.

632
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,317
It was good.

633
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:11,637
I wrote a new song.

634
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:13,263
- Did you?
- Yeah.

635
00:39:13,788 --> 00:39:15,851

- I would be very interested.

I don’t know what to say.

664
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:39,946
It just happened.

665
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,214
Maybe it’ll go away.

666
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:46,254
Maybe it’ll fade. I

667
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,372
I have to see it through.

668
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,988
Do you want to put your head
on this end or this end?

669
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:38,933
Do you want a tea?

670
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,871
I don’t remember if you take sugar or...

671
00:42:55,621 --> 00:42:57,641
I’m gonna wing it. I’ll wing it.

672
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:02,250
Please won’t you come out with me tonight?

673
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:04,535
I’m gonna play some songs down
at this open mic night.

674
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,867
Why don’t you come with me?

675
00:43:05,912 --> 00:43:07,840
Cause I hate your fucking songs.

676
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:11,270
I think we both know that isn’t true.

677
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,725
Sorry, I didn’t... No, I love your songs.

678
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,319
I’m paying fucking horrendous right now...

679
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:21,660
which is exactly why I need to go home.

680
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:23,668
That’s exactly
why you need to come with me.

681
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:25,857
Come on. I insist.

682
00:43:26,082 --> 00:43:27,988
Pick that up & come with me.

683
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,978
You’re coming. I’m not leaving you here.

684
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:32,636
Come back,
I’ll find your fucking head in the oven.

685
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:37,926
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I have a friend here tonight.

686
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:39,537
And if it’s okay with you,
I was wondering...

687
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:43,861
if you’d like her to come up here
and play one of her songs.

688
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,580
Is that okay? Yeah?

689
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,707
Gretta would you come up here please.

690
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:08,278
Hello.

691
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,199
Hey.

692
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:12,137
Were you serious last night
about signing me?

693
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:13,395
Who is this?

694
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:15,311
Really?

695
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:18,261
I’m joking. Yeah, I was serious.

696
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:22,689
I have all my suits here.

697
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:25,546
Would you get me a nice suit
and make me look nice, princess.

698
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:28,280
I heard a song last night
and I’m telling you...

699
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:31,407
it’s exactly what that shit ass 
record label needs right now.

700
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:33,030
You can’t just barge in here.
You can’t come in here like this.

701
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:34,163
Why?

702
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:35,432
Because that’s our arrangement.

703
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:36,405
What you got somebody here?

704
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:38,447
That’s not the point.
We have an arrangement.

705
00:44:38,488 --> 00:44:39,159
Hello!

706
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:39,870
Stop that.

707
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,837
Stray man! Any stray man!
Don’t worry about me.

708
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:44,857
It’s just her husband taking a shower

709
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:46,730
You can continue fucking my wife.

710
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,941
That’s not funny.

711
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,478
Hey, I’m sorry.

712
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,548
If I did, you’d be the first I’d tell.

713
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:52,605
So you’re not.

714
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:55,332
Get you a shirt and a...

715
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:56,548
No razor.

716
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:03,866
You want to come in?

717
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:06,850
You want to sexy time?

718
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:08,404
No.

719
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,498
Ready?

720
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:20,565
So where are we going mister A and R man?

721
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:22,331
We’re going to my partner
to play him your music.

722
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:23,426
You got your demo?

723
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,384
No.

724
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,331
You don’t have a demo?

725
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:27,172
No.

726
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:29,214
Do you have My Space or Facebook?

727
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,284
My Space? No, I don’t.

728
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:34,089
I told you.
I write songs from time to time.

729
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:37,374
Well, what do you write them for?

730
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,415
What do you mean what for? For my pleasure.

731
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:40,478
For my cat.

732
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:41,701
Oh, really? Does he like them?

733
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,604
She. Yes, she seems to.

734
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,990
How do you know?

735
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:47,149
Because she purrs.

736
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:48,348
Maybe she’s booing.

737
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:51,322
No, she purrs at Leonard Cohen too.
She has very good taste.

738
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:52,395
Maybe she’s fucking with you.

739
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:53,834
Can we stop talking about cats now?

740
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:54,498
Okay.

741
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:55,178
Okay.

742
00:45:58,245 --> 00:46:00,266
Fuck it. Let’s do this
the old-fashioned way.

743
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:09,374
♪ SO FIND YOURSELF AT THE SUBWAY. ♪

744
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:14,139
♪ WITH YOUR WORLD IN A BAG BY YOUR SIDE. ♪

745
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:25,047
Thank you, Gretta. Thanks for coming in.

746
00:46:25,176 --> 00:46:27,342
I’m just going to take a moment
to talk with Dan for a minute.

747
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:30,345
Thank you.

748
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:36,633
I’m not into it.
It’s a little undercooked for me.

749
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:38,889
She seems to have kind of
an attitude problem and...

750
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,810
What are you looking for man?

751
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:44,235
You want some little teenaged pop star....

752
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:47,409
whose mom’s been raising
since two years old for stardom.

753
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:50,932
No, that’s not what I’m looking for,
but if you know someone...

754
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:52,713
Just give me the money to make the demo.

755
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:55,837
I’ll take her into the studio.
Get a hot shit producer.

756
00:46:55,933 --> 00:46:57,852
Get a couple of session musicians,
dial the thing out...

757
00:46:57,913 --> 00:46:59,884
and then you can hear what I’m hearing.

758
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,575
And then you can tell me to fuck myself.

759
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,371
People send us their demos.

760
00:47:03,796 --> 00:47:06,025
It’s not the other way around.
We don’t make demos.

761
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:09,030
We’re prospectors man. We’re investors.

762
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:11,381
We’re digging for gold.

763
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:15,674
Make a tape and we’ll get back to you.

764
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,116
That’s the best I can do right now, bro.

765
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,469
So, I’ve been thinking.

766
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:31,485
Why do we even need
to rent a fucking studio?

767
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,222
Because you need a desk,
a live room and sound proofing.

768
00:47:38,304 --> 00:47:41,387
Laptop. Pro Tools.
A couple of dynamic mics.

769
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:44,573
And the city is our fucking live room.

770
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,881
You mean record outside?

771
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,707
- That’s right.
- Like where?

772
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:48,749
Everywhere.

773
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:49,812
Fuck him.

774
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,566
We don’t need a demo.
Let’s record an album.

775
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,605
Every song we do in a different location.

776
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:56,138
All over New York City.

777
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:57,732
And we do it through the summer.

778
00:47:57,777 --> 00:48:00,829
And it becomes this tribute to
this beautiful, God damn crazy...

779
00:48:00,926 --> 00:48:03,770
fractured mess of a city. New York.

780
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,707
Okay.

781
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,707
Under the bridge on the lower east side.

782
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:08,874
Top of the Empire State building.

783
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,046
On rowing boats in the lake
in Central Park.

784
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:14,102
Chinatown.
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine

785
00:48:14,442 --> 00:48:16,546
In the subway. Fucking Harlem. Everywhere.

786
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,749
So what happens if it starts raining.

787
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,407
Whatever happens, we record it.

788
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:22,626
If we get arrested?

789
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:24,254
Keep rolling! It’ll be beautiful.

790
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:25,398
You like it?

791
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,397
What do you think? It’s good.

792
00:48:28,894 --> 00:48:30,089
Will you produce it?

793
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:31,510
Me?

794
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:32,645
Yeah.

795
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:33,750
I haven’t produced in a long time.

796
00:48:33,853 --> 00:48:35,791
We’ll get somebody young to produce it.

797
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:36,916
No, but I want you to do it.

798
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:37,631
Why?

799
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:39,684
Because I do.

800
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:43,468
I give you strings,
but we definitely need piano.

801
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:44,780
Then with the guitars underneath.

802
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:45,791
Got it. I love it.

803
00:48:45,832 --> 00:48:46,749
- Done.
- Done.

804
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,853
The world’s first Jag mobile recording studio.

805
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:50,616
It’s done.

806
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:55,027
It’s bloody genius it is.

807
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,165
Where do you want to go?

808
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,392
We need musicians.

809
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:01,454
Terminally, miserably bored musicians.

810
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:03,329
After that I think...

811
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:06,653
then you bring in the violin and cello.
First cello then violin.

812
00:49:06,931 --> 00:49:08,176
When we get into that lead guitar thing...

813
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:10,668
I want it to become
a whole different kind of sound.

814
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:22,467
This is Malcolm.
Malcolm is a child prodigy.

815
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:25,780
He’s been playing violin
since he was five years old.

816
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:27,749
I technically started when I was four.

817
00:49:28,077 --> 00:49:28,895
Four.

818
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:31,681
And this is his older sister, Rachel.

819
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:34,780
She’s at the Manhattan School of Music
on a full scholarship.

820
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:35,905
Top of her class cellist.

821
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:36,764
That’s amazing.

822
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:38,244
So here’s the deal.

823
00:49:38,526 --> 00:49:40,204
I can’t afford to pay you up front.

824
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:44,147
So I want to offer you
a legitimate back end deal.

825
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:45,895
Sound good?

826
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
Yeah, as long as it’s not fucking Vivaldi.

827
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,594
It’s not fucking Vivaldi.

828
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:52,530
It’s great. No, no, no. It’s great.

829
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,832
Definitely need piano.
Like fill in the guitar underneath.

830
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:58,600
You got it. I love it.

831
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,265
Steve, beautiful.

832
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:19,160
Zach. What’s going on?

833
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,627
I quit.

834
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:21,710
Good luck girls.

835
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:23,634
Keep in touch.

836
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,205
When we get into that lead guitar thing.

837
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:27,841
I want it to become just
a whole different kind of sound.

838
00:50:27,877 --> 00:50:30,396
I want it to be punk meets pop.

839
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:33,238
And have some fun.

840
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:57,559
Ah, he’s home.

841
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,293
Dano, what’s up, man?

842
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:06,489
Troublegum, my brother.
My troubles are over.

843
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:08,726
What say you give me some love, man

844
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,251
This is it! Gangsta paradise.

845
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:11,259
I’m glad to see you.

846
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:12,358
Thanks to you.

847
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:13,506
Give me a hug. I don’t know you

848
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:14,576
That’s Gretta.

849
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:16,459
Great singer and songwriter.

850
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:18,157
Let’s get another one.

851
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,501
Where have you been?
It’s been two or years.

852
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:22,273
I don’t appreciate this shit.

853
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,843
Been on the down low a little bit.
Doing this. Doing that.

854
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:27,259
Waiting for the next move.

855
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,281
Anticipating the next groove.

856
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,991
I know you got
a lot of shit to prove. Right?

857
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:35,472
Been on the underground,
looking for that new sound.

858
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,153
We aint fucking around.

859
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:40,832
Cause if it ain’t right then it’s wrong.

860
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,943
And the road is long,

861
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,938
and you’re only as strong

862
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:46,963
as your next move.

863
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,432
You feel that?

864
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:51,714
That’s pretty much it.

865
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:54,728
Damn. That was like 
some paranormal activity.

866
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,299
You know me.

867
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,275
I’m just so happy to see you, man

868
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:00,345
Yo! Fat Jimmy did you get that down.

869
00:52:00,762 --> 00:52:01,678
Yeah, I got it.

870
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:03,196
Cause that was exceptionally good.

871
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:04,600
Hold my hand, baby. Come on.

872
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:06,430
How can I help you, brother?

873
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,705
An outdoor album! That’s fucking crazy.

874
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:11,533
I wish I could have thought of that.

875
00:52:11,603 --> 00:52:12,572
What do you want me to do?

876
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:15,512
I need musicians.
I need a base player and a drummer.

877
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:16,707
I got plenty of musicians.

878
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:18,809
The problem is we can’t pay them.

879
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:22,986
Fuck it. I’ll pay them.

880
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:23,830
Why?

881
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:25,944
What do you mean “why?” For him.

882
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,442
Of course.

883
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,281
Come on. Get your sexy self in the pool.

884
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,296
I will kill you.

885
00:52:36,104 --> 00:52:38,272
She’s English. She’s a little uptight.

886
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,624
Good luck on the album, Gretta.

887
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:41,653
Thank you.

888
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:45,220
Everything you see around here.
This crib. These cars.

889
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,334
They’re because of him.

890
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:49,087
I don’t ever forget that.

891
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:50,278
I get it.

892
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,260
No, no, no.

893
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,229
You can’t know.

894
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:56,208
A guy like that falls on his luck
for a couple of years.

895
00:52:56,249 --> 00:52:58,208
People lose sight of who he is.

896
00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:00,716
And they don’t treat him with the respect.
He deserves.

897
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:02,916
Anything he’s saying is bullshit.

898
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:10,362
Anything you need, okay?

899
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,603
I love you, man. Thank you.

900
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:13,012
I like her.

901
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:19,530
Are you serious? Are you listening to this?

902
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,682
We’re gonna use it. It’s gonna be genius.

903
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,249
You’re a genius. I don’t have any fear.

904
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:27,947
You don’t hear what I hear.

905
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:29,674
You’re gonna make it real. I love it.

906
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:30,736
Got it?

907
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:37,047
- Those kids are gonna be all over this track.
- What do you mean?

908
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,947
Take this.

909
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:50,176
Little children. Yo! Yo! Yo!

910
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:51,533
Let me see this for a second.

911
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,750
I’m shooting a song down here...

912
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:55,598
and I need you guys to be quiet
for five minutes.

913
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:56,309
No way, man.

914
00:53:56,368 --> 00:53:57,385
I’ll pay you.

915
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:58,653
- How much?
- A buck each.

916
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,223
Hey, you’re funny. Five dollars.

917
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:02,184
Five bucks for all of you guys.

918
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:04,020
Okay. Two bucks ! Two bucks each.

919
00:54:04,627 --> 00:54:05,658
No!

920
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:09,145
All right. Five bucks each.

921
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:12,333
Bring us five bucks and five lollipops.
 One for each of us.

922
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:14,809
Throw in a box of cigarettes and lighter.

923
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,123
I’ll give you one cigarette for each of you
to smoke and you share it.

924
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:20,243
And I’ll give you a pack of matches.
All right?

925
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,229
Yes.

926
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,322

Yes! It’s gonna work!.

960
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,958
Oh my God! Is that the Empire State?

961
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:58,151
Yeah, right here.

962
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:01,747
Get up here. Get that.

963
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:03,221
It’s really good.

964
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,918
It’s great.

965
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,355
The wind’s good, right?

966
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:07,546
It’s not too loud. It’s good

967
00:57:08,754 --> 00:57:11,512
And we can look into people’s windows
which is always fun.

968
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:13,472
You want to come with me to get Violet.

969
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,291
Is that okay?

970
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,249
Yeah. Come on.

971
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,322
My brother. There you go.

972
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:18,697
Thank you very much.

973
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,208
That’s her.

974
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:40,074
This is Gretta. She’s the song writer
I was telling you about.

975
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:41,959
My daughter, Violet.

976
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,015
How are you doing?

977
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:56,249
So who was the cute guy?
The one in the blue shirt.

978
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,473
Greg. You noticed him?

979
00:57:58,204 --> 00:58:01,121
Sure. Who wouldn’t? He’s gorgeous.

980
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,645
He’s totally out of our league.

981
00:58:03,705 --> 00:58:05,004
He’s out of your league?

982
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:08,291
He didn’t look out of your league.

983
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:14,408
Ignore him.

984
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,695
How can you get someone to notice
you’re ignoring them...

985
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:18,887
if they’re ignoring you?

986
00:58:18,947 --> 00:58:21,009
He’s not ignoring you. You’re beautiful.

987
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:23,572
He knows you’re there.
He’s just hedging his bets.

988
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:28,385
You have to be sure
that you actually like him.

989
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,488
That he’s not just the guy in school
to be seen with.

990
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,011
No, I do really like him.

991
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:35,535
Well, then, you have to find a way
to get him to ask you out.

992
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:38,324
Yes, but how?

993
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:41,796
Well, for starters, stop dressing
 like you’re totally easy!

994
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,265
I thought this was sort of sexy.
It’s American Apparel.

995
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:50,066
It is sort of sexy. It’s very, very sexy.

996
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:54,002
But it doesn’t leave much
to the imagination. You know?

997
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,395
I guess.

998
00:58:58,259 --> 00:58:59,582
You want to go shopping.

999
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:01,656
I do.

1000
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:03,039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1001
00:59:03,103 --> 00:59:04,082
Okay, good.

1002
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:06,233
We’re going shopping.

1003
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1004
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:20,716
Good luck with the rest of your album.
It sounds cool.

1005
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:21,610
Thank you.

1006
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:23,012
You have your key?

1007
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:24,071
Yep.

1008
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:26,431
Hey you should come sing on a track?

1009
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,604
I can’t sing.

1010
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:30,444
I can play like a bit of guitar.

1011
00:59:30,509 --> 00:59:32,257
Can you? We’re doing one on Thursday.

1012
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,189
It will be really simple.
You should come and play.

1013
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:35,361
Can I dad?

1014
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:38,434
I need to contemplate that.

1015
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,098
What are you doing? That ain’t cool.

1016
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,064
I don’t know if she can play guitar
well enough to play on a track.

1017
00:59:52,286 --> 00:59:55,098
I don’t won’t to embarrass her.
What if she can’t play?

1018
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,223
Look, it’s going to be easy. Let her do it.

1019
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:07,423
Yeah?

1020
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,302
Hey, babe.

1021
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:12,749
Where’s Violet?

1022
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:15,468
Violet?

1023
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:20,616
I was wondering...
You think it would be cool if she came...

1024
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:24,807
and played guitar on a song
I’m recording on Thursday?

1025
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,749
She’s terrible on guitar.

1026
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,739
She’s not bad.

1027
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:30,666
I think she’ll be okay.

1028
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:32,364
When will she...?

1029
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:34,296
Five o’clock. Will you bring her?

1030
01:00:35,314 --> 01:00:36,610
It’s up to you.

1031
01:00:36,773 --> 01:00:39,985
I’ll text you the address.
Why don’t you come to?

1032
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:45,348
No way.

1033
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,309
Come on. Just come. It’ll be fun.

1034
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:49,900
I want you to come.

1035
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:51,631
I’ll think about it.

1036
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:54,521
- I’ll come, maybe.
- Thank you.

1037
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,468
You know it was nice to see you
and Violet today.

1038
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:19,840
It must be hard not seeing her more.

1039
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:20,969
Yeah it’s...

1040
01:01:23,488 --> 01:01:25,307
So why don’t you?

1041
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:28,282
She obviously really needs
her father around.

1042
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:31,199
What are you
 the fucking Social Services now?

1043
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,293
No. I mean I’m just saying...

1044
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:37,220
It must have been fairly tense
for you to leave.

1045
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:39,676
Especially seeing as how much
she obviously wants you around.

1046
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,051
I’m gonna split.
I’ll see you tomorrow morning.

1047
01:01:58,432 --> 01:01:59,516
Fuck, man.

1048
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:04,849
Dan?

1049
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,988
Hey, look. I’m sorry.

1050
01:02:08,753 --> 01:02:09,361
I’m sorry.

1051
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:13,050
What do you want from me?
What game are you playing?

1052
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,251
What does that mean?

1053
01:02:15,529 --> 01:02:16,293
I just...

1054
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:17,308
What?

1055
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,168
I saw how sweet she was today...

1056
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:21,209
and I just felt sorry
for you being away from that.

1057
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:23,223
That is such a crock of shit .
You were back there judging me.

1058
01:02:23,297 --> 01:02:25,245
You think that I left that relationship...

1059
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:27,976
because I’m some sort of selfish,
depressed prick.

1060
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:29,336
Which I am, by the way.

1061
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:31,272
No. I don’t think you’re a selfish,
depressed prick.

1062
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:34,178
I think you’ve let your troubles get in
the way of your entire life.

1063
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,334
Oh, babe. You’re really showing
your age right now.

1064
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:40,293
You have no idea what happens
between two people...

1065
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:42,251
after 18 years of marriage.

1066
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:45,293
And because you’re willing
to hang around for some asshole...

1067
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,850
after he totally betrayed you,
that’s your business.

1068
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,722
Oh no. I’m sorry. You’re right.

1069
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:52,250
I put a lot of time and effort
into that relationship. And no!

1070
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:55,109
I’m not walking away just because of
a bump in the road!

1071
01:02:55,178 --> 01:02:56,261
Bump in the road?

1072
01:02:56,334 --> 01:03:00,188
I left that relationship cause
I was having a nervous breakdown.

1073
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,261
And she was out there
fucking some other guy...

1074
01:03:02,303 --> 01:03:04,261
planning how she was gonna start
a whole new life with him...

1075
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:06,303
when I was here taking care of my kid!

1076
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:09,730
You have no fucking clue
what you’re talking about!

1077
01:03:10,168 --> 01:03:11,324
You know nothing!

1078
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:27,230
She goes a year up to work on a junket.

1079
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:32,240
And she ends up meeting
and falling in love with this singer.

1080
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:37,178
Bang. Boom. Thunder, lightning. Fireworks.
The whole bit.

1081
01:03:38,129 --> 01:03:42,450
And the arrangement was that
they were gonna come back...

1082
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:44,980
and tell their partners that
they had fallen in love...

1083
01:03:45,016 --> 01:03:47,137
and they’re gonna spend
the rest of their lives together.

1084
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,251
And so I go to the airport
to pick her up...

1085
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,178
and she just comes out with it first off.
Whole story.

1086
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:57,188
Then next day her bags are all packed...

1087
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,376
and we’re telling Violet
what’s going to happen.

1088
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,214
So what did happen?

1089
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:04,334
He choked. He got on the airplane.
Went back to his life.

1090
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:06,991
Turned his phone off
and she never heard from him again.

1091
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,797
I move into another bedroom.

1092
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:11,602
She’s waiting around for a phone call
that never comes.

1093
01:04:11,925 --> 01:04:13,060
And I turn into a...

1094
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:19,797
I lose my shit a little bit.

1095
01:04:21,397 --> 01:04:23,178
So sorry.

1096
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,082
No.

1097
01:04:24,939 --> 01:04:26,991
Maybe people in the music industry don’t...

1098
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:29,866
just don’t make good life partners.
Or fathers.

1099
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,970
Yeah. It certainly looks that way.

1100
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:37,364
I didn’t mean about the father’s bit.
You make a very good father.

1101
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,310
Yeah, right.

1102
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,250
Maybe just not a good partner.

1103
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:47,599
What is that?

1104
01:04:47,734 --> 01:04:49,693
This? That’s a splitter.

1105
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:53,121
For two headphones go into one input.

1106
01:04:53,776 --> 01:04:57,401
It’s actually from my first date
with Miriam.

1107
01:04:57,651 --> 01:04:58,568
It is?

1108
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:00,666
Where’d you meet?

1109
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:04,651
We walked all over the city,
listening to her CD player.

1110
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:08,213
I don’t think we said
more than two words...

1111
01:05:08,296 --> 01:05:09,280
to each other the whole night.

1112
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,672
That was New Year’s Eve
and we were married two months later.

1113
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,693
That’s lovely.

1114
01:05:16,588 --> 01:05:17,877
What kind of music you got on your phone?

1115
01:05:18,693 --> 01:05:21,651
I’m not giving you access
to my music library. I’m really not.

1116
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:24,674
There’s a lot of embarrassing,
very guilty pleasures in there.

1117
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:25,755
Mine too.

1118
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:29,017
You can tell a lot about a person
by what’s on their playlist.

1119
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,124
I know you can. That’s what’s worrying me.

1120
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:33,992
So are we gonna do this?

1121
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:36,765
Okay. Let’s do it

1122
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:24,296
This is a really good choice!

1123
01:06:27,752 --> 01:06:28,619
Oh yeah.

1124
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:30,682
Genius. Perfect. Right?

1125
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:31,693
Yeah. Yeah.

1126
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:38,265
Oh no! I forgot the words!

1127
01:06:40,238 --> 01:06:41,734
Okay! Okay, we’ve got to dance.

1128
01:06:41,776 --> 01:06:42,693
What?

1129
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:44,059
We’ve got to dance!

1130
01:06:44,693 --> 01:06:47,082
- Okay, we’ve got to dance.
- We’ve gotta dance!

1131
01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:49,630
This way.

1132
01:07:52,432 --> 01:07:54,299
I’m quite frightened cause
you might find this cheesy...

1133
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:57,586
but it is one of my favorite songs
from one of my favorite films.

1134
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:00,044
Are you ready?

1135
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,491
It’s good, right?

1136
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,630
That’s what I love about music.

1137
01:08:38,672 --> 01:08:39,588
What?

1138
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,411
One of the most banal scenes
is suddenly invested...

1139
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:43,598
with so much meaning.

1140
01:08:43,672 --> 01:08:45,588
All these banalities.

1141
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,745
They’re suddenly turned into these...

1142
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:49,776
these beautiful, effervescent pearls.

1143
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,693
From music.

1144
01:09:03,919 --> 01:09:07,640
I’ve gotta say,
as I’ve gotten older these pearls...

1145
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:11,776
are just becoming
increasingly more and more rare to me.

1146
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:14,792
More string than pearls?

1147
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:20,672
You’ve got to travel over a lot
more string to get to the pearls.

1148
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:23,693
This moment is a pearl, Gretta.

1149
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:25,713
It sort of is, isn’t it?

1150
01:09:26,651 --> 01:09:28,630
All of this has been a pearl.

1151
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:57,599
Hey guys!

1152
01:09:59,309 --> 01:10:00,226
Hi.

1153
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,271
Hello Steve.

1154
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:04,661
Come on and check it out.
Your boyfriend just won a Music Gong.

1155
01:10:05,278 --> 01:10:06,268
No way.

1156
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:07,554
You won’t believe it.

1157
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:09,672
He’s done something to his face.

1158
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:11,786
Wow. Thank you so much.

1159
01:10:11,919 --> 01:10:14,575
I’m a bit taken aback by this.
This is incredible.

1160
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:17,609
It just proves that a guy from nowhere...

1161
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:21,599
can actually make it
if he follows his dreams.

1162
01:10:21,786 --> 01:10:23,640
I’ve been practicing this speech...

1163
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:26,630
into a shampoo bottle
in the shower my entire life.

1164
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:31,658
Gosh. Thank you.

1165
01:10:32,599 --> 01:10:33,682
Nice beard, you fucking loser.

1166
01:10:33,724 --> 01:10:34,724
What dreams?

1167
01:10:34,765 --> 01:10:37,716
We never had those dreams.
I don’t remember those dreams.

1168
01:10:37,778 --> 01:10:38,757
How do you know?

1169
01:10:38,809 --> 01:10:40,672
Because, I know him.

1170
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,546
Maybe they were private dreams.

1171
01:10:44,108 --> 01:10:46,005
Maybe he just never told you about them.

1172
01:10:47,191 --> 01:10:49,170
Who was I living
with for the last five years?

1173
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:52,180
Baby, you’ve been living with a rock star.
Only he didn’t know it.

1174
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:53,264
It didn’t matter.

1175
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:55,690
But now that he does,
I’ve gotta tell you...

1176
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,149
these people get married to it.

1177
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:59,316
They fall in love with the music.
They fall in love with the lights.

1178
01:11:00,108 --> 01:11:02,180
They fall in love with the road.
The chicks. All that shit.

1179
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:04,628
And no matter how hard he tries...

1180
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:07,820
he’s never gonna be able
to make a woman happy.

1181
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,274
See you in the morning.

1182
01:11:13,191 --> 01:11:14,108
See you.

1183
01:11:14,176 --> 01:11:15,341
He just looks a dick.

1184
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:16,714
Why would he do that?

1185
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:18,222
I don’t know. Well why would anyone?

1186
01:11:18,285 --> 01:11:19,274
I’ll tell you why he did it.

1187
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,274
Cause he wants to look like
the guy who doesn’t realize it.

1188
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:22,726
“Oh! I’ve grown a beard!”

1189
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:25,149
“I was so busy,
lost inside myself writing music...

1190
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:28,274
I didn’t realize
I’d grown a beard the size of my neck.”

1191
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:31,180
I’m gonna sound quite cheesy over it.

1192
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:34,554
I loved him like a fool.

1193
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,115
I don’t think that’s cheesy.

1194
01:11:36,136 --> 01:11:38,198
I think that sounds like a phenomenal song.

1195
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,038
Does it?

1196
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:41,047
It sounds like a song
and I think it sounds like a song...

1197
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:43,108
that you should write right now.
You should write it down.

1198
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:44,149
Write it down.

1199
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:47,164
Write it down, cause you’re in the zone.
Say, “I’m in the zone.”

1200
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:48,253
I’m in the zone.

1201
01:11:48,295 --> 01:11:50,222
Don’t say it like
you’re those posh English girls.

1202
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,118
Say it like someone in New York.
Say, “I’m in the fucking zone.”

1203
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,108
- Say, “I’m in the fucking zone."
- I’m in the fucking zone.

1204
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,118
I’ve gotta write a song.
And I don’t give a shit.”

1205
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,170
I’m gonna write a song.
No, actually shut up.

1206
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:00,554
All right. I’m shushing. I’m shushing.

1207
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,812
Dialing.

1208
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:04,191
All right, here we go.

1209
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:05,592
Speaker.

1210
01:12:06,108 --> 01:12:07,170
Hey, this is Dave Kohl.

1211
01:12:07,212 --> 01:12:09,865

1213
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:14,044

Hey!

1235
01:16:00,337 --> 01:16:04,108
Everybody! This is Miriam.

1236
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:05,149
This is Gretta.

1237
01:16:05,454 --> 01:16:07,329
This is my daughter Violet.

1238
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:10,285
Miriam. Thank you.

1239
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:13,222
It’s not too high is it?

1240
01:16:13,764 --> 01:16:15,834
It’s not too high for a bass. Exactly.

1241
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:19,037
No one should play bass
unless it’s this high.

1242
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,169
You want me to set
your amp or are you good?

1243
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,212
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

1244
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:29,316
Rachel. At the top,
come in a little more gradually.

1245
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:30,436
Bad Jimmy!

1246
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:31,253
Yo, what’s up?

1247
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,212
Come on, man.

1248
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:33,191
All right. I got you.

1249
01:16:33,233 --> 01:16:35,897
The police ain’t gonna get you up here.
Let’s hear that bass.

1250
01:16:36,078 --> 01:16:37,217
I got you, baby. I got you.

1251
01:16:37,274 --> 01:16:39,233
Wait a minute. Do you play bass?

1252
01:16:39,274 --> 01:16:41,149
You were out of tune. You are flat.

1253
01:16:41,191 --> 01:16:43,253
Because I read on the internet
that you used to play bass.

1254
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:47,264
If we can get Violet
doing some guitar on this?

1255
01:16:47,305 --> 01:16:49,375
This should be a family affair.

1256
01:16:49,516 --> 01:16:51,703
I’m a producer
cause I don’t play bass, baby.

1257
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:55,233
Yes you are! You gotta do it.
You gotta do it!

1258
01:16:55,295 --> 01:16:57,149
All right! All right!

1259
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:59,649
Come in whenever you want. You can wait.

1260
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:02,118
Just keep it simple.

1261
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,781
I don’t know if I’m gonna play.

1262
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,437
Whatever.
If you feel like it you do it. Okay?

1263
01:17:08,227 --> 01:17:10,524
It’s totally cool.
But don’t feel like you have to overdo it…

1301
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,819
Hello.

1302
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:23,860
Congratulations.

1303
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:26,027
Thank you. We should have a toast.
Right now.

1304
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,605
To your album?

1305
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:28,948
To our album.

1306
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:35,209
Really?

1307
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:38,850
Don’t get too excited.
I’m just trying it out.

1308
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,802
Should we toast to that?

1309
01:21:47,985 --> 01:21:50,227
Goddamn. How do people drink that?

1310
01:21:57,902 --> 01:21:59,850
We’re going to play a game.

1311
01:21:59,891 --> 01:22:03,839
I’m going to play a song
that is impossible to not dance to.

1312
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:06,944
I defy you not to dance to this song.

1313
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:17,975
This is good.

1314
01:22:21,027 --> 01:22:23,944
You know you want to. You know you want to!

1315
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:31,006
Oh, you know you want to. You do.

1316
01:22:31,944 --> 01:22:35,027
Oh! There it is! There it is!

1317
01:23:19,891 --> 01:23:20,975
I’m gonna give them a ride home.

1318
01:23:22,385 --> 01:23:23,797
- Good night.
- Good night.

1319
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:27,985
Thank you for everything.

1320
01:23:28,027 --> 01:23:29,258
No, thank you for everything.

1321
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,058
OK asshole, let’s meet.

1322
01:24:18,271 --> 01:24:19,774
So how was touring?

1323
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:23,541
Touring was amazing. Grueling. Punishing.

1324
01:24:24,107 --> 01:24:25,169
Inspiring.

1325
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,025
Did you find yourself?

1326
01:24:27,138 --> 01:24:28,127
I don’t know.

1327
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,800
Well, you certainly found a beard anyway.

1328
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:31,830
Look at that thing.

1329
01:24:33,086 --> 01:24:34,950
- It’s intense.
- It’s big.

1330
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,469
Did Mim go with you? On tour?

1331
01:24:41,652 --> 01:24:43,344
You just wanna go straight into this then?

1332
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:44,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1333
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,945
Are you the happiest couple ever?
Or did you...

1334
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:50,065
break up after a month
and she came back to New York on a bus.

1335
01:24:50,106 --> 01:24:52,992
It was a train actually.

1336
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:56,964
I’m sorry. I’m being a bitch.

1337
01:24:57,263 --> 01:24:58,273
No.

1338
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:00,476
You’re entitled.

1339
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:05,931
So, what’ve you been up to?

1340
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,656
HOLD ON.

1341
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:13,552
HOLD ON. THEY’RE NOT FALLING…

1342
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:17,127
God... It’s amazing, Gretta.

1343
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:18,252
Really?

1344
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:22,315
Totally. Ambient sound. The city.

1345
01:25:23,794 --> 01:25:25,632
And that’s it? No over-dubs? Nothing?

1346
01:25:25,723 --> 01:25:27,817
No, no, no. It’s just the way you hear it.

1347
01:25:28,132 --> 01:25:29,153
God, it’s so great.

1348
01:25:29,656 --> 01:25:31,287
And they’re really offering you a deal.

1349
01:25:31,341 --> 01:25:34,570
Well, I don’t know.
He has to play it to his partner first.

1350
01:25:35,073 --> 01:25:36,053
So, we’ll see.

1351
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:41,309
I cannot believe
what he’s done with your songs.

1352
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:42,401
I know. He’s amazing.

1353
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,644
You should get him to do your record.

1354
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:45,722
Ah, it’s too late.

1355
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,139
I just finished mastering the record in LA.

1356
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:51,419
Yeah, I recorded in various studios
on the road.

1357
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:53,470
Wow. So what’s it called?

1358
01:25:54,379 --> 01:25:55,420
“On the Road.”

1359
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:00,983
So it’s kind of like Kerouac.

1360
01:26:01,985 --> 01:26:02,996
Yeah.

1361
01:26:03,317 --> 01:26:05,560
Yeah it is.
That’s actually a terrible album name.

1362
01:26:06,824 --> 01:26:07,772
No.

1363
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:09,761
It worked for him.

1364
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:12,077
No. It’s bad.

1365
01:26:12,186 --> 01:26:14,019
I know that you now it’s bad.

1366
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:15,371
No. I’m... I’m…

1367
01:26:18,379 --> 01:26:19,584
Would you like to go hear it?

1368
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:21,596

I think that you’ve lost the songs
in the production.

1383

Okay, take ”Lost Stars.”

1384
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,899
I wrote it as a ballad.

1385
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:17,810
And it sounds like a piece of stadium pop.

1386
01:27:18,396 --> 01:27:20,693
Yeah but, I wanted to turn it into a hit.

1387
01:27:20,899 --> 01:27:21,847
Why?

1388
01:27:21,953 --> 01:27:23,328
Why? What kind of question is that?

1389
01:27:23,384 --> 01:27:25,413
You’re the writer.
You get sole writing credit on it, Gretta.

1390
01:27:25,496 --> 01:27:26,515
This is huge for you.

1391
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:30,626
Yeah, but you weren’t supposed
to lose the song in it. It’s…

1392
01:27:32,552 --> 01:27:33,531
It’s delicate.

1393
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:36,490
I really…
I think you should get it remixed.

1394
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:38,948
Yeah but, everyone loves it
when we do it. It’s amazing.

1395
01:27:38,997 --> 01:27:41,495
You have to come see it live.
The reaction to it.

1396
01:27:41,573 --> 01:27:42,615
The energy in the room just changes.

1397
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:44,635
Why are you so worried
about what other people think?

1398
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:46,035
It’s our song.

1399
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:49,675
It is, but… Isn’t that what music is about?
Sharing it with people.

1400
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:51,293
No, not that song, Dave.

1401
01:27:52,462 --> 01:27:54,846
Okay. Then… Who do we get to remix this?

1402
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:56,596
Mim. Maybe you should get Mim to remix it.

1403
01:27:56,957 --> 01:27:59,675
Really? So this is obviously not anything
about the album.

1404
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:00,677
You think?

1405
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:09,076
Don’t become this music biz couple,
you know?

1406
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:12,097
Arguing about our… our albums.

1407
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:15,573
The funny thing about all this...

1408
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:18,498
is that I would throw that fucking record
into the ocean...

1409
01:28:18,563 --> 01:28:20,563
if we could just continue
this conversation right now.

1410
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,700
This is what I want to talk about. Okay?

1411
01:28:22,938 --> 01:28:26,719
And if I could somehow say something
or do anything...

1412
01:28:26,761 --> 01:28:28,803
that would undo what I did to us…

1413
01:28:28,905 --> 01:28:31,821
Just tell me what it is. Help me.

1414
01:28:32,118 --> 01:28:33,910
Would you?

1415
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,833
Would you throw it in the ocean?

1416
01:28:39,433 --> 01:28:40,641
Would you want me to?

1417
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:47,128
No.

1418
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:50,497
No, I think...

1419
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,528
I think everything’s changed.

1420
01:28:56,938 --> 01:29:00,569
And I’m…
I’m just finding it a big hard to adjust.

1421
01:29:00,617 --> 01:29:01,596
I know.

1422
01:29:02,139 --> 01:29:05,128
It makes sense. But we’re just gonna
have to find a way to...

1423
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:08,276
get through this.
Get through this together.

1424
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,461
When did you realize that?

1425
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,698
When you sang to me on my voicemail.

1426
01:29:14,217 --> 01:29:16,720
And I realized that nobody on Earth
in their right mind...

1427
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,941
would ever do anything remotely like that.

1428
01:29:20,003 --> 01:29:22,920
And that killed me. That crushed me.

1429
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,641
You completely won me over.

1430
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,024
You know I wasn’t actually trying
to win you over.

1431
01:29:28,117 --> 01:29:29,961
I was trying to tell you to “fuck off.”

1432
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:31,162
And I had.

1433
01:29:32,643 --> 01:29:35,633
And now, you’ve come back and…

1434
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:38,745
And you’ve opened the whole thing up again.

1435
01:29:38,904 --> 01:29:41,841
And I think actually,
I think I’m gonna have to go.

1436
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:42,941
Take that.

1437
01:29:43,036 --> 01:29:45,068
I’m gonna go cause it’s all a bit much.

1438
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:46,422
I hear you.

1439
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:51,118
Take your time. I’m not going anywhere.

1440
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:52,695
What? Are you gonna stay on the bench?

1441
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,744
Yes. I’m gonna stay...
 I’m gonna live on this bench.

1442
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,953
Come to The Gramercy. On Saturday. Please.

1443
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:03,219
Just hear the song.

1444
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,735
I want you to see
how everyone’s just falling in love...

1445
01:30:06,816 --> 01:30:07,982
with what you created...

1446
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:15,139
Please don’t play it like that.

1447
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:17,874
Okay.

1448
01:30:29,058 --> 01:30:32,933
Well, look at you. A vision of pure class.
There’s my daughter.

1449
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,589
No way.

1450
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,128
Is this it?

1451
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,839
There you are.

1452
01:30:39,984 --> 01:30:40,942
Yeah.

1453
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:42,102
You look great.

1454
01:30:42,128 --> 01:30:43,255
Look how cool you are.

1455
01:30:43,378 --> 01:30:45,325
Can I keep this? Show all my friends?

1456
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:46,971
That’s what it’s for, babe.

1457
01:30:47,035 --> 01:30:48,035
Look at you.

1458
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,118
Hilarious.

1459
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:50,297
Why is that hilarious?

1460
01:30:50,457 --> 01:30:53,845
I just had no idea you were that talented.
I just didn’t know.

1461
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:58,480
You’re a real guitar player.
You got some talent. Seriously.

1462
01:30:58,904 --> 01:31:00,936
What? Do you want me to start a band now?

1463
01:31:01,196 --> 01:31:02,384
Yeah! Let’s start a band.

1464
01:31:03,097 --> 01:31:04,138
Let’s start a band.

1465
01:31:04,211 --> 01:31:06,711
Why not? I’ll record you. I’ll produce you.

1466
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:08,282
I like this idea.

1467
01:31:09,014 --> 01:31:09,630
Do you?

1468
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:10,339
Yeah.

1469
01:31:10,488 --> 01:31:12,623
You all motivated now?

1470
01:31:13,149 --> 01:31:16,045
It’s a family business.
It’s like the Jackson Five.

1471
01:31:16,107 --> 01:31:17,045
There you go.

1472
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:18,982
The Mulligan Three.

1473
01:31:19,657 --> 01:31:20,605
You coming in?

1474
01:31:20,669 --> 01:31:23,802
No. I’m going to go play that for Saul
and see if we can get a deal.

1475
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,005
Good luck. Let me know how it goes.

1476
01:31:28,433 --> 01:31:29,485
I love you.

1477
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:32,910
I know you do.

1478
01:31:40,404 --> 01:31:43,404
Come on. Yeah… So pretty.

1479
01:31:46,498 --> 01:31:47,498
Bye!

1480
01:31:57,628 --> 01:31:58,805
Thanks for coming in guys.

1481
01:32:00,118 --> 01:32:02,128
This is fantastic.
You’ve got a great record.

1482
01:32:03,128 --> 01:32:06,087
I missed it on the first listen.
But I don’t want to miss it again.

1483
01:32:06,128 --> 01:32:08,087
We’re very glad that you like it.

1484
01:32:08,878 --> 01:32:12,174
Well, I reached out
to some of my studio connects in LA

1485
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:16,198
and I was thinking we could get
the first track placed in a film.

1486
01:32:16,278 --> 01:32:18,684
Write a film.
There’s also pilot season right now.

1487
01:32:18,755 --> 01:32:20,807
Yeah man, we’re not interested in
any of that stuff.

1488
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:22,785
Okay, so then…

1489
01:32:23,682 --> 01:32:25,641
What are you interested in?
What are we doing here?

1490
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:27,763
Well, I think Dan needs his job back.

1491
01:32:28,646 --> 01:32:31,739
Yeah, sure. What? Take my office.
I don’t care.

1492
01:32:33,021 --> 01:32:36,980
Okay. I guess I want to know,
how does this work?

1493
01:32:37,107 --> 01:32:39,966
We put the album out. We sell it for…?

1494
01:32:39,998 --> 01:32:42,998
Let’s say an album
costs ten dollars a unit.

1495
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:45,661
The artist gets a dollar.

1496
01:32:46,496 --> 01:32:49,019
It’s the same in publishing.
It’s a buck for a book.

1497
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:51,147
Oh, I’m just thinking
for this specifically.

1498
01:32:51,673 --> 01:32:52,980
I have to get my head around it.

1499
01:32:53,021 --> 01:32:56,927
The album doesn’t have
any overhead because we did it.

1500
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,040
And then, distribution…

1501
01:32:59,112 --> 01:33:01,807
It’s not gonna go in stores.
It’s gonna go online.

1502
01:33:01,854 --> 01:33:03,927
And publicity would be…
What? Word of mouth?

1503
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:06,178
So, I think what I’m wondering is...

1504
01:33:06,728 --> 01:33:08,894
why do you get nine out of ten
of my dollars?

1505
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:11,943
Gretta, you’re a very smart young woman.

1506
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,201
And you’re a determined artist.

1507
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:17,339
You have a wonderful project here.

1508
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:21,300
And with the right team behind you
to push you and guide you...

1509
01:33:21,465 --> 01:33:24,496
Maybe hire a hot-shot producer
to remix a couple tracks.

1510
01:33:24,538 --> 01:33:28,371
You could have a hit record
and a very long career.

1511
01:33:28,413 --> 01:33:31,548
But you know, ultimately that’s up to you.

1512
01:33:32,236 --> 01:33:34,545
Ah, you had them. You wound him up.

1513
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:35,590
I know.

1514
01:33:35,647 --> 01:33:37,850
It’s amazing
when you’re not actually that interested...

1515
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:39,154
you always win the hand.

1516
01:33:39,206 --> 01:33:42,196
Yeah. That’s never really worked out
that well for me.

1517
01:33:42,975 --> 01:33:45,017
I found it worked very well.

1518
01:33:45,434 --> 01:33:48,668
You’re gonna get a deal.
That asshole is gonna give you a deal.

1519
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,941
You might have to compromise a little bit.

1520
01:33:51,054 --> 01:33:51,970
Never.

1521
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:52,928
Of course.

1522
01:33:53,396 --> 01:33:55,467
Hey, we should do a bunch of these.

1523
01:33:55,507 --> 01:33:56,423
What do you mean?

1524
01:33:56,486 --> 01:33:59,382
Do you like the European Series?

1525
01:33:59,503 --> 01:34:00,311
I like that.

1526
01:34:00,376 --> 01:34:02,376
The Paris Tapes. The Prague Sessions.

1527
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:03,843
The Berlin Recordings.

1528
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:06,033
We could go all over Europe by rail.

1529
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:08,337
We could take the whole gang?

1530
01:34:08,496 --> 01:34:10,128
Rachel, Malcolm, Steve.

1531
01:34:13,465 --> 01:34:14,382
So…

1532
01:34:14,423 --> 01:34:15,340
So…

1533
01:34:17,882 --> 01:34:20,830
Oh look. I guess I’ll see you in awhile.

1534
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:23,150
Thank you.

1535
01:35:24,507 --> 01:35:29,517
Come to the show. Your name is on the list.
Please. Dave.

1536
01:35:34,496 --> 01:35:37,392
An Evening with Dave Kohl

1537
01:36:03,923 --> 01:36:05,027
Thank you so much.

1538
01:36:09,092 --> 01:36:10,123
Thank you.

1539
01:36:11,077 --> 01:36:12,119
Guitar change.

1540
01:36:12,874 --> 01:36:18,728
This next song was actually given to me
by an amazing songwriter...

1541
01:36:18,808 --> 01:36:20,475
and an even more amazing woman.

1542
01:36:22,015 --> 01:36:23,577
So it’s a very special song.

1543
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:25,484
We’re gonna do her arrangement of it.

1544
01:36:25,759 --> 01:36:27,832
So If she’s here… I’m not sure that she is.

1545
01:36:28,094 --> 01:36:30,548
I’d love for her to come up
and join us on this one.

1546
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,191
There’s a guitar right there, so…

1547
01:36:33,358 --> 01:36:35,400
If you’re here, please join us.

1548
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,537
It’s a really special song to me.

1549
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:39,968

Hey.

1605
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,762
Where are you going?

1606
01:41:29,267 --> 01:41:30,298
Home.

1607
01:41:32,251 --> 01:41:33,251
What’s on your mind?

1608
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:38,047
I don’t want your label
to release my album.

1609
01:41:39,577 --> 01:41:40,514
Fine.

1610
01:41:40,674 --> 01:41:41,674
Fine? Really?

1611
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:44,298
No, because I thought that
you’d be really upset.

1612
01:41:44,457 --> 01:41:45,721
No, it’s your album.

1613
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:48,460
So, what do you want to do with it then?

1614
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:49,958
There it is.

1615
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:53,135
That’s the whole album for a dollar.
A buck for a book.

1616
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:56,414
The whole thing. Now, once
this goes out, that’s it. They’re gone.

1617
01:41:57,906 --> 01:41:58,656
Yeah.

1618
01:41:58,770 --> 01:41:59,773
Are you sure you want to do this?

1619
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:00,395
Yeah.

1620
01:42:00,457 --> 01:42:01,455
How about two bucks?

1621
01:42:01,802 --> 01:42:03,833
Such a capitalist. No, a buck is fair.

1622
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,947
And then we’ll split it evenly
between everyone…

1623
01:42:05,989 --> 01:42:08,106
Malcolm and Rachel – everyone! Come on!

1624
01:42:09,906 --> 01:42:11,232
Once I press this, that’s it.

1625
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,207
I’m going to war with my whole business.

1626
01:42:23,802 --> 01:42:25,170
Gretta James – The Great Outdoors

1627
01:42:25,237 --> 01:42:26,770
That’s so exciting.

1628
01:42:26,822 --> 01:42:27,791
What are you doing?

1629
01:42:27,833 --> 01:42:28,916
Calling reinforcements.

1630
01:42:32,885 --> 01:42:33,833
Check it out.

1631
01:42:33,927 --> 01:42:35,916
I got Troublegum to tweet out the album.

1632
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:37,700
How many followers does he have?

1633
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,750
Apparently the entire world.

1634
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,354
Just about every living human being.

1635
01:42:44,906 --> 01:42:45,947
Mr. Mulligan.

1636
01:42:46,885 --> 01:42:47,843
Good morning.

1637
01:42:47,885 --> 01:42:48,802
Good morning.

1638
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:51,750
News for you on the inter webs.

1639
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,816
Shit!

1640
01:42:53,832 --> 01:42:54,869
You didn’t know nothing about this?

1641
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:55,832
- No.
- No?

1642
01:42:55,854 --> 01:42:56,933
How many did she sell?

1643
01:42:56,989 --> 01:42:58,906
Ten thousand. Today.

1644
01:42:59,179 --> 01:43:00,324
Troublegum tweeted about it.

1645
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:03,551
If Troublegum helped her out,
it’s because he liked her.

1646
01:43:03,781 --> 01:43:05,812
They’re artists.

1647
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:07,702
You didn’t know nothing about this?

1648
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:08,709
Nothing.

1649
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,750
Kind of funny though.

1650
01:43:09,864 --> 01:43:10,833
Is it really?

1651
01:43:10,902 --> 01:43:12,756
It’s pretty funny, man.

1652
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,410
Boo-boo, you know how to pick them.

1653
01:43:14,467 --> 01:43:15,738
It’s kind of good.

1654
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:17,199
Sure is. Kind of uppity

1655
01:43:17,236 --> 01:43:19,007
Clean out your locker.

1656
01:43:19,263 --> 01:43:20,263
See you later.
