You're giving me a heart attack.

32

my hair, it's gonna get messed up.

a car like that?

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,810

After all when a man gets promoted.

44
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,903

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,150

like that all the boys

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,370
will think we're rich.

54
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,323
- Boys, boys, you're too
young to worry about boys.

55
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,990
- Congratulations, Papi.

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,890

57
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,483
Wipe off that lipstick.

yesterday she was one of us,
today she looks like my mother?

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,500
- She's beautiful.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,020
She's a real woman now.

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,530
She's had her quince.

66
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,170
- Well, that's the way it goes,

67
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,290
at 14 you're still a baby,

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,300
then you turn 15 you have a
quince and everything's changed.

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,600
in a few months you'll be
dancing just like that.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,027
- Only if her father says yes.

72
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,380
Has he agreed your quince yet?

73
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,390
- He will, we just
haven't picked a date yet.

- To Gabriel on her 15th birthday.

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,740
This is a day that a father
can be proud of his daughter,

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,020
and this is a day that his
daughter can be proud of herself.

80
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,893
To Gabby!

81
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,298

he kicks to Morales

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,030

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,757
Samuel, did you see the soccer game?

90
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:34,590
- No.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,063
- Oh, I see you were watching the Angels.

92
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,268
- The Dodgers, they got Valenzuela.

93
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:42,018
(group laughing)

94
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,050
- You guys have to help
me pick out a dress, okay?

95
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,560
- Okay.
- Even if your dad agrees

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,970
to the quince, who's gonna be your escort?

97
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,020
- I'll find somebody.

98
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:03,694
Who is that?

99
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,680
- That's trouble.

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,610
He's Gabby's cousin Ramon.

101
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,960
- Oh, he is so cute.

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,420
- He just moved her from New York.

103
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,000
He's staying with cousins.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,423
I hear he's pretty wild.

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,870
- Marta, (speaks in foreign language).

106
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,267
- Hi, Octavio.

00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,420
(Octavio speaks in foreign language)

108
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,270
Sure, I'll dance.

109
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:51,967
- Excuse me.

110
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,080
You wanna do me a favor?

111
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,580
- Si.
- You wanna hold on to that.

112
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,967
As a matter of fact go
ahead and eat it all right,

113
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,110
'cause all it needs is a pair of teeth.

114
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,186
- Oh, gracias.

115
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,053
- Octavio.

116
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,623
That wasn't very nice.

117
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:05,153
- Hey, a man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do, right?

118
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,088
- Can a father dance with his little girl?

119
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,980
- Papi, all the other girls
get to dance with boys.

120
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,027
- Other girls don't have fathers

121
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:39,027
who merengue like Valentino mija.

122
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,337
(group chattering)

123
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,313
Whoa.

124
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,563
- Jorge, Jorge!

125
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:24,668
Check it out.
- Hola, muchachos.

126
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,880
- Hit me, hit me, I'm
going out for a pass.

127
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,400
- I cannot understand why
he can't plant his roses

128
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
in his own yard.

129
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,690
- Because he doesn't have a yard.

130
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,859
(Inez laughs)

131
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,360
Boys, (speaks in foreign
language) come on.

132
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,193
Leave Jorge alone.

133
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:42,026
Now go inside and change,

134
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,252
and you can act like (speaks
in foreign language).

135
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,970
- Jorge, you should of seen
my friend's Gabby's dress,

136
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,000
it was dripping with lace,

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,770
and she had this two-tone nail polish,

138
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,890
and these really, really high heels.

139
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,528
- Jorge, here, we brought you some cake.

140
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,361
- Gracias.

141
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:58,340
In El Salvador la quinceanera
is for the the rich

142
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,970
no (speaks in foreign language).

143
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,340
- Don't worry, Jorge.

144
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,230
You can come to my quince.

145
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,670
- Yeah, if she has one.

146
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,640
- But everybody has one.

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,070
- Everybody has a mass, the party's extra.

148
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,623
- But the party's everything.

149
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,147
- Well, maybe if she behaves herself, huh.

150
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,847
- And her father wins the lottery.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,160
- Senor, do you know if you have work

152
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,080
for me at your factory?

153
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,260
- Que pasa?

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,600
I thought things we're going well.

155
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,480
- I've been in this country one year

156
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,710
and now they ask if I have
paper to show I belong.

157
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,600
So I no have job.

158
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,970
(somber music)

159
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,010
- I'm making up some taquitos

160
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,077
for supper tonight, I'll send some.

161
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:45,517
- No, no, no senora, (speaks
in foreign language).

162
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:46,417
- What's going on?

163
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,484
Immigration up to their old tricks again.

164
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,510
(Jorge speaks in foreign language)

165
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,750
- They not let you rest.

166
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,080
- Don't worry, Jorge, a man like you

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,005
should have no problem finding work.

168
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,953
(speaks in foreign language) Lighten up.

169
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,540
- I'm so glad to see everybody listens.

170
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,373
Whose turn was it to do the dishes, huh?

171
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:08,435
- Ask Marta.

172
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,007
- Yeah, ask Marta.

173
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,840
- I have to iron my dress.

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,673
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,750
And you left it on.

176
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,370
Marta, this is not responsible.

177
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,760
Now come on, you wanna be a grownup, huh?

178
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,410
You better start acting like one.

179
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:30,480
- Ah, these newcomers
with all their problems.

180
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,670
Either they can't hold a job

181
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,880
or they got immigration
yanking them from their houses.

182
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,150
- Samuel, por favor.

183
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,430
- Kids from school disappear all the time.

184
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,420
Once this kid borrowed my biology notes,

185
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,840
I never got 'em back.

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,260
- Be very glad we don't
have their problems.

187
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,800
This family is American citizens.

188
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,090
We put in our time, earned respect.

189
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,230
That's the America dream.

190
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,330
- With hard work.

191
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,760
- [Both] Anything is possible.

192
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,930
- That's right.

193
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,500
- Most be American side
of you talking, Samuel.

194
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,340
- And what's wrong with that?

195
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,760
- Papi, about my party.

196
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,613
- Ah, now she wants to talk
about the Mexican side.

197
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Eddie, ask your mother if
she thinks we Delacruz's

198
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,870
are to Americana to put

199
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,421
on a splashy party like the Coreas.

200
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:21,554
- Papi.

201
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:25,320
- Get all dressed up,
invite a few hundred people,

202
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,080
everyone watching as the proud parents

203
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,110
glide around the room.

204
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,943
- Papi.

205
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:32,940
- What are you waiting for?

206
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,647
You got a party to plan.

207
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:35,480
- Yeah!

208
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,850
- Ah, you're gonna make
a beautiful quinceanera.

209
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,108
- Who's gonna be your escort, Marta?

210
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,350
- You'll go with your cousin Octavio.

211
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,400
- What, he can't even dance.

212
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,330
- Marta, he's just at an age
where he's a little clumsy.

213
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,750
- He's a wart.

214
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,310
Everybody's gonna laugh at me.

215
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,220
He can hardly speak English.

216
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,410
- Hey, since when are you
ashamed of your language?

217
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,800
You will go with Octavio or not at all.

218
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,740
- Great, the party hasn't even started

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,053
and it's already ruined.

220
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,310
(door bangs)

221
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,886
- If she doesn't want her
party, can I get a skateboard?

222
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:10,990
(both laughing)

223
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,990
(metal banging)

224
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,823
- Yeah.
- Go.

225
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,040
- Portall is sick with himself.

226
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,820
His bid was over by 15%.

227
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,456
Disalvo can't believe our operations.

228
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,903
I gotta hand it to ya,
Montoya, you put it over.

229
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,663
Welcome to the executive suite.

230
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,747
What do you think?

231
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,580
- Not bad.

232
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,453
- Arturo, you're an asset to the company.

233
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,350
- Thank you, sir.

234
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,390
- Maybe now I can finally
get to meet the family, huh?

235
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,690
- Of course, Mr. Waterman.

236
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,300
It would be our honor.

237
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,870
- Well, the first thing
we need is to figure out

238
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,870
how to pull off that miracle we promised.

239
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,910
- Don't worry about that,
sir, miracles are easy,

240
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,760
the hard part is getting them shipped.

241
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,660
- Don't remind me.

242
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,413
(door bangs)

243
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,996
(gentle music)

244
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,417
(dramatic music)

245
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,668
- Congratulations, Mr. operations manager.

246
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,113
- (laughs) Gracias, Oscar.

247
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,180
We deserve this job too, you know.

248
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,940
- Not all American enough,
(speaks in foreign language).

249
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,790
- Look at 'em, a few months ago

250
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,920
they were staging raids
(speaks in foreign language),

251
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,713
now they're in the education business.

252
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,160
- Since the new amnesty law immigration's

253
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,360
coming down hard on
bosses who hire illegals.

254
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,343
Everyone's nervous and
everyone's checking papers.

255
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,420
- Would you hold still?

256
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,326
How do expect your (speaks
in foreign language)

257
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,300
to do all this with you

258
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,200
squirming around like a little monkey?

259
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,390
- [Marta] Look at this one,

260
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,100
it has shiny beads all around the top.

261
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,750
- Yeah, each one like a
diamond, and twice as expensive.

262
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,760
- Oh, Marta, maybe we should

263
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,460
pick something a little more simple, huh?

264
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,600
- No, you should see what
the girls are wearing now,

265
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
it's not like in our day.

266
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,150
- I didn't have a day.

267
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,300
In (speaks in foreign
language) by the time

268
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,400
I looked up from the pigs,

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,600
and the chickens, and the washing,

270
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,609
your momma's day came and went (whooshes).

271
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,070
(Inez speaks in foreign language)

272
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,170
My daughter's gonna have something better.

273
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:38,190
- (speaks in foreign
language) made me such a gown.

274
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,560
And I wore high heels for the first time.

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,666
I'm almost walked off
the inside of my skirt.

276
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,544
(group laughing)

277
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,833
Yeah, but I looked good.

278
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,170
- Did Momma tell you I
have to go with Octavio?

279
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,800
- You should of seen the
cousin I had to go with.

280
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,265
Next to him Octavio looks
like Julio Iglesias.

281
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:57,250
(group laughing)

282
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,400
But cousins are safe, you know,

283
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,963
it's like they're spies for the father.

284
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,130
- Mama.

285
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,340
- Mija, after you turn 15

286
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,380
you can make some of your own decisions.

287
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,593
- Yeah, but until then it's Octavio.

288
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:11,745
Ooh.

289
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,393
- The quinceanera party
is only a celebration.

290
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,560
Your true passage into
womanhood must be earned.

291
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,920
Now how do you earn that passage?

292
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,300
Through service to others.

293
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,270
And you are all very fortunate

294
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,870
because that opportunity exists right now.

295
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,426
This is special time, historic time,

296
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,276
(speaks in foreign language) amnesty.

297
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,070
As our religion says-
- Tonight.

298
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,163
- Forgiveness.

299
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,370
Our church has set up an office

300
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,770
to help people to fill
out amnesty applications.

301
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,253
We need volunteers.

302
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,963
Girls.

303
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,890
Marta, will you be of service?

304
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,713
Will you be part of this forgiveness?

305
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,142
(group chattering)

306
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,132
(phone ringing)

307
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,507
- Hundreds of thousands of immigrants

308
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,290
live in this country illegally.

309
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,620
The amnesty program started last year.

310
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,370
It's their chance to come forward

311
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,140
and be pardoned without punishment

312
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,940
for having lived outside
the law until now.

313
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,050
In time those who's qualify
will become residents

314
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,800
and eventually United States citizens.

315
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,150
For the hours that you are here,

316
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,650
you are be trusted with people's lives.

317
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,320
Misplace an application form

318
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,060
or forget to attach a money order

319
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,570
and that person is as good as gone.

320
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,980
Now application form here, medical exam,

321
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,880
receipts, and verification.

322
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,270
Photo here.

323
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,160
We have exactly four weeks left, 28 days.

324
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,620
Every hour counts.

325
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,847
Any questions?

326
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,193
(phone ringing)

327
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,610
Marta, the phone.

328
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,363
- Hello.

329
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,770
- They let children handle these matters.

330
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,140
- Papi, we're not children.

331
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,280
And besides these people need our help.

332
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
- Yeah, but some of these people

333
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,360
have been waiting a long time

334
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,033
for a chance like this, too long.

335
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,240
You remember how it was,

336
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,890
if you didn't like it
here you could go back.

337
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,940
- Are you through?

338
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,853
- It's not a simple decision either.

339
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:23,140
In Mexico things are easier.

340
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,240
The life is not so fast.

341
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,567
- Oh, Samuel, you just
remember it that way.

342
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:31,360
- No, the air is warm,
the people are warm,

343
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,000
the sky is blue, the earth is rich.

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,750
Now in America a man can always improve,

345
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,100
yes, he can move up,

346
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,977
but in Mexico a man can take time

347
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:46,670
for his friends, for his family.

348
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,540
- Papi, please can I be excused

349
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,290
I have to meet my
girlfriends at the carnival.

350
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,340
- Aren't you gonna help your mother?

351
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,283
- Mommy, please.

352
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,183
- Go.

353
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,435
- Papi, me too, I have
some homework to do.

354
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,660
- Homework, you're only
in the first grade.

355
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,693
- Well, sorta like coloring.

356
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,012
(Inez laughing)

357
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:13,912
- Get out of here.

358
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,714
Guess it's just you and me, buddy.

359
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:21,633
- Yeah.

360
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,423
Pop, tell me about the horses in Mexico.

361
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,440
- I don't remember about any horses.

362
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,740
- Yeah, you know the
one that threw you off.

363
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,693
- Me?
- Yeah.

364
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,023
- Never.

365
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,360
That (speaks in foreign
language) was six feet tall.

366
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,983
I could see in her eyes
she would not be broken.

367
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,810
I rode her for three and half hours, mijo.

368
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,350
We fell in love.

369
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,550
(lively music)

370
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,467
(group chattering)

371
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,810
- I couldn't believe it.

372
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,250
I walked in and he was kissing her,

373
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,380
I mean really kissing her.

374
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,820
Their lips were together like Krazy Glue.

375
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,090
You wonder how they could even breathe.

376
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,060
- They can't, when people
kiss they can suffocate.

377
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,310
- Then what happened?

378
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,230
- The commercial came on

379
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,604
and I had to help my mom fix dinner.

380
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:18,437
(group groaning)

381
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:19,270
- Jackie.

382
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,020
- Well, I won't be home to watch tomorrow

383
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,673
'cause I'm going on a
date with Billy Burton.

384
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,760
- A real date, aren't you scared?

385
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,963
- Scared of what?

386
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,456
He's already kissed me.

387
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:33,123
(group gasping)

388
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:36,630
Hey, you're getting
your (indistinct) juice

389
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,890
all over my shoe!

390
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,530
- Gabby, wait, don't move,

391
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,389
you have a big black
bug right in your eye.

392
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,222
- A bug?

393
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,652
That's not a bug, that's mascara.

394
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:49,818
(group laughing)

395
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:51,318
- [Lupe] Cover up.

396
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:08,289
- Look, there's that
gorgeous cousin of Gabby's.

397
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:09,830
Is he gonna stay around?

398
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,470
- Oh, he just sort of popped up.

399
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,440
No plans, no suitcase, and no manner.

400
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,750
- Aren't ya gonna introduce us?

401
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,713
It's only polite.

402
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:38,020
(Announcer speaking in foreign language)

403
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,873
- Ramon.

404
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:42,336
(Announcer speaking in foreign language)

405
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,420
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

406
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,300
These are my very good friends
Jackie, Lupe, and Marta.

407
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:52,060
- What's up?

408
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,400
- You remember Marta, you danced
with her at Gabby's quince.

409
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,450
- Yes, I remember her.

410
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,977
- Well, aren't ya gonna
ask her to dance now?

411
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,105
- Did you bring your
father with you this time?

412
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,105
- No.

413
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:08,856
(singing in foreign language)

414
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:11,606
(Gabby cheering)

415
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,430
- Where'd you learn how to dance?

416
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,280
- On the top of my
father's shoes, and you?

417
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
- Hey, everybody's good at somethin'.

418
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,393
This is what I know how to do.

419
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,730
- So I hear you're from New York?

420
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,563
- PR.

421
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:32,250
- What?
- Puerto Rico.

422
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,080
- And now you live here
with your aunt or something.

423
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,310
- Hey look, let me tell you somethin',

424
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,520
I've been taking care of myself
since I was 14, all right.

425
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,703
- 14, that's my age.

426
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:47,190
- Who's Richard Stands?

427
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,078
- Who?

428
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:49,495
- Richard Stands.

429
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,900
- One of your little friends at school.

430
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,190
- No, in the morning when we
say the Pledge of Allegiance,

431
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,653
you say and to the republic
for Richard Stands.

432
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,850
- Richards Stands.

433
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,573
He must be one of the-

434
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:08,877
- There's no Richards Stands, stupid.

435
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:12,300
It's to the republic for which it stands.

436
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,920
- Hey, that's an easy mistake.

437
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,480
And don't call your brother stupid.

438
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,073
- Hey, Pop, wanna help me
with my stamp collection?

439
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,798
- I'm gonna go for walk.

440
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,805
(lively music)

441
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,638
(singing in foreign language)

442
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:51,690
- Come on, Marta, we gotta
go, it's almost 10 o'clock.

443
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,278
I'm gonna be in big trouble.

444
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:54,633
- What?

445
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,383
- We've gotta go now!

446
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:00,413
- Come on, come on, wait,
stay for this dance, huh.

447
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,415
- No, I can't be late.

448
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,340
- I'll tell you what,

449
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,773
if you stay I'll take you
home in my car, all right.

450
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:14,439
All right, all right, all of you.

451
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,606
- It's a deal.

452
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,613
(playful music)

453
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:34,230
- Are we all gonna fit in your car?

454
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,270
- Well, if you don't,

455
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,755
what we gotta do is just
all squeeze in together.

456
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,901
(group laughing)

457
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,413
- Marta, isn't that your dad?

458
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,890
- Papi, what are you doing?

459
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,190
- I was out for a walk, it's getting late,

460
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,540
I thought it'd be a good
idea to walk you home.

461
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,660
- See you guys tomorrow.

462
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,843
- Goodnight, Mr. Delacruz.

463
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,033
- Bye, Mr. Delacruz.

464
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,633
- Goodnight, girls.

465
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:12,013
What were you girls doing with that boy?

466
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,333
- He's just Gabby's cousin.

467
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,511
- How old is he anyway?

468
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,580
I think he's too old mija.

469
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,400
Think you're too young.

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,850
- [Marta] I'm not too young, Papi.

471
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,940
Other girls my age are already dating.

472
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,013
- [Samuel] That's enough.

473
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:36,594
(singing in foreign language)
(upbeat music)

474
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,419
Cherry, cherry.

475
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:42,669
- Yeah, cherry.

476
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,283
- Papi, (speaks in
foreign language) Jorge.

477
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,426
Jorge, Jorge.

478
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:50,695

(Jorge speaks in foreign language)

482
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:55,930
- Que pasa?

483
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,880
- I look for work, but
they ask me for paper,

484
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,290
so I buy false card, it's no good.

485
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,190
The boss, he no take it.

486
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,970
- Papi.
- I'm sorry, Jorge.

487
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,340
I wish I could help, but
it's the same at the factory.

488
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,290
All you can do is keep trying.

489
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,503
- I just want to work and earn my way.

490
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
- It's what we all want.

491
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,656
- Hey, baseball, huh, Dodgers.

492
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:20,489
- Yeah.

493
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,320
Hey, Ricardo, this is dripping.

494
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,570
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

495
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,810
- You do it best, Marta.

496
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,010
- But we all work with these people now.

497
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,110
- Oh, Mrs. Zavala said, "Their
days are numbered anyway."

498
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,360
- Come on, Marta, just do it.

499
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,193
- All right.

500
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,280
- Go, just do it.

501
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,616

(man speaking in foreign language)

504
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,700
- How about another
one for my friend, huh?

505
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,463
- Gracias.
- Here you go.

(dramatic music)

508
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,147
Come on mijo, let's go.

509
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:10,897
(girls laughing)

510
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,890
Come on, it was different in
our day, we went unnoticed.

511
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,570
The days (speaks in foreign language)

512
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,660
are brazen like roosters.

513
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,493
They're asking for trouble.

514
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:31,130
- Samuel, you are so hard.

515
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,627
- [Samuel] Am I wrong, Inez?

516
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:33,740
(speaks in foreign
language) On the Boulevard

517
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,090
on a nice Saturday afternoon.

518
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,870
Now tell me that isn't
because of the roosters.

519
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,223
- We saw them at Chan's.

520
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,680
- Ricky, do me a favor,
take this food to Jorge.

521
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,513
- I'll take it.

522
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,020
(door bell buzzes)

523
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,410
- Hello, is your mother home?

524
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,243
- Mama.

525
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,580
- Oh, I meant your
mother, not your sister.

526
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,510
Which one of you is having the
(speaks in foreign language)?

527
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,490
- My daughter is.

528
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,460
- Your daughter, who would guess.

529
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,290
If you please, I am Mr. Jose, Mr. Fiesta,

530
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,830
Mr. don't you worry about a
thing, I will take care of it.

531
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,943
May I come in?

532
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,440
Oh, oh, this must be the family.

533
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,423
Senor, you have beautiful children.

534
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:29,083
Especially this one.

535
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,730
Please, join me in the living room

536
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,299
for the thrill of a lifetime.

537
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,966
(playful music)

538
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:43,374
And wa-lah.

539
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:47,110
You look like very hardworking people

540
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,620
and I know that you want the
very best for your daughter,

541
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,550
but there so many
details, who has the time?

542
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,051
The caterers, they are always
taking the leftovers home.

543
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,070
(Inez laughs)

544
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,160
And the musicians, they
book three parties a day

545
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,671
and you worry if they will even show up.

546
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:09,410
But with Mr. Jose, it all comes together

547
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,470
like a pig's place in heaven.

548
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,940
(both laughing)

549
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,660
Wait, do I hear the angels singing?

550
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,853
A visual aid.

551
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:22,460
(groups gasps)

552
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,460
I can see it now, mysterious
smoke fills the room.

553
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,153
And then there is,

554
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,890
Marta, a beautiful princess

555
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,080
surrounded by magnificent bouquets.

556
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,740
All eyes are upon her.

557
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Then there is the toast,
her name in the lights.

558
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,436
And all of this to the music
of a 10 piece band. (chuckles)

559
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:00,760
Don't worry I can get it cheap.

560
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,270
- How much are the lights?

561
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,173
- Samuel, really.

562
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,810
- This is a man of taste.

563
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,040
For you and your beautiful daughter

564
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,995
we will work something out.

565
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,250
This is going to be a
(speaks in foreign language).

566
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,953
This is going to be fabulous.

567
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:21,030
This is going to be great.

568
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,210
Wait, let us capture
this moment forever, huh.

569
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,826
Move in, move in, very tight.

570
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,397
(Jose speaks in foreign language)

571
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:31,233
That will be two bucks.

572
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:34,065
(quirky music)

573
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,330
(Gloria speaking in foreign language)

574
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,912
- One, two, three, one two, three.

575
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:43,912
One, two, three, (speaks
in foreign language).

576
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:48,753
(Gloria speaking in foreign language)

577
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,024
One, two, three, and one, two, three.

578
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,420
One, two, three, one, two, three.

579
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,037
One two, three, one two three.

580
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,574
One, two, three, one, two, three.

581
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,380
One, two, three, (speaking
in foreign language).

582
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:04,823
- Ow, ow!

583
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,903
(Gloria speaking in foreign language)

584
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:10,173
- Octavio, it's a waltz, not a massacre.

585
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,823
(Gloria speaking in foreign language)

586
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:16,339
One, two, three, one, two, three.

587
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,510
One, two, three, (speaking
in foreign language).

588
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,510
- I'm sure my toe is broken.

589
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,240
- Well, at least he
didn't spit in your face.

590
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,203
- That's not funny.

591
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:33,393
- Marta, I think we need to say hello.

592
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,010
Hi, there.

593
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,033
Great car.

594
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,780
- How ya doing?

595
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,339
- What's wrong with it?

596
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:53,837
- Some engine problems.

597
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:56,323
You know these guys keep
you waiting around forever.

598
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:58,920
What happened to your foot?

599
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,010
- My cousin Octavio stomped on me.

600
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,330
- He's gonna be her escort for quince.

601
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,260
- What?

602
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,980
- Her escort.

603
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,323
You know, the one that dances a lot.

604
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:16,777
- This cousin of yours,
does he, does he dance good?

605
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:18,240
Can the guy move or what?

606
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,683
- Can a pig samba?

607
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,120
- Well, I know this guy
who's real handsome,

608
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,440
a little bit older, drives a
real neat car, dresses sharp,

609
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,400
and will make you look good.

610
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,090
Except he doesn't like
hanging out with kids.

611
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,080
- We're not kids.

612
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
- Maybe he's just a little kid himself

613
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,923
who thinks he's a grownup.

614
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,740
- Maybe you're just afraid to find out.

615
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,480
- Uh, Marta, I think we need to go now.

616
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,520
- So it's settled, I'll do it.

617
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,410
- Oh, no, no, you see my family

618
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,140
they don't even know you or anything.

619
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,920
- So get to know me.

620
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,940
I mean it is your party, isn't it?

621
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,970
- I don't think it's a good idea, thanks.

622
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,900
Ouch.

623
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,143
- Ay, Marta, you're really in pain.

624
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,160
Well, what are you waiting for?

625
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,100
You have to give us a ride home.

626
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,224
- No, I don't think I
can do that right now,

627
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,270
because I have a business meeting

628
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,910
that I completely forgot
about and I'm late, all right.

629
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,410
- She hurt her foot, you
can't let her walk on it.

630
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,957
Ramon.

631
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,763
- All right, hurry up, get in, okay.

632
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,541
Okay, hold that.

633
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,265
Yo, Louie, I'll be back
in a few minutes, okay.

634
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,270
I'm gonna take her for a test ride.

635
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,803
- Louie, who's Louie?

636
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,583
- It's my boss.

637
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,973
I work here.

638
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,208
(gentle music)

639
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,640
- He's her cousin, how bad can he be?

640
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,860
- Bad, my father's already
told me not to go near him.

641
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,750
- Well, maybe he'll change his mind.

642
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,733
Can't hurt to try.

643
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,750
- Are you sure you know how to do this?

644
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,783
- Don't worry, I've seen my
sister do it a million times.

645
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,974
(playful dramatic music)

646
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:23,974
(light salsa music)

647
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:36,539
(car engine revving)

648
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:41,227
(car engine revving)

649
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:46,508
(car engine revving)

650
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:12,928
- Eight inches to your
hips, 20 to your knee.

651
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,970
Okay, roll up your pant
leg so I can measure.

652
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,650
- Um, do I have to?

653
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,840
Can you just guess?

654
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,033
- Mija, I have to see where the hem falls.

655
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,340
Marta Alecia Delacruz.

656
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,540
Those beautiful little legs.

657
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,750
Now which one of those crazy
friends taught you this, huh?

658
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,170
- [Both] Jackie.

659
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,720
- You try to act like a grownup,

660
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,380
you still think like a child.

661
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,490
This does not make you a woman.

662
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,160
Marta, look you'll
become a grownup the day

663
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,875
you start thinking about
someone other than yourself.

664
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:49,125
(light dramatic music)

665
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,200
- Are you ready?

666
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,053
- Yeah, sure.

667
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,987
- You've been working
with us for two years now,

668
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,189
and you are clearly one
of our best workers.

669
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,689
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

670
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:08,086
- Gracias.

671
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,950
- But with this amnesty thing

672
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,723
the INS is getting all over me.

673
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:20,010
We know that you're not legal,

674
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,270
and these papers of yours,

675
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,550
these false papers, they can't pass.

676
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:29,704
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

677
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,957
(Salvador speaking in foreign language)

678
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,493
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

679
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:49,410
- He says, "That his wife
just had a baby girl,

680
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,927
and that he's applied for amnesty but-"

681
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,077
- But he didn't get it.

682
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,650
So what am I supposed to do?

683
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,870
It's the law.

684
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,920
Business is business.

685
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,432
Tell him he's fired.

686
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:10,800
(dramatic music)

687
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,380
Did you hear what I said?

688
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,943
Tell him he's fired.

689
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,393
- Salvador.

690
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,930
Mr. Waterman.
- Hey, don't look at me

691
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,630
like that, I don't make the rules.

692
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,493
Look at this, all illegal.

693
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:27,820
You'd be amazed who's in this file.

694
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,620
I gotta, I gotta get rid of 'em all.

695
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,010
Tell him to see bookkeeper,

696
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,537
she'll give him enough to tide him off.

697
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:42,037
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

698
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,990
(door bangs)

699
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,330
Get your papers over to
Pearl as soon as you can.

700
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,893
I gotta show her we got at
least one citizen here, right?

701
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:12,475
(door bangs)

702
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,458
(insects chirping)

703
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:45,329
- Amor, what would you think
about moving back to Mexico?

704
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,840
- I think you were crazy.

705
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,630
Ay, Samuel, you are crazy.

706
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,950
Mexico, where did this come from?

707
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,800
- I figure I could sell the
house, start a business,

708
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,560
get the kids involved.

709
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,180
- Just give up our life here,

710
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,574
everything you and I have struggled for.

711
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:09,149
- Not everything (speaks
in foreign language),

712
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:11,225
we could do the same in Mexico.

713
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,060
We come from there, we belong there.

714
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,740
- No, Samuel, we made a promise.

715
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,150
Our children were born here.

716
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,143
- What if we don't have a choice?

717
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,500
What if we have to go back?

718
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,493
- We have a choice, it's not in Mexico.

719
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,230
And you know what needs to be done.

720
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,710
- And risk everything?

721
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,110
- I don't know how many times

722
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,710
we have to have this discussion.

723
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,710
- Okay, then there will
have to be sacrifices.

724
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:51,526
(light dramatic music)

725
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:04,803
- Samuel, Samuel, (speaking
in foreign language) Dodgers!

726
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,564
(singing in foreign language)

727
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,903
(singing in foreign language)

728
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:30,961
(singing in foreign language)

729
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,393
(singing in foreign language)

730
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:07,669
(birds chirping)

731
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,853
- I will ask him right now.

732
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,150
I hope he's in a good mood.

733
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,180
Look, you sorta got me into
this so wish me luck, okay?

734
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,013
Okay, bye.

735
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:24,378
(Marta exhales)

736
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,670
(hammer pounding)

737
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,877
- Little more, little harder
(speaking in foreign language).

738
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,113
- Hi, I want to talk
to you about my quince.

739
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,783
- So do we, mija.

740
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,420
- This is the most
important day of my life,

741
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,710
and I just think if I can go to my party

742
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,840
with somebody other than Octavio

743
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,630
everything would just be great.

744
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,020
And somebody has offered.

745
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,260
He's a really nice boy,
I'd like to go with him.

746
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,610
He's name is Ramon Sanchez.

747
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:05,257
- Mija, about this party,
something has come up.

748
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,353
- What?

749
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,400
- We, we have to be
careful about money, Marta.

750
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,153
- Okay, I'll invite fewer people.

751
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,373
- We can't invite anybody.

752
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,070
There is no party.

753
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,430
- What?

754
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,940
Why, what, what happened?

755
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,172
- It's a private matter, Marta.

756
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,020
It's, it's not your business.

757
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,760
- Oh, but it is my
business, it's my party.

758
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,690
You promised me.

759
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,215
Mama.

760
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:35,943
- We'll make it up to you.

761
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,320
- It's 'cause I asked
about Ramon, isn't it?

762
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,340
I take it back, I'll go
with Octavio, please.

763
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,350
- No more discussion, please.

764
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,841
And please stay away from
that boy, is that clear?

765
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:49,350
- You take away my party and
you don't even tell me why.

766
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,120
You won't let me see
the friends I wanna see.

767
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,123
You're treating me like a child.

768
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,070
The truth is you don't want me to grow up.

769
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,810
- I thought he might get mad about Ramon,

770
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,950
but I never thought he'd
call the whole thing off.

771
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,290
What's your mom say?

772
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,740
- Nothing, she always takes his side.

773
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,420
- Well, at least you still have your mass.

774
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,670
- Jackie, having just a mass

775
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,450
is worse than not having anything.

776
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,070
- What are you gonna
tell your honor court?

777
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,403
- I don't know.

778
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,673
- What's up, partner?

779
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,040
- Out for a test drive?

780
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,880
- No, going on a burger run.

781
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,713
You guys hungry?

782
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:42,650
- Marta, we have to tell your honor court

783
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,200
that the party's been canceled.

784
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,957
- Well?

785
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,183
- Marta, Marta.

786
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:03,530
- Wanna hear some music?

787
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,363
- Sure.

788
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,908
(upbeat rock music)

789
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:11,158
- Is that too loud for you?

790
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:22,070
(tires screeching)

791
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,337
- Marta, what do I tell them?

792
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:26,004
- Whatever you want!

793
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:31,240
- She's heartbroken.

794
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,557
It was her favorite uncle.

795
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:34,550
(group gasps)

796
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,530
At least he went peacefully in his sleep.

797
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,983
- Oh, wow, it's so tragic.

798
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,300
- She can't possibly have her quince now,

799
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,504
the whole family's in mourning.

800
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,170
- (gasps) Poor Marta.

801
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,403
She must be so sad.

802
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:30,220
- [Marta] Are you sure I'm not gonna fall?

803
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,430
- I'm not gonna let you fall.

804
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,820
Look all you gotta do is put one foot

805
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,470
in front of the other, like this.

806
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,297
- This is dangerous.

807
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:38,947
- I know, that's the whole point.

808
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,910
- Should we be here?

809
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,907
That sign says, "No trespassing."

810
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,053
- Yeah, from that side
doesn't say anything.

811
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,807
Oh, come on, will you chill out, please.

812
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:55,718
I mean I come here every
night under the full moon.

813
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:58,990
(imitates wolf howling)

814
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,243
- There isn't a full moon every night.

815
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,610
- Don't you know when I'm bragging.

816
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:05,860
- You're always bragging,

817
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,563
so I know when you're
bragging, it's all the time.

818
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,383
- You're right.

819
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,020
Come on, wait a second.

820
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,193
Come on, Marta, wait.

821
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,190
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

822
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,023
Come here, what are you doing?

823
00:46:21,023 --> 00:46:23,044
What are you crazy or something?

824
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:23,877
If I'm gonna be your escort

825
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:25,690
I can't let nothing bad
happen to you, come on.

826
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,430
- Ah, Ramon, there's
something I have to tell you.

827
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,860
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,

828
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,220
you just don't want your
girlfriends to die of jealousy.

829
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,083
Marta Delacruz, may I have
the honor of this dance?

830
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,063
- Yes.

831
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:41,098
(upbeat salsa music)

832
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,980
I wanna lead.

833
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,760
- Hey, wait, wait, wait,
that's supposed to be my job.

834
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,900
- My job now.

835
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,800
- Fine you wanna lead, okay, you lead.

836
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,403
Now it's my turn.

837
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:09,173
I told you I wasn't gonna
let anything happen to you.

838
00:47:12,753 --> 00:47:13,920
- [Group] Ooh.

839
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,840
- Marta, I'm telling.

840
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:20,640
- You little twerp.

841
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,920
I gotta go.

842
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,252
- Wait, wait a minute.

843
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:25,919
(kids giggling)

844
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:34,612
(upbeat piano music)

845
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:37,390
- You better not tell anyone.

846
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,500
- Give me a radio.

847
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,333
- No way.

848
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,290
- Then I'm gonna tell.

849
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,123
- No you're not.

850
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:45,481
- [Eddie] Let me out, Marta!

851
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:46,863
I'm gonna get you!

852
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,696
Let me out!

853
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:49,121
- You're grounded young lady.
- Get me out of here!

854
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:50,097
- But Papi.

855
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:53,800
- But nothing, school, church,
and home, and that's it.

856
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,480
- That's not fair, if
you would only trust me.

857
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,843
- Trust is something you
earn, you don't deserve it.

858
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,680
And let your brother out.

859
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,160
He didn't need to tell me,

860
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,660
I saw you myself from the bus.

861
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,560
She deliberately disobeyed me.

862
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,020
- She's disappointed, Samuel.

863
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,800
Try to understand.

864
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,370
- No, Inez, she has to understand,

865
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,610
I am still the head of this family.

866
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,370
- Samuel, Marta is becoming a young woman.

867
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,260
You have to face reality.

868
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,600
You can't stop things by ignoring them,

869
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,200
not with her, not with your
job, not with any of it.

870
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:42,530
(gentle music)

871
00:48:44,649 --> 00:48:45,740
(group chattering)

872
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,840
- Arturo, this is bad.

873
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,960
These need to be shipped by Thursday.

874
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,850
We need more men.

875
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,870
- I know that.

876
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,690
I'm filling in for half the crew myself.

877
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,340
- I'm still waiting to put
through your clearance.

878
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,090
How many times do I have to ask ya?

879
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,863
- I'm sorry, sir.

880
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,270
It's just a situation of misplaced papers.

881
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,010
We've moved so many times.

882
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,210
- Then go down to the social
security office and get a copy.

883
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,374
They got a file, you know.

884
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:12,207
- Yeah.

885
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,223
Mr. Waterman, you have to
give me a little time, please.

886
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,010
- I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know.

887
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,020
Put it this way my friend,

888
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,093
without papers you don't work here.

889
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:34,360
- Marta, where did you go?

890
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,260
I was so worried about you.

891
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,410
- Oh, there's nothing to worry about.

892
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,432
We just went to the railroad tracks.

893
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:40,507
- Marta.

894
00:49:40,507 --> 00:49:43,840
- Oh, Marta, it's so
terrible, I feel really bad.

895
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,160
- She knows I'm grounded.

896
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,070
- I don't think so.

897
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,097
- (speaks in foreign language),
I heard about your uncle.

898
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:52,670
(speaking in foreign language)

899
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,040
- My uncle?

900
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,100
- I told them he died.

901
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,720
- Jackie, I'm in enough trouble

902
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,893
as it is already, now this lie.

903
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,300
- (sighs) Life is so short,

904
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,563
I guess we have to party
while there's still time.

905
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,700
- What do I have to do?

906
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:16,050
- Prove that you've worked
steadily all these years.

907
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,620
- Proof, these hands are my proof.

908
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,470
What do they think I've
been doing all this time,

909
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,623
sitting on my behind?

910
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,000
- You've used different names, Samuel.

911
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,730
Your past employers are the only ones

912
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,180
who knew you by those names.

913
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,360
- Father, do you really think
they're going to remember me

914
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,570
from all the hundreds of others?

915
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,178
And once I go and humiliate
myself in front of these people

916
00:50:39,178 --> 00:50:42,290
how do I know it's just not
another immigration trap?

917
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,230
I've done this already you know, twice.

918
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,870
- There's always that risk.

919
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,630
But if you don't apply you will
never have your citizenship,

920
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,473
and time is running out.

921
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,323
- Nobody knows, not my
boss, not my friends,

922
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,390
not even my children.

923
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,790
- There are so many
others in your situation.

924
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,020
- I am not like the others,

925
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,650
I own my own house, I have a
secretary who takes my calls,

926
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,373
I even have my own parking space.

927
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,550
I'm not just some illegal.

928
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,800
- Unless you have
amnesty, Samuel, you are.

929
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,470
The bottom line is you have no choice.

930
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,503
- No choice, well, we'll see about that.

931
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:32,466
(dramatic music)

932
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,300
- Don't be angry, Marta,
it's your own fault.

933
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,610
- I never told you to lie.

934
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,140
- Hey Marta, where are you going?

935
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,370
- [Marta] Get away from me.

936
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,740
- Just don't get too chummy
with your new boyfriend

937
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,590
because we're gonna be gone.

938
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,410
- What are you talking about?

939
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,720
- Pop's taking us away.

940
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,243
We're gonna raise horses.

941
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,290
- [Jackie] Uh-oh.

942
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,260
- How ya doing?

943
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,093
You want a ride?

944
00:52:00,093 --> 00:52:01,370
- Come on, Marta, let's go.

945
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,253
Marta, let's go.

946
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,552
- Pop.

947
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,733
- Let's go home.

948
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,965
(gentle music)

949
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:21,354
- Come on.

950
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,878
(dramatic music)

951
00:52:23,878 --> 00:52:24,711
- Papi.

952
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,930
- We're leaving.
- Hooray,

953
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,651
we're going to Mexico.

954
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,484
- Mexico?

955
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,625
- Come on, wait a second.
- Papi.

956
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,310
(Samuel speaks in foreign language)

957
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,628
- Come on, Marta, wait.

958
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:45,128
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

959
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,310
- If we move down to Mexico
that'll be the end of my life.

960
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,930
- Well, does your father
say you're really going?

961
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,620
- I don't know he hardly
says anything to me anymore.

962
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,350
- Have you seen Ramon?

963
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,010
Does he know that the
party's been canceled?

964
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,420
Uh-oh.

965
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,420
- How can I even see him, I'm
not allowed out of the house?

966
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,720
- Poor Marta.

967
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,110
Don't worry, things don't get better,

968
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,310
they can only get worse.

969
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:17,067
(gentle music)

970
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,808
(gentle music)

971
00:53:43,908 --> 00:53:46,991
(upbeat salsa music)

972
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:09,843
- Mom.

973
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:12,350
- Huh?
- There's no milk left.

974
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,430
- [Inez] Yes, there is,
Marta, in the carton.

975
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,840
- It's empty.

976
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,350
I can go get some.

977
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:22,030
- [Inez] All right, but
hurry up, you know the rules.

978
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,113
(upbeat salsa music)

979
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:40,788
- I'm gonna put her caps on.

980
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,270
- Hi.

981
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,266
- Hey, come here, I
gotta show you something.

982
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,766
Here, go, go, go, go, come on.

983
00:54:53,128 --> 00:54:55,252
Check this out, I've been
practicing, right, hold that.

984
00:54:55,252 --> 00:54:56,396
Watch this.

985
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:58,896
Da-da-de-de-de-de-de-de-da-da.

986
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:01,920
Yo, we're gonna kill 'em.

987
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,720
- Well, actually we do a waltz.

988
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,100
- A waltz?

989
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,580
Come on, can't we jazz it up a little bit.

990
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,040
I mean what is it a funeral?

991
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,637
- No, it's an honor court,
and you and I would waltz.

992
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:13,780
- You (indistinct) are somethin' else.

993
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,360
A waltz?

994
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,790
I mean I just a brand new suit.

995
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,930
I mean, I don't know what it's
gonna look like in a waltz.

996
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,620
- Oh no, you have to take it back.

997
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,453
- No way, what?

998
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:24,050
What did you think you're
gonna escorted by some bum?

999
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,680
All right, all right,
so we waltz, then what?

1000
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,650
- Then there's a band, and lots of food,

1001
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,310
and matching tablecloths,

1002
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,950
and sometimes your name's up in lights.

1003
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,910
- In lights, like a Broadway show?

1004
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,090
Starring daddy's little girl.

1005
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,800
- I'm not a little girl.
- Okay, okay, okay,

1006
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,340
I'm sorry, you're not a little girl.

1007
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,550
- I can earn a living just like you.

1008
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,383
- A living?

1009
00:55:47,232 --> 00:55:49,832
Hey look, I change tires,
okay, that's not a living.

1010
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,900
You don't know anything.

1011
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,360
I mean it's survival out here.

1012
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,810
It's not some fairy tale
with some fancy parties.

1013
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,923
Don't do what I did.

1014
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,130
Stay with your family, Marta, okay,

1015
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,897
'cause that's the best thing you got.

1016
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,083
(somber music)

1017
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:07,390
- Why do you feel so sorry for yourself?

1018
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,500
- Look Cinderella, you got no right

1019
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,000
to talk to me like that, okay.

1020
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,780
- You can do whatever
you set your mind to.

1021
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,590
- You actually believe that garbage?

1022
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,990
Who tells you that, your rich father?

1023
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,520
Hey look, my life isn't
like yours all right.

1024
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,700
I'm going nowhere.

1025
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,960
I can't even read the
words on that milk carton.

1026
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,310
- So you can learn.

1027
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,170
- Forget about it, all right.

1028
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,810
They've already pushed all
those kiddie books on me,

1029
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,130
so just forget it!

1030
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:29,963
- Ramon.

1031
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:39,420
- Look, you feel something
inside you about who you are,

1032
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,200
your place in this world,
me, I can't feel that.

1033
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,063
It's like a wall and I
keep trying to get over it,

1034
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,750
so instead I just keep crashing into it.

1035
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,343
- So go around it.

1036
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:02,573
- You're such a kid.

1037
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,770
You know you need me to be your escort.

1038
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,793
Between all your friends,
what they're 12-years-old.

1039
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,050
If you don't have me there it's gonna turn

1040
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,110
into "The Mickey Mouse Club".

1041
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:14,943
- You're right.

1042
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:19,436
- So we still on?

1043
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,700
I mean it's not too late, right?

1044
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,890
- Late!

1045
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,930
What time is it?

1046
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:25,763
I gotta go.

1047
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:26,940
- [Ramon] Hey, wait a minute,
how come you're always

1048
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,990
running away from me?

1049
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,713
(gentle music)

1050
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,070
- I sent her out over an hour ago.

1051
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,363
- This food is cold,
we've waited long enough.

1052
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,056
- Rice and beans again.

1053
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:54,120
- (sighs) Chang's not
giving any more credit,

1054
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,270
I had to put back some of
the food I couldn't afford.

1055
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,590
- Don't worry, (speaks
in foreign language).

1056
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:02,055
This is good basic food.

1057
00:58:02,055 --> 00:58:05,510
A man could live forever on
rice and beans, right Eddie?

1058
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:10,056
- Uh, I rather live
forever on french fries.

1059
00:58:10,056 --> 00:58:13,639
(Inez and Samuel laughing)

1060
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,070
- Ah, it's about time.

1061
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,720
Put the milk on the table, Marta.

1062
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,911
You've been gone all this time

1063
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,603
and you don't have the milk, huh?

1064
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,290
We'll talk about this later.

1065
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,543
- No, we'll talk about this now.

1066
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,050
- They were all out of milk at Chang's

1067
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,130
and I had to go all over the place

1068
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,310
to find another store with milk,

1069
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,470
and some of 'em were closed,

1070
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,963
and I couldn't find-
- Stop.

1071
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,173
You insult us.

1072
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:43,793
A Delacruz does not lie.

1073
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,160
Were you with that boy?

1074
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
- What do you have against him?

1075
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,523
- Don't talk back to me.

1076
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,250
I ask the questions here.

1077
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,380
Do you think you can disobey?

1078
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,970
Go against your father.

1079
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:57,803
- No.

1080
00:59:01,676 --> 00:59:05,810
(Samuel speaking in foreign language)

1081
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,350
- Pass me the bread.

1082
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,743
Are have you stopped
understanding your native tongue?

1083
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,934
- My native tongue is English.

1084
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:15,684
(dramatic music)

1085
00:59:17,276 --> 00:59:21,890
(Inez speaks in foreign language)

1086
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,313
I was born here so my
native tongue is English.

1087
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,630
- Do you think you're better than those

1088
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,730
who weren't fortunate enough to come here?

1089
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,120
Do you?

1090
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,953
- Do you?

1091
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,783
- Samuel!

1092
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,117
What is happening to this family?

1093
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:58,997
(rooster crowing)

1094
01:00:01,128 --> 01:00:04,210
- Samuel, (speaks in foreign language).

1095
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,390
You walk to work to
save your pennies, huh?

1096
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:07,835
- Ah, my car broke down again.

1097
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:09,761
(Jorge speaks in foreign language)

1098
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:10,830
(Samuel speaks in foreign language)

1099
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,060
- I have job and they no ask me for paper.

1100
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,350
- Really, that's terrific.

1101
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,380
I knew you would finds something.

1102
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,310
And where is it?

1103
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,530
- Delaware House on Broadway.

1104
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,790
- Ay, Jorge, that place
will hire you for a week,

1105
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,457
then come payday the call
(speaks in foreign language).

1106
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:29,023
- I, I have to take a chance.

1107
01:00:31,072 --> 01:00:33,350
(Samuel speaks in foreign language)

1108
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,639
- No, no, I'll take care of it.

1109
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:37,061
Better days ahead.

1110
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:40,801
(Jorge speaks in foreign language)

1111
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:45,801
(Inez humming)
(upbeat music)

1112
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:55,316
(singing in foreign language)

1113
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,350
- The kids are asleep,
you won't be disturbed.

1114
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,940
- I never meant for this
to become such a problem.

1115
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,220
- I know, I know.

1116
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,853
- Our whole life is in this box.

1117
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,760
Last time I tried this they
said, "The slots were full."

1118
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,513
And there I was with my tail hanging out.

1119
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:50,700
- That lawyer was a crook,

1120
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,400
he left you wide open for trouble.

1121
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,820
- I kept thinking some day I'd try again

1122
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,953
when I wouldn't have so much to lose.

1123
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,960
Now I have everything to lose.

1124
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,733
- So I guess it's time.

1125
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:14,639
(upbeat salsa music)

1126
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:40,303
(group chattering)

1127
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:42,400
- (gasps) Ooh, remember this one.

1128
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,150
Oh, my dad was so proud, his
speech lasted for 20 minutes.

1129
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,250
- Look at your dress.

1130
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,047
Marta, wasn't it beautiful?

1131
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,710
- Can we get back to work, please?

1132
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:03,183
(suspenseful music)

1133
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,859
- Come in, Marta.

1134
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,410
- What does it mean in these files

1135
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,760
when the same person has two names?

1136
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,150
- Usually it means that
they've been using false papers

1137
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,420
and false names to work because
they don't have documents.

1138
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,407
- But what if this person is
already an American citizen?

1139
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:53,240
- Did you see the file in this office?

1140
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,073
- Yes.

1141
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:55,340
- If they were a citizen

1142
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,290
they wouldn't be coming to this office.

1143
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:05,888
(suspenseful music)

1144
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:01,951
(door bell buzzing)

1145
01:05:04,263 --> 01:05:05,096
- Hey, how ya doing?

1146
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,220
- What are you doing here?

1147
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,660
How did you know where I live?

1148
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,830
- Come here, I want you to
see something, all right.

1149
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,080
Check this out.

1150
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:13,100
I am now the new waltz king.

1151
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:17,652
Ta-dah!

1152
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:18,910
- Please, you can't stay here.

1153
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,743
You have to be going.

1154
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:20,850
Thanks for coming by.

1155
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,030
- Hey, is this your car?

1156
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:23,810
- Yeah, you want a ride?

1157
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:26,540
Look, I'll even take
your sister too, okay.

1158
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,910
Come on, let's go.
- No, please.

1159
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,670
I can't come out now.

1160
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:33,100
I have to stay inside,
my other brother is sick.

1161
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,140
- Oh, come on, give me a break,

1162
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,040
that is so lame, sick brother.

1163
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,670
- Listen, I'm not having a party anymore.

1164
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,300
It's been canceled, okay.

1165
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,820
So there's no reason for us
to see each other anymore.

1166
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,370
Now please, just go.

1167
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,271
- Hold on a second here,

1168
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:47,770
what are you talking about canceled?

1169
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,603
What happened?

1170
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:49,436
Did I do something wrong?

1171
01:05:49,436 --> 01:05:53,280
- No, yes, I don't know, I
don't know anything anymore.

1172
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,380
Just please go away and leave me alone.

1173
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,385
And don't come back here anymore!

1174
01:05:57,385 --> 01:05:58,871
- Hey, come on, wait a
second here, all right.

1175
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,288
(door bangs)

1176
01:06:03,978 --> 01:06:04,978
Yo, back up.

1177
01:06:06,806 --> 01:06:09,889
(car engine revving)

1178
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,718
(suspenseful music)

1179
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,728
- [Secretary] King Wire Partitions.

1180
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:29,447
- Arturo Montoya, please.

1181
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:31,976
(phone buzzes)

1182
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:34,476
- Art Montoya, can I help you?

1183
01:06:37,403 --> 01:06:39,258
- Eddie, drop your toys.

1184
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:40,616
Come on it's time for dinner.

1185
01:06:40,616 --> 01:06:42,932
10 minutes (speaking in foreign language).

1186
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,304
Don't forget.

1187
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,721
10 minutes, Eddie, I mean it.

1188
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,334
Don't forget that.

1189
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:58,501
10 minutes, and I mean it.

1190
01:07:06,984 --> 01:07:09,151
This place is such a mess.

1191
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:13,293
Are you all right?

1192
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:15,903
- Why does Papi keep talking about Mexico?

1193
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,810
- He doesn't talk about it that much.

1194
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,450
- Is there any reason why we
might have to go down there?

1195
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,600
- Of course not, we're
not moving anywhere.

1196
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,390
- Is everyone in this
family an American citizen?

1197
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,890
- Ay, mija, so many questions.

1198
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:33,293
- Would you ever lie to me?

1199
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,503
Nevermind.

1200
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,660
- You got papers?

1201
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:43,703
No papers.

1202
01:07:44,662 --> 01:07:46,562
No work without papers, you know that.

1203
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,633
What's with you guys?

1204
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,393
Next.

1205
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,160
Okay, 4.50 an hour night shift
only, take it or leave it.

1206
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,710
- That's not what I'm here for.

1207
01:07:58,182 --> 01:08:00,415
- You're a little overdressed
for this kind of work.

1208
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:02,040
- I'd like to see the supervisor.

1209
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,554
I have a private matter
to discuss with him.

1210
01:08:03,554 --> 01:08:05,570
- Whoa, private matter.

1211
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,520
Well, we're not making
an exceptions today,

1212
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,347
but that's a good try, I liked it.

1213
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:11,350
- I'm not here for work.

1214
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,930
- So then you're wasting my time.

1215
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,670
Okay, next.
- Look, I am not one

1216
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,420
of these newcomers.

1217
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,890
I would like to talk to your supervisor.

1218
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,900
- No way, Jose.

1219
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,350
- Don't talk to me like that.

1220
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:24,950
- I will talk to you anyway I like.

1221
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,040
- I've been living in this country

1222
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,208
since before you were in high school.

1223
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,458
- Hey, get him out of here.

1224
01:08:35,509 --> 01:08:38,259
(birds chirping)

1225
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,760
- Papi.

1226
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,930
- What are doing out on the street?

1227
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:48,970
You should be inside.

1228
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,490
- Please, Papi, I have to talk to you.

1229
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:52,220
- Ah, more business about this boy.

1230
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,533
- No, it's not that.

1231
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,913
Papi, I saw your file at work.

1232
01:08:57,835 --> 01:08:59,100
(light dramatic music)

1233
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,243
I know about you.

1234
01:09:05,318 --> 01:09:07,235
Why didn't you tell me?

1235
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,510
- Marta, this is none of your concern.

1236
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,180
- Yes, it is, it's about all of us,

1237
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,040
it's about me, and Ricky, and Eddie.

1238
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,560
- Silence, since when does
a child tell the father.

1239
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,960
- Is this why you were
talking about going to Mexico?

1240
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,163
Are we being deported?

1241
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,073
- Samuel Delacruz will
never be deported, mija.

1242
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,810
If he leaves it will be
of his own free choice.

1243
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,080
- Well, maybe we could
try and get some help.

1244
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,136
Maybe I could do something.

1245
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,270
- (speaks in foreign
language) There will be

1246
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,333
no more conversations on this
to anyone, is that understood?

1247
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,043
- Yes.

1248
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:44,597
(Marta sighs)

1249
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,283
(door bangs)

1250
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:49,283
(suspenseful music)

1251
01:09:58,981 --> 01:10:03,231
(man speaking in foreign language)

1252
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:14,946
- No!

1253
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:16,837
No!

1254
01:10:18,835 --> 01:10:20,585
- Let's go, let's go!

1255
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:34,143
- Jorge's been deported.

1256
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,120
Carlos saw him get picked up
at the warehouse on Broadway.

1257
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,110
- Jorge, will he be late?

1258
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,330
- We won't be seeing Jorge anymore, honey.

1259
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,060
- What's going on, what's happening?

1260
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,250
- Get away from that window!

1261
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,850
And if any immigration
officers come around

1262
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,420
you don't know Jorge.

1263
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,690
Now I want everybody to come
home right after school.

1264
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,230
Stay close to the house,

1265
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,230
and absolutely no taking to strangers.

1266
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,823
- But they can't pick
us up, we're Americans.

1267
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,893
- Just do as I say, understand?

1268
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:07,492
(upbeat music)

1269
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:14,876
(singing in foreign language)

1270
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:20,584
(singing in foreign language)

1271
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:26,189
(singing in foreign language)

1272
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:31,855
(singing in foreign language)

1273
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,288
(singing in foreign language)

1274
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:49,074
(singing in foreign language)

1275
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:11,967
(singing in foreign language)

1276
01:12:13,757 --> 01:12:17,590
(singing in foreign language)

1277
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,770
- He doesn't have much time.

1278
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:28,870
- He's doing the best he can.

1279
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,850
- But what if he doesn't
get the signatures?

1280
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,533
- Are you thinking about
him, us, or yourself?

1281
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,293
- We're Americans, why
should we have to go?

1282
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,323
- You're an American,
yes, you have privileges,

1283
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,430
but I feel sorry for you.

1284
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,950
Where you come from, what went before you,

1285
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:50,720
you can't see that.

1286
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,193
All you see is yourself.

1287
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:56,830
Mommy, what things can I
get, what things can I have?

1288
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,180
If that's being an American

1289
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:01,519
then maybe we should go back to Mexico.

1290
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,797
(dramatic music)

1291
01:13:10,236 --> 01:13:14,070
(school bell ringing)

1292
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,100
- Marta, where have you been?

1293
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,910
I haven't seen you in ages,

1294
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,490
- Are you having your party or not?

1295
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,120
- You heard about her uncle?

1296
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,207
- Well, Ramon has just said,

1297
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:24,240
"That her party has just been canceled."

1298
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,030
But I thought it was
canceled a long time ago,

1299
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,430
so what'd you do move it to a
fancier place and not tell me.

1300
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,850
- I told you somebody died, okay.

1301
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:32,100
- [Lupe] Yeah, leave her alone.

1302
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,490
- Nobody died.

1303
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,323
- Marta.

1304
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,010
- I'm not having my party.

1305
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:40,560
It's just not that important
anymore, all right?

1306
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,640
- All right.

1307
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,040
- It's okay, Marta.

1308
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,180
- Of course it is.

1309
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,433
- Hey, Marta, you wanna
see something funny?

1310
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,920
- No, Gabby, not here, please.

1311
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,846
- Why not?

1312
01:13:52,846 --> 01:13:54,720
They all have their gym
lockers next to mine

1313
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,080
and they always jabber
about us in Spanish.

1314
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,370
- Just don't, okay.

1315
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,770
- Well, who are they to you?

1316
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,039
Tell me if anyone's coming.

1317
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,120
- Okay.

1318
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,360
- One.

1319
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,360
- Please, Gabby.

1320
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,727
- She doesn't want ya to do it.

1321
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:07,897
- Two.

1322
01:14:07,897 --> 01:14:08,730
- No, don't.

1323
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,128
- Three.

1324
01:14:10,128 --> 01:14:10,961
- No!

1325
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:36,641
(Marta sighs)

1326
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:37,988
(door knocking)

1327
01:14:37,988 --> 01:14:39,880
- Marta, come in.

1328
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,560
This is dedication coming
here on your day off.

1329
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,430
- I'm looking for a case I was working on,

1330
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:46,400
I wanted to make sure that I didn't forget

1331
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,520
to attach the medical exam,

1332
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,080
but I can't find the file.

1333
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,310
- That's no surprise, look at this mess.

1334
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,700
Whose was it?

1335
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,513
- A man named Arturo Montoya.

1336
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,270
- Marta, your father
withdrew his application.

1337
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,103
- Why?

1338
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,113
- He feels cornered.

1339
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:13,690
He's about to fired because he's illegal.

1340
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,300
If he takes time off from
work to get his signatures

1341
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,763
he'll lose his job anyway.

1342
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,230
When your neighbor was deported

1343
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,440
he just doesn't see the point anymore.

1344
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,273
- Can't you help?

1345
01:15:25,273 --> 01:15:27,260
Isn't there anything you can do?

1346
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,750
- I'm afraid it's out of my hands.

1347
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,350
He has to get all of the signatures

1348
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,910
from all of his past employers

1349
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,460
and no one can do that for him.

1350
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,223
I'm sorry.

1351
01:15:42,766 --> 01:15:45,010
(door bangs)

1352
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:45,843
- Papi.

1353
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:51,230
- This a new pastime,
sitting alone in the dark.

1354
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,610
Where's your mother?

1355
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:54,553
- She took the boys down the the Avenue.

1356
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,550
Mrs. Zavala said, "You
withdrew your application."

1357
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,270
- [Samuel] That's right.

1358
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:06,970
- Are you gonna move us to Mexico?

1359
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,170
- My children are American,

1360
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:16,100
this is where they belong, so we stay.

1361
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,220
- But if we stay here
what are you gonna do?

1362
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,483
How will you?
- Feed my family.

1363
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:26,320
I'll work, Marta, with my hands,
with the sweat of my back.

1364
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,280
Are you ashamed of that too?

1365
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,113
- No.

1366
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,600
- I'll survive, that's all there is.

1367
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,160
- But what about everything you dreamed?

1368
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,520
You said, "A person could do anything

1369
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,733
if they really wanted."

1370
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:47,220
- That dream isn't for me, it's over.

1371
01:16:51,113 --> 01:16:53,863
(ethereal music)

1372
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:26,269
(phone ringing)
(group chattering)

1373
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:28,422
- Marta, yoo-hoo.

1374
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,699
Time for a break, wanna come?

1375
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:33,199
- No, you go ahead, I have to finish this.

1376
01:17:39,038 --> 01:17:42,038
(suspenseful music)

1377
01:18:36,032 --> 01:18:39,115
(train bell ringing)

1378
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,902
(tire thuds)

1379
01:18:48,902 --> 01:18:51,319
(tire thuds)

1380
01:18:54,175 --> 01:18:57,120
(tire thuds)

1381
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,490
Hi.

1382
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,630
I figured you might be here.

1383
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:03,893
- Ooh, very smart, real
college material, huh?

1384
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,730
- I have a problem, I need to talk to you.

1385
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:12,060
- What, no matching napkins
for you party dress?

1386
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:12,913
- Please.

1387
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,887
- I said things to you.

1388
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,250
I mean you made me feel
like I'm a lot better

1389
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,450
than the loser everybody
makes me out to be.

1390
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,960
- I have to tell you something.

1391
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,073
Can you keep a secret?

1392
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,080
- Can you trust me?

1393
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,503
- My father's an illegal.

1394
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,550
- So is everybody else
in this neighborhood.

1395
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,523
- No, not like everybody
else, this is my father.

1396
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:45,090
- Why should I care about your father?

1397
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,667
- If somebody can prove how
long he's been in this country

1398
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:51,730
and that he's earned his own
way he can qualify for amnesty.

1399
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:53,030
- So what?

1400
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,820
- I can do that for him.

1401
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,030
I just have to get
signatures at his old jobs

1402
01:19:57,030 --> 01:20:00,819
and I need you to drive.

1403
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,313
- (chuckles) You ever hear of a bus?

1404
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,563
Look I got a lotta better things to do

1405
01:20:05,563 --> 01:20:07,732
than chauffeur you around sweetheart.

1406
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:10,149
(tire thuds)

1407
01:20:15,055 --> 01:20:18,162
(tire thuds)

1408
01:20:18,162 --> 01:20:21,412
(light dramatic music)

1409
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:25,730
- You said, "You could talk to me."

1410
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,230
Well, you said some things to me too

1411
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,110
and they made a difference.

1412
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,943
- Like what?

1413
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,150
- You told me, "That my family's
the best thing I've got."

1414
01:20:35,924 --> 01:20:38,124
And I'm gonna show my
father I believe that.

1415
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,470
- Chauffeur, huh?

1416
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,410
I've done a lot worse.

1417
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,243
- You'll do it?

1418
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,671
Really?

1419
01:20:57,671 --> 01:20:58,504
- Yeah.

1420
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,050
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait, come on.

1421
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:03,050
Stop, stop, come on.

1422
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:15,219
(car horn honking)

1423
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,930
- Who's car is that?

1424
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:21,763
- It's mine.

1425
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,447
Come on, get in, all right, we gotta go.

1426
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:28,197
(car door thuds)

1427
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,302
(train bell ringing)

1428
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,220
So this is where your old man works, huh?

1429
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,730
- No, I could really
mess things up for him

1430
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,300
if we went there.

1431
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,400
We're working backwards from his last job.

1432
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:55,120
Do I look old enough to be
taken seriously by these guys?

1433
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,423
- You look great, but those
little socks they gotta go.

1434
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:02,924
(gentle music)

1435
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:08,127
A real woman.

1436
01:22:08,127 --> 01:22:09,864
If you need me I'm gonna
be right here, okay.

1437
01:22:09,864 --> 01:22:10,697
- Okay.

1438
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:12,770
I'm going in there.

1439
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,350
- [Ramon] Go for it.

1440
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:15,783
- Okay, I'm ready.

1441
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:18,062
- You can do it.

1442
01:22:20,177 --> 01:22:23,844
(light inspirational music)

1443
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:33,923
Go around.

1444
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,050
Around the corner.

1445
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:56,791
(man speaking in foreign language)

1446
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,210
- Come on, give me a break will ya.

1447
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,927
Did I know that the truck
carrying the broken down parts

1448
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:03,373
was gonna break down, huh?

1449
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:08,880
Yeah, we're looking at
Friday, Monday maybe.

1450
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,923
Right, next time we'll send 'em airmail.

1451
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,103
Yeah.

1452
01:23:13,103 --> 01:23:16,140
- Hello, I'm here to ask you
if you remember this man.

1453
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,420
- Excuse me.

1454
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,830
Simpson.

1455
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:21,553
Yeah, oh, no, no.

1456
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,393
Look you better sit down, honey,

1457
01:23:23,393 --> 01:23:24,723
this is gonna take a while.

1458
01:23:25,965 --> 01:23:27,593
All right, come on give me the order.

1459
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:33,223
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1460
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:47,223
- Hey, you blind?

1461
01:23:48,842 --> 01:23:50,060
- Huh?

1462
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,053
- Read the sign.

1463
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,080
If you're lookin' for work

1464
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,843
you have to go to the end of the line.

1465
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:06,043
To the end of the line.

1466
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,530
- Yo, do I look like
I wanna work here bro?

1467
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:15,140
- Oh, why don't you just get
the hell out of here then.

1468
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,623
I said move it.

1469
01:24:27,641 --> 01:24:29,760
- Look, I'm tellin' ya for the last time

1470
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,290
we got two men out sick today,

1471
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:33,060
the line's down on number one.

1472
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,300
No, no, I'll wait, I'll wait.

1473
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,316
Look, you're on honey, you
better make it fast, huh.

1474
01:24:37,316 --> 01:24:38,210
- Do you recognize this man?

1475
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:39,340
He used to work for you.

1476
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,830
Arturo Montoya, Jose
Mendoza, or Reuben Reyes,

1477
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,130
only his real name is Samuel Delacruz.

1478
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:45,470
- Look, I had a lot of men work for me.

1479
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:46,670
- All you have to sign this letter

1480
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:47,630
that says he once worked for you

1481
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,920
and he'll be able to
become a legal resident.

1482
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,991
- That's it.

1483
01:24:50,991 --> 01:24:51,991
- That's it.

1484
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,850
- Who are you?

1485
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,400
- Marta Delacruz, his daughter.

1486
01:24:58,873 --> 01:25:02,373
(light suspenseful music)

1487
01:25:08,283 --> 01:25:09,950
- You look like him.

1488
01:25:17,463 --> 01:25:19,830
No, no, I'm here, look
you got me, I'm all ears.

1489
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:22,480
You can drag me around
as much as you want.

1490
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,910
Look, I promise you, I'll pack it myself,

1491
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:29,410
I'll drive it across country if I have to.

1492
01:25:43,175 --> 01:25:44,627
- What's wrong?

1493
01:25:44,627 --> 01:25:45,720
- Can you believe that
creep actually thought

1494
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,001
I wanted to work for these guys?

1495
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:48,999
- [Marta] So.

1496
01:25:48,999 --> 01:25:52,233
- So, so I can do a lot
better than work here.

1497
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,193
- I know.

1498
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,100
- Did you get 'em signed?

1499
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,460
- Yeah, but my hands are still sweaty.

1500
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,303
- You got guts.

1501
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,413
I mean you go past what scares you.

1502
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,120
All right, so you're on a roll.

1503
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,550
Where's the next one?

1504
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:13,890
- It's late, I'm not really supposed

1505
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:16,160
to be out at all, I'm grounded.

1506
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,023
- Whatever it was you did it's worth it.

1507
01:26:21,573 --> 01:26:24,012
(car engine revving)

1508
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:27,512
(light suspenseful music)

1509
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:44,604
(upbeat music)

1510
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:19,320
(cars thudding)

1511
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,350
- I can believe he actually worked here.

1512
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,150
- It makes my job look like
I'm a Wall Street executive.

1513
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,769
Ah, your father's come a long way.

1514
01:29:28,769 --> 01:29:29,707
- Hey!

1515
01:29:29,707 --> 01:29:32,576
No kids messing around in here!

1516
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,320
You break your necks I'm gonna get sued.

1517
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,341
- Yo, chill out, all right.

1518
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:36,951
We just wanna talk to the owner.

1519
01:29:36,951 --> 01:29:38,090
- Why?

1520
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,940
- My father used to work for him,

1521
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,790
all he has to do is sign this letter.

1522
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,403
- Immigration.

1523
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,913
No way, I can't hire illegals.

1524
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,690
Hey, (speaks in foreign
language) over there,

1525
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,523
(speaks in foreign language)!

1526
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,040
- No, you don't understand.

1527
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,417
All he has to do is say he worked here.

1528
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:00,830
- How do I know he worked here.

1529
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,940
I got hundreds of wetbacks
in and out of here.

1530
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,230
- Because he sad.

1531
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,350
- (laughs) He said.

1532
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,763
He coulda said anything.

1533
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,690
- Please, you're the last signature.

1534
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,810
If you don't sign this letter

1535
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,270
everything we've done will be for nothing.

1536
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,770
- That's life, I ain't signing anything.

1537
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,370
Now you kids get out of here!

1538
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,280
What I'd say,

1539
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,977
move that thing (speaking
in foreign language)!

1540
01:30:24,903 --> 01:30:27,170
- You know what Pops, you're
being a real jerk, man.

1541
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,570
I mean everybody else
has signed the papers,

1542
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:29,850
what's the problem?

1543
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:32,130
- I ain't anybody else.

1544
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,280
- I take it you like
be a slave owner, huh?

1545
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,940
- You watch your step.

1546
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,087
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1547
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:41,970
- You know somethin' bro, you're lucky.

1548
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,210
You're real lucky, man.

1549
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:46,190
- Yeah, look at me, I'm trembling.

1550
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,023
- Come on.

1551
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,600
- That slime, he coulda
signed those papers.

1552
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,460
Forget it, let's just go, all right.

1553
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,380
What?

1554
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,400
Marta, come back here.

1555
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,640
What's a matter?

1556
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,870
- Stay back, you two are
just gonna get in a fight.

1557
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,159
- Don't you know that
you're giving into him,

1558
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,347
that's what he wants you to do.

1559
01:31:04,347 --> 01:31:05,190
He want's you to crawl.

1560
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:07,790
- I don't care what it
takes, I want that signature.

1561
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,493
- What?

1562
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,450
Oh, it's you.

1563
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:22,200
Where's that little punk you were with?

1564
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,240
- This man is my father,
he did work for you.

1565
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,700
You may not remember
him, but it's the truth.

1566
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,430
All you have to do is sign this letter.

1567
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,290
You won't get in trouble

1568
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,210
for something that happened years ago.

1569
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:34,220
I know, I work at the amnesty office.

1570
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,000
You can call and check if you want.

1571
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,973
- I ain't callin' nobody.

1572
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:45,170
- My father's worked so
hard, he deserves this.

1573
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:49,368
To you it's just a signature
but it will changes he's life.

1574
01:31:49,368 --> 01:31:51,610
(inspirational music)

1575
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:52,453
Please.

1576
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:57,880
- You got a lotta guts coming back here.

1577
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,800
Let me see that.

1578
01:32:07,573 --> 01:32:10,656
I don't know why I stick my neck out.

1579
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:16,736
- Thank you.

1580
01:32:16,736 --> 01:32:18,743
You did a good thing.

1581
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:19,993
- [Owner] Yeah.

1582
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,043
- You did it?

1583
01:32:36,136 --> 01:32:37,398
You did it?

1584
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:38,398
- We did it!

1585
01:32:39,613 --> 01:32:40,446
- Yeah.

1586
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:49,698
Come on, let's go.

1587
01:33:06,632 --> 01:33:07,715
What's wrong?

1588
01:33:11,077 --> 01:33:13,540
- All of those horrible places we've been

1589
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:18,530
and my father, I never had
any idea where he'd been,

1590
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:19,913
what he'd done for us.

1591
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,683
- He was just trying to keep
your, keep your life sweet.

1592
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,620
What happens now?

1593
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:33,039
- I don't know.

1594
01:33:33,903 --> 01:33:35,653
- Will I ever see you again?

1595
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:43,863
(gentle romantic music)

1596
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,220
- I gotta go.

1597
01:33:58,220 --> 01:33:59,533
- Wait, wait, wait.

1598
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,880
I don't get it, today I'm your best friend

1599
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,500
and then tomorrow I'm out of your life.

1600
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,250
- No, it's just my father.

1601
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,500
- What about your father?

1602
01:34:10,616 --> 01:34:13,380
I mean come on, I'm breaking
my back to help him.

1603
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,690
- He doesn't know that.

1604
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:15,890
- Yeah, but you know it.

1605
01:34:22,306 --> 01:34:24,980
You're not gonna tell him are you?

1606
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,720
- I can't.

1607
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,590
You don't understand.

1608
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:28,778
- What is because I'm not good enough

1609
01:34:28,778 --> 01:34:30,661
for his little daughter,
is that what it is?

1610
01:34:30,661 --> 01:34:31,917
- No.

1611
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,720
- You just went ahead and used me,

1612
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,820
you got what you wanted, and
now it's goodbye Charlie.

1613
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,120
- That's not fair.

1614
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,220
- Well, you know what?

1615
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:42,210
You go to on to your father, all right.

1616
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,590
Go on to him, 'cause he's probably worried

1617
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,240
about his little princess by now.

1618
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,740
Oh, and another thing, next
time you need a chauffeur

1619
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,640
look one up in the Yellow Pages, okay.

1620
01:35:00,336 --> 01:35:03,419
(car engine revving)

1621
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,333
- Marta.

1622
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,620
Where have you been?

1623
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,700
- Papi.

1624
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,701
- I have forbidden you to see that boy.

1625
01:35:25,701 --> 01:35:27,630
- It wasn't what you think.

1626
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:29,470
- I don't know who you are anymore.

1627
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:32,563
You're not my daughter, you
don't belong in this family!

1628
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,610
- All my life I've looked up to you.

1629
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,530
You taught me to believe in your dream

1630
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,600
of who I am and who I could be,

1631
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,973
and every time I try to be
those things you cut me down.

1632
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,260
You're right, your daughter isn't here.

1633
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:50,872
She finally grew up.

1634
01:35:50,872 --> 01:35:52,533
And if I don't belong in your family

1635
01:35:52,533 --> 01:35:55,360
it's because you won't make room for me.

1636
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,960
You wanna know what I was doing.

1637
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,413
This is what is what I
was doing with Ramon.

1638
01:36:03,844 --> 01:36:07,094
(light dramatic music)

1639
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:17,080
- Everybody up, I'm
calling a family meeting.

1640
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,319
Your father has something to tell you

1641
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:19,869
and I'm only gonna say it once.

1642
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:27,603
Children, your father has
always asked you for two things,

1643
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:32,973
never to lie and never to lose your dream.

1644
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,983
I wanted to be an American,
that was my dream, but I lied.

1645
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:46,593
In fact, I am not a
citizen of this country.

1646
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:53,413
That lie had a reason,
I wanted to protect you.

1647
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:56,923
And I'm not ashamed of that.

1648
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:01,823
But somebody in this
family wanted to help,

1649
01:37:03,129 --> 01:37:05,567
and because of my pride I refused.

1650
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:10,740
Marta wanted me to keep my dream,

1651
01:37:13,965 --> 01:37:14,915
and I shut her out.

1652
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:22,660
Amnesty is forgiveness, I
hope Marta can forgive me.

1653
01:37:32,776 --> 01:37:35,776
(children giggling)

1654
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:48,780
- You're everything I
ever hoped you would be.

1655
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,493
You deserve this day,
you've earned it, mija.

1656
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,023
- Mommy, you made this.

1657
01:38:05,023 --> 01:38:06,544
- Mm-hmm.

1658
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:07,544
- Thank you.

1659
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:12,705
- Hurry up, girls, they don't
wait for nobody at the church.

1660
01:38:12,705 --> 01:38:15,955
(church bells ringing)

1661
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:20,100
- Marta Alecia Delacruz,

1662
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,897
this is your 15th birthday
(speaks in foreign language).

1663
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,223
It marks your passage from
childhood into the grownup world.

1664
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,170
As you cross this threshold

1665
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:36,010
remember you have the power within you

1666
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,133
to find everything you're searching for.

1667
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,973
Never doubt yourself.

1668
01:38:42,763 --> 01:38:44,090
And if others doubt you

1669
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,260
remember God wants you to become complete.

1670
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:52,493
May he look upon you with
kindness and give you peace.

1671
01:38:58,003 --> 01:38:59,155
- Adios, Manuel.

1672
01:38:59,155 --> 01:39:01,226
- Thank you.
- Gracias, Tina.

1673
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:02,059
- Thank you.
- Adios.

1674
01:39:02,059 --> 01:39:03,563
- This is a proud day for both of you.

1675
01:39:04,498 --> 01:39:05,331
- Yeah.

1676
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:11,130
- Congratulations, those
are your temporary papers.

1677
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:13,730
You can use them until your
permanent card comes in.

1678
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,233
- Thank you.

1679
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:20,547
- You have quite a daughter.

1680
01:39:21,953 --> 01:39:26,370
(Guest speaking in foreign language)

1681
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:34,174
(gentle music)

1682
01:39:34,174 --> 01:39:38,507
- Marta, just yesterday I,
I carried you right here.

1683
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,283
Today, I set you free.

1684
01:39:46,811 --> 01:39:47,644
- Papi.

1685
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:51,343
- Marta.

1686
01:39:52,883 --> 01:39:54,240
I've just been told that someone

1687
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,420
has tampered with the files.
- What?

1688
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,125
- There is some officials
waiting inside the office

1689
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:00,513
that would like to speak with you.

1690
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:18,105
- [Group] Surprise!

1691
01:40:18,105 --> 01:40:21,438
(upbeat mariachi music)

1692
01:40:38,054 --> 01:40:39,519
(singing in foreign language)

1693
01:40:39,519 --> 01:40:42,186
- Amigos, the clothes, the food,

1694
01:40:43,033 --> 01:40:45,910
(speaks in foreign language),
were all made by you.

1695
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:48,623
You are our family, you
are where we come from,

1696
01:40:49,467 --> 01:40:50,640
and where we belong.

1697
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,467
- Thank you, everybody from
the bottom of our hearts.

1698
01:40:59,421 --> 01:41:02,171
(girls cheering)

1699
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:04,359
- So beautiful.

1700
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:05,491
These are from Gabby's quince.

1701
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:06,680
- I borrowed them back.

1702
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,771
- Ay, you've seen one
dress you've seen 'em all.

1703
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:09,746
(girls cheering)

1704
01:41:09,746 --> 01:41:12,926
(singing in foreign language)

1705
01:41:12,926 --> 01:41:15,676
(group cheering)

1706
01:41:28,906 --> 01:41:29,739
- Marta.

1707
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:30,913
- [Group] To Marta.

1708
01:41:30,913 --> 01:41:33,124
To Marta, to Marta.

1709
01:41:33,124 --> 01:41:34,041
- To Marta.

1710
01:41:37,461 --> 01:41:40,794
(gentle romantic music)

1711
01:41:42,163 --> 01:41:43,431
Congratulations.

1712
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:44,630
- He let you come.

1713
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:45,977
- Hey, he asked me to come.

1714
01:41:45,977 --> 01:41:49,210
And I tell you what, I wouldn't
miss this for anything.

1715
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,043
Come here.

1716
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,883
Sit down, and watch.

1717
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:20,341
(Ramon sighs)

1718
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:38,403
- Thank you.

1719
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:44,281
(upbeat classical music)

1720
01:42:56,499 --> 01:42:58,614
- Marta Delacruz, may I have
the honor of this dance?

1721
01:42:58,614 --> 01:42:59,447
- Yes.

1722
