    Paul, before I let you go   

5
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,785
    here you are in the middle  
    of a hugely successful

8

9
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,323
     that so much attention     
        is still placed         

10

   of the Beatles reuniting?    

11
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,312
      Well, to be honest,       
         that question          

12
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:06,114
     does get a bit boring      

13
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,016
      um, but I understand      
        you have to ask.

  The Beatles are the Beatles   

15

      to follow, you know?

                years of being  

19

      is there any chance       
         of the Beatles

      than we'd expected.

      Hope you don't mind       
      me surprising you.        

134
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,316
     It's too soon to say.      

135
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,175
         Where's Yoko?          

136
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,545
       Off buying a cow.        

137
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,331
            She won't be home   
            till tomorrow.      

138
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,718
    Bancha twig? Brown rice?    

139
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,036
                    Dandelion?  

140
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,371
           Whatever.            

141
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,326
        What about Sean?        

142
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,494
         He's sleeping.         

143
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,064
         In California          
      where the cows are.       

144
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,115
       Oh, that's a drag.       

145
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,550
    I was hoping to see him.    

146
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,860
      Is it okay to smoke?      

147
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,212
    Have you got one for me?    

148
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,239
You're very thin.               

149
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,326
        Hmm. Mother's got us    
        on a macrobiotic diet.  

150
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,493
    Mother?                     

151
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,746
                    Yoko.       

152
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,562
        So we're alone.         

153
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,733
             Yeah.              

154
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:40,605
            You, me             
   and everything between us.   

155
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,128
       (<i> water boiling</i> )        

156
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,160
                    Here.       

157
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,128
                I brought you   
                something.      

158
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,462
What's this?                    

159
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,882
            "Wings."            

160
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,717
       That's your band.        

161
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,902
            Mm-hmm.             

162
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,588
       Are they any good?       

163
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,590
      Judge for yourself.       

164
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,325
     Madison Square Garden      

165
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,610
                 two weeks time.

166
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,745
   I've already played there.   

167
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,232
        With Elton John.        

168
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,600
Hmm.                            

169
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,935
        Against me will.        

170
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,770
        Elton dared me.         

171
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:30,938
       Heard about that.        

172
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,307
            You did             
 one of our old songs with him  

173
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,475
                      I seem    
                      to recall.

174
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,110
   Yeah, and then I got sick.   

175
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,265
       You ought to come        

176
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,167
                    to the show.

177
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,436
        I'm pretty busy         

178
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,538
you know, Paul.                 

179
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,240
     Yeah, I can see that.      

180
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,782
  You might like it, you know.  

181
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,854
          (<i> coughing</i> )          

182
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,678
       So, you seen much        
     of the others lately?      

183
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,280
         Which "others"         
     are you referring to?      

184
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,666
      The other Be-a-tles.      

185
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,935
     Ex-Be-a-tles, rather.      

186
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,488
        Well, let's see.        

187
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,957
       Haven't heard much       
       of Beatle Harold.        

188
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,009
              Ta.               

189
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,376
Beatle George                   
rang up                         

190
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,578
      just the other day.       

191
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,047
         He was in town         
   making a guest appearance    

192
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,585
      with Monty Python's       
    Flying Circus on stage.     

193
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,154
       He's a lumberjack       
        and he's okay.         

194
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,639
     I know that one, yeah.     

195
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,458
     Yeah, that one, yeah.      

196
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,881
       I'm supposed to go       
        into the studio         

197
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:51,485
with, uh, Beatle Ringo next week
   to play piano or something   

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,754
       on a song I wrote        
       for his new album.       

199
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:54,856
           Oh, yeah?            

200
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:55,890
Yeah.                           

201
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,859
 Don't know if I'll go, though. 

202
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:00,094
    I'd like to help Ringo,     
         but I just...          

203
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,964
I'm not geared up to going back 
        into the studio         

204
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,999
     you know what I mean?      

205
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,822
              You?              

206
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,040
   Haven't heard from George    
           in a while           

207
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,843
      but I talk to Ringo       
         pretty often.          

208
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,645
                You know, that  
                thing with Ringo

209
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,879
                     that sounds
                     like fun.  

210
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,347
                      You should
                      do it.    

211
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,119
                It's very white.

212
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,292
Did you bring me                
anything else?                  

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,334
   Well, first things first.    

214
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,202
     Are you allowed, son?      

215
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,120
      I won't say anything      
         if you don't.          

216
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,679
        Can I smell it?         

217
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,416
    Oh...                       

218
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,320
What is that?                   

219
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,822
                It's good stuff.

220
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,125
Oh, it smells good.             
Yeah, give us another smell.    

221
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,159
                Get away. Go on.

222
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,045
                 Stop slobbering
                 all over it.   

223
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:31,502
  So your record's number one   
      over here, you know?      

224
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,053
  Really? I hadn't heard that.  

225
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,122
         You know me--          
    don't pay much attention    

226
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,790
                  to that       
                  kind of thing.

227
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:37,858
        Oh, yeah, right.        

228
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,477
         So what do you         
      think of it, anyway?      

229
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,763
        Well, you know,         
    you'd think that people     

230
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,532
     would have had enough      
     of silly love songs.       

231
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,219
    Bloody impressive, man.     

232
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,788
       Muzak to me ears.        

233
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,073
           Piss off.            

234
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,144
    Good bass part, though.     

235
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,413
 You know, Paul, I always said  

236
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,232
you're an inspired              
bass player.                    

237
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,767
             I am.              

238
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,570
      And I don't need you      

239
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,155
telling me that.                

240
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,351
   How's it doing in Britain?   

241
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,085
    The album's number one.     

242
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,255
             Good.              

243
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,240
          The single's          
      not coming out there      

244
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,641
     for a couple of weeks.     

245
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,444
   You never know in Britain.   

246
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,281
     It might get beat out      

247
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,384
    by the Bay City Rollers     
       or some odd thing.       

248
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,735
    We're getting old, mate.    

249
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,537
    Speak for yourself, dad.    

250
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,274
 I've still got me pretty face, 
            you see.            

251
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,908
         That you have.         

252
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,100
Are those the rosary beads      
they gave us                    

253
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,336
at Maharishi's                  
thingamajig?                    

254
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,937
Holiday camp?                   

255
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,622
          Japa beads.           

256
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,258
   Japa beads, rosary beads,    
           same thing           

257
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,177
different                       
religion.                       

258
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:10,784
  Om namah silly love songs   

259
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,269
         Om namah jet         

260
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,438
  One jet to always love me.  

261
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,906
      I knew it all along.      

262
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,107
       What? What's that?       

263
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,094
        You-- pretending        
   you didn't know me music.    

264
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,211
         Come on, Paul.         

265
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,048
You're the biggest bloody thing 
       since the Beatles.       

266
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,116
           Oh, them.            

267
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,601
Whatever                        
became of them?                 

268
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:30,571
        They all grew up        
      and became lawyers.       

269
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,776
        Can you believe         
  these bloody entrepreneurs?   

270
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,095
Old Sid Bernstein's             
offering us what?               

271
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,430
      What's it up to now?      

272
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,349
$210 million                    
to get back together.           

273
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:43,683
         It's obscene, isn't it?

274
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,985
It's amazing, really.           

275
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:48,022
They say we only have           
to perform together             
for 20 minutes.                 

276
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,724
Anything we want                
so long as we're                
all four together               

277
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,892
on the stage at once.           

278
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,128
        Yeah, right, just like  
        the old days, huh?      

279
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:57,097
              You know, we ought
              to take the money 

280
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,717
      and just stand there      
          looking grim          

281
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,319
 strumming out-of-tune chords.  

282
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,171
I wonder if it's                
in the contract                 

283
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:07,007
that we have to shake           
our heads about and smile.      

284
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,510
        No, there's more        
        money in it if we're    
        at each other's throats.

285
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:11,879
The battling Be-a-tles.         

286
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,680
               Yeah, back by    
               popular dementia.

287
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:23,807
        I heard you let         
your recording contract run out.

288
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,810
Somebody told me,               
in fact, that, uh...            

289
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,663
       you said you might       
   never make another record.   

290
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:32,666
   It's no skin off my teeth.   

291
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,101
Off your nose,                  
you mean?                       

292
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,269
                No, off me back.

293
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,569
You're not serious.             

294
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:37,771
            No skin off me back?

295
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,906
No, I mean about...             

296
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,340
        You thought it was nose.

297
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,208
        Seriously, John.        

298
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,192
        Seriously, Paul.        

299
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:42,960
             What?              

300
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:43,777
             What?              

301
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:48,164
      I just want to know       
what's up with you, that's all. 

302
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,293
 You know, I'm out there making 
the rounds, talking to the press

303
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,430
     and the one question       
     they inevitably ask--      

304
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,864
        it never fails--        

305
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,368
             is, "Paul, will the
             Beatles be getting 
             back together?"    

306
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,536
                    You know    
                    what I mean?

307
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,637
              No.               

308
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,838
                       I'm sick 
                       and tired

309
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,674
      of having to answer       
   that stupid old question.    

310
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,643
 And-and-and the other thing... 

311
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,896
look, just tell them to grow up,
get on with their own lives     

312
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,164
stop living                     
in the past.                    

313
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,165
It's simple                     
enough.                         

314
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,251
    Yeah, that's easy enough    
         for you to say         

315
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,219
                  being shut    
                  off from the  
                  world and all.

316
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,520
           Believe me           

317
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,039
                      they don't
                      let up.   

318
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,245
            Besides             

319
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,082
                  they're always
                  going on about
                  the two of us 

320
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,285
       being in some kind       
       of horrible feud.        

321
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,723
    Like we're the bleedin'     
Hatfields and McCoys, you know? 

322
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:05,576
 Look, Paul, let's not be coy,  
           all right?           

323
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,926
If you've                       
come here                       

324
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,446
to reunite the Beatles,         
you can turn right back around. 

325
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,947
          Oh, hang on.          

326
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,250
       You don't honestly       
        think I came...         

327
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,451
Look, I don't care              

328
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,468
           you know.            

329
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,771
    I've given up the game,     
        all right, Paul?        

330
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,624
You know, I've been             
under contract to one           
wanker or another               

331
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,459
   since I was 19 years old,    
           you know.            

332
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,728
  I've finally gotten control   
        of me own life.         

333
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,097
I'm not                         
giving that up.                 

334
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,471
     Look, I'm going to go      
        into the kitchen        

335
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,973
   and get something to eat.    

336
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,474
    If you'd like to join me    

337
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,776
that would                      
be fine.                        

338
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:43,264
If you want to sit here and hum 
"It's Been a Hard Day's Night"  

339
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,100
        to your heart's content,
        that's fine as well.    

340
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,802
  Macrobiotic popcorn, is it?   

341
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,789
 Yeah... certified by the pope. 

342
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,629
                    There he is.

343
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:17,647
         (<i> chuckling</i> ):         
          Hello, Sean.          

344
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:21,285
      Oh, he's a handsome       
         little devil.          

345
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,657
    Is this why you retired?    

346
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:30,944
 You still carrying that woman  
       across the river?        

347
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,412
          Come again?           

348
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,798
 Listen, will you shake this up 
          for a while?          

349
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,100
I've got an important phone call
            to make.            

350
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,968
            Will you shake<i> this</i> 
            up for a while?     

351
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,271
Yeah, I would,                  
but Yoko took the tweezers.     

352
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,772
                    What woman? 

353
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,309
Two zen monks were              
walking together                

354
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,244
   when they came to a river.   

355
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,879
       A beautiful woman        
       stood on the shore       

356
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,250
         and asked them         
if they would carry her across. 

357
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,703
            Of course, the monks
            weren't supposed    

358
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,304
                    to associate
                    with females

359
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,440
        but, nevertheless, one  
        of the monks carried her

360
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:01,608
            across the river.   

361
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:04,378
            Later, after walking
            many more miles     

362
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,596
     the first monk turns--     
        15-12, please--         

363
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,466
      the first monk turns      
  to the second monk and says   

364
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,870
  "I can't believe you carried  
  that woman across the river"  

365
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,337
    and the second monk says    

366
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,440
    "Are you still carrying     
  that woman across the river?  

367
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,409
I put her down a long time ago."

368
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,313
      Oh... tell me more,       
        oh, wise master.        

369
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,315
         Tell me more.          

370
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,316
           Hey, June.           

371
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,018
         Yeah, it's me.         

372
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,655
Listen, is everything all right?

373
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,656
         Yeah, I know.          

374
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,124
    Yeah, I got the message.    

375
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,193
       Well, tell mother        
       to give me a ring        

376
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,729
       when she's through       
    taking care of business     

377
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,730
           will you?            

378
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,414
                        Yeah.   

379
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:44,050
                Yeah, you know, 
                I'm fine, yeah. 

380
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,385
                Listen, will you

           of course,           
    it helps to have Linda.     

634
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,681
          How is she?           

635
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,815
She's great.                    

636
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,883
                    Yeah?       
Yeah.                           

637
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:21,884
                And the kids?   

638
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,386
     Great. They're great.      

639
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,954
     Back at the hotel now.     

640
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,157
    We're bringing the girls    
      with us on the tour.      

641
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,175
Did you know that?              

642
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,260
Yeah, so we can have            

643
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,777
 some semblance of family life. 

644
00:35:31,812 --> 00:35:34,046
 That's actually what I'm doing 
        here in America         

645
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:35,514
  checking out houses to rent.  

646
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:40,570
   Do you want to hear a song   
I wrote for Stella, me youngest?

647
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,789
              No.               

648
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,244
     Were you born a prick?     

649
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,313
              Yep.              

650
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,953
     (<i> playing slow music</i> )     

651
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,856
                My old man died.

652
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,273
             What?              

653
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,959
           Recently.            

654
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,828
           Get away.            
         I didn't hear.         

655
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:11,884
      The bastard croaked       
      on April Fool's day.      

656
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,653
             Whoa.              

657
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,522
This is a bit spooky, isn't it? 

658
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,157
I mean,                         
our mothers died                

659
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,159
pretty close together           
in time.                        

660
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:22,028
             Yeah.              

661
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,096
What about you?                 

662
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,064
Where you there                 
when your dad...?               

663
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,750
The last I remember hearing, you
 kicked him out of your house.  

664
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,284
      Told him to get lost      
         or something.          

665
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,570
             Yeah.              

666
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,906
     It was his own fault.      

667
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,175
      Deciding to reappear      
  right when I'm in the middle  

668
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,478
 of doing primal bloody scream  
       therapy, you know?       

669
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,531
     It felt good, though.      

670
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,869
   Telling him to get stuffed   
       right to his face.       

671
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,838
      Strange, you know...      

672
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,341
     just before he died,       
     we spoke on the phone      

673
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,245
  and I actually heard myself   
       apologize to him.        

674
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,014
      I knew he was dying       

675
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,850
    so we were able to talk,    
            you know            

676
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,585
      before he kicked it.      

677
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:05,088
 It's good I got some warning.  

678
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,857
            I mean,             
   otherwise me last contact    

679
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,226
  would have been "piss off."   

680
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:13,329
 It sounds like-- I don't know  
   if you'd take it this way    

681
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,298
       but it sounds like       
        you forgave him.        

682
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,733
            Well...             

683
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,001
   what's to forgive, Macca?    

684
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,572
  I mean, he wasn't my father,  
            was he?             

685
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,841
     Not in any real sense.     

686
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,742
       He was a drifter.        

687
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,111
    He got drunk one night,     
         staggered home         

688
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,047
    and stuck it to his wife    
     before he passed out.      

689
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,649
   That was Freddie Lennon's    

690
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,985
     one great contribution     
         to fatherhood.         

691
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,355
  The rest was just misplaced   
    expectations on my part.    

692
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:54,887
     (<i> playing slow music</i> )     

693
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,622
                I never thought 
                you'd end up    

694
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,257
        with someone like Linda.

695
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,411
 What's that supposed to mean?  

696
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,430
        I always thought        
       you'd get yourself       

697
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,866
  a nice little English girl.   

698
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,804
      It's not necessarily      
      an insult, you know.      

699
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,407
    So what are you saying?     

700
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:17,243
 I'm just saying that I thought 
     I knew you pretty well     

701
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:20,413
  and I was surprised when you  
took up with this American girl 

702
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,281
    and made her your wife,     
          that's all.           

703
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,800
    Maybe you didn't know me    
as well as you thought you did. 

704
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,801
                    Maybe, yeah.

705
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:29,338
   Maybe I didn't know myself   
        so well, either.        

706
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,907
  It took me by surprise, too.  

707
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:35,978
      She's the best thing      
   that ever happened to me.    

708
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,080
   So don't go knocking her.    

709
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:45,821
Like you accepted Yoko with love
   and respect from day one.    

710
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,256
You were a royal asshole, mate. 

711
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:50,776
         Oh, all right,         
       now, listen, John.       

712
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,160
     Oh, look, actually...      

713
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,662
            I want to say this.

00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,967
           (<i> sighs</i> )

       so-called friends        

716

      of grief back then.       

717
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,442
                She was the one 
                I chose to be   
                with, man.      

718
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,910
                    Couldn't you
                    see that?   

719
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,311
      How could I miss It?      

720
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,813
Listen, John                    

721
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,815
we were partners                
since we were kids.             

722
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,583
            Yeah? So I wasn't   
            a kid anymore.      

723
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,651
Neither was I.                  

724
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,153
I'm not saying                  
you shouldn't have              
been with her                   

725
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,988
but you brought her             
along with you                  

726
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,089
everywhere you went.            

727
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,425
She had her bleedin' bed        

728
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,226
brought into                    
the recording studio            

729
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,594
for God's sake.                 

730
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,848
  Look, Paul, when I met Yoko,  
      everything changed.       

731
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:32,651
      I couldn't care less      
      about being in some       

732
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,271
            little boy's club   
            anymore, you know?  

733
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,272
             Fine.              

734
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,090
 If you couldn't deal with Yoko 

735
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,125
      you had no business       
        dealing with me.        

736
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,695
     Well, that's just it;      
        where were you?         

737
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,363
    You bloody disappeared.     

738
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:47,032
        All of a sudden,        
  everything's John and Yoko.   

739
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,200
         Where's John?          

740
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,704
  You turned your back on us,   
           remember.            

741
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,274
Bloody right,                   
I was mad at her.               

742
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,675
I was really mad                
at you.                         

743
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,577
It was just easier              
to hate Yoko.                   

744
00:39:58,612 --> 00:39:59,845
       Oh, come on, Paul.       

745
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:03,349
You just wanted the game to go  
on a little longer, that's all. 

746
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:06,569
                With Beatle Paul
                at the controls.

747
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,921
     You know, getting all      
 the "A" sides of the singles.  

748
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:09,956
      Made to feel special      

749
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,707

                society friends 

750
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,741
    who thought "Yesterday"     

751
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,276
     was the greatest thing     
          we ever did.          

752
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,211
Damn right, I was getting       
all the "A" sides               

753
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:17,480
'cause who else                 
was coming up

competition?                    

755
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,283
It sure as hell wasn't you, and 
that was a group decision.      

756
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,018
        You were worried that   
        I was going to close

759
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,055
on your mind, remember?         

760
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,958
            You needed me 'cause
            you were afraid     

761
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,058
        of being on your own;   

762
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,694
            that everyone       
            would finally see   

763
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,929
        who was the real brains 
        behind the Beatles.     

764
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,798
The real brains?                
Oh, that's a laugh.             

765
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,299
Obviously,                      
I didn't need you.              

766
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,802
I'm doing quite well            
without you now, aren't I?      

767
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:40,803
Yeah.                           
                        Yeah.   

768
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,506
            You and your        
            silly love songs.   

769
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,377
You're making cotton candy, man.

770
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,630
            Nobody takes you    
            seriously anymore.  

771
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:52,931
          Bloody hell.          

772
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,301
     At least I'm working.      

773
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:58,153
Not sagging off,                
sitting all day                 

774
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,039
      watching the telly        
      in some ivory tower       

775
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,175
  letting me life pass me by.   

776
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,428
        You don't know.         

777
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,595
           Screw you.           

778
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,065
   You think I'd rather form    
      meself a pop group?       

779
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,884
        See me face on the      
        cover of<i> Rolling Stone.</i> 

780
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,087
            You know, sell out  

781
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:16,389
     Madison Square Garden      

782
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,891
 just to prove that I can still 
           get it up.           

783
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:20,426
    I've got a son to raise.    

784
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,828
 If you want to waste your time 
     singing nursery rhymes     

785
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,830
            trying to hold on   
            to your fading youth

786
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:29,018
it's no skin off my teeth, mate.

787
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,124
        Look... John...         

788
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:43,098
    I realize how much Yoko     
          meant to you          

789
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:46,168
and still means                 
to you                          

790
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:51,473
and I'm sorry                   
for the way                     
I treated her.                  

791
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,176
    But don't you understand    
      what was happening?       

792
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,779
         Enlighten me.          

793
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,748
  That was a hard time for me.  

794
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,483
    When we were breaking up    

795
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,352
  and I was trying to hold it   
          all together          

796
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,756
and you were spending           
all your time with Yoko.        

797
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,830
    I felt like I was losing    
         me best mate.          

798
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,516
              Who?              

799
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,490
              You.              

800
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:27,042
We were never that close, mate. 

801
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:38,954
  You arrogant, lying bastard.  

802
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,590
      Do you have any idea      
         what it took?          

803
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,092
You have any idea why I'm here? 

804
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,261
         I don't know.          

805
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,828
       Why are you here?        

806
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,332
     I mean, you come over      
     uninvited, unannounced     

807
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,700
 after God knows how many years 

808
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,502
  and I'm supposed to be happy  
          to see you?           

809
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:56,906
                This isn't      
                Liverpool, pal. 

810
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,340
  I don't want you dropping by  

811
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,175
  like it's the good old days,  
            got it?             

812
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,878
      Fine. Then I'm off.       

813
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,647
             Fine.              

814
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,804
         (<i> door slams</i> )         

815
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,427
        Please take me back up. 

816
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,729
    Yes, sir.                   

817
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,221
                    You know... 

818
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:04,256
        What?                   

819
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,423
                        What?   

820
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,816
Where you going?                

821
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,626
Come on.                        

822
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,901
        You're a real piece     
        of work, you know that? 

823
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:45,147
            What do you say     
            we go for a walk?   

824
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,182
What?                           
Out there?                      

825
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,451
                    Yeah.       

826
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,119
                    Why not?    

827
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,454
                We could both do

828
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,524
            with some fresh air,
            don't you think?    

829
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,059
All right.                      

830
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,828
Suppose I ought to show you     
around some here.               

831
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,863
Yeah. New York's cool, you know.

832
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,566
         Nobody's going         
  to hassle us here, are they?  

833
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,468
       Uh... right, uh...       

834
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,838
    what... what day is it?     

835
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,990
           Saturday.            

836
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,178
     Saturday, the... 18th.     

837
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:20,465
         No, the 24th,          
         you pillock.           

838
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,607
      Listen, is it going       
       to be a problem--        

839
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,442
      the two of us being       
      out there together        

840
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,027
            you know, getting   
            recognized          

841
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,929
       and all that crap?       

842
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,731
         Maybe for you.         
 I gave that all up, remember?  

843
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,266
        They don't care         
       about me anymore.        

844
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,601
           Oh, yeah.            

845
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,202
   That's a load of rubbish.    

846
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,870
   They don't care about you.   

847
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,573
       Right, here we go.       

848
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:45,608
              No.               

849
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:46,609
           It's okay.           

850
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:47,610
             Good.              

851
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,844
       Right. No problem.       

852
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,295
     What's that all about?     

853
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,531
     It's Yoko's ephemeris.     

854
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:54,817
You know, I don't know          
much about it, really.          

855
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,051
It's more Yoko's thing.         

856
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,686
  I do know it works, though.   

857
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,422
      I mean, we couldn't       
   have had Sean without it.    

858
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,324
Did you know that Sean was born 

859
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,193
 on exactly the same day as me, 
        October the 9th?        

860
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:06,662
       Yeah, I knew that.       

861
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,397
 What were you doing just now?  

862
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,648
                What were you   
                looking up?     

863
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,417
  Uh, I was making sure that    
  Mercury isn't in retrograde   

864
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:13,518
     you know what I mean?      

865
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:15,787
  That's one of the few things  
        I do know about.        

866
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:17,689
     Mercury in retrograde      
        spells trouble.         

867
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:18,857
           Look out.            

868
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:21,393
       You're better off        
      just staying in bed.      

869
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:22,661
            And it's okay now?  

870
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,147
    There's no great danger     
      in us going outside?      

871
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,833
As far as I can tell, you know. 

872
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,534
     I mean, I could throw      
          the<i> I Ching</i>           

873
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,236
    to be on the safe side,     
           you know.            

874
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:32,404
            See what it says.   

875
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:34,039
    This is starting to get     

876
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:35,707
a bit complicated,              
isn't it?                       

877
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:36,741
          Not really.           

878
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,377
 I mean, you know, it's easier  

879
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,111
 than making up your own mind.  

880
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,533
     All the same, though,      
  I do think we ought to wear   

881
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,401
    some kind of disguises,     
           you know.            

882
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,603
      The two of us being       
      out there together.       

883
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,338
It's like we're asking          
for trouble.                    

884
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,407
I've got a whole closetful

1008

        You have a problem with 
        authority, pal?         

1009

        No, sir, officer.<i> Nein.</i>

00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,751

1015

        was here has ended.     

1016

    Yes.

                You two keep out
                of trouble.     

1018
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,466
Yes, sir.                       

1019
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:38,970
 I wouldn't venture too far off 
  into the park if I was you.   

1020
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,638
Oh, why?                        

1021
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:44,008
    A lot of crazies out there, 
    if you know what I mean.    

1022
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,745
       Come on, Francis.        

1023
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:53,302
                        So long.

1024
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,903
            Cheerio, Francis.   

1025
00:52:58,058 --> 00:52:59,490
            What's got into you?

1026
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:03,828
Here now, Paul.                 

1027
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:06,531
You should have told me         
you were carrying.              

1028
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,366
                Weren't we just 
                smoking this?   

1029
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,469
            And I tried giving  
            you the look.       

1030
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,805
                Then you started
                with the...     

1031
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,673
                was that funny? 

1032
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:20,044
        (<i> with German accent</i> ): 
        Fortunately, all's      
        well that ends well.    

1033
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,181
        (<i> with normal voice</i> ):  
        And luckily for us      

1034
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,683
            they were pretty    
            harmless, those two.

1035
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:26,684
                    Yeah, right.

1036
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,785
        Like the harmless cop   

1037
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:29,454
            who drove his       
            harmless little car 

1038
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,555

1039
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:32,724
        He was pretty harmless  
        as well, wasn't he?     

1040
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:33,858
        They're all bastards.   

1041
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:34,926
Oh, come on, John.              

1042
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,394
You're living                   
in the past.                    

1043
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,330
One cop in Liverpool            
20 years ago                    

1044
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:41,266
        has got nothing to do   
        with those two just now.

1045
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,734
Look, cops is cops.             

1046
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,386
New York or Liverpool.          

1047

        You're just exploiting  
        them as scapegoats      

1048
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:51,309
    for all your repressed      
    and pent-up anger... son.   

1049
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,028
        Piss off.               

1050
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,481
            You know I'm right. 

1051
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:59,951
                    Come on.    

1052
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:16,818
Have you given any thought      
to this trepanning thing?       

1053
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,955
                    What is it? 

1054
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,222
    Trepanning.                 

1055
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,357
I'm thinking                    
of getting it done.             

1056
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,293
            Never heard of it.  

1057
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,195
Well, do you think              
you'd want to do it?            

1058
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,964
            Well, what<i> is</i> it?   

1059
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,733
Well, technically,              
what they do                    

1060
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,752
            is they take this   
            cylindrical saw     

1061
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,987
        and they position it    
        on the top of your skull

1062
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,722
            and they, sort of,  
            drill this hole     

1063
00:54:37,758 --> 00:54:38,890
            which is very small 

1064
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,593
    and it's supposed to relieve
    the pressure on your brain. 

1065
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:43,595
        'Cause the theory is--  

1066
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,663
    Get away.                   

1067
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,798
            No, look, I know    
            this guy-- a doctor.

1068
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,199
        He knows how to do it.  

1069
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:50,835
        The theory is that our  
        skulls are too tight    

1070
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,570
                and create too  
                much pressure   

1071
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:54,539
            and that's why we're
            all so uptight.     

1072
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:55,840
                    I mean, this
                    is something

1073
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,042
                that the ancient
                Egyptians used  
                to do, you know.

1074
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,243
Okay. All right.                

1075
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:00,545
                They've dug up  
                these mummies   

1076
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,514
            and there's actual  
            evidence of this    
            trepanning.         

1077
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,015
    Mmm.                        

1078
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,717
                The Indians     
                did it, as well.

1079
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:06,785
            In Peru, I think.   

1080
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,085
            They used to believe

1081
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:10,755
            that all the evil   
            spirits could       
            be released         

1082
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,124
            through this little 
            hole in your head.  

1083
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:15,360
You're not seriously thinking   
of having this done?            

1084
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,994
                    Yeah, I am. 

1085
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,996
                    That's what 
                    I'm saying. 

1086
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:21,566
            You ought to have   
            it done, too.       

1087
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,669
            It's only a minor   
            surgical procedure. 

1088
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:25,704
        Mmm.                    

1089
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,409
        Look, you bring Linda,

           my hands.            

1124
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,925
    It's through that door,     
          on the left.          

1125
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,594
                Thank you.      

1126

   So, what else can I bring    
     for you this evening?      

1127
00:56:58,465 --> 00:57:01,499
   Uh, have you got any more    
 of that dark Italian chocolate 

1128
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:02,601
      from the other day?       

1129
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:03,602
Of course.                      

1130
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:04,969
    I'll have some of that.     

1131
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:05,970
Very good.

  Oh, he's great, Luigi, yeah.  

1141

     He's off with his mum      
 trying to find a suitable cow.

I'm just waiting for him        

1158

to get up his nerve.            

1159

 From the minute we walked in.

 Well, you know, there's always 
   the hurdle of nervousness    

1168
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,873
  but I've had great responses  
          everywhere.           

1169
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:24,709
       Even the press...

   seems to like me for once.

1190
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,517
 Of course, I like some things  

1191

   better than others, but...   

1192

at least.

      or anything, but...

       that you've been,        
     like, a big hero to me     

1208

        for a long time         

1209
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,185

to thank you.

and I hope you get over it.

It's not...                     
it's not a hero so much.        

1212
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,613
   It's more like, you know,    
      you saved me from...      

1213
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,833
Look, don't go nailing me       
to your cross, all right?       

1214

             Yeah.              

1215

one thing?

Do you agree                    
with that?                      

1247
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:05,770
Well, it's not really up to me. 

1248
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,272
What are you talking about?     
Course it is.                   

1249
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,572
You have an opinion,            
don't you?                      

1250
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:10,108
      Well... mmm... yeah.      

1251
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:12,026
        "Yeah"?                 

1252
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,127
Do you have an opinion?         

1253
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,562
                        You do. 
    Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.         

1254
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,581
Well, let's hear it.            

1255
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:17,648
Okay, well...                   

1256
01:02:17,684 --> 01:02:19,450
Do you think                    
that "Silly Love Songs"         

1257
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,768
by Paul McCartney               
and Wings                       

1258
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:22,536
is the number one song          
in America?                     

1259
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,538
        Well, if you...         

1260
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,941
  if you mean, do<i> I</i> like it...  

1261
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,710
     then I'd say, yeah...      

1262
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,044
sure, you know...               

1263
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,662
it's all right.                 

1264
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:33,581
I guess it's...                 

1265
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,216
     Okay, I think he could     
        do a lot better.        

1266
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,317
              Huh.              

1267
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,352
So, uh, you wouldn't            
personally regard it            

1268
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,088
as the number one song          
in America?                     

1269
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:41,506
No, I wouldn't                  
call it that.                   

1270
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,707
But, you know,                  
obviously                       

1271
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:44,108
enough people                   
are buying it                   

1272
01:02:44,143 --> 01:02:46,627
and requesting it               
at the radio station            

1273
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:49,246
    and that to, you know...    

1274
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:50,498
to make it                      
number one.                     

1275
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,566
      Mmm, well, let that       
      be a lesson to you.       

1276
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,185
             Yeah.              

1277
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,820
             What?              

1278
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,739
  Your opinion's worth shite.   

1279
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:03,094
     I'm sorry, I didn't...     

1280
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,078
I didn't mean...                

1281
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,312
No, don't say sorry.            

1282
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,849
You know, I'm just playing      
with you, all right?            

1283
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,717
            You know, you didn't
            do anything wrong.  

1284
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,285
             Right.             

1285
01:03:12,505 --> 01:03:14,923
Look...                         

1286
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,974
you know, just go out,          
have a good night.              

1287
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,543
Tell your girlfriend--          
you have a girlfriend, yeah?    

1288
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:21,996
            Sort of.            

1289
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,981
Well, you tell                  
your "sort of" girlfriend       

1290
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:26,017
that you "sort of" met          
one of the Beatles              

1291
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,418
and he turned out to be         
just as much of a bastard       

1292
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:29,954
    as anybody else.            

1293
01:03:31,323 --> 01:03:32,606
          Maybe more.           

1294
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,880
And don't be so hard            
on yourself, all right?         

1295
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,850
           O... okay.           

1296
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:45,503
        Dismissed.              

1297
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:47,154
            Thanks.             

1298
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,639
(<i> chuckling</i> ):                  
You're welcome.                 

1299
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,240
              Bye.              

1300
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:52,160
                        Uh, bye.
            Bye-bye.            

1301
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,730
    Bye-bye. Cheerio.           

1302
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,553
  Lennon: one, McCartney: nil.  

1303
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,423
    More chocolate,             
    that's what we need.        

1304
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:16,134
LENNON:                         
It's the bleedin'               
drama that irks me.             

1305
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,201
The indecisiveness.             

1306
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:19,069
I mean, make your move          
and get on with it.             

1307
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,371
            Why don't you       
            just ignore them?   

1308
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:21,739
I guarantee you,                
when he finally                 

1309
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,024
gets the nerve                  
to come over                    

1310
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,125
he won't                        
own up to it.                   

1311
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,276
It's going to be,               
"My Connie adores you"          

1312
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:28,445
or, "My Pamela                  
thinks you're fabulous."        

1313
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:29,614
                    My Heather  
                    likes you.  

1314
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:30,748
That, too, yeah.                

1315
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,433
     No, I mean<i> my</i> Heather.     

1316
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,635
  She thinks you're all right.  

1317
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,803
                No accounting   
                for taste       

1318
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,306
        but she's actually got  
        a bit of a crush on you.

1319
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,373
What, Linda's girl?             

1320
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,874
  Well, she's my Heather, too.  

1321
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,876
     I legally adopted her      
        a long time ago.        

1322
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,895
        How old is she?         

1323
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,248
          She's... 13.          

1324
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:51,552
        Can you believe I've got
        a teenage daughter, huh?

1325
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,920
                        Yeah.   

1326
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,225
                    Here she is.

1327
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,625
                That was taken  
                at the farm.    

1328
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,761
            That's her favorite 
            lamb there with her.

1329
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:01,762
This here a lamb?               

1330
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,097
                        Mm.     

1331
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,566
Did you serve                   
it up for supper?               

1332
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,101
        No, we're vegetarians.  

1333
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,369
            Did you know that?  

1334
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,004
                Yeah. We make   
                it a point      

1335
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,940
        not to eat anything     
        that has a face on it.  

1336
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,994
       Well, that's Mary.       

1337
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:18,696
      She's the bold one.       

1338
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:20,315
     Does Mary have a lamb?     

1339
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,483
It's just a little one, though. 

1340
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,920
      Uh-oh. Heartbreaker.      

1341
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,187
                    Let me see. 

1342
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,624
        Oh, yes. That's Stella. 

1343
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,258
She's adorable.                 

1344
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,660
                        Yeah.   

1345
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,428
And she's only four and a half. 

1346
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,364
         She's already          
      dead keen on horses.      

1347
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,269
   You're a lucky man, Paul.    

1348
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,605
     Got a whole stableful      
        of healthy kids.        

1349
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,939
             Yeah.              

1350
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,743
         We're thinking         
    of having maybe one more    

1351
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,210
      after the tour ends       

1352
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,546
       which is in, uh...       

1353
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,882
         oh, another...         

1354
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,617
          six months?           

1355
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,719
          I don't know          
     how you do it, Macca.      

1356
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,220
    I mean, let alone, why.     

1357
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,356
    Going on the road again     
       like the old days        

1358
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,558
       is the last thing        
    on earth<i> I'd</i> want to do.    

1359
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:05,659
                    Yeah, but   
                    see, for me 

1360
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,894
    it's just the opposite.     

1361
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,663
    See, Linda and the kids     
  are with me, which is great   

1362
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,799
          and the work          
  is what's keeping me going.   

1363
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,901
        I could never do        
     what you're doing now.     

1364
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:14,919
                Doing nothing.  

1365
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:16,053
                    I mean...

1367
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,475
        or, or whatever.        

1368
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:30,934
       Well, actually...        

1369
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,604
   actually, that's not true.   

1370
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,939
        When we split up        

1371
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:39,777
      and I was suddenly        
      out of a job, uh...       

1372
01:06:39,812 --> 01:06:41,929
                that's exactly  
                what I did do-- 

1373
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:43,931
                        nothing.

1374
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,282
Hmm.                            

1375
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:50,487
I was at the farm and           
at first I stopped washing.     

1376
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,556
Then I stopped shaving.         

1377
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,425
And then I just stopped         
getting out of bed.             

1378
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,264
I just used                     
to lay in bed                   

1379
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:02,900
for days on end                 

1380
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,401
and smoking                     
and drinking                    

1381
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:06,904
and watching                    
the telly.                      

1382
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,139
It was really awful.            

1383
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,912
            It's hard facing    
            yourself, isn't it? 

1384
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,480
       (<i> chair scrapes</i> )        

1385
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:19,400
The time                        
has come at last.               

1386
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:20,568
                    Excuse me.  

1387
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,903
I-I couldn't                    
help noticing...                

1388
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,072
    Yeah, I've been noticing    
         you noticing.          

1389
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:26,991
            Oh, yes. I'm afraid 
            we haven't been     

1390
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:28,559
    terribly discreet, you see. 

1391
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,127
This must be your lovely wife.  

1392
01:07:30,163 --> 01:07:31,378
                Hmm? Oh, yes.   

1393
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,780
How do you do?                  

1394
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,983
            Charmed, I'm sure.  

1395
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:37,367
                Yes, well, as   
                I was saying    

1396
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:38,936
                we-we couldn't  
                help noticing   

1397
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,854
that we happen                  
to be sitting                   

1398
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,991
in very close proximity         
to one of the Beatles           

1399
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:45,592
and I was wondering...          

1400
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,963
    that is, if it wouldn't be  
    too great an imposition     

1401
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:52,517
if I might persuade you         
to sing a few bars              

1402
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:54,785
of "Yesterday"                  
for my wife?                    

1403
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,037
        She's a, she's a very   
        big fan, you know.      

1404
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:00,941
     I'd be quite happy to      

1405
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:02,443
and perhaps, while I'm crooning 

1406
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:03,844
  you'd put on your wife's wig  

1407
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,779
       get on your knees        
      and lick my lingam?       

1408
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:12,486
            You should be       
            ashamed of yourself.

1409
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,671
          I am, yeah.           

1410
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,005
                    Come on.    

1411
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:43,217
    His poor wife.              

1412
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:45,119
                Do you know     
                how many times  

1413
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,954
                people have     
                come up to me   

1414
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,890
        and said that they      
        just love the Beatles   

1415
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:53,160
        and that their all-time 
        favorite Beatles song   

1416
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,463
                just happens to 
                be "Yesterday"? 

1417
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,466
            I ought to wear a   
            bleedin' placard    
            around me neck      

1418
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,602
            saying, "It's a Paul
            song. Piss off."    

1419
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,371
Yeah, he should                 
have asked you to sing          

1420
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:04,938
"Strawberry Fields"             
or "Imagine."                   

1421
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:05,939
                Damn right.     

1422
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,941
        Oh, yeah.               

1423
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,377
        I've always hated you   

1424
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:11,445
                for writing that
                bleedin' song.  

1425
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,347
You bloody well wish            
you'd written it.               

1426
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:15,383
            I could have written
            it better than you. 

1427
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:16,950
    Oh, yeah, like              
    you never tried.            

1428
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,852
Anyway, you would               
have bollixed it up             

1429
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,289
by having somebody              
screaming over the refrain.     

1430
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,957
        Oh, quit being so smug. 

1431
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,293
    Want one?                   

1432
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,461
        Yeah. It goes without   
        saying, doesn't it?     

1433
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,301
            Oh, my.             

1434

     you are just fabulous.     

1438
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,841

1439

        such a pleasure.

01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,494
                    Aw...       

1484
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,631
            You know you want   
            it, you tart.       

1485
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,799
Is my name Brian?               

1486
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,469
I got you, son.                 

1487
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,440
    Piss off.                   

1488
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,474
                    That's it.  
                    That's it.  

1489
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,577
        That's enough of that.  
        That's enough of that.  

1490
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,778
So, uh, how's Leeds?            

1491
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:58,779
            Leeds played away.  

1492
01:11:58,814 --> 01:11:59,780
                    Top of the  
                    division.   

1493
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:00,915
                Top of the      
                division, yeah. 

1494
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,917
Yeah, man united,               
man united doing well.          

1495
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,251
                Oh, very well,  
                very well, yeah.

1496
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,253
Yeah, yeah.                     

1497
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,255
                Coming down     
                the pub with us?

1498
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,256
                    Yeah?       

1499
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,824
                Fancy a pint?   

1500
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,253
    It's smaller than I         
    thought it would be.        

1501
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:23,754
     Hello!                   

1502
01:12:23,789 --> 01:12:25,356
Whose place is this?            

1503
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:29,493
     Remember the last time     
we stood on a rooftop together? 

1504
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:33,630
I'd like to thank you on behalf 
  of the group and ourselves.   

1505
01:12:33,665 --> 01:12:36,132
 I hope we passed the audition. 

1506
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:37,735
And so it was to be             
the last time                   

1507
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,636
      our beloved Beatles       
      would ever perform        

1508
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:41,137
      together in public.       

1509
01:12:41,173 --> 01:12:42,806
                The famous Apple
                rooftop session.

1510
01:12:42,842 --> 01:12:44,307
                Hey, this place 
                is huge. Look.  

1511
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:45,976
I really enjoyed that.          

1512
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,144
                Somewhere to    
                put the cows.   

1513
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:56,253
So what was the last            
song we ever played             
together then?                  

1514
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,588
          "Get Back."           

1515
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,540
      That's right, yeah.       

1516
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,743
           "Get Back            
  to Where You Once Belonged."  

1517
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,612
Got a smoke?                    

1518
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:11,752
        Oh, it's me last one.   

1519
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,754
That's all right,               
I don't mind.                   

1520
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,422
        I'll share it with you. 

1521
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:17,924
Remember we were hoping         
that the cops would             
actually arrest us              

1522
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,593
and carry us off                
while we were playing.          

1523
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:21,828
   Yeah, in the Black Maria.    

1524
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:40,781
                    (<i> sighs</i> )   

1525
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,349
Do you ever feel like           

1526
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,752
when you really get             
to the heart of it              

1527
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,787
that it's all                   
just an illusion?               

1528
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,591
  You know, the Buddhists say   

1529
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,993
that you've got to rid yourself 
     of all these illusions     

1530
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:55,796
  including the ultimate one,   
 which is this concept of self. 

1531
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,598
Do you know                     
how basic that is?              

1532
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,752
  All this pain is wrapped up   
        in this concept         

1533
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:05,222
        that this thing         
       called "I" exists.       

1534
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:08,458
And that                        
the real key                    

1535
01:14:08,493 --> 01:14:15,249
is in perceiving this...        
quiet reality                   

1536
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,987
that's... so much simpler       
than anything we can imagine.   

1537
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,392
   Mmm. Of course, you know,    
         my problem is          

1538
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:30,464
 the moment that I get a taste  
of this quiet reality, you know 

1539
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,148
my ego gets                     
all excited                     

1540
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:34,651
'cause I think I'm              
onto something big here.        

1541
01:14:34,687 --> 01:14:37,154
 The next great understanding,  
           John. Hey!           

1542
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:40,724
 Before I know it, my thoughts  
   are running the show again   

1543
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,226
 and I'm back conceptualizing,  
             and...             

1544
01:14:43,262 --> 01:14:45,612
I've got to learn               
how to stop meself earlier.     

1545
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:48,615
You know, I've got to learn     
how to control me thoughts.     

1546
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:51,251
            You got to learn how
            to share that smoke.

1547
01:14:57,943 --> 01:15:00,610
      Why does everything       
  have to be such a struggle?   

1548
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:02,896
    That's a good question.     

1549
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,332
  Then again, it's irrelevant.  

1550
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,286
    What?                       

1551
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,571
Do I contradict meself?         

1552
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:13,573
                    Frequently. 

1553
01:15:13,608 --> 01:15:15,075
Walt Whitman.                   

1554
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,244
                Walt Whitman?   

1555
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,611
    Yeah.                       

1556
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,513
    Do I contradict myself?     

1557
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:23,116
        Very well, then,        
      I contradict myself.      

1558
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:25,452
          "I am large.          
     I contain multitudes."     

1559
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,938
 So you've taken to memorizing  
 the works of the great poets   

1560
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:29,440
      have you now, John?       

1561
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:33,577
Touche, Paul.                   

1562
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:38,298
Just trying to recognize        
the possibilities, Paul.        

1563
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:42,303
    I remember the last time    

1564
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:45,455
                    I saw you   
                    out in L.A. 

1565
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:48,375
        during your so-called   
        "lost weekend" years.   

1566
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,378
        You remember? When you  
        and Yoko were separated.

1567
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:52,879
    No.                         

1568
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:55,081
        We ran in to each other 
        at Harry Nilsson's.     

1569
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,600
                        Come on.

1570
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,570
                We jammed with  
                Stevie Wonder   
                and all them.   

1571
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:02,639
        <i> We</i> did?                

1572
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:04,408
          (<i> laughing</i> )          

1573
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,909
    You were off your head.     

1574
01:16:05,944 --> 01:16:07,311
I was, yeah.                    

1575
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:08,645
           Obviously.           

1576
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:10,831
     Hmm... I've got, like,     
     fragments of memories.     

1577
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,166
       It's really hazy.        

1578
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:13,500
     Anyway, go on, though.     

1579
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,735
     Well, anyway, somebody     
    offered me some P.C.P.--    

1580
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:19,422
                Angel dust-- and
                it was kind of a
                new thing then  

1581
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:21,341
    so I said, "What is it?"    

1582
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:24,311
      He said, "It's, uh,       
it's elephant tranquilizer, man.

1583
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,979
      It's, like, primo."       

1584
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,931
            I said, "Oh, yeah?  

1585
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:29,633
      Have you tried it?"       

1586
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,535
   And he says, "Yeah, yeah."   

1587
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,338
  I said, "Oh, yeah. Is it...   
          is it fun?"           

1588
01:16:34,373 --> 01:16:35,839
         He says, "No."         

1589
01:16:35,874 --> 01:16:40,477
                And he's still  
                doing it.       

1590
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:46,800
    I mean, my question is--    
still is-- if it's not fun, why?

1591
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:55,726
        There's enough problems 
        as it is, you know.     

1592
01:16:55,761 --> 01:16:58,996
         I just wonder          
     how much of this pain      

1593
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,348
            you keep bringing   
            up is maybe--       

1594
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,667
 I may be wrong-- in your head. 

1595
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:08,405
        Because if it was a     
        real thing, a real fear 

1596
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,108
   I think you could face it    
        and get past it         

1597
01:17:11,143 --> 01:17:13,377
 and not let it run your life.  

1598
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:16,179
         Are you saying         
that my thoughts cause me pain? 

1599
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,898
             Yeah.              

1600
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,069
Well, that's what               
I'm trying to say.              

1601
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,903
            Yeah, but you're    
            still in your head  

1602
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,339
                even when you

                not thinking.   

1604
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,575
    Me?                         

1605
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,077
                    Yeah.       

1606
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,996
            You're just         
            afraid to let go,   
            like all of us      

1607
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:34,932
                to stop being   
                in control.     

1608
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:39,102
Yeah, so, I get in me own way   
to protect meself.              

1609
01:17:39,137 --> 01:17:41,939
    Yeah, but it's not always   
    dangerous, you know.        

1610
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:46,092
Like right now... this moment.  

1611
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,962
        You're relatively safe. 

1612
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,932
        I'm not going to do     
        anything to hurt you.   

1613
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,618
    I'm not going to leave you. 

1614
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:56,470
                All right?      

1615
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,830
All right, Paul, you want       
to play that game, do you?      

1616
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:12,135
Take a good look.               

1617
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,237
Tell me what you see.           

1618
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:22,479
I see a beautiful little boy    
whose mother says good-bye.     

1619
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:28,151
                I see the       
                same little boy 

1620
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:31,922
        blaming himself         
   for his father's mistakes    

1621
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:37,494
                telling himself 
                that everything 
                is his fault.   

1622
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:39,329
     I see this little boy      

1623
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:42,532
    believing that the world    
      is a dangerous place      

1624
01:18:42,568 --> 01:18:44,534
    and that there's nobody     

1625
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:47,136
       you can depend on        
        to protect you.         

1626
01:18:49,374 --> 01:18:51,658
            So you grow up      
            trying to pretend   

1627
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,660
                that ordinary   
                little things   

1628
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,780
don't scare the hell out of you,
          but they do.          

1629
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,950
                        I see...

1630
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,186
                my old friend   

1631
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:04,855
    who used to skip classes    

1632
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:07,257
     and wander off with me     
      to the old graveyard      

1633
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:11,577
        looking back at me now  
        still putting himself   

1634
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,431
      and me through hell.      

1635
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:22,472
   And I see a frightened man   

1636
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:26,109
      who doesn't realize       

1637
01:19:26,145 --> 01:19:28,128
            how beautiful he is.

1638
01:19:40,024 --> 01:19:42,559
    I'm sorry.                  

1639
01:19:42,594 --> 01:19:45,312
           For what?            

1640
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,938
For being such a tosser.        

1641
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:01,094
                Me, too, John.  

1642
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,463
                Me, too.        

1643
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:18,895
    You only get married once;  
    at least, I hope so.        

1644
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,698
            Now, the first time 
            I was here...       

1645
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:24,584
            I think I asked     
            for a center vent.  

1646
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,854
        I don't really see it.

1649
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,361

                partying.       

1650

        I found the right girl, 
        and I'm all set.        

1651
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:37,898
        I couldn't be happier.  

1652
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:38,932
        The suit is wonderful.  

1653
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,867
        There's just one thing  
        that would make me      

1654
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:42,368
        a little bit happier.   

1655
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:43,970
            About the pants...  

1656

    Hi. I'm Lorne Michaels,     
the producer of<i> Saturday Night.</i> 

1664
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,938
 Right now we're being seen by  
approximately 22 million viewers

1665
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,556
 but please allow me, if I may  

1666
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:22,142
       to address myself        
  to four very special people.  

1667
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:26,129
 John, Paul, George and Ringo-- 
          the Beatles.          

1668
01:21:26,164 --> 01:21:27,330
Hey. Wake up.                   
                Wha...? Wha...? 

1669
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:29,032
    Lately, there have been     
 a lot of rumors to the effect  

1670
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:30,266
He's talking to us.             
                Yeah?           

1671
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,868
      that the four of you      
might be getting back together. 

1672
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,169
      That would be great.      
                Not a chance.   

1673
01:21:33,204 --> 01:21:34,270
  In my book, the Beatles are   

1674
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:35,438
         the best thing         
  that ever happened to music.

         JOHN AND PAUL:         
      What is he on about?      

1676
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:37,957
 It goes even deeper than that. 

1677
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,293
You're not just a musical group,
      you're a part of us.

1680
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:43,380
    And it's for this reason    

1681
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:44,814
     that I'm inviting you      
     to come on our show.

     (<i> audience laughing</i> )      

1683
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,519
 Now we've heard and read a lot 
       about personality        

1684
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:51,687
 and legal conflicts that might 
prevent you guys from reuniting.

1685
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:52,872
What is he talking about?       
                        What?   

1686
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:54,508
 That's something which is none 
        of my business.         

1687
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,909
            What? Personality   
            conflicts?          
Misinformed.

   will have to handle that.    

1689
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,146
  But it's also been said that  

1690
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,482
 no one has yet to come up with 
  enough money to satisfy you.  

1691
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:03,783
    Yeah.

 Well, if it's money you want,  
    there's no problem here.
