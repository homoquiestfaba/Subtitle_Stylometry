Welcome back to Channel Four
Sparks News.

10
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,553
This is Wanda reporting.

11
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,287
And today is everybody's
favorite day.

12
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,122
- No pants day.
- Yeah!

13
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,324
No pants day!

14
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,125
Hey, everybody. I'm here.

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,596
Reporting from
Sparks Nuclear site.

16
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,664
And let me tell you guys,

17
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:39,366
there is a chilly,
cold front coming in.

18
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,468
Yeah, alright now,
that's enough of that.

19
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,637
Oh, sorry.

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,237
- Movie! Movie!
- Put a movie on.

21
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,921
- It's fake.
- No way.

22
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,514
Totally fake.
Tons of evidence.

23
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,148
Yeah, like what?

24
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,885
Like the American flag waving
in zero gravity.

25
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,287
There's no air in the atmosphere
on the moon.

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,690
Therefore, no winds
to make the flag blow.

27
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,224
- Fuck.
- Fuck is right.

28
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,468
And there's, like,
ten other things

29
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,260
that I... I won't
get into with you.

30
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,272
No, no, come on, get into it.
What is it? What else?

31
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,532
No, it's... it's too scientific.

32
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,901
Just trust me, okay?
The moon landings fake.

33
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,136
That's why you won't tell me,
because I'm a cat?

34
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,206
Look, if you want
to learn more about it,

35
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,808
there's books and shit.

36
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:24,311
- You know I can't read.
- Yeah, then that's why.

37
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,413
Because you're a cat
who can't read.

38
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,549
If you were a cat
who could read,

39
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,586
then you could learn things
and we could discuss more.

40
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,253
Oh, like what, about science

41
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,732
because I know a lot
about science, okay?

42
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,490
I know more than you,
I could teach you

43
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,692
about science, mister.

44
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,426
- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,929
I was raised in a fucking lab,
you asshole, okay?

46
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:44,899
- I was... I was experimented on.
- Sorry.

47
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,634
Yeah, this is the whole reason

48
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,636
why I have so
many health issues.

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,648
- Okay, don't freak out.
- So thanks for bringing that up.

50
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,483
- I'm just saying.
- I am not freaking.

51
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,217
- Okay? I am a talking cat.
- I can't do this right now.

52
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,843
Oh, and you... and you all...

53
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:59,614
Oh, you think you're so hot,
you survived and shit.

54
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,549
Oh! Oh, you are...
Oh! Oh, look at us.

55
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,618
Oh, we are... Oh, we are
the last people on earth.

56
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,721
Oh, we're so special.
None of you are special.

57
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,222
Special my ass. You're sterile.

58
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,258
You're all sterile,
everyone of you is sterile.

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,326
I bet half of you
can't get it up even.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,763
Yeah, yeah. That's what I bet.
You can't get it up.

61
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:18,298
Whereas I am
the last animal on earth

62
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,835
with even a shred of fertility.

63
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,004
So suck it.

64
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,672
You know what?
Fuck you, Donald.

65
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,508
When we found you,
you were malnourished,

66
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,812
you were dehydrated, you had an
eye infection, an ear infection,

67
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,580
a fucking urinary
tract infection.

68
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,816
You had diarrhea, fucking fleas.

69
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,820
You probably had cat aids, okay?
We saved your butt.

70
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,688
So how about a little
more gratitude

71
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,824
and a little less cattitude?

72
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:44,357
Oh, you don't like my cattitude?

73
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,894
- No.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Daniel.

74
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,495
Did I hurt your little feelings?

75
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,907
- No, shut up.
- I will scratch your

76
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,608
- fucking eyes out.
- I... I... I got to go.

77
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,534
I got fucking radio.

78
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,603
Oh, look, come on,
come back here, you coward.

79
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,738
I want to hear about

80
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,606
- the moon landing.
- Shut up.

81
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,450
I want to hear about it with
the moon and the fake and...

82
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,476
Come on! Danny?

83
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,479
You know, you're a little mouse.
A scared little mouse.

84
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,548
- Shut the fuck up.
- Dan!

85
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,282
You're a mouse.

86
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,928
- You're a scared little mouse.
- Shut up.

87
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,720
- That's what you are.
- No, you...

88
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,822
Are you going to follow me
all the way to the radio?

89
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,692
- I got stuff to...
- Danny! Daniel! Danny!

90
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,761
Dan!

91
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,362
Come on, Danny.

92
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,766
Come on, Danny boy.
Danny, Danny, Daniel. Sorry.

93
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,567
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Donald's sorry.

94
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:27,902
Donald's so sorry.

95
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,077
Who touched my cream corn?

96
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,278
Daniel? Donald?

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,416
- Hi, Kate.
- Did you eat my cream corn?

98
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,886
- No.
- Donald?

99
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,023
- Hi, Crazy! I don't eat corn.
- But you can see in the dark.

100
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,391
So did you see who
did eat my cream corn?

101
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,061
Oh, it's like every week
with your blow ups.

102
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,030
Everyone's out to get you, Kate.

103
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,608
What was it the last week?
The Lululemon sweats?

104
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,942
And then what,
the week before that,

105
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,401
with the thousand
island dressing, huh?

106
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,704
Who would eat
your salad dressing, Kate?

107
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,707
And then you want me to figure
it out with my cat powers,

108
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,111
like I'm some sort of gypsy,
psychic or something.

109
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:14,447
So, no, Kate, I did not eat
your fucking cream corn,

110
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,584
and I don't know who did.

111
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,385
I think Donald
ate your cream corn.

112
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,854
- Fucking Donald!
- Yes, I did.

113
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,623
I ate your cream corn.
I ate the cream corn.

114
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:23,891
And the other stuff?

115
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,626
I did.
I ate the thousand island.

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,403
I had nothing to do
with the Lululemon, though.

117
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,096
Ah, so I guess it's fine.

118
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,074
You're just eating my food,
but you don't touch my stuff.

119
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:36,403
Oh... Oh, and you named me
Donald Pump, so fuck you.

120
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,506
He's the one that ruined
the world, remember?

121
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,373
And the reason
that we're all in this mess.

122
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,375
And you go ahead
and name me after him.

123
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,845
A really good move, okay?

124
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,847
So every once in a while
I eat something, right?

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,516
And it might be yours.
Who cares? Big fucking deal.

126
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,417
At least I didn't name you

127
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,986
after the shit
who ended the world.

128
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,421
You got light,
fluffy yellow hair.

129
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,423
What do you want?
The name seemed to fit.

130
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,560
And everyone liked it,
so it stuck.

131
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,629
Live with it.

132
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,800
All of my nine lives,
I live with it every day.

133
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,670
So fuck you
and fuck you, fuckers.

134
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,406
- I love that guy.
- Yeah, where is everyone?

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,775
I don't know.

136
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,777
- Not here.
- Not here?

137
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,579
Daniel!

138
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,881
What?

139
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:21,649
Nothing.

140
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,017
Did you miss me?

141
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,452
I just saw you,
like, an hour ago.

142
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:29,857
Okay, in the hour
that you hadn't seen me,

143
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,125
did you think about me?

144
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,060
Did you think,
"Oh, where's Kate?

145
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:36,396
I wonder where Kate is.
Oh, I'd love to see Kate."

146
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,733
So you missed me.

147
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,835
I guess.

148
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,206
Okay, just the next time a girl
asks you, just fucking lie

149
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,874
- and say yes, okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

150
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,743
No, you're... you're
totally right. I'm sorry.

151
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,146
It's just my residual
nerd awkwardness.

152
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,482
I, uh, wasn't so popular
with the ladies before,

153
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,761
so now that I'm getting a
little female attention, it's...

154
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,220
- Oh, are you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,689
And, you know,
it's just I'm still not so great

156
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:05,458
- with the girls.
- No, you're not.

157
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,562
Thank God you have a big dick.

158
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,635
I mean, it's great being alive

159
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,647
with the last group of people
on earth and everything.

160
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,073
But if no one had a big dick,
I'd have fucking killed myself.

161
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,841
I have...

162
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,210
- You saved me, Dan-Dan.
- I have a big dick?

163
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:26,047
- Biggest one in the group.
- Oh, so technically,

164
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,481
the biggest dick
in the world, right?

165
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:33,054
You have the biggest
fucking dick in all of mankind.

166
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,723
Hey, who's got a big dick?

167
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,995
- Hey.
- Not you.

168
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,040
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Daniel, what's up, man?

169
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,732
You're on radio watch.

170
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,634
- Anything?
- I heard from your mom.

171
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,070
She wanted to know if you were
still wearing panties again.

172
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,805
You guys honestly think
I wouldn't tell you

173
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,840
if a fucking radio
message came in?

174
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,009
Oh, yeah.
One did come in yesterday.

175
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,277
Did I forget to tell you?

176
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,713
I heard from some people
in fucking Fiji,

177
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,915
and they wanted to
know if we'd come visit.

178
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,851
Uh, tell them no, okay?
Well, I'm going.

179
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,019
- Ass face.
- Yeah.

180
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,921
- Kate, Kate.
- Come on.

181
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:11,025
- I'll miss you.
- Oh, he's learning.

182
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,793
That was sweet.

183
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,596
- Say hi to your mom.
- I'm an orphan.

184
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,799
- Me too.
- Me three. Come on.

185
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,635
Shit. Fucking...

186
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,144
So, uh,

187
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,713
who's got a big dick?

188
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,049
I don't know, do you?

189
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,284
Well, you tell me.

190
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:42,690
- Um, average, below average.
- Oh, no, no.

191
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,725
No, that's... It's big. It's big.

192
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,161
Oh, I love your dick.

193
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,730
It's such a cutie, tiny-mighty.

194
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,099
Tiny-mighty?
I'll show you tiny-mighty.

195
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,068
Oh, you better. Come.

196
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,706
I need something little...

197
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,142
Okay, you guys
are making out, alright.

198
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,614
Oh, hey, do you want
to stick it in my ass?

199
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,849
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

200
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,752
Yeah!

201
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,321
Get in there.

202
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,090
- Get in there.
- Jesus Christ cat!

203
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,959
You want a piece of me, huh?

204
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,762
What do...
What do you want, Donald?

205
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,732
Well, Kate, uh,
I found your Lululemon.

206
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,767
Here it is,
it kind of smells a little bit

207
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,936
because I've been
sleeping on it for a week.

208
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,839
Sort of smells like... like ass,

209
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,908
which I know you love, huh?

210
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,910
You bitch!

211
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,078
Bitch!

212
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,914
You fucker!

213
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,183
- Kate!
- I can't, I can't with this cat.

214
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,085
I fucking hate him.
Can we just get rid of him?

215
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,820
I mean, of all the cats,
a kleptomaniac?

216
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,689
Come on, Kate, we just
found them two weeks ago.

217
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,267
We're all getting used
to each other. Come on.

218
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,893
He gets pent up
when we go to sleep at night.

219
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:56,030
We're all pent up here.
I don't steal your shit.

220
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,666
You're wearing
my Metallica shirt.

221
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,368
- Oh, is that yours?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:04,738
And yes, I want to
stick it in your ass.

223
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,242
Oh, my God! Oh, God.

224
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,778
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, are you making out?

225
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,813
Oh, he was just about to
put it in my ass.

226
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,849
But you're my boyfriend.

227
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,827
There are no more boyfriends
and girlfriends here, Wanda.

228
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,820
I know, Adam,
but you're still my boyfriend.

229
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,288
Go ahead, fuck her ass.

230
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:24,925
- Wanda, stop, I'm sorry.
- This is Steve.

231
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,230
- Who?
- Hi, y'all.

232
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,665
He's a talking grasshopper.
I just found him.

233
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,034
- He's so cute and small.
- Yo, I'm right here.

234
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,203
Don't talk about me
in third person, okay?

235
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,908
Right. Sorry. Uh, you can talk.
That's so cool.

236
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,743
How is it like being a cricket?

237
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,846
- What did she call me?
- A cricket.

238
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,982
I'm no cricket, bitch.
I'm a grasshopper.

239
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,151
Well, aren't they
the same thing?

240
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,819
- This monkey is ignorant.
- Huh!

241
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,088
Yo, Steve, calm down, okay?

242
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,756
You can't go
calling people Monkeys.

243
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,025
Oh, why? People and
monkeys are different?

244
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,928
- You look the same to me.
- Alright, I get it. I get it.

245
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,963
No, no. Crickets are lazy,
dumb as fuck.

246
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,098
And all dead, by the way.

247
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,100
Us grasshoppers, we're smart

248
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,868
and damn handsome
if I say so myself.

249
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:11,172
Thriving, even in these
unfortunate circumstances.

250
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,808
We're all over the place.
How many of you around?

251
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,944
Okay, just... What's that joke?

252
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,713
A grasshopper walks into a bar
and the bartender is like,

253
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,815
hey, what's... Is that your name?

254
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,751
What? What's that
supposed to mean?

255
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,886
- Nothing.
- Come on, Steve.

256
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,789
Let's leave these monkeys
to fuck each other in the ass.

257
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,134
Yeah, that's weird, yo. You got
some weird ass friends, Wanda.

258
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,460
I know, but they're all I got.

259
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,167
A talking grasshopper!

260
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,869
So cute.

261
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,771
Now where were we?

262
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,706
- Monkey stuff?
- Yeah.

263
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,250
Seriously, will you just
say I have a big dick?

264
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,153
What?
What's with the penis envy?

265
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,322
Just strange you want
a big dick is all, I don't...

266
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,224
I don't know.
Maybe all women do.

267
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,726
Why is it strange
that I'd want a big dick?

268
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,829
Because, you know, Hips McGee,
it seems like it would hurt.

269
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,431
No, it feels great.

270
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,968
Daniel fucks and fucks me
like Tarzan, and it's amazing.

271
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:15,812
- No fuck for you.
- Wait, hold on.

272
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,137
Kate, we're just talking here.

273
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,482
- Just wait.
- Get out of here, Tiny.

274
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,807
Tiny?

275
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,242
What's that smell?

276
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,844
I don't know,
smells like Italian sausage,

277
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,088
like burning pizza or something.

278
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,549
- Donald ate Steve.
- What?

279
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,483
The cat ate the grasshopper.

280
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,285
- I'm going to kill him.
- Good, do it.

281
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,220
Hey, cats eat grasshoppers
all the time.

282
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,989
- Shut up!
- Ladies!

283
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,223
Why did you eat Steve?

284
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,325
What? The grasshopper?

285
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,794
Yes, you fucker. Why?

286
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,364
- Protein.
- I'm going to kill you.

287
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,266
Hey, take it easy.
Leave him alone.

288
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,401
We should all be eating
grasshoppers.

289
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,437
He was a talking grasshopper.
How many have you met?

290
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,073
Talking shit.
He was very rude. He was angry.

291
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,475
You knew he could talk?

292
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,477
Well, of course,
he had a mouth on him, that one.

293
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,946
Lots of arguments
and then the begging.

294
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,815
And then anyway, Yum-Yum,
end of discussion.

295
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,184
He was very... very, uh, tasty.

296
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,453
And he had sort of an earthy,
earthy tone.

297
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,188
Hey, the smell's
getting stronger.

298
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,324
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's the gas from the outside.

299
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,092
It's been coming in
for a few minutes.

300
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,504
You should probably
get the plastic.

301
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,005
- Go, go, go.
- Everyone go to the plastic.

302
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,196
Plastic, Daniel.

303
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,599
- Plastic.
- What?

304
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,400
There's gas.
Get to the plastic.

305
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,211
- Go and get under the plastic.
- Thank you for the warning.

306
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,936
Daniel, bring the plastic.

307
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,147
- Do you hear me?
- Under the plastic.

308
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,206
- Get the plastic, Daniel.
- Faster.

309
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,844
Oh, yay.

310
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,314
- Guys!
- Donald, you'll kill us all.

311
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,049
Oh, no!

312
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,152
Oh, my God, Donald, stop.

313
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,489
- Donald!
- Stop!

314
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,391
Stop! Get the fuck out!

315
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,594
Alright, it's gone, it's gone.

316
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,104
- It's all gone, I guess.
- What?

317
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,197
- It's gone.
- Daniel, check.

318
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,343
Yeah, it's gone.
He's right.

319
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,942
- It's gone.
- That shit's not cool.

320
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,346
I love you.

321
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,350
Daniel, where are your pants?

322
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,919
<i>Hello? Hello, is this...</i>

323
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,555
<i>Hello, anyone there? Hello.</i>

324
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,265
- Holy fuck, get the radio.
- Get the radio transmitter.

325
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,890
- Go, go, go, go.
- Oh!

326
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,326
- Oh, the radio.
<i>- Hello?</i>

327
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,563
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Get to the radio.

328
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:23,097
<i>Hello?</i>

329
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,201
<i>Anyone there?</i>

330
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,504
<i>Hello? Hello? Anyone there?</i>

331
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,305
Hello? Can you hear me? Hello?

332
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,107
- We're not alone.
- We're not alone.

333
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,518
- I hope it's a cat.
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

334
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,210
I hope it's a cat.

335
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,445
Hello? Hello? Can you hear us?
Come in. Hello?

336
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,884
<i>What?
Are you really there?</i>

337
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,919
<i>Is someone there?</i>

338
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,022
Yes, we can hear you.
Come in.

339
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,258
<i>Really,
oh, my God. I can't believe it.</i>

340
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,493
<i>Genius!</i>

341
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,598
Who are you? Where are you?

342
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,266
<i>In the sky, I'm
flying a plane. Where are you?</i>

343
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,604
We're in Sparks Nuclear
Site outside Los Angeles,

344
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:03,971
right by the ocean.

345
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,747
<i>I'm flying over
Los Angeles right now.</i>

346
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,111
How are you even flying?

347
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:12,680
How are you able to
stay outside?

348
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,348
<i>I have a special suit.</i>

349
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,016
<i>Sparks Nuclear Site.</i>

350
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,652
<i>I just found your location
on my map.</i>

351
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,721
<i>You got an air strip there?
Is it clear?</i>

352
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,422
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes. Yes.

353
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,357
Can you hear us? Hello?

354
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,101
<i>I can hardly
hear you, can you hear me?</i>

355
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,161
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, we can hear you.

356
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,329
- Who are you?
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

357
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,331
<i>My name is Ivanka Pump.</i>

358
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,400
Can you hear me?

359
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,472
Radio's dead.

360
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:41,241
Did she just say her name
is Ivanka Pump?

361
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,010
I don't think so.

362
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,612
Ivanka fucking Pump.

363
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,548
- It... It can't be. It can't be.
- Wow.

364
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,583
I mean, what are the odds,
right? It just can't be.

365
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,084
No, there's no way.
Radio was staticky.

366
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,454
It can't be her,
it's... it's too far-fetched.

367
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:57,357
Ivanka Pump, it's so awesome.
Awesome!

368
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,360
What if it is her?

369
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,396
What if she's coming
here to finish the job?

370
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,097
What do you mean?

371
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,341
Like, what if there are
Pump people out there

372
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,768
and they're hunting survivors

373
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,536
and we just gave up
our fucking location?

374
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,741
I mean, we have no way
of knowing that.

375
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,177
You know, you really have
no way of knowing anything.

376
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,346
He's right,
we don't know anything

377
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,317
except that we just heard
from the first human woman

378
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,053
in... in however long
since we've been here.

379
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,622
And she's okay.

380
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,289
She is surviving somehow,

381
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,091
and she's out there
flying a fucking plane.

382
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,193
She's coming here now.

383
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,629
I'm scared.

384
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:41,001
Alright. Even if it is her,
which I acknowledge is crazy.

385
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,539
Never mind.
It's fucking crazy.

386
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,708
- She's wicked hot, though.
- She is.

387
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,476
By wicked hot, you mean
she's the daughter of the devil?

388
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,278
- Yes.
- Hmm.

389
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:11,098
<i>Kate, can you hear my thoughts?</i>

390
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,600
<i>This is strange.</i>

391
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:14,234
<i>Yes, I can hear your thoughts.</i>

392
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,445
<i>Are you hearing mine?
What's going on?</i>

393
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,237
<i>Oh, hey, Kate.</i>

394
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,107
<i>So... So now you can
also hear thoughts.</i>

395
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,843
<i>Cool. That's cool.</i>

396
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,846
<i>- What the fuck, Donald?
- What, bitch?</i>

397
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,147
<i>How am I hearing you in my head?</i>

398
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,585
<i>I can hear thoughts
like a radio frequency.</i>

399
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,587
<i>Is it a cat thing?</i>

400
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,565
<i>- Why am I hearing you?
- Well, it's an oddity</i>

401
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,324
<i>hat's hard to explain in the
landscape of poisonous gas</i>

402
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,827
<i>and massive radiation,
talking animals</i>

403
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,729
<i>and wanting to have
butt sex with Adam.</i>

404
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:45,833
<i>And now Ivanka Pump literally
falling out of the sky.</i>

405
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,135
<i>So it's a radiation thing?</i>

406
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,237
<i>That makes some sense.</i>

407
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,706
<i>Radiation, yes.</i>

408
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,440
<i>And also, you have cancer.</i>

409
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,175
<i>I have cancer?</i>

410
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,177
<i>- How do you know?
- I hear it.</i>

411
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,847
<i>Fuck you.
You're making shit up.</i>

412
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:01,616
<i>Okay, I'm making it up.</i>

413
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,587
You're stupid.

414
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,463
I'll have to admit
I do say some really dumb shit.

415
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,890
I know that.
Come over here.

416
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,400
- Can we talk in here?
- No, we can't talk.

417
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,569
Can we talk in here, please?

418
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,295
<i>Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?</i>

419
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,431
Yes, we can hear you.
Who are you?

420
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>I've landed my plane.
I'm on the runway outside.</i>

421
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,304
Did you say before
that you're Ivanka Pump?

422
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,173
<i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

423
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,241
<i>Look, I know that's probably
a little shocking.</i>

424
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,245
Uh, yeah, your father literally
killed everyone on Earth, so...

425
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,491
<i>He also killed everyone
I loved, I hate him too.</i>

426
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,493
<i>I've been alone for years,
flying around the country,</i>

427
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,485
<i>looking for people, please,</i>

428
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,598
<i>I'm sorry for what my father
did, but it wasn't my fault.</i>

429
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:42,189
<i>You're the only people
I've found.</i>

430
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,427
Fuck you, Ivanka Pump.

431
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:50,230
If anybody should have died,
it's you.

432
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,666
You and your whole
family screwed up

433
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,635
any piece of democracy
we had left,

434
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,703
and then America
and then everything.

435
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,405
I saw your hate speeches on TV.

436
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,474
Your stupid face
is on the $20 bill.

437
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,610
Couldn't let Harriet Tubman
have the spot.

438
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,613
I hate you, you blonde shit.

439
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,281
<i>I understand how
you feel, I also hate who I was</i>

440
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,217
<i>but that person
is not me any more.</i>

441
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,221
I think we should let her in
and deal with her then.

442
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,591
- Let's put her on trial.
- Let's let her in.

443
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,893
I'm not letting her in
unless we put her on trial.

444
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,193
That's... That's crazy.

445
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,629
Okay? How do we even do that?

446
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,263
We'll figure it out.

447
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,936
And that is more than
she deserves anyway.

448
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,834
Or I can just kill her
if you prefer.

449
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,746
Or we can put her on trial,
and then I'll kill her.

450
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,238
- It's up to you.
- No, no killing anyone, okay?

451
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,607
We've had enough death.

452
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,308
<i>Hello?
Please let me in.</i>

453
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,512
- Oh, dammit. Fine.
<i>- Hello?</i>

454
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,246
Let her in.
Just keep her away from me.

455
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,848
I'll put on a gas mask
and go get her.

456
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,383
Hey, put some pants on.

457
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,419
What's with the no pants?

458
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,688
Is it no pants day?

459
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,756
Is it?

460
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,747
Oh, dammit.

461
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,827
If you fuck her, Adam,
we're done. Done!

462
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,529
You're not my girlfriend
any more, Wanda.

463
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,864
This isn't about us.

464
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:04,431
This is about trying
to make babies.

465
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,299
- So if she's fertile...
- Oh, shut up.

466
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,569
- I'm just saying.
- You know, I'll be the judge

467
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:11,438
if we have a trial,
I am fair and impartial,

468
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,075
and the law
is my shepherd, so...

469
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:17,879
Read my lips as I articulate
out loud the word no.

470
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:20,447
Well, why don't you read
my nail as I scratch

471
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,950
the word bitch on your face?

472
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:26,888
Hey, hey, stop it.
Stop it, you two.

473
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,891
Acting like children.
I'll be the judge, okay?

474
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:32,994
I feel nor here
nor there about Ivanka.

475
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,029
Okay, I'm... I'm happy
she's joining us.

476
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,965
I'm cool if we kill her, too,
basically neutral.

477
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:41,569
We'll all prosecute
and reach the verdict together.

478
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,870
She'll defend herself.

479
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,972
Humanity versus Pump.

480
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,577
I do think I'd make
a better judge.

481
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,050
- I'm just saying, alright?
- Me too.

482
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,602
Please excuse me,
I'm such a mess. I...

483
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,572
I am just so happy
and excited to see you all.

484
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,844
Hi. I'm Ivanka.

485
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,983
- Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,687
Did that cat just talk?

487
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,624
Uh, yeah, he's a talking cat.

488
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,826
Oh, my God. I love cats.

489
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,595
- What's your name?
- Donald.

490
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,897
And please, may I be
the first to welcome you

491
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,099
to the Sparks Nuclear Facility,

492
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,668
the last litter of humanity
on Earth?

493
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:49,570
Hi, Donald.

494
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,639
It's so nice to meet you.
You seem really nice.

495
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,116
I think we're going
to be really good friends,

496
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,076
and I love your name.

497
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,515
Oh, sorry, I... I didn't
mean it like that.

498
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,652
- Hmm.
- This is very awkward.

499
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,187
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

500
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,688
I'm just so excited
to see you all.

501
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:10,124
I haven't seen people
in so long.

502
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,559
Can I give you all a hug?

503
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,961
- No.
- Okay, sorry.

504
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:16,063
Oh, I did see
a talking bear once.

505
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:19,499
And two talking dogs,
but never a cat.

506
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,103
- There's bears out there?
- Oh, yes.

507
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,771
And other different
kinds of animals.

508
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,172
Life is still going on.

509
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,676
Ivanka, we have food and water.

510
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,145
You do? I am starving.

511
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,080
Wait, how do you have
food and water?

512
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:36,584
Well, Sparks is the biggest
nuclear site in California.

513
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,719
Hundreds of people worked here,
maybe thousands.

514
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,621
It was a self-sufficient,
closed facility.

515
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,090
So we have our own electrical
system, water system,

516
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:44,792
an indoor garden

517
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:46,585
and a whole warehouse
full of preserved food.

518
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,064
And how did you all end up here?

519
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:54,035
We were new recruits
here on orientation day.

520
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,671
Stuck us in a safe room
for demo.

521
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:57,872
Next thing you know,

522
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,541
wave came,
everything went black.

523
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,644
People just evaporated.

524
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:04,912
Uh, but we were...

525
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,814
We were fine.

526
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:08,582
Right place at the right time.

527
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:10,551
You know, I was exploring
the sewer pipe,

528
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:13,521
uh, so curiosity saved
the cat in this case.

529
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:20,061
Mmm, how did you survive?

530
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,697
- Oh, I was in space.
- What?

531
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,166
Yeah, I was flying
my spacecraft.

532
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,767
Come on.

533
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,636
You were a model
doing catwalks in New York.

534
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,638
- Catwalks?
- Yeah, that.

535
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,240
See, that was actually
all just a cover up.

536
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:36,277
I was being trained since
I was a child, groomed, really.

537
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,812
To take over Pump operations
one day.

538
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:39,080
- Groomed?
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:40,247
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

540
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,616
No, really.
We were just priming

541
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,752
the public to focus on my looks.

542
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:47,688
So Pump could use me a
distraction whenever he wanted.

543
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,290
Worked like a charm.

544
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,858
Yeah, I believe it.

545
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,026
- Hi, my name is Adam.
- Hi.

546
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,095
She's distracting you right now.

547
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,964
- I'm Wanda.
- Hi, Wanda.

548
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,132
Thanks for letting me in.

549
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,633
We're going to put you on trial.

550
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,635
- What?
- Kate.

551
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:04,271
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi.

552
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,842
So you were in outer space
flying a spaceship.

553
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,177
You were secretly
trying to operate

554
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,680
as part of the Pump plan
for world domination?

555
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,782
Yes.

556
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,593
Look, there's a lot more
that I want to tell you all.

557
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:18,953
I know, it sounds crazy
and fantastical,

558
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,254
but it's the truth.

559
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,090
- Is it?
- Hmm.

560
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:25,926
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,762
Ivanka, we have, uh...

562
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:29,697
Let's get you something to eat.

563
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,332
- Thank you, Daniel.
- Stop.

564
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:36,670
So, uh, some stuff up there.

565
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,306
- This is where we sleep.
- Yeah.

566
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:40,941
And, uh...

567
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,158
<i>Starving space woman, my ass.</i>

568
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:00,094
<i>How smooth is
she going to be after she eats?</i>

569
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,872
<i>- Get out of my head, cat.
- Do you want me</i>

570
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,864
<i>to tell you what Daniel
is thinking right now?</i>

571
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:06,100
<i>I can hear his thoughts.</i>

572
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,235
<i>Uh, yes, and also her thoughts.</i>

573
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:09,937
<i>Daniel wants to fuck her.</i>

574
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,273
<i>I'm not getting
into her head yet.</i>

575
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,974
<i>You're making shit up.</i>

576
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,677
<i>And they are fucking right now.</i>

577
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,846
<i>Donald, are you messing
with me? I'll go check.</i>

578
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,748
<i>But if you're lying to me,
I will neuter you...</i>

579
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,892
<i>Leave my balls out of this.</i>

580
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,852
<i>Oh, and she likes his big dick.</i>

581
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,655
<i>I'm going, you ginger-minger.</i>

582
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,156
<i>Getting hotter. Red alert!</i>

583
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,834
<i>Oh, red alert!</i>

584
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,993
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Look.

585
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:35,196
The only way to lose weight
is to burn more calories

586
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,931
than you consume,
like work it out.

587
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:39,200
I don't exactly have
a choice of diet here, Adam.

588
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,968
But that's what I'm saying.

589
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,946
You can eat whatever you want
as long as you exercise.

590
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,806
I work in the indoor garden,
go up and down stairs, do yoga.

591
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,185
- What else am I supposed to do?
- Do... Do whatever you want.

592
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,877
Eat whatever you want,
you look great.

593
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,779
You just said I gained weight.

594
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:54,648
I said you looked healthy,
and I meant it as a compliment.

595
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,917
But you think that emaciated
pilot girl is hot?

596
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:59,720
No, I don't. I just said
she's pretty skinny, that's all.

597
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,690
But you like that, don't you?

598
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,058
- Just admit it.
- Okay, fine.

599
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,026
Yeah, I think she's super hot.
So what?

600
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,361
Oh, come on.

601
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,930
What? Kate's pretty
fucking skinny,

602
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,141
you're not giving
me shit about that.

603
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,833
- That's different.
- Why?

604
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,703
Because she's not Ivanka
fucking Pump. That's why.

605
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:18,005
If... If Tom Brady
were to radio us next,

606
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,673
you... you feel good about that?

607
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:22,076
Really? Tom Brady?
Tom Brady is fucking dead.

608
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,844
Everyone is dead.

609
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:25,913
And I feel great
to be alive right now.

610
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,415
I bet you I look a lot
better than Tom Brady does.

611
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:30,317
Do you still like me?

612
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,254
Of course I still like you.

613
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,089
Do you still love me?

614
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,224
I moved to California for you.

615
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,026
Baby, I do.

616
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:43,063
And did I gain weight?
Be honest.

617
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:46,200
- Honest?
- Tell me.

618
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,104
- Okay, a little.
- I hate you.

619
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:53,374
It looks good on you. Wanda!

620
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,042
You know, sometimes
...Jesus!

621
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,444
The best option is to lose.

622
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,347
I mean, that was pretty bad.

623
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,416
No, no, no.
You... You... You go after her,

624
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:04,885
you... you tell her you care,
you tell her she's pretty,

625
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,420
you look in her eyes, and you...

626
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,255
You say, I love you,
blah, blah, blah.

627
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,357
I think I should
just sit this one out.

628
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:14,461
Maybe we just need a little
space to figure things out.

629
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,231
- I see, you don't love her.
- I do.

630
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,168
I don't know.

631
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:23,270
But you're starting to have
feelings for Kate.

632
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:27,141
What? No.
No, I mean, I don't know.

633
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,710
You know, it's been
pretty obvious, actually.

634
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:32,346
Oh, what? I don't think so.

635
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,948
Yeah, it has.

636
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:37,218
This sucks.
What am I going to do?

637
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,890
Look, man, Kate and I,

638
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,427
we have a way of...

639
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:51,165
Of communicating so
I could feel it out for you.

640
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,436
No. No, I just... I really...

641
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,037
I don't want to hurt Wanda.

642
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,039
Yeah, it's a new world,

643
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,510
so we get to make up
the new rules, right?

644
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,378
I mean, you're all
fucking each other.

645
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,213
So who's to say
you can all fall in love

646
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,082
with each other, too, right?
That's natural.

647
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,850
You know, I'm sure
if you call a love line,

648
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,385
they'd back me up on this.

649
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,188
- You want me to call love-line?
- Oh, yeah.

650
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,091
Yeah, I mean,
let me call love-line.

651
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,792
- Okay.
- Hello, love-line?

652
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,829
I'm a male in his twenties
from California,

653
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,497
living with the last
two chicks on Earth,

654
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,499
and I'm in love with them both.

655
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,103
- It's three chicks.
- Oh, right. Three chicks.

656
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,838
Because Ivanka Pump
just showed up.

657
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,339
And I'm in love with her, too.

658
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,141
Now, one girl...

659
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,279
One girl was my girlfriend
before all this.

660
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:42,283
But then we broke up,
we're still sort of together.

661
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,052
She's fine with me sleeping
with the other chick.

662
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,354
Just not with Ivanka,

663
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,857
which I really want
to sleep with.

664
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:53,227
God, I'm not even sure if
she wants to sleep with me.

665
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,464
Anyway,

666
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,368
my ex, let's call her Cookie,

667
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:04,872
still has feelings for me and...

668
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:09,843
I think that I'm falling
more for the second girl.

669
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,622
Let's call her Cake.
I mean, what should I do?

670
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:14,281
Do I go for my Cookie
or my Cake?

671
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,319
Well, I would, uh,
I would say that

672
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:21,556
you can have your Cake and
you can also have your Cookie.

673
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:23,457
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,927
I also masturbate
25 times a day.

675
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,462
Sometimes more, is that normal?

676
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,130
Yeah, that's right
in the wheelhouse

677
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,533
for a radiated California.

678
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:34,368
But let's get back
to the first question.

679
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,037
- What? My life?
- Yeah.

680
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,141
I can't find them anywhere.

681
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,011
I searched the kitchen,
the basement, everywhere.

682
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,313
Oh, did you try storage?

683
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,616
Yeah.

684
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,352
Probably.

685
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,525
Where were you?

686
00:30:58,325 --> 00:30:59,627
We were... We were in storage.

687
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:02,229
I told Ivanka
that we had Twinkies,

688
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:06,467
and she freaked out
so I took her to get some.

689
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,069
Yum.

690
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,540
Was it good?

691
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,075
- She enjoyed it?
- I did.

692
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:18,112
I hadn't had one in so long,
and I was desperate.

693
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:19,581
I really, really like them.

694
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:22,216
I mean,
I could take them in all day.

695
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,218
I mean,
I know we're sharing, but,

696
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,487
I can really go down
on those things, huh?

697
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:31,325
Well, we're pleased to share
all that we have here with you.

698
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:33,661
Do you need to rest
or take a shower?

699
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:36,497
Oh, Kate, you're so sweet,
but no, I'm fine.

700
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,566
I just want to look
around this place,

701
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,401
get to know you
all a little better.

702
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,970
Well, you know Daniel
pretty well already.

703
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,639
Yeah, well, he is a dreamboat.

704
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:48,242
Oh, and I want to get
to know you, too, Kate.

705
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,943
Great.

706
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,622
Hey, Adam, can you please
go get Wanda in here?

707
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:53,313
I think we're ready to begin.

708
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:55,249
Begin what exactly?

709
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,484
- Ivanka's trial.
- You were serious about that?

710
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,422
- Yeah.
- Uh, Kate.

711
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:06,293
Come on. I think we can just let
her settle down a little bit.

712
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:08,462
Oh, I think she settled
down real fast already.

713
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,565
I'll go get Wanda.

714
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:14,134
You know what, Kate?
I'm not a criminal, okay?

715
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:17,639
I was a victim of my father
and his schemes my whole life.

716
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,139
- We all were.
- Yes.

717
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:20,974
And I was a victim
of his actions.

718
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,645
Like the rest of you,
I am a survivor, just like you.

719
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,613
It's not my fault
that I was born a Pump.

720
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,314
Is that your opening statement?

721
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:29,684
You know, Ivanka,
why don't you just entertain us

722
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,052
and yourself with this thing,
and then we'll move on?

723
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,987
I just want you to know
that I'm not really

724
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,523
for the whole trial thing.

725
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,597
I think we should let you
settle down and, you know,

726
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,993
just talk about what you...
What you know.

727
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:42,196
You call it a conversation,

728
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,031
and I'll call it the trial
of the century.

729
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,539
Great.

730
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,541
Everyone's here,
and the trial begins.

731
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,409
Mi casa, your courtroom.

732
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,457
Oh, here we go.

733
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:15,262
Humanity versus Pump.

734
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:18,766
What am I being accused for?

735
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,301
You are a key player in
the destruction of our world,

736
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:25,339
and you've done despicable,
harmful things to many.

737
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:28,743
So crimes against humanity.
That's it.

738
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,278
Whatever.
I'm telling you, I was a victim.

739
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,715
So you didn't own
property all over the world?

740
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,450
Fly in private jets,
eat caviar for breakfast

741
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,386
and snort blow off
the mayors for dinner.

742
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:40,722
Oh, I did.

743
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:42,389
But that's hardly a crime.

744
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,734
They are when you
earn those privileges,

745
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,425
hurting other people.

746
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,662
I agree, but I didn't earn them.

747
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:51,231
- My father did.
- Born with a silver spoon.

748
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,701
You know what, Adam, that is
really funny that you say that.

749
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:56,103
I actually did have
a silver spoon as a child.

750
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,372
- It had my name on.
- Oh, my God. That's hilarious.

751
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:00,584
Where did that saying come from?
The silver spoon thing?

752
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:02,486
From people who had silver
spoons for their babies.

753
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,444
Yeah, did you know you
have to use ivory spoons

754
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:05,847
when you eat caviar?

755
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,582
Because the metal ones
oxidize a little...

756
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,751
Or you could
just use a plastic spoon.

757
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:13,086
They didn't have plastic spoons
when they started eating caviar.

758
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,088
Well, they had wood,
didn't they, Adam?

759
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,592
Stop talking about the spoons.

760
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,226
- Didn't you bring it up?
- No, you did.

761
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,795
No.

762
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:24,064
Oh, Wanda did with the caviar
for breakfast thing.

763
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:26,466
But I didn't mention spoons.

764
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,869
Maybe you did.

765
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:29,469
I don't think so.

766
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,506
I didn't even know
they had ivory spoons.

767
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,508
Okay, everyone,
just shut up about the spoons.

768
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,242
Caviar is so delicious.

769
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,512
- When did you've caviar?
- It was a wedding.

770
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:39,614
What kind of spoons
did they use?

771
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,281
You know,
they served it on crackers.

772
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,150
- So tasteful.
- Stop!

773
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,328
We're not talking about spoons
or caviar or anything else

774
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:46,888
that isn't related
to this trial.

775
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,489
- You know what's funny?
- What's funny?

776
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,261
The world came to an end,
and a Pump is still being sued.

777
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,573
You know what's knee-slapping
uproariously hysterical?

778
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:09,544
Is that billions died
and a Pump is still pumping.

779
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:13,313
Wow, Kate, you should
have been a lawyer.

780
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,617
Oh, I'm just a nuclear
physicist, I'm afraid.

781
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,352
Yeah, mom was really
disappointed, but thank you.

782
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm glad that you're
satisfied with the court.

783
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,624
Well, if it pleases the court,

784
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,926
I'd like to enter my plea.

785
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,628
Please. Plea.

786
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:29,731
Not guilty.

787
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,498
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yes.

788
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,167
Audible gasp from the gallery

789
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,212
and reporters are scribbling
away in their notebooks.

790
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,538
Now, can we continue?

791
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:39,674
Do you need a Twinkie break,
Daniel?

792
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,274
Maybe you want to help
the defendant

793
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,277
with a long
cream-filled Twinkie.

794
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:46,724
- Oh, I'm good.
- Good.

795
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,683
- Beautiful.
- Okay.

796
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:50,818
We have enough for one day?

797
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:54,589
Can we wrap this all up?
Is this really necessary?

798
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,156
I don't feel good.

799
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,193
- Oh, Katie.
- Oh, are you okay?

800
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,530
Wanda, can you just
come with me for a second?

801
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:04,699
Yes. Yes, of course.

802
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:06,634
Thank you.

803
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,236
- Is she okay?
- It's cancer.

804
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,581
- Oh, really?
- Doesn't he...

805
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,339
He makes shit up all the time.

806
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,341
Okay, fine. I'm making it up.

807
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,511
- Are you making it up?
- No.

808
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,847
I'm going to go check on Kate.

809
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:22,482
Adam, wait. Adam, wait.

810
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:23,751
Yes, Ivanka?

811
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,654
Do you think
that I should be on trial?

812
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,957
Um, okay, can we talk
about this later?

813
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:31,793
I should go, check on Kate.

814
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:34,862
- Sure.
- Uh, I'm... I'm very...

815
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:36,698
You seem really nice.

816
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:38,866
And I'm... I'm very glad
you found us.

817
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,836
I'm glad.
I'm very glad you found us.

818
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,807
I'm like very glad you found us.

819
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,514
So... So that Adam's
in love with Kate.

820
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:54,649
- Is he?
- Yeah.

821
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:55,917
What are you talking about?

822
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,719
He told me
just before the trial.

823
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,620
He told you
he's in love with Kate?

824
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:02,557
And Wanda. He's very confused.

825
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,026
- I love them both myself.
- You do?

826
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,260
This is one kind
of love fest here.

827
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:11,398
Did I just walk into
an STD death trap?

828
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,736
All good.
STDs have been eradicated.

829
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,839
- Unless you have one.
- No.

830
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:20,041
But I do hope
you love me one day, too.

831
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:21,976
I already did... Do.

832
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:25,613
Did... Do. Do.

833
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,682
And Adam?

834
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,249
Well...

835
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,384
Does that mean you're bisexual?

836
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,621
I'm trisexual.

837
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,289
- Donald?
- Oh, heavy petting.

838
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:39,026
That's as far as it ever got
between the two of us.

839
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,427
I swear.

840
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,665
So, um,
what's a trisexual, then?

841
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:48,335
I'll try anything.

842
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,271
Do you guys do orgies?

843
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,608
Sometimes, yeah.

844
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:57,512
Orgies, uh, sort of more
of a loose structure.

845
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:59,647
Like, anyone anywhere
kind of thing.

846
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,583
You know?
Sometimes orgies, yeah.

847
00:38:02,884 --> 00:38:04,051
I just watch.

848
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:05,452
I'll go watch.

849
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:09,389
Are orgies your thing?

850
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,092
Not really.

851
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,694
I'm more into power plays.

852
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:16,396
Rough stuff, domination,

853
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,800
submission.

854
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,572
Kate's not feeling well.

855
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,373
She went to lay down for a bit.

856
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,043
Trial's postponed for now.

857
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,545
Thank God.

858
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,048
I... I didn't mean like that, I...
Not about Kate.

859
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,851
Yeah, um, well...

860
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,055
Ivanka, how did you
survive all this time?

861
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:43,691
It wasn't easy.

862
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,092
When the wave happened,

863
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,061
I was coming back from
the space mission.

864
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,596
I didn't know what was going on,

865
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,397
other than I lost contact
with the base.

866
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,569
So I kept going because
nothing was wrong on my end.

867
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:58,039
And then after I landed,

868
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:00,975
I discovered
all of the destruction,

869
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,845
and I've been looking
for survivors ever since.

870
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,684
Three questions.
Where did you live?

871
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,986
How did you eat?
How did you stay outside?

872
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,721
I went to the military base.

873
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,957
I switched planes, and then
I flew to the next base.

874
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,925
Switched planes,
gathered supplies.

875
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,528
You can go outside
in the space suit.

876
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,097
So I would listen
on the radio for people,

877
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,866
look for any signs of life.

878
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,368
And you guys were the only
people that I found alive.

879
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,639
I'm just so happy to see you

880
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,741
because I really thought
that I was all alone.

881
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:37,011
Did you ever think
about what your dad did?

882
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:40,915
About being his daughter
and part of the Pump operations?

883
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:42,884
All the time.

884
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,653
I was a mess for a long time.

885
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,922
I thought about killing myself,

886
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,393
and then I decided,
no, you survived.

887
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:56,731
So I decided that I would go out

888
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:58,900
and look for people and
help in any way that I could.

889
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,467
I thought to myself,

890
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,037
"No, you don't have
the right to die.

891
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:05,907
You survived, and
there might be a reason why.

892
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,809
And you need to understand
what that reason is."

893
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,646
Now that I found you guys,

894
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,714
maybe I'll find out
what that reason is.

895
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,018
Are... Are you fertile?

896
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,853
I mean... I mean,
how would you know.

897
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,122
- I don't know.
- Why would you ask her that?

898
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:23,824
Because you and Kate aren't.

899
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:25,960
So maybe the reason
why she survived

900
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:28,529
was to start humanity
again with her babies.

901
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,565
That's disgusting.

902
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,535
- A whole race of Pumps?
- Hmm.

903
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,003
Come on, Wanda.

904
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:37,672
I'm sorry, that's...

905
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:39,439
That's disgusting.

906
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,577
- Oh, don't cry, Ivanka.
- Oh, no.

907
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:46,614
No, I had fantasies about
finally meeting people

908
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:48,928
and that we would come together
and the fight would go on.

909
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,819
That's why I was honest
with you about who I was,

910
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,622
because I thought that
maybe you would see me

911
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:58,059
as I see myself,
a victim and a survivor.

912
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,195
But now I realize
I was so wrong.

913
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,599
You will always hate me,
and I can never escape that.

914
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,704
I don't hate you.

915
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:13,975
I mean, I do,
but I don't know you really.

916
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,644
I hate the person
you're supposed to be.

917
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,746
Maybe that's not you any more.

918
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,515
- I hope it's not.
- It's not.

919
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,250
I think you look beautiful.

920
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:25,853
- Thanks, fat daddy.
- Fat?

921
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:28,022
It's all that protein
you been eating lately.

922
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,091
Yeah, look who's talking.

923
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:32,093
What's that supposed to mean?

924
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,095
Well, uh, nothing.

925
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:36,764
Does everybody think I'm fat?

926
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,066
No, Wanda, come on.
You look great.

927
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,302
- I'm in love with you actually.
- What?

928
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,803
I have a big crush on you.

929
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:45,072
Just like Adam
has a big crush on Kate.

930
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,542
Uh, what? Um...

931
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:51,679
- Adam?
- I don't have a crush on Kate.

932
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,149
I mean,
where'd you get that from?

933
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,685
Uh, Donald said that you said.

934
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,654
- So...
- Oh, thanks a lot, Donald.

935
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:03,257
- Is that true?
- Uh, no.

936
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,893
He makes shit up all the time.

937
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,261
- Donald?
- Yes.

938
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:08,896
Did Adam tell you
he has a crush on Kate?

939
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:12,133
No, he said he loves her
and he also loves you.

940
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,768
He's very confused.

941
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,269
Are you confused, Adam?

942
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,638
Fine. Okay?

943
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,208
I... I like Kate
but I love you too.

944
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,611
Oh, you are confused.

945
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,846
Why... Why am I confused?

946
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,149
I've been locked up here
with the both of you for ages.

947
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,851
Why can't I love you both?
What choice do I have?

948
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:33,788
Oh, you can choose.
Do you like Ivanka also?

949
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,723
Yes. I like Ivanka, of course.

950
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:39,026
I mean, I... I love...
I love the... the floors

951
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,831
and the... Daniel and Donald
and... and the metal doors

952
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:47,068
and the fluorescent lights
and the gas and the radiation.

953
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:49,637
I fucking love everything, okay?

954
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:53,040
Also, Wanda, I was
kind of kidding before,

955
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:54,175
but I really do like you.

956
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,143
And obviously, I love Kate,

957
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:59,113
but I clearly have a little bit
of an instant crush on Ivanka.

958
00:42:59,146 --> 00:43:01,082
I think that's okay
under the circumstances.

959
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:05,052
Well, then I'm the freak
who only loves Adam,

960
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:08,189
her ex-boyfriend, whom
she moved to California for,

961
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:11,826
because she thought he'd propose
and they'd get married.

962
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,127
Oh, God.

963
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,728
You love her too?

964
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:16,097
Go get her.

965
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,969
Baby! Baby! Baby!

966
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,105
Listen to me a minute.
Listen to me.

967
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,208
I was going to propose.

968
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,411
- You were?
- Yeah.

969
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,646
Baby, come here, sit.

970
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,783
You remember when I picked
you up from the airport?

971
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:39,887
Well, I had it with me
when I picked you up.

972
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:42,857
I just... I was waiting
for the right moment,

973
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,825
and I brought it
to work with me.

974
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,229
- You brought the ring to work?
- Yeah.

975
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,131
Why didn't you ever tell me?

976
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:53,400
It was just in my pocket.

977
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:56,070
I may... I was nervous.

978
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,139
I liked feeling it there.

979
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,341
You thought you'd propose to me

980
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:02,776
on our first day
at a nuclear facility?

981
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,945
No, no. I had it in my pocket.

982
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,982
I like to feel it.
I was... I was nervous.

983
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:10,317
Why didn't you ever tell me?

984
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,953
Well, with everything that
happened, you know,

985
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:15,189
I guess I was just waiting
for the perfect moment.

986
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:16,857
I think you found it.

987
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,894
What?

988
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,729
Um...

989
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,441
- We're going to get married!
- Get the ring, Adam!

990
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:26,367
Oh, my God!

991
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,737
Oh, what? Wanda, I love you
and everything, you know?

992
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,305
But look, why get married?

993
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,941
You know, like marriage
isn't a thing any more.

994
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:35,809
Oh, I love you, too. That's why.

995
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,344
That's the reason.

996
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:42,049
Oh, right, right.
Okay, um, I'll get the ring.

997
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,793
And I'll get Kate.
Who is going to marry us?

998
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,753
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- I will.

999
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:48,322
I officiated my friend's
wedding in Carmel.

1000
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,258
I'm certified online.
It's good for all of California.

1001
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:54,228
Oh, unless you're Jewish.
Are you Jewish?

1002
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:56,397
No, all the Jews are gone.

1003
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,801
Actually, I'm a Jew. Reformed.

1004
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:06,073
I mean, my husband...
Late husband was Jewish,

1005
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:09,276
so I converted, so actually,

1006
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,246
Jews now make up
one-fifth of the population,

1007
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,081
stronger than ever.

1008
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,116
I don't think Kate would like it

1009
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,085
if you were to marry us, Ivanka.

1010
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:20,054
Not because you're Jewish.

1011
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:21,523
That's irrelevant.

1012
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,492
No, no, I get it.
It's because she hates me.

1013
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,495
I'll talk to her.

1014
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,165
- Come on, Adam.
- Uh, it's there. It's this way.

1015
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:32,900
Oh, well, I help
you get the ring.

1016
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:38,172
This is the hope
for humanity, eh?

1017
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:40,374
You're so fucked.

1018
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:43,177
Right?

1019
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,152
Donald, can you
help me find the ring?

1020
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,054
I'm busy.

1021
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:28,455
Come on.
It's under the bed.

1022
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,491
You really going to
marry Wanda, eh?

1023
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:33,994
This is not how I imagined
the end of the world.

1024
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,338
But you're a cat, you're nimble.

1025
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,197
You can see in the dark.
Come on, buddy.

1026
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:39,534
Donald, be a dear
and go help him.

1027
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:41,835
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, dear.

1028
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:42,970
Come on.

1029
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,383
People!

1030
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:01,097
<i>- Ivanka?
- What?</i>

1031
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:02,866
<i>- What do you think?
- I'm embarrassed.</i>

1032
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,592
<i>- About what?
- Humanity.</i>

1033
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:08,162
<i>These choice samples.
Sad, stupid, pathetic people.</i>

1034
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:10,431
<i>- Won't be long now.
- Found the ring?</i>

1035
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,199
<i>Oh, yeah.
I've had it for days.</i>

1036
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:14,536
<i>Found it going through
everyone's stuff.</i>

1037
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,504
<i>Of course, you did.</i>

1038
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:19,973
<i>Fun to see Adam
run around looking for it.</i>

1039
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:23,243
<i>Not for too long.
Give it back to him.</i>

1040
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:25,045
<i>I want to see how
this wedding goes.</i>

1041
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,023
<i>- Really?
- Last wedding on earth,</i>

1042
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,415
<i>it'd be romantic.</i>

1043
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:29,926
<i>Yeah, maybe not the last one.</i>

1044
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,654
<i>Right. Not the last one.</i>

1045
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:35,590
<i>- Let's have fun, baby.
- Yes, let's have fun.</i>

1046
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:37,592
<i>Give him back the ring.
Is it nice?</i>

1047
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,503
<i>- It's cheap.
- Of course, it is.</i>

1048
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,928
<i>Oh, he's coming your way.</i>

1049
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,396
I'm not ready yet.

1050
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,907
Can't find the fucking
ring anywhere.

1051
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,499
I swear I hid under the bed.

1052
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,602
Well, did you ask
Donald to look?

1053
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:50,270
Yeah, I looked. He looked.

1054
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:52,339
We looked everywhere.
Here. Might be here.

1055
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,244
Oh, well,
why don't you take mine?

1056
00:47:57,978 --> 00:47:59,380
What? No.

1057
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,248
Well, I'm not using it anyway.

1058
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:04,151
Well, doesn't it have
a sentimental value for you?

1059
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:06,120
My husband was a dick.

1060
00:48:06,654 --> 00:48:09,123
So why are you wearing it
after all this time?

1061
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:12,359
Maybe I was looking for
the right moment to take it off.

1062
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,196
- This is it.
- Adam.

1063
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:18,533
I never thought
I'd see another man again.

1064
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,367
And this ring reminds me

1065
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:22,369
of what I thought
I'd never have again.

1066
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:25,239
And now... Never mind.

1067
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,542
What?

1068
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,444
You're getting married.

1069
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,313
- And?
- I'm too late.

1070
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:37,652
Oh, Ivanka. We hardly know
each other really.

1071
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:39,420
I know what I want
when I see it.

1072
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,257
- Me?
- Wanda's a lucky girl.

1073
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,159
Oh!

1074
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:49,597
You fall right out of the sky
into my arms.

1075
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,734
Well, I'm not in your arms,
but I wish I was.

1076
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,301
You want me to hold you?

1077
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:56,638
I want you to do what you want.

1078
00:48:57,304 --> 00:48:59,106
I want you to do
what's in your heart,

1079
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:00,340
what's in your balls.

1080
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,242
I want you to blow the rules
all to hell

1081
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:04,344
and make up new ones
for yourself, yeah?

1082
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,246
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1083
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:10,284
Wanda! What about Wanda?

1084
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:12,587
Wanda! Wanda! Wanda!
All I hear is Wanda.

1085
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,698
I think Wanda wants
this more than you do.

1086
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:20,127
- If you ever did at all.
- No, I... I did, okay?

1087
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:22,530
Now we've spent so much time
with each other.

1088
00:49:22,564 --> 00:49:26,400
It seems like ages that we
actually wanted to be together.

1089
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:31,071
Adam, you need to
make up your mind.

1090
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:33,073
I like strong men.

1091
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,643
I'll be in storage if you want.

1092
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,111
I hope you do.

1093
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,013
I hope you'll come.

1094
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:45,452
Don't eat too many Twinkies

1095
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:48,322
You'll get sick.

1096
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,704
- I got the ring.
- Jesus, stop doing that.

1097
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:04,338
Where did you find it?

1098
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,674
It was under your bed,
under some magazine.

1099
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,318
- Let me see it.
- Yeah, not so fast, Tiny-Mighty.

1100
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,409
What?

1101
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,545
I want to officiate your

1102
00:50:10,578 --> 00:50:12,212
- wedding.
- Fuck no.

1103
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:13,715
Why not?

1104
00:50:13,748 --> 00:50:16,483
Because I'm not getting
married by a fucking cat.

1105
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:18,151
A fucking talking cat.

1106
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,454
- I'm a talking cat.
- No.

1107
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,322
Okay, fine. Let Ivanka do it.

1108
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,358
Ivanka, why?

1109
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,793
I don't know. She wants to.

1110
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:27,562
What do you care
what Ivanka wants?

1111
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:30,798
I mean, maybe Kate
will have the honor.

1112
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:35,335
You know, no ring,
then no ring man.

1113
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:40,575
- Give me back my ring.
- I don't have it.

1114
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:43,410
You just said you found it.

1115
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,178
No, no, I lost it again.

1116
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:47,090
You know what? I don't even
want the fucking ring.

1117
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,826
Oh, well, you don't
want to get married?

1118
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,417
No, I don't. And you know what?

1119
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,720
Fuck you and
fuck this stupid wedding.

1120
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:55,489
It's... It's in the storage.
It's in storage.

1121
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:57,190
It's in storage.

1122
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,426
- What's in storage?
- You know, lots of things.

1123
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,137
- Where's Adam?
- Does he have the ring?

1124
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,573
- You okay, Kate?
- I'm fine.

1125
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:03,807
Yeah, I heard you puking.

1126
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,299
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

1127
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:06,677
We could decorated over here.

1128
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,335
Oh, we can put paper
flowers over here.

1129
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,572
- We need music.
- Here. Kate and I can sing.

1130
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:13,373
- You can't sing.
- Oh, we can sing, baby.

1131
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:27,755
Okay, okay. You can sing.
Just not that song.

1132
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,389
Please, not that song.

1133
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:30,825
Hey, Wanda, you said, Adam.

1134
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,335
You asked, where's Adam?
Is that right?

1135
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:34,194
- Yes.
- You know, he's in storage.

1136
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:35,739
He's probably
still looking for the ring.

1137
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,608
- I'm going to go help him.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1138
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,333
Don't... Don't...
Don't go there now.

1139
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:41,366
- Why not?
- Well, he's there with Ivanka.

1140
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:44,772
- Ivanka?
- Yeah, they went there to fuck.

1141
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,709
Oh, I'm getting so sick
of your shit, cat!

1142
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:49,587
No, that did... they did.
They went there to fuck.

1143
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,145
Just like Daniel did
five minutes after she arrived.

1144
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,313
Whoa, wait a minute.

1145
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:54,716
Did you fuck Ivanka in storage?

1146
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,250
No, I... I... Okay.

1147
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,964
- He did.
- Did you fuck her or not?

1148
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,321
- Not in storage.
- Yep.

1149
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:03,625
Oh, god. Shit. I'm going.

1150
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:05,392
Is Adam really
in there with her?

1151
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,395
Daniel, I hope she has AIDS.

1152
00:52:08,763 --> 00:52:10,263
I don't think so.

1153
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:11,933
I'm never going to
fuck you again.

1154
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:13,635
Oh, there's two men
left on earth,

1155
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:16,771
- and she won't fuck you.
- Or Adam, ever.

1156
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,171
You both disgust me.

1157
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,907
Why can't we fuck Ivanka, huh?

1158
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:21,509
She's a beautiful
woman who probably

1159
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,910
hadn't been fucked in years.

1160
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:24,588
She's just dying to
be touched, to be loved,

1161
00:52:24,612 --> 00:52:25,880
to be held, to be kissed.

1162
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:27,649
You can hate her as
much as you want,

1163
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:29,817
but on a human level,
it's just cruel not to fuck her.

1164
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:31,753
On a human level, Daniel?

1165
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,530
Well, then, fuck. I should
just fuck her too then.

1166
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:35,556
- You should.
- I'd rather die.

1167
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:39,627
Okay, we... we hold her
guilty in your... in your trial.

1168
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,328
And then what?
What are you going to do?

1169
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:43,397
- Something bloody.
- You're not a killer, Kate.

1170
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,375
I don't know what I'll do.
I'll think of something.

1171
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:48,703
Like forgive her for her crimes
and give her a second chance?

1172
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:49,937
Is that your dick talking?

1173
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:52,640
What? So now I'm
the fucking problem here?

1174
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:55,375
- Not her.
- No, no, one's a problem.

1175
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,612
We're just all in a crazy
situation, that's all.

1176
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:59,747
No, I still get to
decide something.

1177
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:03,250
I get to decide who
I forgive and who I fuck.

1178
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,753
And what shitty cat I kick
if he comes near me.

1179
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,722
Oh, temper, temper, temper.

1180
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:10,257
Everything's gone belly up
since you've crawled in here.

1181
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,493
Are you really going to blame
the broken vase on the cat?

1182
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:14,862
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:17,297
- You're so crazy. You're crazy.
- Fuck you.

1184
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,901
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1185
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,636
I'll scratch
your fucking eyes out.

1186
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,840
Where is Wanda?

1187
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,743
Uh, she stormed away.
I don't know where she is.

1188
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,445
After she caught you
fucking Ivanka?

1189
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:32,947
Huh? Here we go.

1190
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,717
Yes, she caught us
fucking, okay?

1191
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,250
So your fiancée ran off,

1192
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:38,853
and here you are
with Ivanka, the tramp.

1193
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:41,789
Okay, enough with
the name calling, Kate.

1194
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,991
His fiancée screamed and hit us

1195
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:47,461
and then destroyed storage
and then broke a million things

1196
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,863
and basically tried to kill us.

1197
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:50,832
Oh, and then she stepped
on all the Twinkies.

1198
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,567
Thank God, I saved a couple.

1199
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,037
And then she called off
the wedding and she stormed off.

1200
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,606
Congratulations, Adam.
It's a record.

1201
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,609
Shortest engagement in history.
In all of history.

1202
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,711
Call the Guinness Book
Of World Records.

1203
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:05,412
Ivanka, I'm sure
you're in there too.

1204
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:06,948
- What for?
- Biggest cunt ever.

1205
00:54:06,981 --> 00:54:08,415
Again with the names.

1206
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:09,884
You know,
I think would be in there,

1207
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,687
you know, as a talking cat.

1208
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,790
And I'm a talking monkey,
so get over yourself.

1209
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:17,592
Right, but I'm bilingual.

1210
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,260
I speak cat and I speak monkey,
so it's a little better.

1211
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:21,963
Not if I cut your tongue out.

1212
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,532
- Kate!
- Wait!

1213
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:26,901
- Kate! Kate, stop!
- Kate!

1214
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:29,537
- Kate! Don't, don't, don't.
- Come back here.

1215
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,740
Do not hurt him.
He has done nothing to hurt you.

1216
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:35,510
You've been here for less
than a minute, so shut up.

1217
00:54:35,543 --> 00:54:37,344
You don't get to
tell me what to do.

1218
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,046
- Calm down.
- Oh, everyone,

1219
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,883
- stop telling me what to do.
- Okay, girl, just get a grip.

1220
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:44,018
You know what? Have a Twinkie.

1221
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:47,655
Yeah, I need to think.
Yeah, I need sugar.

1222
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,456
What do you need to think about?

1223
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:51,793
Your punishment in the trial.

1224
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,828
Oh, my God, I'm so...

1225
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,296
Wow, we're still on that?

1226
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:58,431
Okay, I'm sorry.

1227
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,401
My bad. I confess. Now what?

1228
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:04,972
Now? You get punishment.

1229
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:07,008
Banishment.

1230
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,911
- What's vanishwa?
- Ba...

1231
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:12,914
Banished! Banished!

1232
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:14,015
- Oh.
- What?

1233
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:15,415
You're kicking me out?

1234
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:16,651
- Yeah.
- She's kicking me out.

1235
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,686
I don't... I don't think so. No.

1236
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,721
- Mm-hmm, no.
- Ivanka Pump.

1237
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:24,659
For your past and
also your current crimes,

1238
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:27,895
this court finds you
unfit for society.

1239
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,697
You are hereby
banished from Sparks.

1240
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,798
Never to return.

1241
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:33,601
- Just go.
- Okay, Judge.

1242
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,571
So who exactly is
going to kick me out?

1243
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:38,005
The guys or...

1244
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,909
Well, I'm not
kicking you out, sorry.

1245
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:45,125
- It's her or me.
- Don't look... Don't look at me.

1246
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,583
- Daniel!
- No.

1247
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:51,853
Okay.

1248
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:55,488
So it's me who's unfit
for the society.

1249
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,458
I hope for the sake of humanity

1250
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:00,027
that there are others out there.

1251
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:05,432
Oh, my God. Kate, don't be such
a fucking drama queen, okay?

1252
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:06,767
You can't go outside.
You'll die.

1253
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:07,935
Yeah, I know.

1254
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,905
Well, I don't want you to die.
I love you, Kate.

1255
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:13,841
And no matter how
much you hate Ivanka,

1256
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:16,409
she's staying and so are you.

1257
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:21,048
Thank you, Daniel.
That's exactly what I needed.

1258
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:24,118
Someone to come and tell me
what I can or can't do.

1259
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:26,621
Well, you know what?
You better listen...

1260
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:28,823
You listen...

1261
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,158
Kate, are you...

1262
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:33,160
Kate, are you okay?

1263
00:56:33,194 --> 00:56:34,494
Are you...

1264
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:35,630
Are you okay?

1265
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:36,940
I'll... I'll get her some water.

1266
00:56:36,964 --> 00:56:38,431
Um, let's take her to bed.

1267
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:40,001
- The end.
- Come on, guys.

1268
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:41,712
- Help me take her to bed.
- I'll get her some water.

1269
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:43,013
No, help me take her to bed.

1270
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:44,505
It is the end.

1271
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:45,682
Come on, guys.
Help me take her to bed.

1272
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,775
Really, it is.

1273
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:49,653
- <i>This is Wanda, do you copy?</i>
- Adam, there she is.

1274
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:50,745
Come on.

1275
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,754
Wanda, can you hear me?
It's Adam.

1276
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:01,589
<i>Put Ivanka on.</i>

1277
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,991
She's not here.
She's helping Kate.

1278
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,160
<i>Ivanka's helping Kate?
With what?</i>

1279
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:07,762
Wanda, where are you?

1280
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:09,797
Where are you calling from?
Are you outside?

1281
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,566
<i>Tell that skunk, I'm
going to burn down the plane.</i>

1282
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,735
Wanda, listen to me.
You can't stay out there.

1283
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,137
You have to come in.

1284
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,772
<i>About to light the match.</i>

1285
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,140
<i>Put her on.</i>

1286
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,575
Wanda, can you hear me?
Come inside.

1287
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,145
<i>I'm wearing
the space suit. I'm fine.</i>

1288
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:26,647
We have a situation
with Kate. Come in.

1289
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,721
- Where is she?
- She's outside, I think.

1290
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:35,565
- Outside, how?
- She's wearing your spacesuit.

1291
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:37,589
She wants to burn down
your plane. Reason with her.

1292
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:41,028
Wanda. Wanda, this is Ivanka.

1293
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:43,230
Do not light a fire
near that suit.

1294
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:44,598
Can you hear me?

1295
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,670
- I'll go get her.
- Hurry.

1296
00:57:49,704 --> 00:57:52,773
Okay, I'm hurrying.

1297
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:56,110
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- Wanda? Wanda, it's Ivanka.

1298
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,045
- <i>Ivanka?</i>
- Yes.

1299
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,847
<i>I'm going to burn
down your plane.</i>

1300
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:02,917
Wanda, do not light a fire
in that suit.

1301
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,986
There's a small oxygen leak.

1302
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,954
Wanda, can you hear me?

1303
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:08,999
<i>Can't hear you.
Don't know if you can hear me.</i>

1304
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,026
<i>You took my fiancé,
I'll cut your wings off bitch.</i>

1305
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,128
- <i>Here goes nothing.</i>
- Wanda, no.

1306
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,575
Wanda?

1307
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:29,710
Wanda?

1308
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:52,800
- Kate's dead.
- What?

1309
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:55,136
- What?
- What happened?

1310
00:58:57,104 --> 00:59:01,342
I... I... I took her to bed.
She lied down.

1311
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:05,913
She just started convulsing.

1312
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:07,982
And she stopped breathing.

1313
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,585
I couldn't...
Couldn't revive her, just...

1314
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:12,920
Oh, my God.

1315
00:59:12,953 --> 00:59:14,555
I couldn't.

1316
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,192
Where's Wanda?

1317
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,936
Ivanka, your...
Your plane is fine.

1318
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:32,273
- And Wanda?
- Oh, she's dead. She exploded.

1319
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:34,275
Wanda's dead?

1320
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:36,644
- I just said that.
- No, Kate is dead.

1321
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:38,012
Oh, I know.

1322
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:41,182
- How do you know?
- Well, she was pregnant.

1323
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,917
No, she had cancer.

1324
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,351
We hear each other's thoughts.

1325
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:46,120
What the hell
are you talking about?

1326
00:59:46,153 --> 00:59:48,055
You know, I say things
and no one listens.

1327
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:50,291
I just keep repeating
myself around here.

1328
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:53,994
How do you know she's dead?

1329
00:59:54,028 --> 00:59:55,830
What do you want?
The transcript?

1330
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:57,631
Okay, look, she...

1331
00:59:57,665 --> 00:59:59,705
She reached out to me
in her thoughts and, uh, said,

1332
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,802
"Oh, I need help, I'm in pain.

1333
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:03,404
My stomach."

1334
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:06,774
- Why... Why didn't you help her?
- I... I was outside.

1335
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,909
I... I told her to let go.

1336
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,911
- Let go?
- Yeah.

1337
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:13,047
I keep... Will you stop repeating

1338
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,915
everything I say
with a question?

1339
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:17,017
It's so annoying. Annoying!

1340
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:20,688
I... What's going on?
What happened to Wanda?

1341
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:24,325
She exploded herself outside
trying to burn down my plane.

1342
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,230
Okay, Adam.

1343
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:32,032
What?

1344
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,734
No.

1345
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,105
I... I don't...

1346
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,406
I don't know what to say.

1347
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,941
Come, sit down.

1348
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:43,210
Yeah, you should sit down.

1349
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,147
Let's all sit down.

1350
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:58,859
This is a lot to process.

1351
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:02,163
It's horrific, but we have to
keep it together now.

1352
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:04,231
You!

1353
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,400
You come here,

1354
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,903
and the next thing
that happens is both girls die.

1355
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,371
How is that my fault?

1356
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:13,207
It's a pretty big coincidence.

1357
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,943
Yes, but that's exactly
what it is.

1358
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,444
- A coincidence.
- Is it?

1359
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:20,314
Guys, your friends just died.

1360
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:22,249
You can hate me
and blame me later.

1361
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,151
Okay. Right.

1362
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:25,986
Uh, we should...

1363
01:01:30,824 --> 01:01:33,093
- I don't know.
- Well, I think we should

1364
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,130
bury Kate and Wanda
and have a ceremony.

1365
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,132
You know what, I brought back
one of her shoes.

1366
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:40,067
Wanda's shoe?

1367
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:43,771
You see? You see what they say?
They repeat everything I say.

1368
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:45,472
Yeah, that's all
that's left of her.

1369
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:47,208
That... That one shoe.

1370
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:51,445
I was going to marry her.

1371
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,515
Yeah, I don't think so.

1372
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:55,015
I was, okay?

1373
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:57,318
I was just screwing
up my courage.

1374
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:59,497
Yeah, I think you were screwing
up a little bit more than that.

1375
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:00,921
That was panic.

1376
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:02,856
- Okay?
- Okay, okay. Yeah.

1377
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:05,960
Ivanka waltzes in here,

1378
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:09,029
I haven't seen another woman
apart from these two in years.

1379
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,798
So my head starts spinning.

1380
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:14,168
She comes on to me, she tells
me she wants to fuck me.

1381
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:17,171
I was... I was easy pickings.

1382
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:21,942
I feel ugly, used, dirty.

1383
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,911
Please!

1384
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:26,080
You went for it
like a pig on a truffle.

1385
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:28,282
You need to stop blaming me

1386
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:30,384
for everything that's wrong
with you and the world.

1387
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:34,822
I wanted to fuck, you wanted
to fuck me and so we did.

1388
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:36,233
There's nothing
to feel guilty about.

1389
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:37,925
Oh, I feel guilty.

1390
01:02:38,859 --> 01:02:40,427
Wanda just wanted to be with me.

1391
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,231
She just wanted to...
To be loved.

1392
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:45,799
Why did I put her through that?

1393
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:48,969
Kind of blew
the marriage up, didn't you?

1394
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:51,236
- I kind of messed...
- It's not necessary, Donald.

1395
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:54,208
What? Come on, their engagement
imploded. Am I wrong?

1396
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,352
How are you making
jokes right now?

1397
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:56,844
Okay.

1398
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,847
Donald, be sensitive, please.

1399
01:03:02,249 --> 01:03:03,951
Of course. Of course.

1400
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:07,087
I'm sorry. I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

1401
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:09,490
Sorry, Wanda.
I'm so, so sorry, really.

1402
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:11,191
I want to go see Kate.

1403
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:33,347
Ivanka.

1404
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,216
Guess what I was hired
to do here.

1405
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:38,452
Oh, run the daycare centre.

1406
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,954
- I don't know. What?
- Security.

1407
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:43,023
Oh, he's joking.

1408
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:45,326
How... How can you joke
at a time like this?

1409
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,960
Security?

1410
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,596
Yeah, computers.

1411
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,365
I was, uh, sort of a hacker,

1412
01:03:51,398 --> 01:03:56,403
hired to find breaches,
glitches in software, bugs.

1413
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:57,905
Okay.

1414
01:03:58,272 --> 01:03:59,940
Why am I
telling you this, right?

1415
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,143
- I'm following.
- I think I found a breach.

1416
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:05,913
A bug.

1417
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,658
- But all the computers are dead.
- Like my friends.

1418
01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:09,316
Where are you going
with this Daniel?

1419
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:11,285
It's you.

1420
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,154
You're the bug.

1421
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,190
Brilliant.

1422
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:17,901
- He should get a raise for that.
- Oh, yeah.

1423
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,627
You know,
just think about it, Ivanka.

1424
01:04:19,661 --> 01:04:21,261
Okay, I get it. I'm the bug.

1425
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:25,366
Everything... our system's
running smoothly.

1426
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:29,403
Then you show up,
everything goes crazy.

1427
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:31,438
The girls die,

1428
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:35,142
and you take control somehow.

1429
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:37,512
Everything starts
working in your favor.

1430
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:39,581
How is the girls dying
in my favor?

1431
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:42,015
They wanted you out, gone.

1432
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:43,384
You're dangerous.

1433
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,087
But you're attracted
to danger, aren't you?

1434
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:49,056
Sure.

1435
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:51,492
- I like a little flame.
- Okay.

1436
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:53,227
And oops,
you got a little burned

1437
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,095
and now you want
to cry about it, or...

1438
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,397
I want to put it out.

1439
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,898
That's all he could
come up with.

1440
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,167
So far.

1441
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,035
Wow, you must feel
pretty terrible

1442
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,413
knowing that
there was danger around

1443
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:05,239
and you let it
kill your friends.

1444
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:06,541
I feel plenty bad about it,

1445
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,976
but I'm not done
figuring you out yet.

1446
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:11,011
Okay, smarty pants.
What's my next move?

1447
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:14,448
You're going to come
after me or Adam?

1448
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,985
What?
And lose such gifted lovers?

1449
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,322
I don't know what
your end game is,

1450
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:24,258
but I'm not going
to lose to you again.

1451
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,527
No.

1452
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:28,195
I want to strike a deal.

1453
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:31,566
- You want me to go after Adam?
- No.

1454
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:34,001
I want you to go after me.

1455
01:05:34,536 --> 01:05:36,970
- I'm confused.
- That's good.

1456
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:39,124
- Just get to the point, Daniel.
- Tell me everything.

1457
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,442
I'll go away.

1458
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:46,246
What do you think,
Donald, of our friend

1459
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,348
Sherlock Holmes here
and his little deal?

1460
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,528
Well, I'm not going
to beat around the bush.

1461
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:52,986
- You never do.
- No, I just grab it.

1462
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,222
I think he's on to something.

1463
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:58,058
So why don't we just tell him
what he wants to know,

1464
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:01,195
and then he's got to go. Deal?

1465
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:05,667
You're in on it. Of course.

1466
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,536
I'm behind it. I'm Donald Pump.

1467
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:12,406
The cat version.

1468
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,209
No, the real thing.

1469
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,978
But you're a cat.

1470
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:22,349
Yes, it's a necessary
temporary transition.

1471
01:06:22,784 --> 01:06:25,052
I want to be with
my daughter, you see.

1472
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:27,321
I don't see.

1473
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:32,226
This place is a dump, trust me.

1474
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,028
I mean, why do you think
we're here?

1475
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:37,231
Because... Because of us.

1476
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:39,534
Because we're the...
The last survivor.

1477
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:41,769
Right, yeah.
You're the last people on Earth.

1478
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,506
That's right. We... We spent
two years looking for you.

1479
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:46,373
We had the entire army
looking for you.

1480
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,108
- You have an army?
- Yeah.

1481
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:50,678
Grasshoppers, ex-marines.

1482
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:53,413
- Yeah.
- Well, why are you...

1483
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:55,349
Why kill everyone? What?

1484
01:06:56,818 --> 01:06:59,353
I want to be with my daughter.

1485
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:03,591
- You keep saying that.
- I've been saying it for years.

1486
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:09,329
Oh, you want to be
"together" together?

1487
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:14,134
We do. But...
But I want it to be right. Yeah.

1488
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:18,506
So you're killing
everyone in the world

1489
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,407
so you can be together
without guilt?

1490
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:22,476
That's nice,
it's a good thought,

1491
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,779
but I think it's maybe
a little bit more than that.

1492
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:28,081
Good, because
that's fucking pathetic.

1493
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:33,086
I hated the world.
Didn't you, Dan?

1494
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,622
Sure, sure.

1495
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:37,659
It had its problems,
but nothing compared to now.

1496
01:07:37,692 --> 01:07:41,361
We could spend lifetimes,
generations trying to fix it.

1497
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,463
And I'm telling you,
we would fail.

1498
01:07:43,497 --> 01:07:46,199
- Do you understand?
- I don't understand.

1499
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:48,870
Look, the only way
forward for all of us

1500
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:51,171
is to start over from scratch.

1501
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:54,576
From one man and one
woman from the ground floor.

1502
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:56,343
And I had the plan.

1503
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,580
Don't you see, Daniel?
That's my plan.

1504
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,314
My plan, Daniel. Don't you see?

1505
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:03,685
To push the reset button,
to make it great again.

1506
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:11,124
I'm so ashamed.

1507
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:14,227
Oh, come on.
Why are you ashamed, Daniel?

1508
01:08:16,564 --> 01:08:17,699
I voted for you.

1509
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:19,333
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Dan.

1510
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:20,768
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, alright.

1511
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:22,102
You know what?

1512
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:25,372
We don't expect you
to understand our vision.

1513
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,543
- I don't think he could.
- No, probably not.

1514
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:31,345
It's demonic that you...
You think that

1515
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,681
you've done humanity
some kind of favor.

1516
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:36,751
This reboot of yours,
what gave you the right?

1517
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,219
Your vote.

1518
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:42,557
I should just kill you both.

1519
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:45,526
Oh, but, you know, then

1520
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,596
the army would have to
come after you and Adam,

1521
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,430
and that would be
the end of humanity.

1522
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:51,899
Do you really want that on you?

1523
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:54,234
It's a little
more on you, really.

1524
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:58,673
Look, we're going to start over.

1525
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:03,143
A new beginning, a new chapter,
whether you like it or not.

1526
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,513
Well, why not just
get it over with?

1527
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:09,182
Kill everybody.
Why all the fucking games?

1528
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,451
Well, we like to have fun.

1529
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:13,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1530
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,624
- Like a cat and a mouse.
- Ah, exactly, see, he gets it.

1531
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:18,593
Yeah.

1532
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,828
Right, okay, so go ahead.

1533
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,899
Kill us all. Get it over with.

1534
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:27,802
Present sucks.
The future's not worth shit.

1535
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,672
Yeah, but see,
that would be too messy.

1536
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:34,474
You know, us killing you,
it has to be better than that.

1537
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:36,276
- Yeah.
- I'm not going to kill myself.

1538
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:37,521
I won't give you
the satisfaction.

1539
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:39,312
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1540
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,685
- We'll have Adam do it.
- He won't.

1541
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,255
Looks like you missed the bug.

1542
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:50,390
Oops.

1543
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:53,828
Adam's with you?

1544
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:56,229
He does what he's told.

1545
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:57,865
- He's a good boy.
- No.

1546
01:09:58,766 --> 01:10:00,333
What have you done with Adam?

1547
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:02,335
Why don't you ask him yourself?

1548
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,204
Honey baby?

1549
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:08,552
Adam, what have
they done to you?

1550
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:09,844
What? Nothing.

1551
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:11,846
They just...
They explained things.

1552
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:13,915
What did they explain?

1553
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:16,574
I don't know, didn't they
explain things to you?

1554
01:10:16,818 --> 01:10:18,461
- Yeah.
- So they killed everybody.

1555
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:20,888
- Now it's just you or me.
- You're gonna kill me?

1556
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:22,900
- Or... Or you me.
- I'm not going to kill.

1557
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:24,391
We don't have to do
what they say.

1558
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:25,727
Well, we sort of do.

1559
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,403
Daniel, you can kill Adam
anytime you like.

1560
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:28,672
- I don't like.
- I mean, I would...

1561
01:10:28,696 --> 01:10:30,497
I'd prefer that he kill you,

1562
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:33,333
because then the last man
on earth is called Adam.

1563
01:10:33,366 --> 01:10:35,335
Sort of like the first
man on earth, right?

1564
01:10:35,368 --> 01:10:37,370
Like in the bible,
you know, circular.

1565
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:39,974
It's poetic.
I don't know. You get it.

1566
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,976
Let's just kill them both.

1567
01:10:43,644 --> 01:10:45,412
But that would mean
the real end of humanity.

1568
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:46,814
The good end.

1569
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:48,850
Where all the evil is dead.

1570
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:50,317
Yeah, but then their children

1571
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,953
and their children's children,

1572
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,530
a thousand years from now,
things would be great again.

1573
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:55,757
No, no. It'll be worse.

1574
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,592
Their utopian dream is fake.

1575
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,359
- Believe me.
- It'll never work.

1576
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:01,929
It'll work. It's all been
carefully thought out by me.

1577
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:03,430
So it's going to work.

1578
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:04,866
I don't care. I mean, whatever.

1579
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:06,968
Just get on with it.
One of you has got to go.

1580
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,738
What happens to the last one?

1581
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:13,440
- Oh, he becomes the witness.
- The witness?

1582
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:15,475
Yeah, so he can see
the end of the world.

1583
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,345
What do you need a witness for?

1584
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,515
- Yeah, like an audience.
- He needs an audience.

1585
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:23,283
Yeah, no, need is a big word.
I like.

1586
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:29,456
I'm sorry, Daniel.

1587
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:31,926
At this point, they have the
better story, the better plan.

1588
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,694
So you ready to kill me?

1589
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:36,597
Yes.
I'm sorry, Daniel. I see no...

1590
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:38,533
I see no other choice.

1591
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:42,703
And finally, the jury
has reached its verdict.

1592
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,639
- Come on, Dan.
- I thought we were friends.

1593
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:46,473
Just take it outside, guys.
Come on.

1594
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:48,009
How are you going to kill me?

1595
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,476
With this.

1596
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,445
It's the Twinkie.

1597
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,784
It is fast. Painful, but fast.

1598
01:11:57,885 --> 01:11:59,020
- Come on.
- No.

1599
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,489
You know what?
I'm glad to die.

1600
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:05,126
I don't want to live in this
place you've made any more.

1601
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:08,395
It's... It... This place is shit.

1602
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:12,767
It's not worth living in.

1603
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,803
Oh, it's going to be beautiful.
Trust me.

1604
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:19,907
I could never kill you.

1605
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:22,661
I don't know... I don't know
what they've done to you.

1606
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:25,046
This is hard on me too, Dan.

1607
01:12:27,882 --> 01:12:29,517
Come on.

1608
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,786
I'll eat the fucking Twinkie.

1609
01:12:32,485 --> 01:12:34,131
Well, come on back down
when you're done, Adam.

1610
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,957
We have a spacesuit
fitted for you.

1611
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,025
It's real nice.

1612
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:41,662
Well, it's done.

1613
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:44,832
Zero Fucks, your master plan.

1614
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:47,768
Oh, it was beautiful to watch.

1615
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:50,104
And a new world begins,
our world.

1616
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:52,073
We finally get
to be together, Daddy.

1617
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,908
Oh, my darling.

1618
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,753
- Eat it.
- Don't make me do this, man.

1619
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:07,454
Don't make me eat
that fucking Twinkie.

1620
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:10,191
Eat it.

1621
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:12,425
Why do you want to kill me?

1622
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:15,529
I don't want to eat it,
I don't want to make you eat it.

1623
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:18,498
This is hard on me, too, Daniel.

1624
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:23,037
Did you see her? She's gorgeous.

1625
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:27,440
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, Adam, you're really...

1626
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:31,579
You're going to... You're going
to kill me on no pants day?

1627
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:34,048
Oh, but I thought...

1628
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:36,517
You're going to kill
me on no pants day, Adam?

1629
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:39,887
Don't you bring that up now.
Don't you bring up no pants day.

1630
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,454
God, I love no pants day.

1631
01:13:41,488 --> 01:13:44,191
- I hate no pants day.
- What?

1632
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:47,995
- I like Frank whistle Wednesday.
- Why do you hate no pants day?

1633
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:50,463
Because I have a tiny penis.

1634
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:54,035
I have a tinier penis than you.

1635
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,904
But Kate loves you...
Your... your tiny penis, bro.

1636
01:13:57,638 --> 01:14:00,473
- Don't you bring that up.
- Tiny-Mighty!

1637
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,543
- I'll show you Tiny-Mighty.
- No.

1638
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,012
- I'll show you Tiny-Mighty.
- No.

1639
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:06,647
I'm not eating.

1640
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,883
Eat it. Eat the Twinkie.

1641
01:14:12,153 --> 01:14:13,988
Mr. Pump,
this is Steve reporting.

1642
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:18,225
- Steve, are we ready to go?
- Yes sir.

1643
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:20,027
Ship's ready to move.

1644
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:21,963
Well, shall we go?

1645
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:27,568
Attaboy.
