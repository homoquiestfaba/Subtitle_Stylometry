1
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,321
Christmas traditions.

2
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,055
Candy canes!

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,689
Presents!

4
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:31,659
New inventions to make the season bright!

5
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,162
Little thing l've been working on.

6
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,032
Yes, we have all of the usual traditions!

7
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,365
Gingerbread houses,

8
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,699
wreathes,

9
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,034
caroling,

10
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,369
stockings.

11
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:48,180
Oh, but the Royal Christmas Tree
is much more than a tradition.

12
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,282
You see, every ornament on our tree
is a memory,

13
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,853
a memory of a kindness
or of a thoughtful deed.

14
00:01:56,915 --> 00:02:01,692
lndeed, the ornaments
represent centuries of goodness,

15
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:07,498
a timeless record of the best we've done
throughout the years,

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,699
gratefully hung upon our tree.

17
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,633
And so it goes.

18
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:18,509
This Christmas, new ornaments
will honor new deeds of kindness.

19
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,712
And each unique creation holds within it

20
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:27,084
the very spirit of Christmas.

21
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,818
Oh, nice tradition, you say?

22
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,852
Nay, my friend,

23
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:37,061
for us,
the Royal Christmas Tree is Christmas.

24
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:55,845
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

25
00:02:55,908 --> 00:03:00,284
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

26
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,318
Come on, Jean-Bob. Sing along!

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,089
l'm boycotting, zank you very much!

28
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,624
Well, l love Christmas!

29
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,092
Me, too.

30
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,229
Take it easy and slow down.

31
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:18,135
Oh, sure, 'cause ze rest of ze year
you're busy as a beaver

32
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,266
pelt!

33
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,339
Well, someone woke up
on the wrong side of the lily pad.

34
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,707
Spring is ze season of love!

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,975
Ze chances of me getting ze kiss

36
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,115
zat will turn me back into a prince
at Christmas are almost zip!

37
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,318
Down from the usual one in a million.

38
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,383
Come on, fellas!

39
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,420
Can't hear you back there!

40
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:43,759
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

41
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,428
Number 9!

42
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,763
A little warning Rothbart, please!

43
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:53,469
Are you sure Derek and Odette are coming?

44
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,603
Unfortunately, yes!

45
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,240
Same plan as always then,

46
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,341
iust get his attention,

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:05,516
and soon, Derek will follow you
right into my trap.

48
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:11,056
Then l'll have my revenge on him
for doing away with me.

49
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:16,427
So, when he shows up, don't move.

50
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,993
Easy for you to say, Ghost Man!

51
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,494
You're already dead!

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,169
l've only got one life left,
and trouble always seems to...

53
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,836
...come my way!

54
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,306
Eyes on the prize, Number 9.

55
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:38,084
Remember, once l get my body back,
l'm giving you an extra life.

56
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,985
Don't move.

57
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,922
lf you say so.

58
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,028
...to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

59
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,964
Christmas has the best holiday music,
don't you think?

60
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,201
-Much better than Pumpkin Awareness Day.
-Pumpkin!

61
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,202
Do l have that on the list?

62
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,038
lt's gotta be on there somewhere.

63
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,673
Oh, here it is.

64
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,908
l have to make pumpkin pie for the widows.

65
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:08,974
Whoa!

66
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,622
Ya know, l've been seeing this cat a lot lately,
except without all the ice.

67
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,687
Shoo, little fella, shoo.

68
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,489
Go on.

69
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,696
That was kind of creepy.

70
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,867
On the other hand,
he did stop us in the right spot.

71
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,569
Mistletoe?

72
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,505
l don't know how it is in your kingdom,

73
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,010
but our tradition says...

74
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,745
l know all about that tradition.

75
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,649
Merry Christmas, Derek.

76
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:54,157
How come no one ever told me
about zis mistletoe business before?

77
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,964
Zis changes everything! Everybody sing!

78
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,569
Over ze river and through ze woods
To Uberta's house we go

79
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:12,510
l'll get a big kiss right on ze lips
And poof! l'm a frog no mo-oh

80
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,350
Cookie.

81
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,949
l can't!

82
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:27,391
Uberta told me to blow the horn
the very moment l see Derek's sleigh,

83
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,857
or else...

84
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,697
You've used up all my pucker!

85
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,101
l can't blow the horn if l've lost my pucker!

86
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,700
Silly puppy!

87
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:43,004
Smoochie give you extra pucker!

88
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,805
No, it...

89
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,007
He's coming.

90
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,414
Wow. Listen to that!

91
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,315
Give that guy a promotion.

92
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,199
They're playing our song.

93
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,638
Yeah, those have to be
one of Lord Rogers' inventions.

94
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,173
And iust look at the swans!

95
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,540
Now, that's all Mom.

96
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,475
Every year she chooses a Christmas theme.

97
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,380
And this year it's
''A Swan Princess Christmas.''

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,646
Wow.

99
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,149
l'm really impressed with your mother.

100
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,017
Yeah.

101
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,620
There's something
you should know about Mom.

102
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,722
There's actually two Ubertas.

103
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,225
The regular Uberta, the one you know...

104
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,663
Derek and Odette!

105
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,700
Your first Christmas together!

106
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,902
...and then there's Christmas Uberta.

107
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,507
Okay folks, let's move it!
We've got a lot of work to do!

108
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,642
She's very focused.

109
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,708
Derek!

110
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,879
The tree! Move!

111
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,549
Odette, you're with me!

112
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,355
l mean this way, darling!

113
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,090
And Chamberlain!

114
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,058
Yes, madam.

115
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,462
Let all the staff know,

116
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,568
it's time to bring up the ornaments
for Ornament Day!

117
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,502
l iust love it!

118
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,774
Wow, Rogers. Love the chimes.

119
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,843
Oh, had a little spare time.

120
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,680
You again?

121
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:45,496
And now if you'll excuse me,
Operation Smoochfest is underway.

122
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,432
You remember
the last Operation Smoochfest?

123
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,336
Oh, yeah. Operation Smushfest.

124
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,818
-Okay, l'm headed down to the cellar.
-Good.

125
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,987
Now, the thing you're looking for is...

126
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,622
There's people down here.

127
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,059
So what? They don't care about you.

128
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,596
Oh, really? l'm a black cat!

129
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,962
So?

130
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,934
l lost four of my eight lives
just by crossing people's paths!

131
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,634
Get down there.

132
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,579
You get to carry the Royal Star!

133
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,848
l shall carry it with pride.

134
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,521
Yes, but with both hands, please.

135
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,586
Oh, sorry.

136
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,659
-All boxes checky-check!
-Good, good, good.

137
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,927
When Derek returns with the tree,

138
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:57,134
we'll be ready for Ornament Day.

139
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,467
That mean you call kingdom to castle.

140
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,635
Yes.

141
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,008
Someone need pucker practice!

142
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,778
Are you moving or not?

143
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,247
Well, kisses don't last forever.

144
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,984
At least l hope not.

145
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,192
Get me out of here!

146
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,729
Thanks for breaking that up, chief. Yuck.

147
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,564
Now. Move it!

148
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,068
Against the back wall to the right!

149
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,535
You're lucky.

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,005
Most cats don't know right from left.

151
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,474
-Found it!
-Excellent.

152
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,910
Now, get Derek.

153
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,846
That's the best part! We don't need him.

154
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,713
The lock's got a key!

155
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,183
No! Don't open it!

156
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,319
lt can't be you.

157
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,857
Derek's the one who sent me out of this life.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,527
He's the only one who can let me back in.

159
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,598
lf it's anyone else, that's it for both of us.

160
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,767
Oh, so it's back to Plan A then, huh?

161
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,872
Get Derek's attention, lead him
to the cellar, yadda, yadda, yadda.

162
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:15,579
lt's gonna be the worst Christmas present
he ever opened.

163
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,847
There.

164
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,319
Oh, the orphans are going to love it!

165
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,988
l sure hope
that's on your Christmas list, Princess.

166
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,025
Shouldn't you be
cutting down a tree or something?

167
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,358
Yes, he should!

168
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,425
You're late!

169
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,994
-Now mush.
-Right.

170
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,399
Odette. Follow.

171
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,671
Oh, sorry. That was Christmas Uberta.

172
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,710
Last year we found
the Royal Christmas Tree here,

173
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,882
but this year, l think this is the spot.

174
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,949
lce Leopard Pass?

175
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,552
Too dangerous?

176
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,024
Oh, no, not dangerous enough!

177
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,024
l was going to suggest Grizzly Falls,

178
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,931
but if you'd feel safer in Ice Leopard Pass,
then all right.

179
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,300
Remember, it's all about more lives.

180
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
No!

181
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,977
What's this?

182
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,781
lce Leopard Pass.

183
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,382
We might see a cat.

184
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,830
lt's Christmas.

185
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,435
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

186
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,670
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

187
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,373
'Tis the season to be jolly

188
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,642
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

189
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:59,550
Don we now our gay apparel
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

190
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:05,323
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

191
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,491
Wow! Really amazing!

192
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,229
Just wait until you see
Lord Rogers' little group.

193
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,042
Hark, the herald angels sing

194
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,047
Glory to the newborn King

195
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,251
Peace on earth, and mercy mild

196
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,555
God and sinners reconciled

197
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:42,892
Joyful, all ye nations rise

198
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,562
Join the triumph of the skies

199
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,533
Hark, the herald angels sing

200
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,804
Glory to the newborn King

201
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,113
And now, here's why l wanted you to see it.

202
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,616
You, see, it's all part
of a Christmas Eve celebration!

203
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,517
-Yes. And...
-And we were thinking...

204
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,621
Let the Queen speak, please.

205
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,887
That we would like you, Odette...

206
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,161
Hello! Real crown here! Not a toy!

207
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,926
Yeah. Sorry.

208
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,566
We'd like you, Odette, to arrange,
rehearse and choreograph...

209
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,034
Your very own number for Christmas Eve!

210
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,002
Rogers!

211
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,707
-My very own number?
-Oh, dear

212
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,643
she's so grateful she can't speak.

213
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,444
You can thank us later, dear.

214
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,981
Thank you,

215
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,353
l think.

216
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,763
The Royal Tree is down there somewhere,
Brom. Time to strap on the skis.

217
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,565
lt's time for me to get...

218
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,737
Don't worry,
l'll keep a look out for predators.

219
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,238
Brom?

220
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,177
Oh, l don't care if predators see me.

221
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,945
And you have every reason to feel that way.

222
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,416
What's that thing?

223
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,521
Snowboard. Rogers' latest invention.

224
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,588
lt's faster. Better.

225
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,695
Well, old-fashioned skis
are fast enough for me.

226
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,204
l'm glad to hear that.

227
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,804
lce leopard?

228
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,116
Okay, okay, eat the round one, please.
l need the other guy.

229
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,950
Move out, Brom. l've got your back.

230
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,351
But keep an eye out.

231
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,487
They hunt in pairs.

232
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,056
Pairs!

233
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,301
Unbelievable.

234
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,651
Goodbye, life!

235
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,158
Hello, life! Signing off!

236
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,796
Signing on!

237
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,896
Still good.

238
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,014
l don't wanna miss Christmas dinner!

239
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,151
Nice and safe.

240
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,856
Where's the brakes?

241
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,494
Oh, no.

242
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,530
Derek!

243
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,645
Mommy!

244
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:48,339
Oh, yeah, he's a born killer.

245
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,140
Okay, iust settle down!

246
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:57,515
Yeah, he took down two ice leopards,
while he was moving!

247
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,816
Look, look, l'll give ya three new lives! four!

248
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,085
Now way! l'm out!

249
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,618
Wait! Wait!

250
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,723
five new lives then! Six!

251
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,995
Okay, nine new lives,

252
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,532
if you get Derek to open the chest.

253
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,136
From one to nine in one little leap.

254
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,607
Mistletoe properly positioned.

255
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,378
Breath neutralized.

256
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,647
Target located.

257
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,020
Are you sure this is a good idea, Jean-Bob?

258
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,155
She has lips. l have ze mistletoe.

259
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,490
What could go wrong?

260
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,093
He should wait for answers.

261
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:01,010
Fellas, l am iust swamped.

262
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,213
Can you help me come up with a number
for the Christmas Eve party?

263
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:08,852
Well, as soon as our very little friend
comes to his very little senses.

264
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,550
Oh, dear.

265
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:20,063
Don't know how it is with your people,
but our tradition says...

266
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,299
You're good.

267
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,368
l get lots of practice.

268
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:32,743
Evidently, some people have no respect
for Christmas traditions!

269
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,376
Evidently, you're a frog.

270
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,279
Zat's not why l can't get smooches!

271
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,216
Christmas is ze reason!

272
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:45,188
Jean-Bob, that's it! Christmas is the Reason.

273
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,655
l love that song!

274
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,492
And l love you, Jean-Bob.

275
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:57,168
Zis one loves me. Zat one wants to kill me.
Ze world is a very confusing place.

276
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,574
Oh, it's a beauty, isn't it, Rogers?

277
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,343
Can't you haul that thing any faster?

278
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,745
Oops. Sorry.

279
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:17,321
Now, Uberta,
instead of lighting the tree with candles,

280
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:22,192
this year please consider
my newest invention.

281
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,690
What is it?

282
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,063
l call it the light bulb.

283
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,198
lt'll never catch on.

284
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,767
Get the candles ready. Chop, chop!

285
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:40,011
May l request a second opinion
from regular Uberta?

286
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,446
Oh, all right! Just get cracking.

287
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,322
lt's Ornament Day!

288
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,990
lt's Ornament Day.

289
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,895
lt's Ornament Day!

290
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,774
Have you seen Prince Derek?

291
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,108
Probably working on his ornament!

292
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,677
lt is Ornament Day.

293
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,645
Ornament Day?

294
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,683
Bells ring!

295
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:25,654
Hearts sing!

296
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:32,097
Come see what love brings!

297
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:38,536
Pictures tell a story
of two hearts full of love

298
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:43,941
They're sharing a memory
of caring and tender rejoicing

299
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:49,647
lt's the season of love
that comes at Christmastime!

300
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,546
We live it

301
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,181
Love it

302
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,049
Beg it to come

303
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,752
-And want it to stay
-And want it to stay

304
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,457
To have this season each day

305
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:06,397
lt's the season of love

306
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:12,402
Lulu's lost her luster
Will you help make her shine?

307
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,276
Ajewel in this spot
and your coin in your pocket for Christmas!

308
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:24,216
lt's the kind acts of love
that make a Christmas shine

309
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,779
We're lighter

310
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,148
Brighter

311
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:29,284
Wiser by far

312
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,154
Because we follow that star

313
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,657
Because we find who we are

314
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,528
ln the season of love

315
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,032
Bells are rung

316
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,501
Carols sung

317
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,968
lt's begun

318
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:52,342
Our glad Christmas-tide

319
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:58,183
But when l give a gift from my heart

320
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:03,454
Then Christmas has finally arrived

321
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:09,960
There's a magic that takes
the fear out of living

322
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,462
When you have it
there's peace in your heart

323
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,664
That's what it does

324
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,438
There's a magic that's found
when you're giving

325
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,408
And it's here
in the season of love

326
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:32,884
There's a magic
that takes the fear out of living

327
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:37,020
When you have it
there's peace in your heart

328
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,921
That's what it does

329
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:44,294
There's a magic that's found
when you're giving

330
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:48,665
And it's here
in the season of love

331
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:56,907
My friends, Lord Rogers
will light the tree on Christmas Eve

332
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,174
with his newest invention,

333
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:02,144
-the light ball!
-Bulb!

334
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,450
And now, to conclude Ornament Day,

335
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:10,685
we will place the Royal Star!

336
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,625
lt's gone!

337
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,131
But it was in the box, l saw it!

338
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
-You checky-check, right?
-Me checky-check!

339
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,101
See! She checky-check!

340
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,769
You checky-check me checky-check!

341
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,208
Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll find it. l'll iust go

342
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:32,271
checky-check one more time.

344
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,157
Oh, you've got something to do with this,
you creepy little cat.

345
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,060
At least he doesn't have his bow...

346
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,130
Wait! Now he's going to kill me
with his bare hands!

347
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,764
Not so fast!

348
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,368
He's on my flattened tail!

349
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,743
Oh, great. A matching set.

350
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,919
Yeah, open it.

351
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,330
How did... That's weird.

352
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:44,781
On the first day of Christmas
Prince Derek gave to me

353
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,518
A way back to earth

354
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,686
You're still a ghost?

355
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,189
Not for long.

356
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,260
l'm gonna so mess with people.

357
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,626
Check this out.

358
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,803
Wait, wait...

359
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,240
Wait.

360
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,208
So, when do l get my nine lives?

361
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,843
Once a year? Lump sum?

362
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:21,619
Hey, l gotta get my own body back
before you get any new lives.

363
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,987
What? That's false advertising!
You never said...

364
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,321
You never asked me, Fuzzy.

365
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:33,031
Besides, l couldn't do it now,
even if l had the ol' bag o' bones.

366
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,497
-What?
-The only thing more powerful

367
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,869
than the Forbidden Arts
is the spirit at Christmas.

368
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,705
At Christmas, l ain't got much iuice.

369
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,440
Would l lie?

370
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,246
All right, whatever.

371
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:55,852
So this is when you decide to come back?
When you're at your weakest?

372
00:26:56,316 --> 00:27:00,123
Well, you have to come back at Christmas

373
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,458
if you want to destroy Christmas.

374
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,526
Destroy Christmas?

375
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:08,163
You can't even give me extra lives!

376
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,030
True.

377
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:16,207
But l can cast one itty bitty spell at a time.

378
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,843
lf l play it right, Christmas will fall,

379
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,113
along with Derek and Odette.

380
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:27,547
Dang.

381
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:32,189
Crushing this would have put
a really nice button on that speech.

382
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,224
But, of course, Odette!

383
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,362
How can you possibly do a Christmas song
without singers?

384
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,761
lndeed!

385
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:46,403
You can borrow as many
of my sopranos and altos as you like.

386
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,738
And l'm happy to lend you
my tenors and basses.

387
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,672
That's very unselfish of you.

388
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,943
Oh, dear, it's no trouble at all.

389
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,176
Not in the least.

390
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,483
ln fact, Rogers, l'd like to borrow
a few baritones myself.

391
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,184
Of course you can...

392
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,517
-Not.
-What?

393
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:09,325
l know what you're up to,
you baritone-napper!

394
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,627
And who's had their eyes on my altos?

395
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,295
Me!

396
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,636
My eyes, but not my ears
because they sound like alley cats!

397
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,002
Now, wait.

398
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,903
You're iealous!

399
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,271
You're iealous-er!

400
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:28,078
How could l be iealous
of such sad silly ninnies!

401
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:32,015
We'll see who sounds like sad ninnies,
silly Sally!

402
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,079
Please!

403
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:36,051
Let the competition begin!

404
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,987
You're going down, Hairdo!

405
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,356
Bring it on, Pipe Cleaner!

406
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,498
You stay two steps behind me.

407
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,965
Don't count on it!

408
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,667
Get back! Get... Get back!

409
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,038
Move your bouncing bustle out of my way!

410
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,404
Stop pulling on my dress!

411
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,706
Did that iust happen?

412
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:00,039
Oh, believe it, sister.

414
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:45,254
Someone hasn't been showing
much Christmas spirit.

415
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,925
Hey, Number 9, it worked!

416
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:53,963
Man, is it great to be back.

417
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,366
Oh, great!

418
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:05,606
Rothbart!

419
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,023
l'll iust be on my way.

420
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,919
He's back. And l let him in.

421
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,786
That cat led me here.

422
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,855
How did l not see this?

423
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,523
Master Hunter!

424
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:04,032
l might not be able to see you now.

425
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:10,375
But l will hunt you down,
and send you back where you belong.

426
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,210
Are you sure?

427
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:19,015
l heard him. l saw him.

428
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:23,453
The chimes made him visible,
they seemed to hold him.

429
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:28,091
Yes. Because they represent Christmas.

430
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,756
And you.

431
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,392
But what does he want?

432
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,594
l think l know!

433
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,566
Your mother and Rogers are suddenly
fighting about the Christmas Eve party!

434
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,631
Yes.

435
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,469
He said, ''lt worked.''

436
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:44,773
He's using the Forbidden Arts
to destroy the Christmas spirit!

437
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,742
-We've got to tell them.
-No.

438
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:50,746
lt won't do any good
while they're under the spell.

439
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,916
This has to stay between us for now.

440
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,352
Okay, Derek's onto us.

441
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,122
So, a little brainstorming session!

442
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,793
Spells that will destroy the Christmas spirit!

443
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:07,296
Right. Before Derek can catch you or me.

444
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,630
You're lucky, most cats can't write.

445
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:15,006
Okay! There are no bad ideas
so just let it flow.

446
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,336
Great, great! How's this? How's this?

447
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,339
The little chef guy,

448
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:23,181
make him make bad decisions
with all his little Christmas creations!

449
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,747
You call that an idea?

450
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:32,055
Okay, how about this spell?

451
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,858
Christmas cheer drives the frog berserk!

452
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,027
l got better ideas in my elbow.

453
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,393
How about this?

454
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,461
Christmas gifts.

455
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,900
Odette, she's got incredibly bad taste!

456
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,534
For the next parade!

457
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,838
l can't cast a spell on Derek or Odette.

458
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,207
They got too much Christmas spirit.

459
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,708
Come on, Number 9!

460
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,713
You said there were no bad ideas!

461
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,413
There ain't!

462
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,220
But there sure are a lot of lousy ones.

463
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:08,254
Where you going?

464
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:11,160
Brainstorming is for dumbbells.

465
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:14,563
l'm better shooting from the hip anyhow.

466
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,502
Derek!

467
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,939
Find me another way in!

468
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:57,873
lt's a chime convention out there!

469
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,275
Clever boy, Derek.

470
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:05,216
But the castle ain't the only place
l can destroy Christmas.

471
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,652
Enioy it while you can.

472
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:26,237
Jolly old St. Nicholas
Lean your ear this way

473
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:32,009
Don't you tell a single soul
what l'm going to say

474
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,808
What l'm going to say

475
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,745
Oh, dear, that's too cute.

476
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,746
You bet it is, Beanpole!

477
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,950
l obiect! We've never used animals before.

478
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:43,150
Sue me.

479
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:46,221
Tell me if you can

480
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,058
Merry Christmas.

481
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,926
Yes!

482
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:56,365
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yay!

483
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,837
Zis is ridiculous!

484
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:07,344
Lord Rogers said
we're essential in upping the cute factor.

485
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:10,278
l hate being used for my good looks.

486
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:12,146
What's in it for me?

487
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,353
Time to get my angel on.

488
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,457
Hit it!

489
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,967
Angels we have heard on high

490
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:36,240
Sweetly singing o'er the plains

491
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:42,147
And the mountains in reply
Echoing theirjoyous strains

492
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,209
Oops!

493
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,451
-Gloria
-Gloria

494
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,019
Two animals!

495
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:58,530
ln excelsis Deo

496
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,592
Angels

497
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,595
Well done!

498
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:06,135
You're going down, sister!

499
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,807
Wait, wait, stop!

500
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,812
Down! Stop!

501
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:23,953
Oh, cruel universe!

502
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:27,355
You may think you've trumped me, Rogers,

503
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,657
but there's one thing you forgot.

504
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,392
l know where to get

505
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,492
a zebra.

506
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,530
And l'm not afraid to use it!

507
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:39,401
Your zebra is no match for my

508
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,069
flamingos!

509
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:43,638
Flamingos, eh?

510
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,907
l'd be scared if l didn't have

511
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:48,243
a Shetland pony!

512
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,842
You wouldn't!

513
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:54,217
Oh, l'm that crazy! Believe me!

514
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,025
l didn't want to have to do this.

515
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,091
Rogers, careful.

516
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,860
But you leave me no choice!

517
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,462
Think of future generations!

518
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,631
-l'm bringing in...
-No.

519
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:18,708
-...baby pandas!
-No!

520
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:29,020
You want the children
to sing for the Christmas Eve party?

521
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,116
l do.

522
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:34,591
But first, l'll have to set up a little audition,
ifthat's okay.

523
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,392
Well, okay, then.

524
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:39,926
Wonderful.

525
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:43,399
Now, l knowiust the song
l want you to learn.

526
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:44,932
lt goes something like this.

527
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:51,607
Christmas is the reason for the season...

528
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:54,343
...when Jesus Christ was born

529
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,113
Oh, they know that one real well.

530
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:01,150
Then what do you say
we take a ride to the castle

531
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:03,184
in the Royal Sleigh?

532
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,257
-Merry Christmas.
-And to you, sir.

533
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:10,957
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

534
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:17,033
-Give my best to your dear wife.
-Don't worry, l'll carry it.

535
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:22,306
Bleh! Good thing l'm a ghost,
or l'd be puking!

536
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,340
What a fine goose!

537
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:31,180
For that price it better lay golden eggs.

538
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:39,091
God rest you merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

539
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,321
Hold on.

540
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,257
-Hold it.
-What's this?

541
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,060
You try singing next to Marvin.

542
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,028
He's flat as a pancake!

543
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,030
Well, better than being sharp as a stick!

544
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,899
Then l'd poke you in the ribs
to get you on pitch.

545
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,067
Oh, leave him alone, would you?

546
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:56,338
Now, that's music, boys.

547
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,209
Wish me luck.

548
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,915
lf it goes well,
remember it was my suggestion.

549
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:08,717
lf it goes bad, it was his idea.

550
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,220
l hope you like it.

551
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,493
lf you have any suggestions, please.

552
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:25,371
Christmas is the reason for the season
when Jesus Christ was born

553
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:28,604
Christmas is a reason for love on earth

554
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,742
Oh, bless that happy morn

555
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:38,850
Peace and love, goodwill toward men
In praise we sing this day

556
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:44,789
His blessed birth in Bethlehem
The life, the truth, the way

557
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:49,792
Christmas is the reason
for the season when...

558
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,234
Holy brown out.

559
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:04,405
Don't look at me!

560
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:07,309
Derek and Odette!

561
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,576
The chimes!

562
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:15,183
So unsatisfying!

563
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,653
His blessed birth in Bethlehem

564
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,890
The light, the truth, the way

565
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,268
These children should definitely be
the Christmas Eve grand finale,

566
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,301
don't you agree, Rogers?

567
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:38,475
Without question! The only thing cuter
than the animals are these

568
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,573
children!

569
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,941
Yes.

570
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,945
And they're all mine.

571
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:46,513
And no one else's.

572
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:50,220
You would take all ofthem?
You slithering serpent!

573
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,820
Back away, Pencil Neck!

574
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,659
Fork over Freckles and Pigtails,
and no one gets hurt.

575
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,460
What's gotten into you two?

576
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:02,797
Odette's right! You can't iust cast us aside!

577
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:13,744
Back online! Whew, Momma! That was close!

578
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:16,378
We got to figure out how they did this.

579
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,515
-And by ''we,'' you mean...
-You.

580
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:20,980
Yeah.

581
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:24,319
Sorry, allergic to chimes.

582
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:28,792
l'm allergic to death.
But l'm going, l'm going.

583
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,726
-Good kitty.
-More like dumb kitty.

584
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:37,567
l thought for sure
l had broken Rothbart's spell.

585
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,604
One moment the orphans had Rogers
and Uberta clapping and singing.

586
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:47,378
And the next, it was like separating
two baboons fighting over the same banana.

587
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,777
At least it's iust Mother and Rogers.

588
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,245
Everyone else seems to have a lot of

589
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,514
Christmas spirit.

590
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:56,817
Where is everyone?

591
00:41:57,216 --> 00:41:58,586
Hello!

592
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,422
Hang on, Sir Peter! l'm coming!

593
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:03,657
l got ya.

594
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:05,425
Thank you, Prince Derek.

595
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,394
Are you all right?

596
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:11,000
Fine. More than l can say for her.

597
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,967
My wife made that angel.

598
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,836
We'll have it fixed right away.

599
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,806
l can do it, Princess.

600
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:22,578
But l sure wish you could do something
about this village.

601
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,011
The village?

602
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:28,251
Usually this time of year,
people are knocking on my door.

603
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:32,255
''Can we help hang your decorations?''
They say.

604
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:34,121
This year, l had to ask.

605
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,423
And the answer was, ''No!''

606
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,326
l mean, look at this!

607
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:44,935
lt's like everyone's taken a bite
of the same piece of bad fruitcake!

608
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:49,770
This is worse than we thought.

609
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,340
Rothbart started with Mother and Rogers.

610
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:55,277
-lf we can break that spell, maybe...
-l agree.

611
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:57,478
l have a new idea to try on them!

612
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:01,117
Great!
And l'm working on something, too, but...

613
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:02,516
What?

614
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:05,553
Well, l'm going to need Bromley's help.

615
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:08,724
Which means l have to tell him
about Rothbart.

616
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:13,762
When you do, make sure
you stand between him and the door.

617
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:18,700
Rothbart's ghost? Where?

618
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,839
Let me go! He's in here, l know it!

619
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:26,307
No, no, no, no, he's not.

620
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:29,511
A cold presence
just passed right though me!

621
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:30,877
You're imagining things!

622
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,581
Now, say something brave and you'll feel it!

623
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:36,950
Say it, Brom!

624
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:41,124
l wish l was snuggled up
to my Santa mug full of cocoa.

625
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:45,761
Not exactly a war cry,
but we'll try to build on it.

626
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,762
lfthere's one thing l know you can do, Brom,

627
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,597
it's use this.

628
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,168
We're gonna build a trap.

629
00:43:56,936 --> 00:44:01,845
Rothbart wants to destroy Christmas.
He has to be stopped, Brom.

630
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:06,548
No one messes with my Christmas cocoa.

631
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,316
Whatever it takes.

632
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:12,787
What do you mean you're ''on strike?''

633
00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:15,590
Give me a new life now.

634
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,492
That ain't negotiable!

635
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:20,930
Okay, okay, then l'm staging a sit-down.

636
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,298
l can force you to work!

637
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:27,635
And waste your precious power?

638
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,712
Face it.
Management has lost to the common cat.

639
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:39,649
This is a face you don't wanna mess with.

640
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,421
This is very unprofessional of you.

641
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,626
-The Hag?
-Oh, snap!

642
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:54,596
Merry Christmas!

643
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,168
Hey, hey, it's me, your old partner.

644
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,707
No, no, no. Calm down, will ya!

645
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:15,718
You go away! Go away! Icky ghost!

646
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,286
l'm your friend!

647
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,728
Hey, did you do something with your hair?

648
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:32,300
Look, it's me.

649
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,836
Rothbart?

650
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,407
You Big Naughty.

651
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:44,714
Gosh, l missed ya so much!

652
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,115
Bridgit miss those days, too.

653
00:45:48,114 --> 00:45:49,115
Who's Bridgit?

654
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:51,684
Me Bridgit!

655
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:53,587
Right! Right!

656
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:59,430
Well, maybe Bridgit and Big Naughty
work together again?

657
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:02,797
Hey, wait, we have a deal.

658
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:07,436
Me not sure about that.

659
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:11,873
Okay, me in. Me all the way in.

660
00:46:16,342 --> 00:46:18,212
Meet your replacement.

661
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:20,214
Scab!

662
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:29,891
l can't speak!

663
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:39,903
l was iust making my special vocal
booster tea for Uberta's singers.

664
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:42,802
Drink up!

665
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:46,007
ls it possible, Ferdinand,

666
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:51,949
that l ate or drank something
that made me lose my voice?

667
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,617
Could there possibly be such a thing?

668
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,724
Not it, not it, not it, not it, not it, not it.

669
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:05,360
Got it. Unwashed root of periwinkle!

670
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,930
lf not cleaned and prepared correctly,

671
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:15,173
the tiniest particle
could render you silent in a snap.

672
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,176
My cupcakes!

673
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:29,888
Thank you, Ferdinand. Thank you very much.

674
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:35,993
When Uberta's singers take their tea,
it'll have a little something extra

675
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:40,862
that will leave them speechless.

676
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:42,528
Treachery!

677
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:47,537
-Uberta, l was iust...
-l know exactly what you were up to!

678
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,874
Unwashed root of periwinkle?
How could you be so two-faced?

679
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,012
The same way you could, only better!

680
00:47:57,476 --> 00:48:00,783
Are you saying you can trick and scam
better than me?

681
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,651
l can double your double-cross anytime!

682
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:06,354
Well, l'll see your double of my double-cross

683
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:08,356
and raise you a hoodwink.

684
00:48:08,788 --> 00:48:10,892
l'll see your hoodwink and raise you

685
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:13,027
a bamboozle and a flimflam!

686
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,928
-Well, l'll see...
-Excuse me!

687
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:17,965
l know this is a lot to ask at Christmas,

688
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:21,871
but will the two ofyou please help me
with a very special item on my list?

689
00:48:22,768 --> 00:48:24,905
lt's kind of sneaky.

690
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,177
l'm the King of Sneaky!

691
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,915
l'm the Queen of all Sneakdom!

692
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:37,520
Great. l'll get the sleigh ready.

693
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:40,621
-l call shotgun!
-l call shotgun!

694
00:48:41,187 --> 00:48:43,391
-l said it first!
-Yeah.

695
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,759
Orphans? Singing?

696
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,327
Odette bring them in.

697
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:48,862
Odette!

698
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:51,765
They melt heart of Roger and U-Bertie.

699
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:54,969
That's what give you brown-down.

700
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,336
Brown out!

701
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,309
My replacement is as sharp as beach ball.

702
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:05,046
So where is she now?

703
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:09,385
No, don't tell me. Making mittens
for little Siberians somewhere!

704
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:12,687
No. She do that last week.

705
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:16,525
Now she get Roger and U-Bertie
to help her with new thing.

706
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,626
Like what?

707
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:23,733
Me not sure, but me got good idea in skull.

708
00:49:24,197 --> 00:49:26,968
lt's good to know she's not iust a pretty face.

709
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:30,872
What made me think
l could destroy Christmas

710
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:33,474
with Derek and Odette working against me?

711
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,780
They're like a perky little force field
of goodness.

712
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:45,822
They got to go.
And l'm gonna deal with her first.

713
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,623
Yeah, l got enough for that now.

714
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:53,561
Odette's gonna ioin the catfight.

715
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,729
Lead the way.

716
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,500
Hello? The chimes?

717
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,403
Those chimes!

718
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:05,907
Don't worry. Me cut down chimes.

719
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,915
Look like your replacement
got good idea in skull.

720
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,284
Yeah, yeah, l hope you have a brown down!

721
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:24,526
Come on. Giddy-up already!

722
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:29,663
Too close.

723
00:50:31,497 --> 00:50:33,567
Patience a virtue!

724
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,768
So where we headed?

725
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:39,208
Odette, Roger and U-Bertie
in big room for sure!

726
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,411
That where Odette make shoe for orphan,
food basket for tornado victim...

727
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:44,912
Yeah, l got the point. Keep cutting.

728
00:50:47,146 --> 00:50:49,284
Are we all ready to go?

729
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:55,092
Quite. As soon as a certain Lord
scooches over for a certain Queen.

730
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:57,658
Oh, fine! Baby!

731
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:01,294
Nope.

732
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:04,600
-What's wrong now?
-lnsufficient scootage!

733
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:06,768
l can still feel his cooties!

734
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,602
Cooties? Well, l never!

735
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:12,173
Come on, come on, come on.

736
00:51:15,808 --> 00:51:17,912
What are you up to, my dear?

737
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:24,820
Chime repair.
Some tinkley-tinkies don't tinkle.

738
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:30,526
How about a romantic ride
when Odette comes back with the sleigh?

739
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:33,093
Odette's gone?

740
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:36,062
Me too busy.

741
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:40,837
lt won't be until later.
She hasn't even left yet.

742
00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:47,575
Move, before they leave!

743
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,811
Come on, come on.

744
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,960
''Me sure she in big room!''

745
00:52:09,195 --> 00:52:13,970
Go ahead, Odette!
Work your Christmas cheer

746
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,242
'cause l'm gonna suck
every drop of peace and joy

747
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:22,144
out of this entire kingdom.

748
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:29,785
Every Christmas season,
as long as l can remember,

749
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,019
my father and l would come here,

750
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:34,288
to the Woodcutters' Village,

751
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,658
and we'd make sure
that they had a Christmas

752
00:52:36,722 --> 00:52:40,229
with lots of good food and presents.

753
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:42,196
lt's my first Christmas without him,

754
00:52:42,828 --> 00:52:46,435
but l couldn't miss coming.
Thanks for doing this with me.

755
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:02,916
Okay, it's clear.

756
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:07,953
Put that back.

757
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,390
The Queen delivers the ham!

758
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:10,657
Who made up that rule?

759
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,727
l did, and l'm the Queen!

760
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:15,262
l had it first!

761
00:53:15,961 --> 00:53:17,431
She's hogging the ham!

762
00:53:17,563 --> 00:53:19,566
You've got the potatoes and the stuffing!

763
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:22,971
Two side dishes don't equal a ham!
Do they, Odette?

764
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,605
Do two side dishes equal a ham?

765
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,340
l'll carry the ham.

766
00:53:27,806 --> 00:53:30,646
Happy? Now neither of us has the ham!

767
00:53:59,405 --> 00:54:00,740
What is it, Momma?

768
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:04,247
-lt's food.
-And presents?

769
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,347
Yes, and presents!

770
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:10,120
But you said
there wasn't going to be a Christmas.

771
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:12,486
l did, but...

772
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:14,621
But angels came?

773
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,559
Yes, dear, angels came.

774
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,261
Play, Father, keep playing that song!

775
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:22,963
Merry Christmas, Rogers.

776
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:43,921
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

777
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:48,692
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

778
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:54,428
Listen to you!

779
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:58,735
-Not flat again, l hope?
-l'm afraid you are.

780
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,972
Flat out perfect! Merry Christmas, friend.

781
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:04,638
Merry Christmas!

782
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:10,215
God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you despair

783
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:12,212
Wonderful!

784
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:16,184
Yes, and Merry Christmas to you!

785
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:19,087
We love you! Merry Christmas!

786
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:22,224
All right, floor it, Odette,
l've got geese to cook!

787
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,126
Christmas Uberta is back!

788
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,096
And so is the Christmas spirit.

789
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:30,765
Comfort and ioy

790
00:55:30,863 --> 00:55:35,839
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

791
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,337
No!

792
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,042
Look what Christmas is doing to me!

793
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:42,510
Yeah. Got it. Another brown-out.

794
00:55:43,143 --> 00:55:45,046
No! You don't get it!

795
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:48,884
Christmas almost gave me a black out!

796
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:53,623
Well, l wouldn't worry.
l'm sure Bridgit will fix everything.

797
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:56,324
Yeah, that girl is bright as a...

798
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,859
A little light bulb?

799
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:01,529
Yeah, sure.

800
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:05,901
Okay, you're back in for the full nine lives.

801
00:56:06,832 --> 00:56:08,202
Yes!

802
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:12,841
Okay, again! From ze big finish!

803
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:16,279
This is the last time, Jean-Bob.

804
00:56:16,575 --> 00:56:18,846
Yeah, we get the point.

805
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:23,252
lf we pull too early, you'll ''miss ze kiss.''

806
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,454
One, and-a-two...

807
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:32,096
Gloria

808
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,159
What the...

809
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,965
When l get those nine lives,

810
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:42,773
l'm gonna pick a fight
with the biggest, ugliest dog l can find.

811
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:45,440
Okay, zere's applause.

812
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:50,247
Girls approach me. Wait for it. Wait for it...

813
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,754
Didn't you hear me say, ''Wait for it?''

814
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:01,755
Come on, Romeo.

815
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,730
l'll take that.

816
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:12,400
Keep your paws off Royal property!

817
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,770
So, what is this, a C9, maybe?

818
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,417
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

819
00:57:31,384 --> 00:57:32,753
Oh, great!

820
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:35,623
Zere is absolutely no escape.

821
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:41,396
Except for running right past us.

822
00:57:42,528 --> 00:57:44,265
l'll explain later.

823
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:19,904
There's a kitty l know
who's about to get nine shiny new lives.

824
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,538
That guy looked a lot like...

825
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:25,340
Don't say his name!

826
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,975
lt's Rothbart's ghost.

827
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:32,515
Great! You not only say ''Rothbart,''
you say ze ''ghost'' part, too!

828
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:51,168
Question. How many cats does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

829
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:56,639
Just one, ifyou promise him nine lives.

830
00:58:57,803 --> 00:59:02,812
Now, back on the tree.
When the lights are switched on,

831
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:08,820
the Royal Christmas Tree and all those
precious ornaments will be destroyed.

832
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:16,195
Then l'll have all the power l need
to finish off Derek and Odette.

833
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,297
Voili. King Rothbart!

834
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:28,104
Christmas Eve

835
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:32,742
A special time of year

836
00:59:33,672 --> 00:59:36,311

837
00:59:36,509 --> 00:59:39,081

Come one

00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:48,090
lt's finally gonna happen, Number 9!

840
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,725
l'm like a kid at Christmas!

841
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,860
-That's a good one!
-Bossy-boss!

842
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:57,066
Derek doing big secret against you!

843
00:59:57,563 --> 00:59:58,998
Do you think he knows?

844
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:02,738
l don't know. Go, keep an eye on it.

845
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:04,871
Keep an eye on what?

846
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:09,313
Never mind!
Come on, show me what he's up to, Brenda!

847
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,610
Bridgit!

848
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:17,651
Okay, follow Bridgit.

849
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:19,520

Hello, Princey. Okay me come in?

01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:31,934
Sure. But close the door.
Top secret stuff here.

Me take peeky-peek. No!

854
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:47,349
You make a pretty good spy, Bridgit.

855
01:00:47,913 --> 01:00:50,318
See? He call me Bridgit!

856
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:53,688
He shoulda called you a dirty sneak!

857
01:00:53,953 --> 01:00:55,956
Derek, he not done!

858
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:57,090
What do you mean?

859
01:00:57,323 --> 01:01:00,295
He tell Kitty Kat, ''Keep an eye on it.''

860
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,830
lt's too late, Little Prince.

861
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:08,506
When Christmas is destroyed,
you and Swan Chica are next.

862
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:10,504
Stay with him!

863
01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:18,915

Joy to the world

There he is! Keep an eye on that cat!

871
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,033
Think small, Jean-Bob!

Okay, zat's iust weird.

Okay, sure. Let me iust get in touch
with my inner lawyer!

875
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:23,979
While fields and floods

876
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:27,483
Rocks, hills and plains

877
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:30,920
Repeat the sounding ioy

878
01:02:30,983 --> 01:02:34,256

Open sesame seeds!

882
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:59,081
Open sesame seed buns.

883
01:03:00,146 --> 01:03:01,982
Oh, brother!

884
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:06,689
Here we come a-caroling

885
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:11,094
Here we come a-wand'ring
So fair to be seen

01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:38,487
lf only we had a crow bar!

892
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:48,968
The cattle are lowing
The Baby awakes

893
01:03:49,262 --> 01:03:56,209
The little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

894
01:03:56,502 --> 01:04:03,482
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky

895
01:04:03,609 --> 01:04:07,216
And stay by my cradle

896
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,392
'Til morning is nigh

897
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:24,000
-Aren't they iust the sweetest things?
-lt's so beautiful.

898
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:34,010
-You're through!
-Well done, Speed!

899
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:36,711
Speed? What about the ''toolbox'' here?

900
01:04:38,544 --> 01:04:43,487
May the ornaments on this tree
inspire us to do good!

901
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:47,122
And may this tradition live forever!

902
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:52,428
Begin the countdown
to light the Royal Christmas Tree.

903
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:56,164
All right, everybody. Now, attention.

904
01:04:56,562 --> 01:04:58,132
Yes, attention, attention.

905
01:04:58,698 --> 01:04:59,699
Ready?

906
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,601
Let's go.

907
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:03,537
-Ten!
-The Forbidden Arts!

908
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:05,872
Nine!

909
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:08,275
-Eight!
-Seven and a half.

910
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:09,743
Rogers, stop!

911
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:13,049
Seven. Six. Five.

912
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:15,417
The bulb! Get the bulb!

913
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:16,516
Four!

914
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,819
Three!

915
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:20,554
-Two!
-Two!

916
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,024
Ready. One!

917
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:25,025
lt's Christmas!

918
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:50,585
Give me some skin, baby.

919
01:06:23,716 --> 01:06:24,884
Oh, no!

920
01:06:26,919 --> 01:06:28,188
Christmas is gone!

921
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:31,225
Oh, dear, no!

922
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:43,239
-He's...
-And he, and he...

923
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:45,339
Let me help ya out there.

924
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:49,379
''He's back and he's in the flesh.''

925
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:01,890
l got rid ofyou once, l can do it again!

926
01:07:02,288 --> 01:07:05,594
We're gonna replay our final battle all right,

927
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:09,832
but first, we got a coronation to take care of.

928
01:07:17,236 --> 01:07:20,276
Long live the King.

929
01:07:22,942 --> 01:07:26,883
You ain't the only one
with a Christmas list, Princess.

930
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:31,087
''Come back to life?'' Check.
''Destroy Christmas?'' Check.

931
01:07:31,584 --> 01:07:33,087
Take back the kingdom?

932
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:37,424
Now that one's a little fuzzy.

933
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:44,003
l mean, technically, yeah, checkerino.
l got the crown, l got the power.

934
01:07:44,497 --> 01:07:50,675
But in reality, l know you two
are gonna keep getting in my way,

935
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:56,347
because you got the Christmas spirit
all year round.

936
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:02,153
But l'm gonna take care of that now
back at my castle.

937
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:06,020
Yeah, that's what l said.

938
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,057
The seat of government's
moving to Swan Lake

939
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:12,128
and you're coming with me, Princess.

940
01:08:13,426 --> 01:08:15,229
Odette!

941
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:20,137
Sorry, Derek, but l'm sure
you can find your own way there.

942
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:24,240
And be sure to bring your A game.

943
01:08:33,346 --> 01:08:36,385
Careful, Derek! He's more powerful than ever!

944
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:39,988
Yeah, he really Big Naughty now.

945
01:08:40,053 --> 01:08:42,824
l know. But now he's also mortal again.

946
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:53,835
All right, Rothbart's taken Odette
back to Swan Lake!

947
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:56,170
Quick! Hop on!

948
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:00,642
Well, zat explains ze no seat belts!

949
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:05,447
Less speed, Speed!

950
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:11,186
Okay, you're fast, l get ze point!

951
01:09:22,728 --> 01:09:25,867
Now, that's what l call curb appeal!

952
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:30,640
lt iust screams
''comfort and luxury'' in a quiet rural setting!

953
01:09:32,105 --> 01:09:35,177
But a little cute for my taste.

954
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:41,717
You like? l call it Gothic chic.

955
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:48,925
And that's not the only thing
that's going retro, sweetheart.

956
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:49,355
No. No!

958
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,432
Oh, no!

959
01:10:06,806 --> 01:10:08,676
lt's diii vu all over again.

960
01:10:09,075 --> 01:10:10,811
So l'm nostalgic.

961
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:20,021
She's pinned.

962
01:10:22,388 --> 01:10:27,765
Do what you want with me,
but you will never destroy Christmas!

963
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:29,897
But l iust did!

964
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:33,836
After today, do you know
what the people are gonna remember

965
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:37,439
next Christmas
and every Christmas after that?

966
01:10:37,503 --> 01:10:38,938
This Christmas!

967
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:46,817
The year their beloved tree and
all their cherished memories disappeared!

968
01:10:47,613 --> 01:10:49,416
Back off, ya big...

969
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:59,195
My own first Christmas ornament!

970
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:00,860
No!

971
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:02,496
l have a nail appointment.

972
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:09,538
And now for my second ornament.

973
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:15,311
l'm not gonna blast you
like l did your little parrot.

974
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,713
We're gonna stick with tradition on this one.

975
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:26,124
When moonlight touches your wings,
you'll transform, all right,

976
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:31,595
into my favorite Christmas decoration.

977
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:33,660
Forever.

978
01:11:34,993 --> 01:11:37,966
The Master Hunter has arrived.

979
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:45,342
Sorry to bring all your big plans
down to earth, Derek!

980
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:48,175
What?

981
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:53,747
Nice ankle bracelet.

982
01:11:53,879 --> 01:11:56,084
Come on! Let's go rough him up!

983
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,787
Change her back!

984
01:12:00,186 --> 01:12:02,557
You want change, do you?

985
01:12:02,622 --> 01:12:04,292
Well...

986
01:12:08,694 --> 01:12:12,535
On second thought, my tennis elbow
is really acting up.

987
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:32,718
Oh, no!

988
01:13:01,114 --> 01:13:03,084
The thrill of victory!

989
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:08,623
Ze agony of defeat.

990
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:37,984
Derek!

991
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:56,575
Pictures tell a story
of two hearts full of love

992
01:13:58,004 --> 01:14:02,212
They're sharing a memory
of caring

993
01:14:02,308 --> 01:14:06,282
and tender rejoicing

994
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,849
The song's doin' something.

995
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:11,486
Keep singing, louder, louder!

996
01:14:12,018 --> 01:14:15,824
lt's the season of love

997
01:14:15,955 --> 01:14:21,099
that comes at Christmastime!

998
01:14:21,894 --> 01:14:24,032
We live it

999
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,667
Love it

1000
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:30,373
Beg it to come

1001
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:33,475
And want it to stay

1002
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:38,815
To have this season each day

1003
01:14:38,877 --> 01:14:43,921
lt's the season of love

1004
01:14:56,062 --> 01:14:58,065
Merry Christmas!

1005
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:00,600
Okay, my turn.

1006
01:15:02,302 --> 01:15:04,606
-Well?
-lt worked.

1007
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:10,047
But for a prince,
you're kind of short, slimy and green.

1008
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:25,991
Odette!

1009
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:27,894
Derek!

1010
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:38,575
Derek. Don't leave me.

1011
01:15:39,405 --> 01:15:40,406
l can't...

1012
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:47,485
You're everything that's good.

1013
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:49,082
No!

1014
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:53,853
No!

1015
01:15:58,158 --> 01:15:59,960
No! No!

1016
01:16:00,826 --> 01:16:04,133
l can't hear

1017
01:16:04,197 --> 01:16:09,907
your heart beating

1018
01:16:09,968 --> 01:16:12,541
But l know

1019
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:18,249
you still hear me

1020
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:22,084
Great! Now we got aliens!

1021
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,843
Zank you, aliens.

1022
01:16:52,878 --> 01:16:53,879
You're back.

1023
01:16:58,084 --> 01:17:01,356
You saved Christmas

1024
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:06,529
and it wasn't even on your list.

1025
01:17:08,327 --> 01:17:11,267
No. Christmas saved us all.

1026
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:33,020
They're all gone.

1027
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:37,194
We'll start carving new ornaments
this very day.

1028
01:17:45,298 --> 01:17:48,303
Looks like Rothbart lost the rematch.

1029
01:17:57,943 --> 01:18:01,150
Christmas is the reason for the season

1030
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,120
when Jesus Christ was born

1031
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:05,886
Jesus Christ was born

1032
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:09,592
Christmas is the season for love on earth

1033
01:18:09,789 --> 01:18:13,229
Oh, bless that happy morn

1034
01:18:14,827 --> 01:18:21,207
Peace and love, goodwill toward men
In praise we sing this day

1035
01:18:22,068 --> 01:18:25,974
His blessed birth in Bethlehem

1036
01:18:26,072 --> 01:18:30,246
The life, the truth, the way

1037
01:18:33,146 --> 01:18:38,256
Our newest Christmas ornament,
honoring Derek and Odette!
