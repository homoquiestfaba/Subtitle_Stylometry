1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,943
Jimmy, we discussed this
you can't tape our sessions

2
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,844
it's not allowed!

3
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:35,391
Does your defiance make you feel more powerful?

4
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,102
Filming people makes you
feel like you're in control of the situation

5
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:48,103
Doesn't it?

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,910
Maybe?

7
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,126
I can seat here as long as you can

8
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,527
and you cannot force me to participate
in your little game here.

9
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,840
Jimmy, put the camera away, please.

10
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,221
Ok! Alright! That's enough!
Give me the camera! Come on. Now Jimmy!

11
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,626
Give it to me.

12
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,261
We go, give it to me.

13
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,360
Give me the camera!

14
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,458
Give it to me Jimmy!

15
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,504
Aren't you a fucking nut? Are You boy?

16
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,166
A little crazy? Give it to me.

17
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,948
Hey mom! I heard you and dad
doing it nasty last night.

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,854
Thanks for that one.

19
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,888
By the way! Who the fuck is Nancy?

20
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,512
Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
our friends you're hung like a light switch.

21
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,809
There it goes! He makes to reach and
mass, both balls at the same time.

22
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,620
One heck of a double play.

23
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,318
And a sniff to finish them off.

24
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,056
I live in a fucking fake show.

25
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,365
You like that, you fucking nigger?

26
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,775
Oh yeah, baby, I like it.

27
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:46,180
So what was going through your mind
when I called you a nigger?

28
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,750
This cost you an extra 50.

29
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,466
You like call me a nigger?
When you get your nut off?

30
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,268
No.

31
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,133
Then why d'you call me that?

32
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,772
I was trying to do the unthinkable.
when I called you that.

33
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,212
I wanted to see if I could do that.

34
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,015
And that you found?

35
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,086
I believe that I want to die.

36
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,294
Judy, Judy first period track.

37
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,399
Oh! Miss Sanburrows,  bitch of all bitches.

38
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,624
Give it to me.

39
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,425
Do you want it?

40
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,957
God damn!

41
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,838
Mary Crearlie.

42
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,577
Billy Ransend, damned imbecile.

43
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,694
Morning guys!

44
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,726
Pretty good.

45
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,401
How you doing?

46
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,203
- Hi guys.
- For heaven's sake.

47
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,717
How's it going?

48
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,431
Happy anniversary, that's all I wanted to...

49
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,432
- Jimmy, get out of here.
- Hey Dad.

50
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,332
Happy anniversary!

51
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,173
- I'm sorry.
- I sit down it.

52
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,741
Off you go.

53
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,146
Thank you very much for coming,
they wanted to double the bet at that point.

54
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,781
Thanks, honey!
I'm 50 yards from the green and I'm looking...uh

55
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:10,182
and I'm not looking at the caddy, right?
and I'm saying ok, a big 7 is gonna do it, right?

56
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,290
On any occasion I would probably made it.

57
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,291
But I'm screwed, six ways, sorry!

58
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,330
So he hands me the club
and I'm not even thinking about it...

59
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,344
You Know, it is bad enough my parents made
me come here

60
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,886
I have to put up with you and that stupid camera.

61
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,520
- I have something I wanna show you.
- What?

62
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,521
Something disgusting?

63
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,522
Something that probably will make me wanna puke?

64
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,926
No, something beautiful.

65
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,039
Something that might change your life.

66
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,808
You're weird, Jimmy.

67
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,684
The people are calling you names
because they don't understand you?

68
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,823
I'm not gonna talk to you until
you turn that camera off.

69
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,228
You know, just because I'm up here, doesn't
mean I like you or anything.

70
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,037
Soon as this is over, I'm going back downstairs.

71
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,611
That's Miss Sanburrows' car.

72
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,412
And Billy Ransend, that red headed prick that
decided to dump a coke on your head?

73
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,418
I put a hand of weed in his locker and left
an anonymous note in the principal's office.

74
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,661
Mary Crearlie
I took care of her too.

75
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,431
Why did you do that?

76
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,736
I did it for you.

77
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,446
Shut off the fucking camera!

78
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,516
The problem is that Tom wants me to stay late
Not this late!

79
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,355
He's threatened to take away this account while I was away.

80
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,321
It is time to speak up to Tom.

81
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,058
I have spoken up to Tom.

82
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,565
You two are equals in that
company. He is not your superior.

83
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,124
Not technically.

84
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,466
He takes away another account, I'm gonna be...
I don't know what I'm gonna do

85
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,735
He threatened to take away two accounts.

86
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,946
Why is he taking away any accounts?
What's Bill have to say about it?

87
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,351
Because of his daddy owns the company...

88
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,984
You know the man for 20 years.

89
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,759
It doesn't seem to matter in this case.

90
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,088
Anyway, I'm tired of it.
Wish I could just quit that job, but I can't.

91
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,559
- Hon, are we having the salmon tonight?
That's terrible!

92
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,797
I don't want it, I mean I told you

93
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,298
We're having the salmon, I got it at the market for 1$ 98.

94
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,076
It tastes like it's 1$ 98.

95
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,107
No, I can't buy your underwear
and dinner, so eat home.

96
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,378
At least you can do.
Spend too much attention on that stupid kid.

97
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,758
You don't spend time.

98
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,919
I spend plenty of attention on him.

99
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,123
When is the last time you had a Saturday
or anything like that.

100
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,029
He doesn't want to have a Saturday with me,
he's a weirdo, he's a freak!

101
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,731
- Are you ready for me, you fucking slut?
- I'm not ready yet.

102
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,632
You know, I don't like to wait.
Do you know what to do?

103
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,104
I put on my make-up.

104
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,172
Your were the one that wanted do this thing.

105
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,945
I just wanna take a little time, ok?
I just wanna have some time!

106
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,952
Come on, slut!

107
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,588
Make a cocktail.

108
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,368
You know you like it too.

109
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,669
I'm just saying you're being taking advantage of me.

110
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,874
You don't listen to me, I'm telling you
that I'm not being taking advantage of

111
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,914
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do
in work, ok?

112
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,421
I'm just trying, I'm just trying.

113
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,621
You should have the front office.

114
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,719
Oh, stop it.

115
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,026
Or maybe an increase.

116
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,293
And you like it?

117
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,327
I'm not talking of anything.

118
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,202
You could answer when I call.

119
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,472
I'm making calls all the time, I can't talk to you.

120
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,880
You always think I gotta
pay all my attention to you.

121
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,440
I am your wife.

122
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,850
All right.

123
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,753
So...

124
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,027
My God.

125
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,029
what you guys are you up to?

126
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,089
- what the God damn fuck are you doing here?
- I told you he would find out.

127
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,397
Give it to me camera, you fucking asshole.

128
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,268
Give me that fucking camera.

129
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,868
you bitch, you bitch.

130
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,002
Fuck you.

131
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,979
Fucking fag.

132
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,142
You, you want to feel something, young man?

133
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,485
So you wanted to see how it really works.

134
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,047
Nancy, Nancy let me call your daddy.

135
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,758
No! No filming!

136
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,128
I'm leaving, I swear!

137
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,865
Ok, Ok.

138
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,804
when I'm on camera, it makes me nervous.

139
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,442
Fuck the camera!
Come on talk to me!

140
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,109
Alright.

141
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,714
Tell me how you felt
when you saw the video.

142
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,621
I felt like someone
had read the mind.

143
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,924
And?

144
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,960
I felt like someone attempted my mind
and made sure's being protected.

145
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,040
And what you said about God?

146
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,541
I said that I felt like God had sent to
someone to protect me,

147
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,342
to look after me

148
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,450
you are the only person in my life

149
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,251
who's ever looked after me

150
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,514
God I hate you when you film me crying.

151
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,545
- How you like it, huh? How do like you it
when the camera shoot right up your ass?

152
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,224
You like it, do you?

153
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,252
In generally I place the camera a little further away from my face
but if this is your personal style

154
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,853
then I guess I'll have to adjust it

155
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,259
- Does this work for you?
- Fuck it, I'm leaving!

156
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,538
Judy, wait.

157
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,368
What?

158
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,435
Come on, don't you wanna ask me anything?
Come on.

159
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,580
Ok. Why did you get kicked out of school?

160
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,792
Taking a semester off.

161
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,524
I heard you got kicked out because
you talked to a man who killed himself on the camera.

162
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,399
I didn't tell him to and  I didn't tell him not to.

163
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,973
If he wanted to die it was his choice.

164
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,917
And the camera was there,
not me. That's the truth.

165
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,046
You can believe whatever you want.

166
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,817
And...

167
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:38,718
...now I am here with the folks,

168
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,219
going to therapy,

169
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,520
...reevaluating my life's ambitions.

170
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,733
And as my Mom likes to say ...I'm...

171
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,734
gonna take this semester off,

172
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,635
start the next semester at a community college

173
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,140
and forget the whole thing ever happened.

174
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,281
It's not so bad. Not so bad.

175
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,691
Maybe you shouldn't film everything.

176
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,993
I don't film everything.

177
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,326
Just what's important!

178
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,633
Why me?

179
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,949
What d'you think?

180
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,852
Stop!

181
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,017
Just tell me!

182
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,658
Because you love me?

183
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,354
Yeah, you understand!

184
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,238
So where are you taking me?

185
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,605
- To a beautiful place.
- Where?

186
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,109
Chuckie Cheese.

187
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,236
Ok, but seriously.

188
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,511
I can't tell you, I'll ruin it.

189
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,606
Just trust me!

190
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,507
Fine.

191
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,520
Can I ask you something?

192
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,886
Can ask for anything.

193
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,584
Do you hate your parents?

194
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,387
Yeah, yeah, I do,
but I understand them.

195
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,730
What's to understand?

196
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,695
Well, I mean I understand that my ascension
into young adulthood

197
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:28,796
trigger their descending into middle life crisis.

198
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,002
You see, when an old child leaves the nest
the parents have to re-evaluate their lives

199
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,443
and all they see is
these younger, better versions of themselves.

200
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,511
They feel insecure because
we no longer seek their approval.

201
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,915
They are abandoned because
of our need for privacy.

202
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,921
You know, they used to take us to
baseball games, cover our scars with bandages.

203
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,672
And once we no longer need  Mom to nurse our bruises...

204
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,267
Dad to look up to,
they put ... and subsequent so forth and turn to question.

205
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,839
How do you know all these things?

206
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,408
I am a genius.

207
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,014
Actually...

208
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:23,115
the years when you've no one to talk to

209
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,190
don't play sports, don't go out,

210
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,591
have no one to listen to you...

211
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,499
No one to ask advice,

212
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,100
you pretty much have to figure everything out on your own!

213
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,616
You're so smart!

214
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,445
You're so beautiful!

215
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,717
Do you think I'm pretty?

216
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,418
Let me see, I think you're the most beautiful
person in the world.

217
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,923
Actually, I think you're the
most beautiful person in the universe.

218
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,497
No one has ever said that to me before.

219
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,939
Yeah, well, get used to it!

220
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,967
Or do you think that I'm smarter?

221
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,637
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,981
- Do you think fat?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,851
How can you say that? I weigh 53 kilos.

224
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,186
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you said flat... flat-chested

225
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,286
I am not flat-chested!

226
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,986
Ok, prove it!

227
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,552
I don't have to prove it, what you can see.

228
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,656
No, I still can't tell.

229
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,690
I wear a 4B cup.

230
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,395
Ok, well, then show me!
Take out your little titties, come on!

231
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,637
I'm not just gonna take them out!
You take yours out!

232
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,198
- It's already out baby.
- Oh, my God!

233
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,435
I don't believe you just fucking did that.

234
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,004
- Yeah, that's why I did it.
- My God.

235
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,915
I showed you mine, now show me yours!

236
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,909
Come on!

237
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,526
Wow, Yes!, I'm pulling over!

238
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,458
- No.
- Yes, I'm pulling over.

239
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,429
We gonna get your boobies on camera.

240
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,628
Alright Judy, show me your titties!

241
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,801
- Come on!
- I'm embarrassed.

242
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,676
You don't have to be embarrassed.
You can trust me!

243
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,244
You can trust me with your life.

244
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,556
Dude, for real this time. Come on.

245
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,392
Take off your bra!

246
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,866
Yes, that is very nice!

247
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,367
Very nice!

248
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,922
What's the matter?

249
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:15,422
I've showed you my breast and I've seen your
penis and we haven't even kissed yet.

250
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,134
you haven't even ask me to be your girlfriend.

251
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,375
- Will you be my girlfriend?
- Yeah.

252
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,337
- Would you give me a kiss?
- Yeah.

253
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,043
- Will you turn off the camera?
- No.

254
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,244
I don't wanna waste the opportunity
to document the most beautiful moment of my life

255
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,852
I want to see them again!

256
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,530
Just turn off the camera, please.
Turn it off!

257
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,637
Are you getting these?

258
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,640
This is where you wanted to take me?

259
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,113
Yeah, what's the matter?

260
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,282
I want to go home.

261
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,657
Don't fuck this up, Jimmy!
Be normal!

262
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,605
Normal.

263
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,446
Got to fuck everything up!

264
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

265
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,485
How you're feeling?

266
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,518
I don't know, huh, so good!

267
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,722
My God, I envy you.

268
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:34,161
I don't know, I just really want it lately
Really bad.

269
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,969
What is that?

270
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,638
I can't say, I'm embarrassed!

271
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,241
Oh, come on!

272
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,943
No, now you have to tell me.

273
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,378
It was after yesterday.

274
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,253
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

275
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,795
After I saw you use that gun.

276
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,827
You were so scared.

277
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,992
You were shaking, I mean,

278
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:07,393
it was the most horrible thing
I ever did, I don't think I'll ever see you like that.

279
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:14,201
I was very scared first.
I didn't expect it to be so loud

280
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:16,302
and you looked so mean...

281
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:22,109
But when I got home and I started thinking about it.

282
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:27,047
about how your muscles looked and
how dangerous all seemed.

283
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,358
I just got... more excited and...

284
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,829
Horny?

285
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,139
- Hold this for a second!
- Where are you going?

286
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,081
I'll be right down.

287
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,788
You're so hot!

288
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,898
Dad keeps this in his closet.

289
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,404
It is heavy.

290
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,638
Now I see the appeal, give me the camera!

291
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,305
Do you like this?

292
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,907
Yeah! Oooh.

293
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,045
Yeah, it's hot!

294
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,513
Do you like that?

295
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,962
Oh, fuck, it's my parents.

296
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,496
Hurry up, hurry up!

297
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,731
That's not...

298
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,365
Shit.

299
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,933
God.

300
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,971
Now Judy!  Is there anything you'd like to say to your fans
before you go through with this?

301
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,686
I'm very much looking forward to losing
my thief virginity.

302
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,922
I would also want
to share these with my fans

303
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,684
Thank you for your boobies and thank you
for this rare behind the scenes look.

304
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,690
at your first crime / moment of truth.

305
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,218
Hey, you two! Stop there!

306
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:46,519
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?

307
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,432
You can't go walking around the
store playing with that camera.

308
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,165
I want you to turn this thing off and get out of here, come on.

309
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:01,203
What is the matter with you Jimmy?
You almost got us caught!

310
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,215
So what is with that stupid camera?  What is it?

311
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,985
Why do you have to film everything?

312
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,958
It's like you have some sort of a
problem or something!

313
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,986
That's the reason why everyone thinks you're weird
that's why everyone makes fun of you.

314
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,622
So everybody makes fun of me, huh?

315
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,501
Yes, can't you give that thing just a fucking rest.

316
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,098
Don't you wanna deal with it?
You know what?

317
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,699
Fuck them and fuck you too if you care

318
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,940
I couldn't give a fuck what people think.

319
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,507
This is my life and I want to document it

320
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,208
and me filming you Judy...

321
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:42,109
happens to be the only reason

322
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,053
I manage to get out of the fucking bed every morning.

323
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,559
How does it feel, Jimmy?

324
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,329
How does it feel have someone tape you?

325
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,498
It doesn't matter how I feel right now, forget it!

326
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:09,178
What matters is that you
see inside of me and you're taping it.

327
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,310
- Can you understand that?
- I don't know!

328
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,087
Will you at least try?

329
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,125
Yeah

330
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,888
Never ever ask me not to film you

331
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:29,989
or anything we do

332
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,130
It's the only thing that I'll ever ask of you, Judy.

333
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,308
Ok, I'm sorry.

334
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,509
Would you swear on it with camera?

335
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,519
Cut that, you fat ass dickless fucking hick.

336
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,762
Jimmy.

337
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,737
Fuck it, Jimmy, stop!

338
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,544
My God, I love you Jimmy.

339
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,794
My God, Jimmy hold.

340
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,971
Jimmy!

341
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,571
My God.

342
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,344
Hi baby, I miss you, I'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

343
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:58,116
Be good and don't take too long!
Look what I go for you!

344
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,651
I can't wait for you to see it.

345
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,022
Welcome! May I take your order?

346
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:13,060
Can I get a double cheeseburger
with no pickles, large fries and a coke.

347
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,433
Fast forward!
Can I get a number 2, also please?

348
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,780
Sure that's 9$ 53, please pull out!

349
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,544
Sorry, that's what I missed more than anything.

350
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,450
So, what were you doing the whole day?

351
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,884
Masturbating mostly.

352
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,686
Hey, you cheated on me.

353
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,559
I'm supposed to be the only one responsible
for making you come.

354
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:43,328
You'd better be on
count for 24 hours a day.

355
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,361
Seriously, what were you doing there?
What was a day in the life of Jimmy in that house?

356
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,366
- Outside masturbating...
- Yeah.

357
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:59,070
Well, I talked and I talked and I fucking talked
until they were satisfied

358
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,210
And basically, I told them what they wanted to hear!
And said shit like

359
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,049
Now, when we real talk about my problems I realize that
my behavior was inappropriate.

360
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,127
And harmful toward others.

361
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,625
And then, ok, I realized
that I had to cry all the time.

362
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:24,164
Cause whenever somebody would cry
they call it a breakthrough.

363
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:30,170
You gotta start out like real slow, like this, you know...

364
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,150
Now I get into position.

365
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,552
I know now that violence
it's not the answer.

366
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,360
And then will be like...

367
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,407
I was wrong!

368
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,604
It was really really wrong.

369
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,514
I need help.

370
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,320
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

371
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,225
Especially to my parents...

372
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,258
After everything they've done for me.

373
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,062
And then they gave me a bitty bit of hug in the end.

374
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,906
Then, you know,  after a couple of weeks...

375
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:04,007
they diagnose you with something,
give you some medication and then you're done.

376
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,777
My God, you're a freaking genius!

377
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,109
I know, I am!

378
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,042
So what they gave you?

379
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,509
These pills, I don't take them.
I can't get a hard-on on them.

380
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,451
So what they said you have?

381
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,619
Oppositional Defiance Disorder. ODD.

382
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:31,024
You are so lucky, I wouldn't be
diagnosed with something.

383
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,129
So what does it mean?

384
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,767
ODD?

385
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,868
It is characterized by an overwhelming feeling
of negative hostile and defiant behavior

386
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,674
which causes the patient to not be able
to distinguish reality from fantasy.

387
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,749
I fucking love that.

388
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,279
Basically, I'm a delusional motherfucker.

389
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,059
I am so fucking hungry, man!

390
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,349
My God.

391
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,855
- Fuck!
- What?

392
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,623
Goddammit!

393
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,827
I specifically asked for no
pickles, they fucked up my order.

394
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,033
How will ODD brain handle this?
Will this ODD brain be able to restrain the pickle struggle?

395
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,538
Do the drive turn?

396
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,350
I don't know, I really don't know.

397
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:59,744
I don't know, I might just fucking go postal.
What am I gonna do?

398
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,782
My God!

399
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,664
O Jeez, it's so hot!

400
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,035
I'm burning my nipples with my pickles.

401
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:20,600
My God! Help me, Lord!

402
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,305
Help rule my heartbreak.

403
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,657
I love you Judy.

404
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,534
don't run so quick.

405
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,512
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

406
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,413
What if we could live here forever?

407
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,848
Right here?

408
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,877
Maybe not right here, but eventually we could buy some  land

409
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:06,378
we could live together on that
and we could be naked whenever we want.

410
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,128
What do you think?

411
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,823
I think you're waste.

412
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,696
You are right, but I'm serious.

413
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:21,127
I never want this to end
I want to see this moment forever.

414
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,433
I want to feel the air on my body
and I want to be naked and I wanna feel free

415
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,305
And I want us to fuck our brains out every single day.

416
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,317
You know what? I've seen a place like that.

417
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,818
You do?

418
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,648
Where is that?

419
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,553
Up in Arlinger.

420
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,790
I do look serious.

421
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,786
I'm telling you there is this amazing place
when I was in the bin.

422
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,129
It's all anybody talked about, you know,
anybody talked about!

423
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,160
But supposedly up in Arlinger there's this guy
Uncle Rodney,

424
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,461
he runs this commune where you can run around
and get drunk and naked all the time

425
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,299
It's all they do

426
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,301
Uncle Rodney's commune?

427
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,609
I'm not kidding.

428
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,810
Ok, we can go to uncle Rodney's commune.

429
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,376
Yeah.

430
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,080
You can go.

431
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,919
You really want me to say something?

432
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,787
Yeah, I really do.

433
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,500
I won't go one day without masturbating.

434
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,436
I want to live with my Goddamn penis.

435
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:32,298
I want to calm you

436
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:34,699
so we can have it three-way

437
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,100
and I wanna be cheating.

438
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,114
And...

439
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,644
I want to scratch my balls
with a cheese grader.

440
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,553
That's so gross
.

441
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,518
And...

442
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,554
I love you.

443
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,026
Loved you since we were kids.

444
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,598
You have?

445
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,770
I love you so much it hurts.

446
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,775
God is stabbing me in the freaking heart with
a thousand knives at the same fucking time.

447
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:23,091
You are the only person that can take the pain away.

448
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,128
You feel that way about me?

449
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,896
I love you so much that I'd rather
die than be without you.

450
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,204
Ok, you gotta make me a promise then.

451
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,702
Kind a like the way a husband and wife when they get promised.

452
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,012
To marry?

453
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,543
No, no, this is something more
powerful than marriage

454
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:53,844
It's a bond

455
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,153
It's our bond, it's transcendental.

456
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,228
- What?

457
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:10,162
It's transcendental because...
transcends everything.

458
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:23,241
Life... love, people... things.

459
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,654
It really transcends death

460
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:36,489
If you swear on a bond it means that...

461
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,190
you'd rather die than break your promise.

462
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,672
It's so beautiful!

463
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,810
Judy...

464
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,109
I couldn't go a day without you.

465
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,083
OK, then swear on the bond.

466
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,020
Swear that we'll never let anything come
between us.

467
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,318
Not even death.

468
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,621
I'll never let anything come between us
not even death, I swear the bond.

469
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,034
We'll be together forever.

470
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,477
Forever.

471
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:43,288
I don't know what it is, love the ghetto
every time I get out it's the first place I want to go to.

472
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,268
Yeah, you know I really love it
when you're out the jail.

473
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,272
Do you think you could try
and stay out of it for a little while?

474
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,577
Yeah, if I'm not on bail, I'll probably go to jail.

475
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:00,006
I'm serious, you act like it's no big deal
when you go away.

476
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,014
Alright, alright.

477
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,454
No, it's not alright.

478
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,517
Listen, when you go in there
I stuck out here all by myself.

479
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,921
all alone, in the real world, Jimmy.

480
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,524
You go in and then come back like it's nothing
like everything's fine and it's not fine.

481
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,929
I don't want to live another day
without you. Do you understand me?

482
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,441
I would rather die.

483
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,839
Alright, I promise I'll never go back.

484
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,874
I promise, I swear on my life
I swear on a bond that I'll never go back.

485
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,385
Do you swear on the bond?

486
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,796
Now what?

487
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,612
Last time you got out we did it like 5 times

488
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,613
like as we soon as we saw each other
we got naked and we did it

489
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:10,442
and today my parents weren't even home
and I tried to do some stuff to you

490
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,221
and you were not even interested in it.

491
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,921
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

492
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,754
Is it because you gotta speak with your mom and Dad?

493
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,060
No.

494
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:30,029
Do you not like having sex with me anymore?
Do you not think I'm attractive anymore?

495
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,443
No, that has nothing to do with it, alright?

496
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,873
Look! I'll tell you!

497
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:41,574
After I saw my Dad getting
rammed in the ass by my Mom

498
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,079
I sort of blocked the whole thing out
so now when I go into the bin

499
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,351
that's all he wanna talk about

500
00:43:48,452 --> 00:43:51,452
So, now, every time I get a word

501
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:54,453
it's like the instant replay machine goes off in my brain

502
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,459
and I'm just seeing my Mom like
pounding my Dad in the ass.

503
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,338
It's pretty unfortunate. It sucks.

504
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,068
It's really awful, I'm sorry.

505
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,102
Yeah, but you know what?
It's not like you tried very hard.

506
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,849
You just gave your little sex face
and grabbed my cock.

507
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,544
Ok, fine! How about this?
Do you like that?

508
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,389
That's what I'm talking about.

509
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,154
Oh, yeah...

510
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,562
- Woody's coming out!
- Is he?

511
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,261
Shit.

512
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:34,527
Dude, I think you hit somebody.
Stay here!

513
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,634
Jimmy, what you're doing?

514
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,077
Oh, fuck!

515
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,788
Well, we gotta take him to a hospital.

516
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,921
No, we'd get busted!

517
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:06,926
Shit, shit, he's not breathing
I think he's dead.

518
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,302
- Is he fucking dead?!
- I don't know!

519
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,108
Fuck, just pop the trunk.
No!

520
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,813
Just pop the trunk before somebody sees us, hurry up!

521
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,318
Fuck!

522
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,568
My God, I just wanna go home.

523
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,835
God.

524
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,547
I'm driving, hurry up, hurry up, come on.

525
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,920
Get in, get in, hurry!

526
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,483
I can't...

527
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,887
What the fuck! Get in
before somebody sees us!

528
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,923
We have a dead guy in the fucking trunk!

529
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,299
Fuck, my God, that's a fucking caught!

530
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,099
Alright just stay calm, stay calm,
don't say anything, don't cry!

531
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:25,505
My God, we have a dead guy in the fucking trunk
and there's a fucking cop right there.

532
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,343
Please, be calm!

533
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,153
Good evening. License and registration!

534
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,952
Yeah, certainly!

535
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,531
Here you go!

536
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,634
Sir, remove your keys from the  ignition
and step out of the vehicle for me, please.

537
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,576
Come on out back with me.

538
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,322
My God Jimmy.

539
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,204
Fuck!

540
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,308
What the fuck did just happen?

541
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,943
- You want to fucking tell me what happen...
- Shut the fuck up!

542
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,210
Fucking tell me!

543
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,773
What are you doing?

544
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,277
Filming.

545
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,688
It's dark, you can't see anything.

546
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,663
It's all infrared. Do you want to see?

547
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,995
No, I don't want to see it.

548
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,932
It is beautiful!

549
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:35,334
He's dead, he's in my car, Jimmy
and he stinks.

550
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,010
I want to go home.

551
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,249
I don't think I can do this.
I am not like you.

552
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,720
I can't do this!
I want to fucking go home!

553
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,316
Goddamit, what the... I'm sorry!

554
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,021
What the fuck is wrong with you?
We can't go home.

555
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,423
And you will do this, you did do this!
You killed him, Judy.

556
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,264
And you didn't even get into the car
until the cops showed up.

557
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:07,199
Do you want me to go to jail?
Is that what you really want?

558
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,214
And are we gonna do?

559
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,782
I don't know, I don't know.

560
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:27,919
We'll just have to make really intelligent
decisions right now.

561
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,828
Ok?

562
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,995
We'll just figure something out, we get out of here,

563
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:42,034
And we will fix it, it will be ok.

564
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,016
Alright?

565
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,713
Do you promise?

566
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,220
Come here!

567
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,352
I promise, I promise, it will be ok.

568
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:06,332
My God, the hair burning is making me nauseous.

569
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,974
Burning bodies fucking stink.

570
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,369
You know that bones already been cooked off right now?

571
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,271
Jimmy, don't do that!

572
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,745
You know where we're gonna go?

573
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,256
Where we're gonna go?

574
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,758
We're out to Lincoln to visit Dinko.

575
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,287
Who's Dinko?

576
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,589
Well, he has his own place and he knows about you

577
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,090
he wants to meet you

578
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:43,095
He doesn't like cops, so he probably
won't be inviting 'em up very much.

579
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:48,474
Could I just get a little tiny, tiny smile?
Please!

580
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:54,407
No, I just can't! I'm sorry!

581
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,358
Did you find the video?

582
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,726
Yeah.

583
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:12,024
I remember that shit! I remember that shit that you're video taping

584
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,976
Alright, so you guys going to stay on me?

585
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,537
But I gotta do business sometime in here, ok?

586
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,838
so it's very important for me,
when people come to the door

587
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,544
You can't answer the fucking door,
and you can't answer the fucking phone.

588
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:38,749
Other than that we's gonna have a fucking good time
cause I got shitload of fucking crank.

589
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:44,056
And that shit's off the fucking hook!
Do you want a hit?

590
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,961
No, I get the feeling Judy actually.

591
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:57,670
Hey man, you better stop taping, you gotta stop taping, ok?
'cause I got crank kids come up to smoke

592
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,944
and sometime to see some shit,
and you fucking put that out man.

593
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,518
So it's very important! Alright?

594
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:13,328
The crank kids it's a whole different fucking breed, man!

595
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:20,259
Totally unpredictable, hard to know
what the fuck they're gonna do.

596
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,334
Fuck!

597
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,137
There was this one fucking dude

598
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:34,138
he climbed upon the roof of his house
to take shit

599
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:40,045
It was the only fucking place he could take the shit
house fuck up his ass!

600
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,693
Jimmy, why aren't you giving your attention to me?

601
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,194
I'm sorry.

602
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,525
Do I look sexy?

603
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,759
You are really sexy, baby.

604
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,852
I got some work for
you all, if it's ok with you guys!

605
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,820
What kind of work?

606
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:16,148
You know, just mixing some shit out, I'll teach you!
Some hot, some good money I'll teach your girl too

607
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,149
if she wants to know how, ok?

608
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,155
Right on! That's all I have always wanted
to learn how to do.

609
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:24,156
make some crystal methamphetamine

610
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:25,557
Goddamn!

611
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,569
You're a genius, dude.

612
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,037
- It is for you
- Thank you.

613
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,748
Man...

614
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,745
Is it like your girlfriend? or are you all just fucking?

615
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,783
Yeah, she's my girlfriend, I only have one rule, man!

616
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:54,284
Please, don't ever, ever fuck it!
You understand?

617
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,897
- You got me?
- I got it.

618
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:58,900
Cool.

619
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,029
You like to fuck your own lady.

620
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:14,039
So... Osis.

621
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:18,510
This dude, this fucking dude.

622
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:24,049
Told me anything I know about mix
and he probably flip over your girl.

623
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,322
You're talking about uncle Rodney, right?

624
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,232
Right.

625
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,334
Uncle fucking Rodney.

626
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,138
Do you have an uncle Rodney, baby?

627
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,700
No, he's not my uncle, he's not anybody's uncle
remember I was telling you about

628
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,941
the guy that was out in the bin?

629
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,842
I told you we would go
to Arlinger, remember?

630
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,250
When was that?

631
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,450
We will be naked.

632
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,256
We're always naked, Jimmy.

633
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,989
Yeah, forget it.

634
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,099
Fuck!

635
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,605
Do you like that shit?

636
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,639
Yeah.

637
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,542
You gotta fucking see in here, man.

638
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,773
we have to go , you don't have to go on
in a shit like here.

639
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,579
I mean, my place is cool, but...

640
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,916
it's always on the move.

641
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,513
So you ought to go up and see to it, ok?

642
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,124
Fuck.

643
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,729
Customer's call.

644
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,760
Baby, I am very high, right now.
It's amazing, it's great.

645
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,034
You having a good time?

646
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,669
I told you?

647
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,143
Jimmy, your girl in chicks?

648
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,811
Well Judy, are you into chicks?

649
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,878
I don't know, you want me to be into chicks?

650
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,890
Yeah, bring her in, man!

651
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:18,297
Actually, I don't know
Judy is really all that into chicks.

652
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:20,098
Now that I think about it

653
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,604
I'm not that really into chicks.

654
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,639
yeah, we do, now we won't change it.

655
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,917
I don't know!

656
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:34,622
I just wanna get some shit and get out of here.

657
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,149
Shut the fuck up, you got it?
And you fucking take your clothes off.

658
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,654
I don't want to.

659
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,857
You go on.

660
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,760
Jimmy.

661
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,167
Stop it!

662
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,267
He's a big man
he can do what he wants.

663
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,741
Now up to you, Dinko.

664
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,342
I'm gonna fuck this junky whore for you.

665
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,144
You all fucking look!

666
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,050
Are you gonna fuck her or
are you just gonna talk about it?

667
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,079
Jimmy, if you let him fuck her I swear you
that I'll never fucking talk to you again!

668
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,592
We gonna do some fuck time, man.

669
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,748
Off you go.

670
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,978
'cause you think that this guy deserves to die?

671
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,820
- This faggot rapist?
- Yeah. He does!

672
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,378
Good-bye Dinko, you stupid fuck.
Thank you for the car and for the cash.

673
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,876
And for the crank.

674
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,515
How you're feeling, baby?

675
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,216
I don't care about anything.

676
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,750
So, what are we gonna do with the car, Jimmy?

677
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,124
Ditch it.

678
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,088
- And the crank?
- Fucking snort it.

679
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,461
And the cash?

680
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,935
We will go on vacation anywhere you want.
How's that?

681
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,836
It sounds amazing.

682
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,502
And now the one, the only Elvis.

683
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,210
Alright.

684
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,874
I'm understanding you're couples
it's that alright in vows! The vows?

685
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:22,519
Thanks, thank you very much.

686
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:28,186
Judy, promise to always swallow,
never cut your hair

687
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,033
or have another man penis injected in any
part of your body for as long as you both shall live?

688
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,593
I do.

689
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:40,007
You Jimmy,  you promise
to always fuck Judy  with enthusiasm

690
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:44,536
to take a shower once a day and promise not to inject
your penis in any part of another person body,

691
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:46,537
as long as you both shall live!

692
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,440
I do.

693
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,915
Now the rings.

694
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,850
It is the best part.

695
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:08,227
According to the power invested in me

696
01:00:08,228 --> 01:00:12,628
I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride

697
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,944
We cut that out.

698
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,251
Cut the fucking crank line, baby!

699
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,190
Hey, you know what? What?
I got an idea.

700
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:33,095
Now that we're married I should
go to the med school and become

701
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,256
an anesthesiologist and
get you all the crank you want.

702
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,631
- Really? you'd do that?
- Yeah.

703
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,431
Jimmy, your house is on TV.

704
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,131
- Jimmy look! Come here!
- What?

705
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:46,005
...has just named two suspects in the attempted
murder of deputy Frank Mitchell

706
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:50,968
who was critically wounded after pulling over a suspected
hit and run driver two nights ago.

707
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:55,674
The two suspects are, James Wright
a 21 year old Caucasian male

708
01:00:56,386 --> 01:01:00,322
And 18 years old high school senior
Judy Elizabeth Oaks Keller.

709
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,822
No, it's not...

710
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,053
Wait, wait!

711
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,020
And although there's no official word on his status,

712
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:09,921
sources say that the hospital
has listed him in critical condition.

713
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:14,726
The two youths were caught on tape
by an onboard video camera

714
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:16,827
mounted inside the Deputy's patrol car

715
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,341
The sheriff's department has released
the following footage in an effort

716
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:24,835
to help involve the public
in the search for the suspects.

717
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,874
On a very serious note we would like to warn our viewers
that the images you're about to see

718
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,344
are graphic in nature
and may not be suitable for young children.

719
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,756
Once again, viewer's discretion is strongly advised.

720
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,441
Judy, I didn't want us to be apart.

721
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,144
I guess people know who we are now.

722
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,845
Actually, we're kind of famous.

723
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,453
That's the most romantic thing I ever even heard of.

724
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,890
I love you Judy.

725
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,665
I love you too.

726
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,869
Jimmy, it's your parents.

727
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,637
We are very shocked
about recent events.

728
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,439
Our son...

729
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:07,448
has always been a dear sweet boy
who is a little confused.

730
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,014
But we want him to know that we love him very, very much
and we just want this whole thing to be over

731
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,747
Bitch!

732
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,826
I found the clippers, baby.

733
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,030
Come on, sit down, it's go time!

734
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,138
Ok.

735
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,070
- Wait, wait!
- What?

736
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,943
I just wanna to look at myself one last time.

737
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,177
I look so good!

738
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,974
Alright, that's enough!

739
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,748
Judy, I'm not sure about this.

740
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:46,880
Why?

741
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,117
Come on, I changed my hair!

742
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,753
I Know,  but you look beautiful
I'm gonna look like a shit.

743
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,855
No, you won't! It was your idea, remember?

744
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,157
Come on.

745
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,792
Ok, let's do this!

746
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,498
Alright.

747
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,112
My God!

748
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,014
I love you but I hate you right now.

749
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,354
My God.

750
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,049
Turn it back more.

751
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,954
I can't even look.

752
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,530
We should leave it like this.

753
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,236
No, I don't want to look like
male patterned baldness.

754
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,674
Comb it over there.
Comb it over here

755
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,241
I see you like this.

756
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:52,416
Come on, get serious!

757
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,891
- God,  it feels really good.
- Yeah?

758
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,888
Wait...

759
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,295
Yeah!

760
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,699
My God, you're such a fucking pig when you eat.

761
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,007
That's so gross!

762
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,343
That's it! I'm not taking you to the country club.

763
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,646
Right.

764
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:26,085
I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?

765
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,852
Ok, I'll take you to the country club, I promise.

766
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,825
Really? When?

767
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,717
I don't know.

768
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:39,858
Thank you so much for marrying me.
You're my prince in shining armor.

769
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:47,431
And one day, we'll have a white picking fence and
a big house and a little beautiful baby.

770
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,145
What should we name the baby?

771
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,842
What's wrong?

772
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,420
Nothing.

773
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,324
What, what's wrong?

774
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,887
Shit, give me the camera.

775
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,459
- My God.
- They're going to our door.

776
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,994
Shit.

777
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,308
They know where we are, we're gonna get caught.

778
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,745
Alright, let's get out of here.

779
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,146
Get in!

780
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:47,730
- Did they see us?
- I don't think so.

781
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,130
Think, I gotta think, I gotta think.

782
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,974
I don't think that they see us
I think we're ok.

783
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:07,312
My God... that was close.

784
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,923
Good morning.

785
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,830
Wake up, you little fuck nugget.

786
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,201
How are we doing this morning, Mrs. Wright?

787
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,371
Where are we?

788
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,005
It's a surprise.

789
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,916
I want you to drive this thing 'cause I want
to film you when we get there, ok?

790
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,115
Ok.

791
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,211
Come on! Get up.

792
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,120
When we're gonna see it?

793
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,289
God, I hate you when
you do this to me, just tell me!

794
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,161
You just keep looking!

795
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,265
Which further.

796
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,132
Just keep fucking driving.

797
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:00,206
My God, is this it?

798
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:01,472
Yeah.

799
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,769
Is this where your friend lives?

800
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,714
This is where we lives.

801
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:08,672
We do?

802
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,878
For a while if we want to.

803
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,881
My God, this is so amazing!
Do you wanna live here?

804
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,255
Yeah.

805
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,988
- This is so amazing!
- Like a rock concert, huh?

806
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,690
Look around...

807
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,558
We're gonna get drunk and
naked all the time.

808
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,571
- Yeah, go over here, ok?
- There?

809
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,130
Close to those guys.

810
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,800
- Take it, Ok?
- OK.

811
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,173
- Is that uncle Rodney?
- No, that's Buddy.

812
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,704
But Rodney wants to meet us.

813
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:11,711
He does?

814
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,873
Yeah, like we're fucking celebrities or something.

815
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,042
My God.

816
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,278
Come on, let's party!

817
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:25,116
So we got like... 35 trailers out here.

818
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:29,089
Real nice fucking trailers, I tell you, man!
They're always open you guys can crash in one.

819
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,166
Now, some folks might show up...
I might have to put you in a tent

820
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:35,898
Judy look! they have hairy pussies out here.

821
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,273
that's my girl, I make sure she keeps it trimmed, seriously!

822
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,004
I don't like any hair. it's disgusting!

823
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:46,638
Seriously, some people might show up and
I'd have to put you in a tent, don't fuck it, man!

824
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:52,412
Everybody's real nice out here
you'll always find a bed to crash, yes you can!

825
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:56,623
Although don't look like much
we'll fucking break you down up here.

826
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,651
We have some really good party up
and you can stay as long as you like.

827
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:00,652
You know what?

828
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,731
You all can stay forever.

829
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,058
Now, if you do, you gotta know
there's some rules up here, ok?

830
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,459
Up her it's the labs, alright?

831
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,128
we don't really fuck around with it.

832
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,972
Don't film it.

833
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,470
'cause Rodney he's gonna have a break.
Alright, what's rule 2?

834
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,738
Rule number 2

835
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,875
No cops! Now I got to worry about you two
bringing the cops up here,

836
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:32,083
Beyond that it's pretty much fucking that you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

837
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,486
Whatever the fuck you want.

838
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,090
Do you wanna hang with us?
You wanna do some partying, a little hang out, you know

839
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:43,426
I like you Jimmy, most of the time, most of the time
You have to sell some shit for uncle Rodney

840
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:48,566
he told me you were a very, very special case and you
are gonna need a little time to let the things cool down, right?

841
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,871
That might take a couple of months.

842
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:56,207
That might take a couple of years, but who
the fuck's up in a rush anyway, isn't that right?

843
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,957
Ready? one, two three.

844
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:07,118
Now, fuck me, look
I have you carried in our new home.

845
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,429
Give me a kiss.
Oh, look at that!

846
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,065
How do you turn this fucking thing off?
How you do that?

847
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:21,099
If you give your love to uncle Rodney
you'll get it back... like 10 times.

848
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,975
But don't be afraid to love him...

849
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,776
because you'll learn to love yourself in return

850
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,982
He'll teach you the sacral
and how we're all connected.

851
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:43,354
Uncle Rodney respects us,
he can be your savior.

852
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,561
Or your executioner, it's your choice.

853
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:51,334
I've seen him getting pissed off quite a bit
with people that steal from him.

854
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:56,566
We got a new special form, we take care of it
our own way, we don't involve the law.

855
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,080
We take care of it internally.

856
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,626
This dude I was showing with, like Matt
or something like that,

857
01:12:21,627 --> 01:12:23,427
he's just gotten out of the joint 
and he was telling me

858
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,732
about this place where
you can like do what you want.

859
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:31,444
And not have to worry about any of 
that bullshit and other shit that goes on

860
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,675
That other world out there.

861
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:37,642
And I was like: Dude, that sounds cool!
So I came down, checked it out

862
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,343
and I was like: Yeah!

863
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,548
I mean this,  this what life should be!

864
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:43,683
Hey baby.

865
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,894
- Come, that's warm.
- Really?

866
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,361
Yeah, come on!

867
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,865
No, I think I'll just film you for a while.

868
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,459
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

869
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,166
How do I look now?

870
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,164
Sexy.

871
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,734
Hey, cut!

872
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,114
- Hey, again!
- Hey!

873
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,011
Do you like it here?

874
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,518
How long can we stay?

875
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,321
That's up to Rodney.

876
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,327
What's he like?

877
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,555
I don't know! Supposedly he's weird.

878
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:24,656
Actually, I heard he's really weird.

879
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,835
Well, if he's weird is great weird wherever he is.

880
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,135
If we could stay here forever
like Buddy says.

881
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,269
We wouldn't need anything else.

882
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,348
The cops won't come, won't they?

883
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,453
This camera shit's fun, man.

884
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:55,455
Hey! Are you nervous?

885
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,397
No.

886
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,127
I'd be.

887
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,965
It's supposed to be cool, right?

888
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,996
Yeah man, he's cooling cool! 
But, Gosh, you really don't have any idea, do you?

889
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:13,304
Judy wants to meet him,
it's ok if I ask, right?

890
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:18,342
No, you have to, she's one of the girls now
she's going to  meet him.

891
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,418
What the fuck does that mean, Buddy?

892
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,453
Won't you relax, man? Just like
you're one of his boys.

893
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:33,431
I'll give you two weeks and you will want
her to experience him.

894
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,630
Might you want it too.

895
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:41,140
Just go see him, alright?. 
He wants you to feel him.

896
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,942
Hey man, take your camera.

897
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,744
Go now, they're waiting for you.

898
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,751
Fuck!

899
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,749
Are you filming?

900
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,021
Yeah.

901
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,734
Where you want me?

902
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,936
You sit yourself up wherever.

903
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,534
Ok.

904
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,401
So...

905
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,204
I want you to feel comfortable.

906
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,406
Do you feel comfortable?

907
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,547
I guess so.

908
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,446
The important thing is that we get this right

909
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,254
Please, please.

910
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,654
Just a second, I gotta take care of my baby.

911
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,360
Don't lie, don't lie!

912
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:51,462
Some people come here and
they're too far gone like Connie here.

913
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,570
and by the time they get here
there's nothing I can do

914
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,478
Except trying to ease their pain.

915
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,210
Ain't that right, sweetheart?

916
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,686
How about a little bitty baby taste?
What do you say?

917
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,990
Yeah, yeah.

918
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,129
Is that?

919
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:32,302
There's something about addiction 
brings out something beautiful in people.

920
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,640
See, addiction is pure.

921
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,620
Addiction reduces
people to infants.

922
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:49,152
And it ain't nothing so beautiful,
innocent and pure as an infant.

923
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:07,070
Connie here, is not an
adult any longer , she's an infant.

924
01:18:07,571 --> 01:18:09,771
and I'm her surrogate mother

925
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,578
who must provide the much needed 
breast milk from time to time.

926
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,985
It is an arrangement that we have both
come to accept

927
01:18:20,986 --> 01:18:23,586
and embrace

928
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,505
I love you.

929
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:47,515
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

930
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,214
Thank you.

931
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:58,756
Alright, off you go, sweetie.
Daddy's gotta do the work.

932
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,871
Listen! Before begin, please.

933
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:11,268
I'm gonna use this tape for my fans.,

934
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:14,606
and there's a fair number of them out there

935
01:19:14,607 --> 01:19:17,607
so let's try not to fuck this up

936
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,715
I wanna apologize, before we start...

937
01:19:25,016 --> 01:19:28,516
if what I say frightens you 
or makes you uncomfortable.

938
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,226
I'll be fine.

939
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:38,729
No, you will not be fine.

940
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:44,735
What I have to teach will be
frightening.

941
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:49,406
The truth is an acquired taste.

942
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,613
But once you get to it.

943
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,214
That's all you ever want.

944
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,483
That's all.

945
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,420
Now, those kids out there, we...

946
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:06,021
The undesirables...you might call us

947
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:11,729
You, me, we know the truth.

948
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:17,166
We know it, you know,
society don't want you.

949
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,673
Your parents don't want you.

950
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:24,742
The corporate America sure as fuck doesn't want you, 
you wouldn't be here otherwise, would you!

951
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:29,048
And if America had the chance.

952
01:20:29,049 --> 01:20:30,849
If this government had the chance

953
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:36,387
They would gas us in a heartbeat.
They would exterminate us

954
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,695
just like the Jews
or they would enslave us.

955
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:46,896
like the niggers, 'cause make no mistake about it
we are the new niggers of this country.

956
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:52,402
Nobody respects us, nobody sees
what we have to offer.

957
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,551
Nobody has any compassion for us.

958
01:20:56,585 --> 01:21:02,621
They don't care or they're too naive
to see that we are the fucking...

959
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:08,319
of a wasteful society that has failed

960
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,093
To educate, to embrace

961
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:15,125
to fulfill, to inspire any of us

962
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:18,226
we are societal garbage

963
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:23,267
There ain't no counter culture. Not anymore.

964
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,771
It's gone, it's dead and it was
replaced by us.

965
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,244
The garbage culture.

966
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,048
We've been tossed aside.

967
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:38,382
We've been imprisoned, 
we've been institutionalized.

968
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,658
We've been systematically abused.

969
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,990
We've been executed, we've been enlisted

970
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:50,091
into armies... started 
by governmental fuckers

971
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:53,966
with the  sole purpose of killing us off.

972
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:58,377
That's all, to kill us fucking off.

973
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:01,909
And every week...

974
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:06,810
somebody shows up at my doorstep
 and they're disillusioned and they're addicted

975
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:11,081
And they're angry and they're pissed 
'cause they've been set aside.

976
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,720
They've tossed out with the garbage.

977
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:18,122
Let me tell you something, 
every time somebody like that

978
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:23,427
comes and joins the garbage culture,
the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger

979
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,009
and they get a little bit weaker.

980
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:32,936
Until the theys and the thems
of this country run out of places

981
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:35,912
run out of places to put the garbage.

982
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,614
They can't put it anywhere and
it overflows into their cities

983
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:43,647
and it spills over out of the places that
they have set aside

984
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:45,148
to contain us

985
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:50,922
And we will burn down their world!

986
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,060
We will set fire to their world!

987
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:59,662
And we will not stop until our
rain of fire falls upon their heads.

988
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,411
And then we will fornicate in their ashes.

989
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,548
That's what is here for you.

990
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:16,417
That's what is here.

991
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,987
I'm glad you showed up I can't believe it.

992
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,888
You're having a good time?

993
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,395
We love it here.

994
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:59,456
I'm glad to hear it, you know,
I know what you did to Dinko.

995
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,134
Fuck!

996
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:06,205
You will like all we're getting to you now son.

997
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:15,005
You shut it up, now you do like?

998
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:22,012
I'm gonna rape your fucking girlfriend. 
I will rape your girlfriend, son.

999
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,022
How do you feel now?

1000
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,465
- Do you think he's fucking dead?
- Yeah.

1001
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,428
Let me go!

1002
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,448
God.

1003
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:12,115
Judy, sweetie, wake up on me!

1004
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,518
What are you doing?

1005
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:22,730
Come Judy, I'm getting you out of here, sweetie.

1006
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,737
What the fuck is going on?

1007
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:38,117
Baby, you're bleeding! Are you ok?

1008
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,219
Wanna take you out, ok?

1009
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,929
You're bleeding.

1010
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,538
There's blood everywhere.

1011
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:05,771
- Will you just get into the car.
- I don't feel so very well.

1012
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:09,271
Don't fall asleep. Stay awake!

1013
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,914
Stay awake.

1014
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,494
You alright sweetie?

1015
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:29,428
Fuck! I'm sorry.

1016
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:32,263
Judy wake up!

1017
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,299
Please, fuck!

1018
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:51,814
Judy, Judy, wake up!

1019
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,360
Come on, I saw you waking up a while ago.

1020
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:07,870
Are you ok?

1021
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,572
Am I with you?

1022
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,774
Yeah, you're with me.

1023
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:19,275
I'm ok.

1024
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:26,983
Jimmy.

1025
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,525
Judy, not the camera right now, ok?

1026
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:34,591
No, reminds me when
we first met just you and your camera.

1027
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:37,603
Remember how you used to freak me out.

1028
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,439
Do you know how much money we have?

1029
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:42,533
No, I don't know, why?

1030
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:46,343
I was thinking... maybe Canada.

1031
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,310
It's closer than Mexico.

1032
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,945
Ok, as long as I'm 
with you, I don't care.

1033
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:01,822
Actually I was thinking maybe I should take you home.

1034
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,324
What?

1035
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,430
I could...

1036
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:10,263
write you a letter or send you a video.

1037
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:16,065
Say I made you do everything they'd believe you.
Just have to say I made you do everything!

1038
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,078
No, I don't want that.

1039
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:26,041
Listen, I'll be fine, ok?
I'll be fine, just go to Canada

1040
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:29,049
or you can sail on to Mexico.

1041
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,456
I don't wanna be without you.

1042
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:35,886
Judy, I know we swore on the bond
that we'll never be apart.

1043
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:38,397
But...

1044
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,564
I'll let you go, I won't be mad at you, sweetie.

1045
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:46,098
No, Jimmy,

1046
01:30:48,099 --> 01:30:50,899
I'm staying with you and you're staying with me.
That's all there is to it!

1047
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,276
Ok.

1048
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,851
You're so handsome, you know that?

1049
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:03,823
Jimmy, pull over, you're too fucked up to drive.

1050
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,025
Ok.

1051
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,099
Did you want to ask me something?

1052
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,865
- Judy, do you love me?
- You know I do.

1053
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,338
Do you know I love you, right?

1054
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:22,239
- Sweetie.
- What?

1055
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:25,074
- We're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1056
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:27,444
Use the rear-view mirror.

1057
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,378
It's over, we're done honey.

1058
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:37,353
Pull over, it's not worth it, ok?

1059
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:42,252
Judy, my God, there's a road block.

1060
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:45,996
Listen...

1061
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:50,025
Jimmy, just shut up, why you're being 
such a little bitch all of a sudden?

1062
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:53,837
I'll tell them that I told you early
I'll them that I made you do everything.

1063
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,274
We're staying together!

1064
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:57,277
Listen, we can't fucking be together!

1065
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,405
Yes we can, I won't sack and give you, cause I can't.

1066
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:04,841
- Judy, I love you.
-I love you too.

1067
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,312
Do you hear that?

1068
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:13,054
My God.

1069
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:15,652
It's a barricade, stop the car.
