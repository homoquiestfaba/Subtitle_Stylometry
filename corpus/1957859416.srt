I already told you,
I've been looking.

43
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,862
Just having some bad luck.

44
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,034
There's no such thing
as bad luck.

45
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,827
Just means you're lazy.

46
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,068
Look, I'm trying my best.

47
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,206
Well, your best
ain't good enough, Danny!

48
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,931
Don't worry, I'm not going to be
some kind of bum all my life.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,137
You got that right,

50
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,793
because if you don't
get a job soon,

51
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,344
I'm kicking you out of this
house.

54
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,689
Alfonso, get up, we're going
to be late for church!

55
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,413
Ma, you scared the shit
out of me.

57
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,482
-Watch your language, damn it.
-Oh, sorry.

58
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,551
What are you going to do, huh?

59
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,068
You going to sleep all day?

60
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:55,689
Hurry up,
we're going to early Mass.

61
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:57,448
Oh, Ma, church?

62
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,655
Sí, church.
Lord knows you need it.

63
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:04,689
-What's that?
-What's what?

64
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:07,310
Ah! Ah! Ah!

65
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,896

This!

68
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,689
Oh, Ma, that's just, you know,
a hickey.

69
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:16,379
Hey, you're messing up
my hair, Ma!

70
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,034
Alfonso...

71
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,137
Lust is the work
of the devil. Huh?

72
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,103
I guess I'm going to hell,

73
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:28,137

feels good.

74
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:31,241
Ah! Okay, okay, stop it.

75
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,586
Alfonso, you listen to me.

76
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,206
If you're going to live
in my house,

77
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,517
you'd better show some respect,
comprendes?

79
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:40,344
Mi'jo, how is your father
going to get you job

80
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,758
if you look like that?

81
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,586

Okay, Ma, okay.

82
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,586
And change that underwear,
or whatever that is.

83
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:54,620
I mean, look, you can almost see
everything hanging out.

84
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,965

Why is he coming back
to this fucked-up place, though?

114
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,896
Because the 'hood is home, dawg.

-Big Joe.
-What's up, homes?

124
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:08,965
Looking slick, dawg!

125
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,137

You blew up and shit, huh?

-They'll be happy to see you.
-Can I speak to you?

138
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,103
I can't believe
this fucked-up couch

139
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,931
is still here, man.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,896
Yeah. It's always been here.

141
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:53,241
I see your grandfather's
still hanging tough, huh?

142
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,310
Yeah, he's still going strong.

143
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,620
That's good.

144
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,275
And the old man Canto?

145
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,034
You know, he's there.

146
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:07,482
Damn, homes,
this place never changes.

147
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,655
I've been in and out
of the joint all my life.

148
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:11,448
Every time I come out,

149
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,551
the neighborhood
still looks the same.

150
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,241
You stay out this time.

151
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,689
I'm going to give it
my best shot, homes.

152
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,103
But for some reason,
trouble always seems to find me.

153
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,275
I got two strikes now.

154
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:26,241
One more and I'm gone for good.

158
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,448

00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,896

160
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:48,517
Out and about again.

161
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,689
What's up, dawg?
I heard you was out.

162
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,655
They weren't letting us in.
I'm out.

163
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,965
What up, Danny?

164
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,862
What up, Gramps?

165
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,448
Thought you knew, fool.

166
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:01,000
Clocking that dope money,
that's what's up.

167
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,620
So you think you big-time now,
huh?

168
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:05,793
-Is that it?
-Come on, Joe.

169
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,275
You know what's up, biggie.

170
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:10,413
I'm the only one fucking selling
dope over here, homes.

171
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:11,965
Ain't nobody else doing it.

172
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:13,379

173
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,103

a kid picking your nose.

174
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:19,448
See? Come out here,
give an old dog some respect...

175
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,724
But don't be disrespecting me,
homes...

176
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,793
in front of somebody else.

177
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,862
Because then I'll have
to call you on it.

178
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,482
Let me tell you something, ése.

You need to get your ass back to YA,

193
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:19,586
you can't lift this,
loose change.

194
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,206
What the fuck you talking about,
boy?

195
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,758
Okay, Mr. Bodybuilder.
You're the shit, right?

196
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:25,862
I know one thing for sure.
You can still get tossed, fool.

197
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,206
Let's go right now, bitch.

198
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,034
Come on, man. Get back.
Shit, let's lift.

199
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:30,379
Fuck this dude.

200
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:32,034
Damn, dude,
what's up with you, bro?

201
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:34,172
Why do you want to start
throwing blows and shit,

202
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,620
like a fag.

203
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,965
What, 'cause I'll fuck you,
now I'm a faggot?

204
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,965
Come on, Ray, you know you're
two beers away from being a fag.

205
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,793
- Man, shut the fuck up.
- Danny...

206
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,655
remember that time
when we were wrestling,

207
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,551
when he had me in that bear hug
from behind?

208
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,931
Getting a hard-on?

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,965
Yeah, I remember that shit.
All 3 1/2 inches.

210
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,103
Trying to rub that shit in my ass, bro.

211
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,068
Why are you bringing
that shit up for, huh?

212
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,137
It was a long time ago.
What, we was like 12?

213
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:57,965
Long time ago?
That shit was last week.

214
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,275
Yeah, whatever.

215
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,379
Bitch.

216
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:03,620
-Two.

217
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,896
Two. Come on. Three.

218
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,137
-Three. Come on, keep going.

219
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,241
-Come on, three more.
-Put that shit out, dawg.

221
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,862
Yo, Raymo, what the fuck
you think you doing, dawg?

222
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:16,862
I'm getting high, man.
What's it look like I'm doing?

223
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,137
What, you want a hit?

224
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:19,551
You know we don't do that shit.

225
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,689
What's up with you, Ray?

226
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:23,482
Just my way of making it
through the day.

227
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:25,172
Put that shit out, man.

228
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,724
My old man's
going to smell it.

229
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:29,862
Since when the old man giving
a fuck about what you do, huh?

230
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,689
What?

231
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,758
You and your old man got issues,

232
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,896
don't be taking this shit
out on me, okay?

233
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,862
What the fuck's that supposed
to mean?

234
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,068
It means what it means.

235
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,758
You know what?

236
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,379
Just fucking leave, Ray.

237
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,275
I was leaving anyway.

238
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,034
Fuck both you bitches.

239
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:01,517
Hey, Ma, I am starving.

240
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,758
Is it okay if I make myself
a tortilla with butter?

241
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,379
No, Ramon, the food's ready.

242
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,034
What are you making?

243
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,275
Chorizo.

244
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,862
-Again?
-Yes, again.

245
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:18,068
Well, I'm starving.
I'll eat anything.

246
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:24,896
Ma, what do we got to use these
old mayonnaise jars for glasses?

247
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,620
Excuse me.

248
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,517
Bring out the china.

249
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,862
Aw, Ma.

250
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:32,586
"Aw, Ma," nothing.

251
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:35,172
It's not like when your father
was alive.

252
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,241
Things are different now.

254
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,862
Is that for you?

255
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,793
Yeah, Ma.

256
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:50,862
Ma, can you loan me $30?
I'll pay you back.

257
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,724
What did I just finish
telling you, Ramon?

258
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,931
You know I get my check
on the first of the month,

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,344
and I'm already behind
on the rent.

260
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,827
But I really need $30.
I need it right now, Ma.

261
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,241
I don't have $30.

262
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,551
You sure?

263
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,551
I'm sure.

264
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,172
Is everything all right?

265
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:08,689
Everything's fine, Ma.
Don't worry, okay?

266
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:10,103
And don't worry about the rent.

267
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,862
I'm man of the house now,
all right?

268
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,448
'Sup, Gramps?

269
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:32,517
Chillin', fool.

270
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,344
Man, ever since Raymo's pop died
he's been acting like this, man.

271
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:37,310
Got to feel for him,
you know?

272
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,206
Get out, you!
Who sends you people?

273
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,482
Damn! Damn!

274
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:47,758
Stupid!

275
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:49,793
-'Sup.
-Man.

276
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,655
Mr. Kim don't even know, eh?

277
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,896
I'm trying to help his stupid
little chickenshit business!

279
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:00,379
Hey, man, but I got a deal
for you guys.

280
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:02,068
I'm gonna hook you up, eh?

281
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,517
Check this out.

282
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:06,000
Bam! Food stamps.

283
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,379
County issued.

284
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,827
The real deal.

285
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:11,034
We don't need no food stamps.
We ain't that poor.

286
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,965
Come on, man.
I'll give you a good deal.

287
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:17,862
Twenty bucks worth of stamps
for ten bucks!

288
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,551
-No, that's cool, dawg.
-No, man.

289
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,931
Okay, okay, okay.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,482
Twenty for five bucks.

291
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:24,827
Now that's a bargain

292
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,724
not even the Welfare Department
could give you.

293
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,344
Get your crazy ass
out of here, dawg.

294
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,241
All right, then.

295
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,586
See how you are?

296
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,448
I'll catch you guys later, eh?

297
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:46,724
You're short 30.

298
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,413
Oh, yeah.

299
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,172
You know, I got this
crazy smoker, man.

300
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,241
But he say he's gonna
get me next week, so...

301
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,034
You're already fucking up
with my, Ray.

302
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,827
Don't think I'm stupid too.

303
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:57,344
I know why
you're coming up short.

304
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,551
You're smoking up my shit.

306
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,586
I was just testing out the
product, dawg.

307
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:04,241
But I know your shit's good,
so it ain't gonna happen again.

308
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,310
Don't fuck with me, Ray,
all right?

309
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,310
I ain't fucking with you,
Gramps.

310
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,689
There's your cut.

311
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,551
Five dollars?

312
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,379
That's right, motherfucker.
Five dollars.

313
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,931
You do the math, genius.
Stop smoking my shit.

317
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,620
We cool, dawg?
We still got homey love?

318
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,379
-Yeah, we cool.
-Cool, fag?

319
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:51,000
Yo, what's Gramps
doing here?

320
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,586
Putting in some work for him.

321
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,241
What?

322
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,724
Man, you selling for Gramps?

323
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,448
What's wrong with you, man?
You crazy?

324
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,310
How come you didn't tell us
about that shit, dawg?

325
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,034
Money's money.

326
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:04,172
You guys know I got to start
helping out my moms.

327
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:05,620
Yeah, we know, dawg.

328
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,931
Times are hard, but this ain't
no way to go about it.

329
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,310
-Gramps is bad fucking news.
-Yup.

330
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:13,000
You guys are making a big deal
out of nothing, man.

332
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,620
Hey, Lucy.

333
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,379
Hope it's not too late.

334
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,482
No, it's not too late.
I was at the library, studying.

335
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,724
Damn, girl,
you're always studying.

336
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,206
You know, one of these days
your head's going to explode

337
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,103
-from all that studying.
-No.

338
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:49,827
There's nothing wrong
with working too hard.

339
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,034
You should try it.
You might like it.

341
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,241
-Yeah, right.
-Hm. "Yeah, right."

342
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

343
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,310
You know that
Alfonso's parents

344
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,724
are having their anniversary
party this Saturday?

345
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,310
-It's this Saturday?
-Mm-hm.

346
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,275
You want to come?

347
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,379
Yeah, I want to come.

348
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,206
-Yeah?
-As long as you gonna be there.

349
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,931
I'm gonna be there.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,655
You gonna look good for me?

351
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,586
Danny, wait.

352
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,000
What?

353
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,689
Danny, it's a letter
from New York University.

354
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,310
Yeah?

355
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,034
-Open it!
-No, I'm too nervous.

356
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,241
I don't know.

357
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,896
You open it.

358
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:40,620
-Hurry, hurry.
-All right, relax, girl!

359
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:43,241
You look like you're going
to pee on yourself or something.

360
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,344
-Want me to get you a diaper?
-Let's go, hurry.

361
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,724
Okay, all right.

362
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,724
It says, "Congratulations...

363
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,896
"we are pleased to inform you
that you have been accepted

364
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,758
to New York University."

365
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,344
Oh, my God.

366
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,275
I can't believe it.

367
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:03,344
I'm in.

368
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:04,965
-I'm in, Danny.
-Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:08,103
New York University.
Isn't that, like, in New York?

370
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,827
I can't believe
I'm going to New York.

371
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:13,137
I thought you said you were
going to stay around here

372
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:14,862
when you finish
junior college.

373
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,965
Danny, aren't you happy for me?

374
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:22,172
No, I'm not fucking
happy for you.

375
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:23,551
Oh, please.

376
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,068
No, what...

377
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:26,689
You're, like, leaving?

378
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,862
And I'm supposed to be happy
about that shit?

379
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,413
You know, you don't care
who you leave behind, do you?

380
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:33,965
That's not true.

381
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,310
You know, that's all right.

382
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,448
I'm getting used to people
walking out of my life.

384
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:47,724
Danny.

385
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,241
Danny, come back.

388
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,862
Man, gotta say,
that's good, dawg.

389
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,689
Did you check out
my mom and dad, bro?

390
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,413
You wonder why I'm so horny
all the time? Look at them.

391
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,241
It's called love.

392
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,310
Something you know
nothing about,

393
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28,344
Mr. Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am.

394
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:31,344
Shit, that's right.
That's me, qualified pimp, bro.

395
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,793
I was hoping Lucy'd bring
some of her fine-ass friends,

396
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,103
because I'm horny
like a motherfucker, dawg.

397
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,689
You'd better get you
a kung fu grip, G.I. Joe,

398
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:41,137
because Lucy's ass
ain't coming.

399
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,413
Shit.

400
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:48,206
Man, I ain't had food
this good in a while.

401
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,931
Man, you got enough food
on that plate?

403
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,758
Yeah, dawg, I'm good.
I'm out, though.

404
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:56,862
Where are you going, bro?
The party's just starting.

405
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,344
I'm gonna go kick it
with Gramps.

406
00:20:58,413 --> 00:20:59,620
Oh, shit, man.

407
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,137
Kick it here with us, dawg.

408
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,344
Fuck Gramps, all right?

409
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:04,137
I got to go, dawg.
Sorry, man.

410
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,793
You know, rent's due.
Need the money.

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,103
Get the fuck out of here then,
faggot.

413
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,275
There's Lucy right there, bro.

417
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:31,758
I don't know.

418
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,620
-She looks good, though.
-Hell, yeah, she looks good.

419
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:38,206
Let's get over there, man.
How do I look?

420
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,965
-Greasy as shit.
-Shit, just the way I like it.

421
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,620
Come on.

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,172
Lucy.

423
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,310
Glad you ladies made it.

424
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,620
Danny.

425
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,448
Hey, Alfonso, this is my friend,
Chespi.

426
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,413
We go to school together.

427
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,103
Chespi, huh?
That's a beautiful name.

428
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,172
Beautiful face.

429
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,793
Big...beautiful eyes.

430
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:06,620
You must be a model, right?

432
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:09,931
How original.

433
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,551
Nice to meet you.

434
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,655
Pleasure's all mine.

435
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:19,206
Lucy, you never told me
you had such a beautiful friend.

436
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,137
You know, I used to be a model.

437
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:26,793
Are you for real?

438
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:29,034
You'd better watch out
for this one, Chespi.

439
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:31,896
I think I can take care
of myself, Lucy.

440
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,172
Yeah, Lucy, she can take care
of herself.

441
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:37,965
Can I offer you
something to eat?

442
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:39,206
Like a beer?

443
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,275
Yeah. Sure.

444
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,241
'Sup?

445
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,655
We'd better talk.

446
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:01,896
Danny, I want--

447
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,758
Fucking come on, man.

449
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,931
Hey, fool.
Wake the fuck up.

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,137
Keep an eye out.

451
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,724
I got it.

452
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,310
You see what I told you?

453
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,896
When these fools see me
rolling up,

454
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,137
it's like I'm the motherfucking
ice-cream man.

455
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,000
I just don't like
this neighborhood, dawg.

456
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,482
Making me all nervous and shit.

457
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:36,965
Get the fuck out.

458
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:40,241
-'Sup, Gramps?
-What the fuck you want?

459
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,620
I wondered if you can hook me up
with some shit, dawg.

460
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,413
I'll hook you up
when you got the money.

461
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,551
Oh, come on, dude.
Front me this one time, dawg.

462
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,137
I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear.

463
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,517
I get my General Relief check
first thing in the morning.

464
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:53,103
Motherfucker, this look like
a motherfucking layaway plan?

465
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,137
Come on, dawg,
20 bucks ain't gonna break you.

466
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:57,620
I said, does this look like
a motherfucking layaway plan?

467
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:58,689
-Dude, no.
-What?

468
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:00,724
Hey! Go that way.

469
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,551
You fucked up.

470
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:20,241
What you doing, Gramps?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

471
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,551
Shut the fuck up, Raymo,
and pay attention.

472
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:26,517
This is what happens to fools
that fuck with my reputation.

473
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:28,344
Don't do it.
Don't kill me, Gramps.

474
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,172
Please, come on,
we go back way too long.

475
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,172
Come on, here.
I don't know what I was doing,

476
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,103
but here's the money,
take the money back.

477
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,000
-Stupid motherfucker. 

478
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,379
You ain't ever gonna fuck
with my reputation again,

479
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,241
you fucking dope fiend bitch.

480
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:51,862
Let's just get out of here, dawg.

481
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,758
Pick up the money.

483
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,586
I said, pick up the fucking money.

485
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,482
-Sit down.
-Ow, Danny!

486
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,482
You know you just
made a scene.

487
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,827
I'm not going
to let you leave.

488
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:35,137
You're not going.

489
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,793
Danny, I have to.

490
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,689
I thought we had
something here.

491
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:42,379
Danny, we don't have
anything here.

492
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:44,448
What are we gonna do?

493
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:46,206
We gonna get married,
and then--

494
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,724
And then you're gonna take care
of us by playing basketball

495
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,137
for the rest of your life?

496
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:53,310
Hustling for ten bucks a game?

497
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:55,965
Come on, Danny.

498
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:59,172
I want to have
more than that.

499
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,137
You don't think I want
more than that?

500
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,827
I want more than that too, Lucy.

501
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,689
Then, good.
You can come with me.

502
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:10,206
Let's go.
Let's get an apartment together.

503
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,620
What, leave?

504
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,034
I-I just can't leave, Lucy.

505
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:20,137
Danny...

506
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,482
look at me.

507
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:26,517
I'm not the same
quiet little girl

508
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,344
you met in high school
anymore.

509
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:32,344
I don't want to have
to depend on you, okay?

510
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,551
I want to be able
to survive on my own.

511
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,137
I want to go out there
and be prepared.

512
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,965
Who the hell
taught you that?

513
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:42,275
Your lesbian butch haircut
college professor?

514
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:45,586
Fuck, Danny, you didn't hear
a thing I just said, did you?

515
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:46,896
You just say "fuck"?

516
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,551
I can't believe
you just said "fuck."

517
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,172
I never heard you
say "fuck" before.

518
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,931
Danny, I said it, okay?
I said it. Fuck.

519
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,655
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
There, I said it again.

520
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,068
I swear to God, college is just
messing you up bad, girl.

521
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,586
I'm leaving, Danny.

522
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:07,241
And I'm leaving with or without you.

524
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:17,172
Nothing.

525
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,137
I don't know. I just wish life
was easier, you know?

526
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:38,413
I just don't know anything about
anything right now, abuelito.

527
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:49,931
What's the difference?

528
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:07,344
Well, how does a pigeon know
when he's ready to fly?

529
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Boom, boom, boom!

530
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,413
Just dumped his whole clip
on this poor fool.

531
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:28,000
Damn.

532
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,413
I'm telling you, Ray,
Gramps is fucking crazy.

533
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:31,896
This is some serious shit, dawg.

534
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:33,827
We're talking straight-out
murder here, bro.

535
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,965
Ain't like I pulled the trigger,
you know what I'm saying?

536
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:38,137
No, but you were there.

537
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,206
Look, man, I'm just trying
to make some money.

538
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,344
I ain't into all this killing
shit, you know that.

539
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:45,137
Should have thought
about that shit from the get-go.

540
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,206
Who's fucking up now, Raymo?

541
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,068
Come on, man.
Come on, let's play.

542
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,517
-No, no--
-Just play. Just play, man.

543
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,448
Back on, Danny.

544
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:05,827
Back up, man. Come on, Danny.
Take it to the hoop. Let's go.

545
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,758
Damn, man.
Get off me, man.

547
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hey, we got a problem?

548
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,620
Yo, just take the ball, man.

549
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,620
-Take it up.
-Yo, Ray, take it up.

550
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,827
Get a point, Alfonso.
Don't mess up.

551
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,068
You want this?

552
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,275
Get off me, man.

553
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,379
Yo, Alonzo,
throw it, dawg.

556
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,689
Is your girl coming?

557
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:36,241
Fuck! Pass the--
Get the ball out!

559
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,517
Alfonso, pass the fucking ball!

560
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,862
I ain't passing nothing, man.
Come on.

561
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,551
Pass the ball, dawg.

569
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah! Yeah!

570
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:03,620
-Give me that!
-Whoo-hoo!

571
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,655
Yeah. You guys will never
beat us, man.

572
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:07,206
- Go sit down.
- Later, losers.

573
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,517
Go sit down.
We did it, guys.

574
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,103
-Get off the court.
-Yeah!

575
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,517
I fucking hate
them motherfuckers.

576
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,413
They think they better
than us.

577
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:24,793
Yo, I don't think we're good
enough to beat them, dawg.

578
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,034
That's our problem.

579
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,862
We're always feeling sorry
for ourselves.

580
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,862
I know we can beat
their old asses.

581
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,068
I don't feel sorry
for myself.

582
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,655
I feel sorry
for this silly fucker.

583
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,000
You lost the game.

584
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,379
Me?

585
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,068
Yo, I got fouled, dawg.

586
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,137
Yo, Danny, you saw that shit,
man. I got fouled.

587
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,517
Hey, just remember, Alfonso,

588
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,241
you can't do it by yourself,
all right?

589
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,551
-Only as a team.
-What?

590
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,379
-Just remember that shit.
-What?

591
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,482
What, Danny? What?

592
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:50,034
-What?
-Man, shut the fuck up.

593
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,758
You sound like a broken record.
"What, Danny? What? What?"

594
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:54,586
-"What? What?"
-What'd I do? What'd I do?

595
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:55,965
-What, I like you don't know?

596
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:57,689
You fucked our world,
is what you did.

597
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:00,793
Flossing for the bitches.
We lost.

599
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,103
Shit, he's coming, man.

601
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:20,931
What's up, little homies?

602
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,896
-What's up?
-What's up, dawg?

603
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,448
Hey, Raymo,

604
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,758
I heard you're selling
a little something-something.

605
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:28,655
Oh, yeah?
What you need?

606
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:30,724
I'm glad you asked, homey.

607
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,448
Boy, do I got a deal
for you guys.

608
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,103
I'll trade you a dove sack...

609
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,620
for these brand-new bibles
that I ripped off.

610
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,034
Dawg, I can't believe
you stole bibles, man.

611
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:44,034
Come on, Raymo.
It's an even trade, eh?

612
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,724
Bibles for little mota.

613
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,482
This ain't a swap meet, dawg.

614
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,137
- No.
- Okay, okay, okay.

615
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,482
Check this out.

616
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,827
They're New Testament, dawg.

617
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,551
I don't give a fuck
how new they are.

618
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,862
Plus, you know
I can't read.

619
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:00,000
See how you are?

620
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,931
And I thought you were
a businessman, eh?

621
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,241
God's gonna punish you
for this, Raymo.

622
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,206
Torneo, you want the shit
or not?

623
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:12,034
Yeah, I guess so.

624
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:13,137
How much you want?

625
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:14,724
Give me a dovey.

626
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,206
Two dimes, dawg.

627
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,655
All right, then.

628
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:24,206
I'm out of here.

629
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,517
Laters.

630
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:29,137
Later.

632
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,551
You know, Big Joe used to be
a really good boxer in prison.

633
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,862
They should have kept
that lowlife locked up.

634
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,172
Ooh, the guy on the right's
pretty good.

635
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,310
Boy, you don't know
shit from Shinola.

636
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:50,482
He's a washed-up boxer.

637
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,137
Look at that shot.
Hell, no.

638
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,241
He keeps dropping his left,
Danny.

639
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,862
Those jabs take their toll
on a boxer.

640
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,551
Do you have that habit?

641
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,862
Dropping your left?

642
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:06,655
All the time.

643
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:08,551
He's got a lot
of heart, though.

644
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,275
Most fighters do.

645
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:13,551
Mando Ramos, Bobby Chacon,
Muhammad Ali.

646
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,206
They never quit.
They just keep coming at you.

647
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,517
Isn't that the way you were
when you fought?

648
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,482
I never ran away.

649
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,931
Doesn't having heart
count for something?

650
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,310
Having heart doesn't count
for shit.

651
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,241
You still come out a loser.

652
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:33,793


653
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:35,862
I'm going to bed.

654
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:40,000


655
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,448
Turn out the lights.

656
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:09,275
Can I help you?

657
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:11,448
Yeah, you have the little
pig-shaped ones?

658
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,000
No, we ran out.

659
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,379
But we'll have some more
later on today.

660
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:18,482
You know, I was wondering
about that sign in the window.

661
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,724
-What about it?
-Do you still need someone?

662
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, I sure do.
Do you have any experience?

663
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:24,482
Experience?

664
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:26,793
Well, in a bakery
would be nice.

665
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:28,586
No, but I'm a hard worker.

666
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:30,758
I can do that kind of work.
I got strong hands.

667
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,241
I'm sorry, kid,
I'm looking for somebody

668
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,551
-with a little experience.
-Look, I'm a fast learner.

669
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,551
-I pick things up like this.

670
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,000
Look, I need a job, sir.
Please.

671
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,000
Everybody around here
needs a job, muchacho.

672
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,931
Look, look,

673
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,517
I'm just asking you for a shot.

674
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,620
You won't be sorry,
I promise.

675
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:53,034
Lookit, I pay $4.75 an hour.

676
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,344
Eh?

677
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:56,965
No benefits,
because I cannot afford it.

678
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:58,517
The hours are long.

679
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:01,620
4:00 in the morning
to 4:00 in the afternoon.

680
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:04,551
Bottom line:
it's ball-busting work.

681
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,241
The last guy quit on me.

682
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,931
Well, what do you think?

683
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,551
Perfect.

684
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,517
Can you start Monday?

685
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,241
Hell, yeah,
I can start Monday.

686
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,379
Good.

687
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,896
All right,
I'll see you Monday.

688
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:20,758
-All right.
-Hey, oh, by the way.

689
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,448
-What's your name, kid?
-Oh, Danny.

690
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:23,896
Danny Pacheco, sir.

691
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:26,586
Okay, Danny Pacheco.
I'm Mr. Ochoa.

692
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,620
-Nice to meet you, boss.

693
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,862
I'll see you Monday. Early.

694
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:33,379
Yeah. Yeah, early.

701
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,068
We'd better stop, Alfonso.

702
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,896
Stop? What do you mean, stop?

703
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:02,758
I mean, stop.

704
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,206
-W-W-What's wrong?
-How bad do you want me?

705
00:36:06,827 --> 00:36:08,551
Shit, I want you bad.

706
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:14,206
What is it? What, does my breath
smell or something?

707
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,275
How bad do you want me, Alfonso?

708
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,655
I just told you,
I want you real bad.

709
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:22,655
Enough to beg for it?

710
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,965
Shit, I ain't begging
for nothing.

711
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,827
Okay, okay, okay.

712
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:45,517
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

713
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,965
I'll let you know
when I'm ready.

714
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,793
For now, you have
to "talk to the hand" thing.

715
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,068
The hand thing?

716
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:57,137
Yeah. The hand thing.

717
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:59,137
Now, can you please
drive me home?

718
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,586
Shit.

719
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:12,620
What'd you say
about my mama?

721
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,241
Yeah.

722
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,655
Oh, yeah!

723
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,241
Nice shot, dawg.

724
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,551
Shit. Lucky shot.

725
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,862
Lucky? Them's some skills,
doggy dawg.

726
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:23,379
Let's see what you got.

727
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,275
How was your date
with Chespi last night?

728
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,482
It was all right.

730
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:29,827
I knew you wasn't
gonna bone her.

731
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:32,310
You're such a dick, Raymo.

732
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:33,862
Come on, Chespi's a good girl,
man.

733
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,655
We're talking
Catholic high school here.

734
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:38,137
Shit, I think her parents
even want her to become a nun.

736
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:40,586
-Shit!

737
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:42,206
What you laughing at, bro?

738
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,586
-Bullshit, man.
-What you laughing at, bro?

739
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:47,241
Don't you know that Catholic
high school girls are the worst?

740
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,344
You see, they know the power
of pussy, and how to use it.

741
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:51,965
Trust me, man,
I'm like "Go see Cal"

742
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,172
when it comes to bitches.

743
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:55,103
Shit, who are you bullshitting,
bro?

744
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,586
When it comes to girls,
you're a big old scaredy-cat.

745
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,000
Or a faggot.

746
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,413
Oh, oh, there you go again.
See, you just frustrated.

747
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:02,931
I'm gonna do you favor.

748
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,448
I'm gonna call Chespi and tell
her to give you that pussy,

749
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,206
because I'm tired
of this faggot shit.

750
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:08,689
Shit, you don't know jack, bro.

751
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,103
Chespi was on me
like a backpack.

752
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,517
I had her begging for my big,
brown snake, bro.

753
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,310
But you know what?
I'm gonna make her ass wait.

754
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:19,379
Shit, who does she think
she is?

755
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,896
That's right. Never let a bitch
call the shizzat.

756
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:24,206
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm talking about.

757
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:27,137
Full control, baby.
That's what I'm about.

758
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:28,379
-Right.

759
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, snap.
Yo, man, I got to jet.

760
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,551
Gramps is paging me.

761
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,448
Damn, bro, it's like you're
picking Gramps over us, man.

762
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:36,793
Yo, I thought you were getting
out of this game, man.

763
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,655
Look, man, I told you
I was gonna get out.

764
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,275
Just got to make some snaps,
make my ends meet, help Ma out.

765
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,965
-You know what I'm saying?
-You already said that shit.

766
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,241
Look, man, I'll catch you
on the flip side, all right?

767
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:51,965
Yo, leave the beer, dawg!

769
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,310
That's some good
quality shit, homes.

771
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:59,241
I'm buzzing like a motherfucker, man.

772
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,793
Right.

773
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:02,965
On a serious tip.

774
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,827
Big Joe's out.

775
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,655
I think he wants to gang me
for my shit.

776
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,758
But I'll let you know one thing.

777
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,137
What?

778
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:18,862
Ain't nobody gonna fucking
gang me for my shit.

779
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:20,827
Fucking nobody.

780
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:26,103
You know, I was thinking,
Gramps.

782
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,103
After I get a little bankroll,
I'm...

783
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,551
I'm going to take a little break
for a minute.

784
00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:36,413
Get a 9-to-5.

785
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,034
You know, a real job.

786
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,620
-A real job.
-Yeah.

787
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,068
Let me tell you something,
Raymo.

788
00:39:45,137 --> 00:39:48,241
You gonna get out
when I let you out.

789
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,827
-Yeah, but--
-Yeah, but nothing, fool.

790
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:01,620
Why do you think I capped
that basehead the other night?

791
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,241
To teach your ass a lesson.

792
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,586
I go down...

793
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,241
you go down to.

794
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,482
What, you didn't think
I brought you into this

795
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:13,724
because I thought
you were smart?

796
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:16,620
No, motherfucker.

797
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:18,793
Rule number one:

798
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:21,206
don't let nobody in
that's smarter than you,

799
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,137
because they might end up
burning you.

800
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:26,896
You ain't getting out.

801
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:36,068
I don't feel so good.

802
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,482
Handle it.

806
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,862
'Sup, Big Joe?

807
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,586
Let's take a walk, homes.

808
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:27,862
What the fuck you think
you're doing, Raymo?

809
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:29,896
Didn't Gramps teach you
anything?

810
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,172
Taught me how to make
that dollar.

811
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,793
Yo, let me teach you
how to stay alive, homes.

812
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:37,137
Whenever a sign of two heads,

813
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,655
always keep them
in front of you.

814
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:40,896
Don't even turn you back
on nobody, no matter what.

815
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,275
Yeah, I guess.

816
00:41:42,344 --> 00:41:43,931
You guess?

817
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,517
Ain't no guessing about it,
homes.

818
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,620
Ain't as if you're some fucking
Avon lady selling soap dishes.

819
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,758
Hey, look at me when
I'm talking to you, homes.

820
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:56,965
In this business, if you turn
your back on anybody,

821
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:58,275
you're gonna get fucked.

822
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:00,310
Some motherfucker's
gonna creep up on your ass

823
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:02,068
and take you
for all you've got,

824
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:04,275
then put you in a box
just for the fuck of it.

825
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,517
You see this scar right here?

826
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:09,862
Yeah.

827
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:12,000
I turned my back
on a motherfucker one time.

828
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,310
And just like that,
he stuck me with a screwdriver.

829
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:18,310
I almost lost my eye, homes.

830
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,551
That ain't gonna happen to me.

835
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:44,862
I'll be there early,
Mr. Ochoa.

836
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,379
What are you thinking, Danny?

837
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:47,655


838
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:48,965
Shit.

840
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:09,275
Danny!

846
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:05,241
You getting the hang of it?

847
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,827
Yeah, everything's good,
Mr. Ochoa.

848
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:09,344
Good. If you need any help,
just ask Marcos.

849
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,896
Ah! Fuck! Shit!

850
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,000
Did you burn yourself?
Are you okay?

851
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,379
Yeah, I'm okay.

852
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:29,758
After 25 years
of working here,

853
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:32,310
I don't even have
to wear gloves anymore.

854
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,103
Of course...

855
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,103
I don't have any feeling
left in my fingers.

856
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:50,379
What's up, Joe?

857
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:51,862
What's up, homey?

858
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,379
Brought you some sweet bread
to go with your beer.

859
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:55,724
Thanks, homes.

861
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,379
How was work?

862
00:45:01,482 --> 00:45:03,586
It ain't easy,
that's for sure.

863
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:04,862
There's a guy there,

864
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:07,034
busting his ass
for 25 years.

865
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:09,068
Can't even feel
his fingers anymore.

866
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:11,620
Shit, I don't know
if I can last that long.

867
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,310
Remember when you were younger?

868
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,827
I used to tell you there was
more out there than you think.

869
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:17,172
Yeah, I remember.

870
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:19,482
The neighborhood can't offer you
everything, homes.

871
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:24,310
You know, when I was growing up,
I never got good advice.

872
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:26,068
It was always bad.

873
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:28,137
I had this constable
one time tell me,

874
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,379
"You know, you people
are real good at fixing cars,

875
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:32,862
but you got to remember
to fix them, not to steal them."

876
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,448
He said that?

877
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, he did, homes.

878
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:38,482
But I taught that motherfucker
a lesson.

879
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,034
What'd you do?

880
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:43,034
I stole his Volvo
from the teacher's parking lot,

881
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:45,655
and I set it on fire right there
in front of the schoolyard.

882
00:45:45,724 --> 00:45:47,482
-Nah!
-Yeah, I did.

883
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:49,000
Good times.

884
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:57,172
Lucy got accepted into
this fancy college in New York.

885
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,551
Is that right, homes?

886
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,068
Yeah, and she wants me
to go with her.

887
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,275
Well, there it is, Danny.

888
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,896
You could do something
with yourself.

889
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,310
Something good.

890
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:09,551
Don't ever be afraid
to leave the 'hood, bro.

891
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,034
Man, I ain't afraid.

892
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,275
You ever been afraid, Joe?

893
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:22,379
I was always afraid, homes.

894
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:24,620
I had a lot of chances
to do something with myself

895
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:26,586
when I got out of the joint,

896
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:29,206
but I kept coming back
to the neighborhood, you know?

897
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:34,551
That'll always be
my biggest mistake.

898
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,517
So I guess we're all afraid, huh?

900
00:46:57,551 --> 00:46:58,793
Abuelito.

901
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:03,689
I am.

902
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:05,448
I brought you
some sweet bread.

903
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:35,275
Guess you won't be
kicking me out soon, huh?

904
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:40,034
There's a plate
on the stove for you.

906
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,206
I'm not hungry.
I'm just going to go to bed.

907
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:19,586
In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.

908
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:21,034
- Amen.
- Amen.

909
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:27,034
So, Alfonso,

910
00:49:27,103 --> 00:49:30,862
tell me more about this girl
that you've been seeing.

911
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:32,689
What's her name?

912
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:35,034
Crespi, or Crispy.

913
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:37,344
-Chespi, Dad.
-Chespi, honey.

914
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,620
Is she a good girl?

915
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,655
Yes, Dad,
she's a good girl.

916
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:45,448
The only way this boy's
going to meet a good girl

917
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:46,758
is at church.

918
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:49,448
Ma...

919
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,068
Chespi is a good girl.

920
00:49:51,137 --> 00:49:53,206
I'm telling you guys,
she is like an angel.

921
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:55,689
I mean, she went to Catholic
high school and everything.

922
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:01,620
And she was going to be a nun.

923
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:03,034
A nun?

924
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,448
See?

925
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,379
Dios mío, thank you.

926
00:50:09,448 --> 00:50:11,896
Alfonso, have you slapped flesh
with her yet.

929
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:17,310
He didn't mean that.

930
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:18,758
Who's teaching you
these things?

931
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:19,793
Alfonso.

932
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:21,000
-I did not.

933
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,965
-Ah!

934
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:25,965
Listen, you'd better keep your
little quack-quack in your pants

935
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:27,379
with this Crispy girl.

936
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:28,931
Do you hear me, Alfonso?

937
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,206
Quack-quack? What?

938
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:31,965
Don't give me this "what-what"
business.

939
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:33,931
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

940
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,137
"What?"

941
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:39,827
And, by the way,

942
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:41,827
I talked to Frederico
about that job for you.

943
00:50:41,896 --> 00:50:44,103
Now, he wants to see you
on Saturday.

944
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:46,413
Saturday? I can't then.
I'm playing ball with the guys.

945
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:49,137
Can you believe this kid?

946
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:51,275
Playing ball with the guys
is much more important

947
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:52,482
than getting a job?

948
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,275
Look, you'd better
be there on Saturday.

949
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,068
I mean it.
And don't you dare forget.

950
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,206
Okay, okay, I'll be there
and I won't forget.

951
00:50:58,275 --> 00:50:59,586
You'd better not.

952
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:07,655
Can somebody please
pass me the beans?

954
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,413
I'm ready, Alfonso.

955
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,862
Take me.

956
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:27,275
You sure?

957
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:28,655
Yeah, I'm sure.

959
00:51:38,068 --> 00:51:39,827
Shit.

960
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,241
How long have you had this
in your wallet?

961
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,689
I guess it's been a while, man.
All right, look.

962
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:48,034
Maybe we should go to the store
and buy a three-pack.

963
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:50,482
Who cares, baby?
Who cares?

964
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:52,275
Wait. You sure, right?

965
00:51:52,344 --> 00:51:53,965
Do you want me or not?

966
00:51:54,034 --> 00:51:56,000
Shit, of course I want you.

970
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:13,206
Whatsup, man?

971
00:52:14,448 --> 00:52:15,586
Hey, you Raymo?

972
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,103
Yeah, I'm Raymo.

973
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:19,068
What you want?

974
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,241
Dove sack, homes.

975
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,448
Hey, is this shit good?

976
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:23,655
Is this shit good?

977
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,965
Hell, yeah,
my shit's good.

978
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,448
Hurry it up.

979
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:29,103
I got to take a leak.

980
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,758
Is my shit good.

981
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:41,310
I don't fuck around, dawg.

983
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:45,448
Yeah, my shit's good.

984
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:47,275
I got the bionic chronic.

985
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:50,655
Shit, yeah, take you
to another level, man.

987
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,379
Fuck up, homes!

988
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:57,517
This is fucked up.
What's up, man?

989
00:52:57,586 --> 00:52:58,931
Shut the fuck up,
fuck bitch!

990
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
-Yo, what's your--
-Shut the fuck up, homes!

991
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,137
Take his money, homes.

992
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:04,655
Fuck it, ése. Fuck it!

993
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,034
Let's work something out, man.

994
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,931
Fuck off, Raymo Ray!
Take that shit, homes.

995
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,379
Let's just talk about this, man.

996
00:53:09,448 --> 00:53:11,034
Shut the fuck up!

997
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,655
Fucking got it.

998
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,000
I got some-- I'll hook you up
with some fucking shit.

999
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,517
What do we do now, homes?

1000
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:20,689
Fucking blow this fucking fool's
head off, ése.

1001
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,793
You got my shit, dawg.
Come on, man.

1003
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:25,275
Get on the floor, ése!

1004
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:27,586
-Right now, homes!
-Hands behind your back!

1005
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:30,172
Blast his ass.
Blow his fucking head off, ése.

1006
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,137
Put your hands
behind your back.

1007
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:34,241
Get the fuck out of here, ése.

1008
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,758
Fuck.

1010
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:05,965
Fuck.

1011
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:12,068
What the fuck you doing outside?

1012
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:13,379
What?

1013
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:15,068
What happened to your pants?

1014
00:54:15,137 --> 00:54:16,965
I got jacked.

1015
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:18,655
What?

1016
00:54:18,724 --> 00:54:20,379
Oh, fuck, dawg.

1017
00:54:20,448 --> 00:54:21,689
How much?

1018
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,310
$1,500, man.

1019
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:25,724
They fucking caught me
slipping in the alley, dawg.

1020
00:54:25,793 --> 00:54:27,310
Fucking Big Joe told me, man.

1021
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:29,172
He told me to fucking
watch my back.

1022
00:54:29,241 --> 00:54:30,551
What the fuck you gonna do?

1023
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,551
I don't know, Danny.

1024
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,586
Fuck, dude, Gramps is gonna
come looking for your ass, dawg.

1025
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,000
He's gonna want his cash.

1026
00:54:41,068 --> 00:54:42,724
I know Gramps is gonna
want his money.

1027
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:44,586
You think I need
to hear that from you?

1028
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,413
This is your doing, Ray.

1029
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:50,448
You walk around like some
fucking kingpin.

1030
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:52,689
Didn't have to go out like this.

1031
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,931
So, you going to leave me
hanging now?

1032
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,482
Huh, dawg?
Is that just about now?

1033
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:59,241
I told you so?

1034
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:04,862
No, no, dawg.

1035
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,689
I ain't gonna
do that to you.

1036
00:55:08,862 --> 00:55:10,448
Come on,
you're like my brother.

1037
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm just so fucking tired,
Danny.

1038
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,068
I'm just so fucking tired
of everything.

1039
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:25,000
Look, dawg,
at least you okay, man.

1040
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,344
You know?

1041
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,379
I mean, just crash here tonight.

1045
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:44,931
Dude, I get paid
from the bakery next week.

1046
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,793
I mean, it ain't gonna cover
$1,500,

1047
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:49,896
but it's yours, homey.

1049
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:53,275
Thanks, dawg.

1050
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:03,103
Just...just try to get
some sleep, all right?

1052
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:08,862
Boy, I fucked up, man.

1054
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:37,310
$1,500?

1055
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:39,310
He got to borrow $1,500, bro?

1056
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,655
I can't believe that, man.

1057
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,793
He almost got his ass
taken out.

1058
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:46,862
Shit, dawg, I'm broke, man.

1059
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:49,344
I mean, maybe I could ask
my pops for some cash.

1060
00:56:49,413 --> 00:56:50,965
Not $1,500,
that's for sure.

1061
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:54,896
-What are we going to do?
-I don't know, what can we do?

1062
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:57,379
-We ain't got that kind of cash.
-We got to do something.

1063
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:58,689
Gramps ain't gonna
let this shit go.

1064
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:00,517
I know he's not going
to let it go.

1065
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,379
Where's Raymo at now?

1066
00:57:02,448 --> 00:57:04,241
At his pad.

1067
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,551
Hiding out.

1069
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,689
For how long, dawg?

1072
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:23,000
Yo, dawg, I know you don't want
to hear this shit right now,

1073
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:24,931
but I got in Chespi's pants
last night, bro.

1074
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,379
Got bucko, I was like--

1075
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:28,103
-Get off me, man!

1076
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:29,310
Shit.

1077
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,793
You lying, dawg.

1078
00:57:30,862 --> 00:57:32,379
Shit, I ain't lying, dawg.

1079
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:33,965
We went at it all night long.

1080
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,965
I must have nutted
six or seven times, man.

1081
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:38,275
That's got to be some kind
of world record and shit.

1082
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:40,724
I can't believe she gave
that shit up to your ass, man.

1083
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:43,000
Didn't you say she wanted
to be a nun or something?

1084
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:45,000
That don't sound like
no nun to me.

1085
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:47,896
I hit that shit so hard
she almost passed out, bro.

1086
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,517
Yo, I took full control, baby.
I showed her who the man was.

1087
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:51,724
I was like...

1089
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,103
Dude, you wear a jimmy hat,
though?

1090
00:57:56,758 --> 00:57:59,137
Come on, Al, tell me you
at least wore that little old,

1091
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,172
expired, crusted shit
you got in your wallet.

1092
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:03,620
Of course I did, dawg.
What you think, I'm stupid?

1093
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:06,413
-You didn't wear one, huh?

1094
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,310
Dawg, that shit is just
too good, man.

1095
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:10,241
Just got caught up
in the moment, you know?

1096
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,965
I figured I didn't need one,
you know?

1097
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:13,586
Well, I hope that pussy
was worth it.

1098
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,655
Oh, that shit was worth it, bro.
I was like...

1100
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:19,068
Oh! Your daddy!

1101
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:22,896
What's up, Joe?

1102
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:26,827
Don't touch it
with that, homes.

1103
00:58:26,896 --> 00:58:28,068
Sorry, man.

1104
00:58:29,379 --> 00:58:31,793
I heard Raymo got caught
with his pants down last night.

1105
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:33,206
Shit. How'd you know that?

1106
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:34,551
Come on, homes.

1107
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,379
I've been here too long
not to know.

1111
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:58,000
Where's Raymo?

1112
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:01,206
We don't know where he is.

1113
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah, we haven't
seen him around, dawg.

1114
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:09,482
Don't fuck with me, Danny.

1115
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,586
He said he didn't know
what was happening, ése,

1116
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,034
so why don't you just
step off.

1117
00:59:13,103 --> 00:59:14,724
No, fool, why don't you
step off.

1118
00:59:14,793 --> 00:59:17,068
You're in my business now, Joe.

1119
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,620
Why don't you just get the fuck
out of here, man.

1120
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,103
What?

1121
00:59:21,172 --> 00:59:23,413
You think you're gonna come back
to this neighborhood

1122
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:25,241
and think everything's
gonna be the same?

1123
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,620
Fuck you, old man.

1124
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:29,448
I ain't that little kid anymore,
fool.

1125
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:31,862
So why don't you just take
your little prison fantasies

1126
00:59:31,931 --> 00:59:33,379
and get the fuck
out of here.

1127
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,206
And you.

1128
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:43,586
You just tell Raymo
to watch his back.

1129
00:59:48,448 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, he said watch your back,
man, with a Glock in our face.

1130
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:52,379
Shut up, Danny.

1131
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:53,896
Who's that?

1132
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,793
Relax, relax, relax, man.

1133
00:59:56,862 --> 00:59:58,551
It's just a car driving
down the street.

1134
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,103
Look at me, man.

1135
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:02,103
Look at me, I'm all--
I'm all fucked up now.

1136
01:00:02,172 --> 01:00:04,000
I can't even fucking
think straight.

1137
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,689
-Who's that?
-Come on, Raymo.

1138
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:08,655
Look, you're getting me nervous.
Shit, dawg, it's just a car.

1139
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:10,551
Fuck, I hate this shit, man.

1140
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,931
Hiding out in my own house
like a fucking prisoner.

1141
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,482
Well, we shouldn't be out here,
man.

1142
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:18,000
Gramps will smoke
the three of us.

1143
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:19,482
Will you shut the fuck up,
Danny?

1144
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:21,965
Hey, fuck you, man. He didn't
have the gun in your face.

1145
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,068
-It was in my face.
-I was fucking there, okay?

1146
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:26,206
I was right behind you, bro.
Not right now.

1147
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:29,862
Was it worth it, Ray? Huh?

1148
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:32,517
You want to make a little cash?
Now you're hiding out here?

1149
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,172
Fucking up, Raymo.

1150
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:38,068
You know, I may be
a lot of things,

1151
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:42,034
but one thing I ain't gonna be
is a punk.

1152
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:43,724
Fuck that.
You know what, man?

1153
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:45,965
I'm gonna have
a little respect.

1154
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:47,793
I can't run from Gramps
my whole life.

1155
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:49,068
Fuck him.

1157
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:51,758
You're thinking
all wrong, dawg.

1158
01:00:51,827 --> 01:00:54,275
Look, you just wait until things
cool off, all right?

1159
01:00:54,344 --> 01:00:56,931
- Cool off?
-They're gonna cool off real quick ok?

1160
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,620
I fucking know Gramps.
That fucker's crazy.

1161
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,793
Fuck him, though.

1162
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:04,275
He's gonna catch me?
Don't let him catch me here.

1163
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:06,655
And he ain't going to.
Not in front of my jefita, man.

1164
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:09,103
She doesn't deserve to see me
go down like that.

1165
01:01:09,172 --> 01:01:12,586
Let's handle this shit
on the street, like men.

1166
01:01:12,655 --> 01:01:14,827
Yeah, you thinking all wrong,
dawg.

1167
01:01:14,896 --> 01:01:17,482
So you just keep
fucking up.

1168
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,000
Can I come in?

1169
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:30,655
Yeah, I guess.

1170
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,689
I wanted to come
and say goodbye.

1171
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:48,172
I don't want to leave with
hard feelings between us, Danny.

1172
01:01:51,482 --> 01:01:53,586
So you were really going
to leave me, huh?

1173
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,965
I have to be back east
the day after tomorrow.

1174
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:05,241
I hate this shit,
you know that?

1175
01:02:06,413 --> 01:02:07,896
Danny, please.

1176
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:11,344
Please stop running away
from me, please.

1178
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:28,965
When my mom walked out
on me and my dad...

1179
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:32,206
I swore to myself

1180
01:02:32,275 --> 01:02:34,827
I would never let myself
feel that way again.

1181
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,068
And now here you are,
just...

1182
01:02:42,655 --> 01:02:45,620
just bringing all those feelings
back again.

1183
01:02:45,689 --> 01:02:48,379
Danny, I'm sorry.

1184
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:51,172
Sometimes...

1185
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:53,793
Sometimes we're just forced
to make decisions in our life

1186
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:55,310
that we don't like.

1187
01:02:57,793 --> 01:02:59,517
And I don't like this.

1188
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:02,379
But I have to do it.

1189
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,758
So, what am I
supposed to do?

1190
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,241
Just let you go?

1191
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:09,586
No, I don't want you
to let go.

1192
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:12,965
I want you to come with me.

1193
01:03:15,103 --> 01:03:17,034
Oh, God, Lucy,
I wish I could.

1194
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:19,344
-Then come.
-I can't.

1195
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:21,586
It's just too many things
I got to take care of.

1196
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:23,586
There's just too much
going on.

1197
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:33,344
I just want you to know that
this is important to me, okay?

1198
01:03:37,275 --> 01:03:38,586
I know.

1199
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:45,310


1200
01:03:45,379 --> 01:03:47,379
I love you so much, Danny.

1201
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,724
I love you.

1203
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:20,482
I don't want
to leave you, Danny.

1204
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:24,896


1205
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:32,758
I love you.

1206
01:04:46,689 --> 01:04:48,344
That's bullshit.
Raymo got jacked, man.

1207
01:04:48,413 --> 01:04:49,965
Look, I know that
and you know that.

1208
01:04:50,034 --> 01:04:51,551
But that's a rumor
the guy started,

1209
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,034
and it makes Gramps look weak.

1210
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:55,137
Man, fuck Gramps.
He's gonna get his money back.

1211
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:56,689
What are you, stupid?

1212
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:58,931
Ain't about cash no more, homes.

1213
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,758
It's about Gramps' reputation
on the street.

1214
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:03,620
And it doesn't help that Raymo's
walking around the neighborhood

1215
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:04,827
as if he's wrong.

1216
01:05:04,896 --> 01:05:06,965
You'd better check him, homes.

1217
01:05:17,965 --> 01:05:20,724
I don't want you talking
to that convict.

1218
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,448
-Yeah, but--
-Yeah, but what?

1219
01:05:23,517 --> 01:05:25,586
Don't you ever
listen to me?

1220
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,689
He's nothing but a no-good
criminal.

1221
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,310
Why are you so worried
about Big Joe?

1222
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:31,689
-Who cares if I talk to him?
-Just stay away from him.

1223
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:33,000
-You hear me?
-Why?

1224
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:34,896
Because I'm your father,
that's why.

1225
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:36,862
Why don't you act
like my father.

1226
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:39,068
At least Big Joe's there for me.
He talks to me.

1227
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:41,103
Goddamn it,
what do you want from me?

1228
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:43,448
-I don't want anything from me.
-Damn it, Danny!

1229
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:46,586
I give what I got to give.

1230
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:48,655
You don't give me nothing!

1231
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:50,241
You've never
given me anything!

1232
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,896
I thought your job
was to teach me

1233
01:05:52,965 --> 01:05:55,068
what it's like
to be a man.

1234
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:57,241
But instead, you're just some
broken-down old man

1235
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:59,586
in a wheelchair that doesn't
give a shit about nothing,

1236
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,965
especially me.

1237
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:06,000
What? You want to hit me?

1238
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:07,241
Is that what you want?

1239
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,000
Well, come on,
you son of a bitch.

1240
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:11,310
You're just like
that whore mother of yours.

1241
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:16,413
Don't you ever talk that way
about my mother, you hear me?

1242
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:19,103
You don't deserve her.

1243
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:23,034
You remember that time
you lost that fight

1244
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,689
and got your ass knocked down
in the second round?

1245
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,689
What did you do?

1246
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:34,000
You beat her...

1247
01:06:35,379 --> 01:06:37,965
so I couldn't recognize
her beautiful face anymore.

1248
01:06:40,103 --> 01:06:41,689
You remember that,
old man?

1249
01:06:42,827 --> 01:06:44,241
Because I swear to God,

1250
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:49,103
I'll never get her face
out of my fucking head.

1251
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,379
You son of a bitch.

1253
01:07:24,655 --> 01:07:26,275
He's my son, jefe.

1254
01:07:28,724 --> 01:07:30,827
I raised him as I saw fit.

1255
01:07:57,655 --> 01:07:59,689
Danny! Come here!

1257
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,068
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Ochoa?

1258
01:08:07,137 --> 01:08:09,137
Yeah, Danny. Come in.

1259
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:16,620
I know you've been
with my for a while.

1260
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:18,896
And I hate to do this.

1261
01:08:18,965 --> 01:08:21,275
But I'm going to have
to let you go.

1262
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:22,724
-W-W-What did I do?
-Oh, no, no.

1263
01:08:22,793 --> 01:08:24,275
You didn't do anything wrong,
mi'jo.

1264
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:26,896
You're a good worker.
One of the best I've had.

1265
01:08:26,965 --> 01:08:28,517
So then why are you
letting me go?

1266
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:30,931
Things are slow, Danny.

1267
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,172
Cut my hours.

1268
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,379


1269
01:08:36,448 --> 01:08:38,068
I-I-I'm sorry, Danny.

1270
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,551
I can only afford one helper.

1271
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,275
And you know Marcos has been
with me for many years.

1272
01:08:43,344 --> 01:08:45,379
Then cut my hours and my pay,
Mr. Ochoa.

1273
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:48,620
Jesus, man, I'm already paying
minimum wage.

1274
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,689
I cannot go any lower.

1275
01:08:55,103 --> 01:08:57,793
Look, I really need
this job.

1276
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,344
You're a good kid.

1277
01:09:00,413 --> 01:09:03,275
And this is very difficult
for me, Danny.

1278
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:05,758
So please try
to understand.

1279
01:09:05,827 --> 01:09:07,896
I just can't keep you.

1280
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:26,931
Yo, Ray, I don't think you
should be sitting out here

1281
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,275
out in the open, you know?

1282
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:30,137
I told you, man,
I don't give a fuck.

1283
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:32,551
Shit, Ray, stop screwing around,
man.

1284
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:36,000
Damn, if it were me, man,

1285
01:09:36,068 --> 01:09:38,034
I would have gotten the fuck
out of Dodge already.

1286
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:41,034
Nah. Not me, man.

1287
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:45,793
Like I said, whatever happen,
happens.

1288
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:48,689
Like you just said,
shit happens.

1289
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,793
Hey, man, where's your Jeep at?

1290
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:57,413
Chespi's driving.

1291
01:09:57,482 --> 01:09:59,517
Oh, man, don't tell me
you're whipped already.

1292
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:01,241
-That pussy must be good.
-Yo, shut up.

1293
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,517
I ain't whipped,
all right?

1294
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:04,000
Look, man,
everybody knows

1295
01:10:04,068 --> 01:10:06,620
when you start lending your ride
out to a female, it's over.

1296
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:09,344
-You whipped. Night, Alfonso.
-Will you shut the fuck up, man?

1297
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:12,034
I ain't whipped, all right?
How many times I gotta tell you?

1298
01:10:12,103 --> 01:10:14,206
I'm the man. I wear the pants.
I call the shots.

1299
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:17,413
That's right, you wear the pants
but you ain't got no car.

1300
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:19,310
-Yo, just chill...

1302
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,448
Get in the Jeep, Alfonso.

1303
01:10:26,517 --> 01:10:28,586
But me and Raymo
were hanging out--

1304
01:10:28,655 --> 01:10:30,758
I said, get in the Jeep now.

1305
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:37,896
Yo, I got to go, dawg.
You gonna be all right?

1306
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:39,965
I'm gonna be all right.

1307
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:42,206
You sure, man?

1308
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:43,724
Yeah.

1309
01:10:43,793 --> 01:10:45,620
I was gonna step anyway...

1310
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:48,758
you pussy-whipped
motherfucker.

1311
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,620
Fuck you, homo.

1312
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:52,068
That's right, I'm a homo.

1313
01:10:52,137 --> 01:10:54,275
A Homo sapien,
you brown bitch.

1314
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:55,586
Get your ass home.

1315
01:10:58,827 --> 01:11:00,103
What's up with you?

1316
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,896
Is it that time of the month
or something?

1317
01:11:01,965 --> 01:11:03,862
As a matter of fact,
it's not.

1318
01:11:05,896 --> 01:11:08,137
I'm late, Alfonso.

1319
01:11:08,206 --> 01:11:09,551
What do you mean,
you're late?

1320
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,379
I mean, I'm pregnant.

1321
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:13,965


1322
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:20,206
Do your parents know?

1323
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,758
I can't tell my parents.

1324
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:23,758
You know how religious
they are.

1325
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:27,827
No, they're going to think
they've wasted all their money

1326
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:29,448
sending me to a Catholic
high school.

1327
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:31,448
You're just going to have
to marry me, Alfonso.

1328
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:33,206
Marry you?

1329
01:11:33,275 --> 01:11:34,689
That's what I said.

1330
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,482
Well, what about your college
and stuff?

1331
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:37,827
Please.

1332
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:39,241
I never wanted
to go to college.

1333
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,586
That was my father's idea.

1334
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:44,172
Marriage and a family
is what I want.

1335
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,241
And what I want, you want.
Right?

1336
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,206
I guess.

1337
01:11:51,379 --> 01:11:53,379
Are you crying?

1338
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:55,172
Crying? I just got something
in my eyes.

1339
01:11:55,241 --> 01:11:56,551
I can't believe it.

1340
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,448
I should be the one
that's crying, Alfonso.

1341
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:00,068
What are you...?

1342
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,689
Wait a second, Chespi.
Wait, wait, wait.

1343
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:06,068
Why should you be crying?

1344
01:12:06,137 --> 01:12:08,172
For all I know,
you were afraid of losing me,

1345
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,655
so you went ahead and let
yourself get me pregnant.

1346
01:12:10,724 --> 01:12:13,034
So I let myself
get you pregnant?

1347
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:14,724
Of course you did.

1348
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:16,379
This isn't my fault.

1349
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:19,827
Don't even try
to put the blame on me.

1350
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:22,034
Look...

1351
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:23,931
maybe we should just
think about this.

1352
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,482
Oh, boy, I knew
this was going to happen.

1353
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:27,379
-What?
-What? What "what"?

1354
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:29,620
All you wannabe players
are all alike.

1355
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:31,931
This is the way
it's going to work.

1356
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,310
You are going to ask my parents
permission to marry me.

1357
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,758
And that's final.

1358
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:43,379
Can I ask you something?

1359
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:44,965
What?

1360
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:46,517
Why me?

1361
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:50,206
Because I've never
loved someone

1362
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:51,931
as much as I love you.

1363
01:12:52,896 --> 01:12:54,137
And...

1364
01:12:54,206 --> 01:12:55,896
I never, ever want
to let you go.

1365
01:12:58,413 --> 01:12:59,689
Really?

1366
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,586
Yeah, really.

1369
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,000
That used to be us.

1370
01:13:20,068 --> 01:13:22,137
Remember just fucking around
all day?

1371
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:25,275
Got nothing to worry about.
Just...just chilling, man.

1372
01:13:25,344 --> 01:13:27,827
Yeah, I wish those kids
never have to grow up.

1373
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:30,965
At least not in this
neighborhood.

1374
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:32,310

1375
01:13:33,655 --> 01:13:35,413
What's wrong with you, dawg?

1376
01:13:36,896 --> 01:13:38,827
Chespi's pregnant.

1377
01:13:38,896 --> 01:13:41,000
Damn!

1378
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:42,965
-Are you serious?
-For reals?

1379
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:44,655
Straight up.
I ain't lying.

1380
01:13:44,724 --> 01:13:46,586
What are you gonna do, dawg?

1381
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:50,310
I don't know, man.

1382
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:53,931
Are you crying?

1383
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,862
How stupid, man!
I ain't crying.

1384
01:13:56,931 --> 01:13:58,965
I just got something in my eye,
man.

1385
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,241
Looks like you're crying
like a little bitch.

1386
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,413
I'm gonna make your ass cry
in a second, bitch.

1387
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:05,137
I don't know, Fonse.
I was you?

1388
01:14:05,206 --> 01:14:06,586
I'd kick that female
to the curb,

1389
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,000
that's what I'd do.

1390
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,379
I just feel bad that
I did this to her, you know?

1391
01:14:10,448 --> 01:14:12,620
It's all my fault, man.

1392
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:15,275
I guess I'm gonna have to do
the proper thing and marry her.

1393
01:14:15,344 --> 01:14:17,551
Fonse, what are you, crazy?

1394
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,344
Look, man, you ain't got to do
nothing you don't want to do.

1395
01:14:20,413 --> 01:14:21,689
You the man.

1396
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,379
You in control
of the situation, dawg.

1397
01:14:23,448 --> 01:14:24,827
-Remember that.
-I know I am.

1398
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:27,103
But she's, like,
lost without me, you know?

1399
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,275
She really is. She wouldn't even
know what to do.

1400
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,379
It's like you always say, man.

1401
01:14:31,448 --> 01:14:33,172
Handle your females.
Handle them.

1402
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:35,586
Don't let your females
handle you.

1403
01:14:36,896 --> 01:14:38,379
I do always say that, huh?

1404
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:39,965
Right? Yup.

1405
01:14:41,896 --> 01:14:43,344
I don't need them ho's,
big daddy.

1406
01:14:43,413 --> 01:14:45,172
No. You don't need her.

1407
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:46,862
I don't, huh?

1408
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:49,413
Hell, no.

1409
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:52,379
Shit, it's not like she got
my nuts in a glass jar.

1410
01:14:52,448 --> 01:14:54,793
-She got one of them.
-But you got one left.

1411
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:57,137
Shit, ain't no way
I'm gonna marry her, dawg.

1412
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:59,586
She's dreaming,
and she can keep on dreaming.

1413
01:14:59,655 --> 01:15:02,241
Shit, because I don't need her
in my life, right?

1414
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:05,620


1415
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:09,758
I would just like to say,
first of all...

1416
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:11,827
that I--

1417
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:15,344
I really need your daughter,
Chespi, in my life.

1418
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,310
And...

1419
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:20,241
I-I-I would like to...

1420
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:24,965
to ask both of you
for permission to, uh...

1421
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:35,000
to-to-to-to m-marry
your daughter, Chespi.

1422
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,000
Are you Catholic, son?

1423
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:44,310
Catholic?

1424
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:46,862
Oh, I'm-I'm very Catholic, sir.
I, uh...

1425
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:49,034
Sometimes I think I'm a little
too Catholic.

1426
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:52,034
I even wanted
to become a priest.

1427
01:16:03,448 --> 01:16:04,793
Gracias.

1428
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,862
Damn, homes, I can't believe
I'm getting married, man.

1429
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:14,896
And me and Raymo always said,
you need Chespi in your life.

1430
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:17,137
Chespi's a good girl.
Thank God you listened to us.

1431
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,413
Mm-hm.

1432
01:16:21,931 --> 01:16:25,034
Hey, bro, I don't know how you
can eat tacos with cow tongue.

1433
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,448
That's some nasty-ass shit.

1434
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:27,896
Shit, man,
that's good, bro.

1435
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:29,206
Hey, you want some?

1436
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:31,137
Man, get that shit
out of my face.

1437
01:16:31,206 --> 01:16:34,000
Don't you know that cows
spend their whole day

1438
01:16:34,068 --> 01:16:35,689
licking their big-ass balls?

1439
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,413
-You lying, man.
-Mm-mm.

1440
01:16:37,482 --> 01:16:38,655
Really?

1441
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:40,448
He ain't lying.
Big-ass balls.

1442
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,137
Don't you study biology?

1443
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:44,310
Shit, where do you think
the flavor comes from?

1444
01:16:44,379 --> 01:16:45,793
Whew.

1445
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,896
Did you think you could
hide from me, motherfucker?

1446
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,586
I ain't running from you,
Gramps.

1447
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:10,586
You...you ain't what?

1448
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:12,379
You think you're big shit now,
huh?

1449
01:17:12,448 --> 01:17:13,655
Is that it?

1451
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,896
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1452
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,551
911! 911! Hey!

1453
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,689
911, cabrón! Come on, hey!

1454
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:35,172
Hey, hey!

1455
01:17:39,137 --> 01:17:40,620
Get your little ass
on the rebound.

1456
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,000
You can count on it.

1457
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:48,172
-You okay, dawg?
-Damn, dawg.

1458
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:50,551
I can't believe you stood up
to that fucker, man.

1459
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:53,310
Fuck Gramps.

1461
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:52,655
Shit! Get you some!

1462
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:54,000
What's up, homes?

1463
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:56,689
Yeah!

1464
01:18:56,758 --> 01:18:58,517
Are you hurt, baby?
Are you hurt?

1466
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,482
-Nice shot.
-Yeah. Shit.

1467
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:10,103
You see that pass, though, bro?
Shit, that was cool as fuck.

1468
01:19:10,172 --> 01:19:11,413
You should be in the NBA.

1469
01:19:11,482 --> 01:19:13,137
Yeah, the National Bitch
Association.

1470
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,965
Or the National Bizzatch
Association.

1471
01:19:15,034 --> 01:19:17,586
-National Beyotch Association.

1472
01:19:17,655 --> 01:19:19,931
Hey, man, how come I never
see you break a sweat?

1473
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,586
Because I'm cool as fuck, dawg.

1474
01:19:21,655 --> 01:19:23,103
Some people
just got it like that.

1475
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:24,931
No, man, but everybody
got to sweat, man.

1476
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,586
Get all the shit
out your system.

1477
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:28,310
-It's called toxins, bro.
-Yeah.

1478
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:30,827
The motherfucking toxins, man.
That's why people get colonics.

1479
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,827
You know, I can't help it, bro.
It's genetic.

1480
01:19:32,896 --> 01:19:35,310
-My mom don't sweat either.
-See? There it is.

1481
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:37,172
Your mom-- Your whole family
don't sweat.

1482
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:39,724
You guys got issues, dawg.
You're supposed to be sweating.

1483
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:41,724
All right, just because
you sweat like a pig.

1484
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:44,517
You need to go to the doctor and
have them sweat glands checked.

1485
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:46,241
Hell, pigs don't sweat, bro.

1486
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,896
Look it up, bro.

1488
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,275
Hold on to this, homes.

1489
01:20:22,413 --> 01:20:24,275
Hey, Big Joe.

1490
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:26,827
Hey, homey,
could I have a drink of your 48?

1493
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,448
Didn't I tell you
I was gonna catch your ass?

1494
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:04,655
I told you, Gramps, I ain't
running from you anymore.

1495
01:21:04,724 --> 01:21:07,068
You think you got balls now
so you're gonna stand up to me?

1496
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:09,586
Hey, put the gun away, ése.

1497
01:21:09,655 --> 01:21:11,241
Just squash the bullshit, man.

1498
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,068
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.

1499
01:21:13,137 --> 01:21:14,931
I already told you
this wasn't your beef.

1500
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,965
And I told you before,
don't pull no gun on me

1501
01:21:17,034 --> 01:21:18,379
unless you gonna use it, punk.

1502
01:21:19,862 --> 01:21:23,000
I'll blow your motherfucking
head all over this street.

1503
01:21:26,034 --> 01:21:28,793
Want to see me walk my talk,
motherfucker?

1504
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,896
Check this one out.
This one's for you.

1505
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:33,000
Raymo!

1509
01:23:44,896 --> 01:23:46,551
Fucking curse...

1512
01:23:56,586 --> 01:23:58,241
Shit, they're on my...

1513
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,310
on my fucking arms.

1515
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,827
Oh, fuck.

1516
01:24:04,896 --> 01:24:06,758
Oh!

1517
01:24:06,827 --> 01:24:08,344
Oh, shit!

1518
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:11,068
Oh, fucking Raymo...

1521
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:56,172
I guess this is goodbye,
Abuelito.

1522
01:26:09,758 --> 01:26:11,206
I'm really going
to miss you.

1523
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:16,103
Forgive me, Danny.

1531
01:27:53,103 --> 01:27:55,827
Yo, I'm glad I caught you
before you left, man.

1532
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,413
Yeah, me too, man.

1533
01:28:00,862 --> 01:28:04,000
I'm just waiting for my cab
to take me to the airport.

1534
01:28:05,793 --> 01:28:08,137
How about you, dawg?
How's the married life?

1535
01:28:08,206 --> 01:28:09,931
-It's good, man.
-Yeah?

1536
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,241
Yeah, I'm really happy,
you know?

1537
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:14,655
Yeah.

1538
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,896
So listen, man,

1539
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,517
I've been thinking
Well...

1540
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:22,068
we've been thinking,
me and Chespi,

1541
01:28:22,137 --> 01:28:25,965
that if it's a boy,
we're gonna name him Ray.

1542
01:28:29,793 --> 01:28:31,379
Ray's a good name.

1543
01:28:35,379 --> 01:28:37,206
I really miss Raymo,
you know.

1544
01:28:39,344 --> 01:28:41,310
Yeah, me too, dawg.

1546
01:28:43,896 --> 01:28:46,793
We had some good times
on this couch, huh?

1547
01:28:46,862 --> 01:28:49,241
The three of us grew up
on this sofa.

1549
01:28:51,068 --> 01:28:55,379
remember that time when we were
playing that farting contest,

1550
01:28:55,448 --> 01:28:58,965
and Raymo farted so much
that he shit his pants.

1552
01:29:01,241 --> 01:29:02,448
Yeah.

1553
01:29:03,586 --> 01:29:05,034
How about when...

1554
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:06,517
when he fell asleep
on the couch,

1555
01:29:06,586 --> 01:29:08,758
and he woke up,
and someone stole his shoes?

1558
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,137
His mom kicked his ass for,
like, a week.

1559
01:29:13,206 --> 01:29:15,000
She was barefoot
for a week.

1560
01:29:17,275 --> 01:29:18,724
Check it out.

1562
01:29:21,344 --> 01:29:22,896
San Quentin.

1563
01:29:24,379 --> 01:29:25,724
Big Joe.

1564
01:29:26,896 --> 01:29:28,310
Life.

1565
01:29:28,379 --> 01:29:30,827
Man, life's too fucking crazy,
man.

1566
01:29:32,137 --> 01:29:33,413
What'd he have to say?

1567
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:36,965
He said, make sure we take care
of this sofa.

1568
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:41,275
Most of all, we got to take care
of each other.

1569
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:48,413
Shit, but we'll still
be in touch, right, Danny?

1571
01:29:53,103 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah, man.
You're my road dog.

1572
01:29:57,551 --> 01:29:59,517
New York's only, what,
3,000 miles away?

1573
01:29:59,586 --> 01:30:01,000
I walk there, bro.

1576
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:08,000
Homey love, man?

1577
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:12,034
That's all we ever had, dawg.

1578
01:30:16,103 --> 01:30:18,517
All right, man, you take care
of yourself, all right?

1579
01:30:21,379 --> 01:30:22,965
Say hi to Lucy for me, okay?
