1
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,536
(Rockets roaring)

2
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,146
Man:
Eva, we've got to go now!

3
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,179
Now, now!

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,623
- Come on, Eva!
(people screaming)

5
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,028
Come on, hurry!

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,364
Come on, run!
Eva, come on!

7
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,797
Come on, Eva.
We don't have time.

8
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,332
We don't have time.

9
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,508
- Come on, Eva!
- Get out the door!

10
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,979
- Run!
- Eva!

11
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,952
(Screaming)
- GO, go. Go. 90!

12
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,161
Mommy!

13
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,468
Get back!
Go on, go!

14
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,097
(Shouting)

15
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,532
Woman:
Hold on to me.

16
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,410
(screaming)

17
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,052
(coughing)

18
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,125
(shivering)

19
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,240
(rumbling)

20
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,675
(panting)

21
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,393
(buzzing)

22
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,554
(electricity crackling)

23
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,567
Let there be light.

24
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,627
(clanking)

25
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,800
Yeah.

26
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,954
Not exactly the Garden of Eden.

27
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,128
After a blast,
everything gets vaporized

28
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,628
and sucked up
into the atmosphere.

29
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,976
And it rains back down to earth...

30
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,045
as radioactive dust.

31
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,047
Number one rule:

32
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,387
No one opens that door

33
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,653
till the radiation clears.

34
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,993
You understand me?

35
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,259
You want to survive,
you listen to me.

36
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,041
(Rumbling)

37
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,243
(crashing, metal screeching)

38
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,021
Jesus!

39
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,992
Woman:
Someone get the lights!

40
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,662
- You okay? You okay?
(coughing)

41
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,400
- Someone get the lights!
- Calm down. Calm down.

42
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,342
Don't touch that.

43
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,178
(Crackles) (girl screams)

44
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,551
(coughing)

45
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,580
Holy shit, it's the dust!
It's the dust!

46
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,459
That dust is from the inside.

47
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,463
The bitch is sealed tight.

48
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,522
What was that?
Another bomb?

49
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,057
That was our building
coming down.

50
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,262
How the fuck do you know that?

51
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,931
I don't want to be down here.

52
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,769
I want to go now.

53
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,742
I know, sweetie.

54
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,438
But Uncle Mickey says
we have to stay.

55
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,243
- Why?
- Because your face will melt off

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,113
and your hair will fall out.

57
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,584
She's a little girl.

58
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,782
I was just fucking around.

59
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,884
- So that was a nuke?
- Definitely.

60
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,895
Fucking rag-heads.

61
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,625
- We got to stay down here?
- Bet your ass we do.

62
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,260
That door stays sealed
until the radiation clears.

63
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,928
And how long's that gonna take?

64
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,063
When I say.

65
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,743
What's the plan, Mickey?

66
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,770
Well, my plan was to build
a fallout shelter

67
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,545
and take it easy
while my pain-in-the-ass tenants

68
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,110
barbecued above me.

69
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,383
Does anybody's cell phones work?

70
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,982
No, there's no signal.

71
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,959
- I fucking lost mine.
- You lost it?

72
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,656
Is that a radio?

73
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,188
Give it a try.

74
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,996
Cocksucking jack-off.

75
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,263
- Hello?
(static hissing)

76
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,293
Hello? Hello?

77
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,637
Hello, do you copy?

78
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,640
What's down here?

79
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,559
Mickey: As you see, just a bunch
of storage cells full of junk.

80
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,562
Hey, uh...

81
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,830
uh, it's Mickey, right?

82
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,531
Yeah.

83
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,836
Why do you have
so many mattresses?

84
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,833
Because I'm the super
of a goddamn apartment building.

85
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,712
So why do you have
so many mattresses?

86
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,547
What the fuck do you care?

87
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,644
I sell them on the Internet.

88
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,155
(Man coughs)

89
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,014
Turkish bath in here.

90
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,618
Sorry, ladies, no running water
to wash your panties.

91
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,494
Toilet's on the left.

92
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,660
It's septic,
so after you finish,

93
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,569
throw some lime on top of it.

94
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,703
That's fucking disgusting.

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,472
It's called saving water.

96
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,106
Sure, whatever.
I've got to take a dump.

97
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,880
What's in here?

98
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,857
That's my room.
Nobody goes in there but me.

99
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Mama, I'm hungry.

100
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,893
Uh, Mickey...

101
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,559
do you have anything to eat?

102
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,348
Mickey:
The food is adequate, I hope.

103
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,877
Don't thank me all at once.

104
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,050
No, the food's good.
Thanks, Mickey.

105
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,359
(ball bouncing)

106
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,698
- Hello?
(static hissing)

107
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,797
Hello? Hello?

108
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,835
Anybody there?

109
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,367
Hello?

110
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,244
(Crashes)
- Shut up back there.

111
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,647
Hello?

112
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,016
We have survivors

113
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,954
in a building
on the northwest corner

114
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,615
of 29th and 5th.

115
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,356
I repeat, the northwest corner
of 29th and 5th.

116
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,330
Do you copy?

117
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,970
Woman: Do you really
have to smoke that thing?

118
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,099
I mean, there's already
so much dust in here.

119
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,041
So when can we go up?

120
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,414
When I say so.

121
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,078
Fuck it.
Ade, come on, let's go.

122
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,487
Adrien, come on.
Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.

123
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,015
Let's go. Fuck it.

124
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,756
Mickey:
What do you think you're doing?

125
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,355
Get away from the door.
I won't tell you again.

126
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,026
- I told you!
- Josh!

127
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,895
- Adrien: Look out!
- Get away from the fucking door!

128
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,770
- Get away from the goddamn door!
- Come on!

129
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,367
Go ahead.
Shit!

130
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,174
What the fuck, Mickey?

131
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,272
God damn it.

132
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,544
- Fucking...
(girl screams)

133
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,415
Fucking big man with that ax, huh?
Keep pushing me, Mickey.

134
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,083
Keep fucking pushing me,
you're gonna see what happens.

135
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,615
(Spits)

136
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,229
Ever see what happened
to those poor Japanese bastards...

137
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,498
after we dropped
Little Boy on Nagasaki?

138
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,996
The skin melting off their bones.

139
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,534
Faces like roadkill.

140
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,138
Lucky ones died in the blast.

141
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,740
And those kids in Chernobyl...

142
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,845
eyes and... ears.

143
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,982
Shit growing all over 'em.

144
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,356
Tumors the size of grapefruits

145
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,691
popping out of their necks.

146
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,095
Enough, Mickey.
We get it.

147
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,793
What you need to get

148
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,429
is if that dust gets in here,
we're all fucked.

149
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,338
(Rumbling)

150
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,015
Hope not.

151
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,614
(metal clanking)

152
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,120
(door opens)

153
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,134
(water splashes)

154
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,441
Come here, honey.
Let me braid your hair.

155
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,658
Can I borrow that, please?

156
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,397
Of course.

157
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,405
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

158
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
You kept it.

159
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,415
Of course I did.

160
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,185
Eva.

161
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,558
I'm sorry if I've been acting
a little bit nuts.

162
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,756
I'm just trying, you know,

163
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,787
to keep it together.

164
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,061
I guess that's what survival is,

165
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,070
just trying to keep it together.

166
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,538
But I love you.

167
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,268
And you love me.

168
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,268
And that's what's going
to pull us through this nightmare.

169
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,781
It'll make us better parents.

170
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,550
(lighter clicking)

171
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,913
Eva.

172
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,851
- Eva.
- What?

173
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,507
Come on, honey.
Just one more bite.

174
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,477
Girl:
I want to go home.

175
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,911
Woman: Do you want me to try
and warm them up for you?

176
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,548
Girl:
We are going to die, aren't we?

177
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,457
Woman: No, honey,
we're not going to die.

178
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,893
We're going to live.

179
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,727
Let's just do our meditation, okay?

180
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,460
Shut your eyes.

181
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,094
Really picture the beautiful light
and how good it makes us feel.

182
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,627
Let's do that right now, okay?
Come on.

183
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,334
- Shut your eyes.
- It doesn't work.

184
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,606
- It does work.
- I want to go home.

185
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:45,479
Wendy, you just have
to be patient, okay?

186
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,110
And then it'll get better outside.

187
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,620
And then somebody'll come down
and they'll help us.

188
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,418
- Promise?
- Promise.

189
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,016
Thank you.

190
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,798
Gonna have to eat this shit
every day?

191
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,133
What'd you say?

192
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,597
What?

193
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,674
I give you food.

194
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,342
Shelter, and that's what you say?

195
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,019
Fuckers come down here,
expect me to take care of you.

196
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,287
What do you contribute?
What'd you bring to the fucking party?

197
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,350
Take it easy, Mickey.

198
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:35,161
All my family and friends
are probably dead,

199
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,896
and all you can talk about
are fucking beans?

200
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,401
Come on, Mick!

201
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,138
Are we really supposed
to rely on this guy?

202
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,804
- Sam.
- No, no, no, no, really, really.

203
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,337
How long can you keep us
alive in this... in this...

204
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,543
- Shit hole.
- Yes, exactly.

205
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,813
You know what?
This is a fucking shit hole, man.

206
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,013
Eva:
Calm down. Sam...

207
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,817
No. No, I'm sorry.
I won't stop.

208
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,983
- Stop.
- I won't stop because I want someone

209
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,959
to do something, that's all.

210
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,757
- I need someone to do something.
- Sam, calm down.

211
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,855
- No, I won't calm down because I...
- Sam.

212
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,025
Woman: Sam, please stop.
Stop!

213
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,298
- Do something, man. Come on!
- Sam, please stop.

214
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,669
Instead of just sitting around
waiting to fucking die.

215
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,208
Don't be scared, Wendy.

216
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,884
Uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.

217
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,480
And you're a big girl, aren't you?
Want to see a magic trick?

218
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,219
I'm gonna take my thumb off
for you, all right?

219
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,025
Yeeow!
God, that hurts.

220
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,398
Seen that one before?

221
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,096
Okay, let me think
of another one.

222
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,504
Making your cigar disappear?
(chuckles)

223
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,475
(laughs)

224
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,777
(rumbling) (Wendy screams)

225
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,052
Bobby:
Oh, shit.

226
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,217
Shit.

227
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,058
(metal groaning)

228
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,298
Marilyn:
It's a rescue.

229
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,930
Down here!
Down here!

230
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,445
- Cut the lights.
- What the hell for?

231
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,646
Just do it.

232
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,562
You guys,
what's going on up there?

233
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,872
Hey, okay,
we're civilians, all right?

234
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,570
Okay, we're all
on the same side, right?

235
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,670
(Grunts)
- Whoa, what are you doing?

236
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,204
Didn't you hear him?

237
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,026
(Wendy screams) Mommy!

238
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,897
Help me!
No!

239
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,198
(screaming)

240
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,697
- No!
- Help me!

241
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,176
Wendy!

242
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,181
No, no!

243
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,085
No! No!

244
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,965
- No!
(gunshot)

245
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,868
- Get back.
(screaming)

246
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,238
Go, go, go! Run!

247
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,076
(Gunshots) (groans)

248
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,011
God!

249
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,074
(Breathing heavily)

250
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,311
(electronic pulsing)

251
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,781
(electronic pulsing quickens)

252
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,341
We've got another
2-8-Baker.

253
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,377
(Rapid electronic pulsing)

254
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,963
(screaming)

255
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,008
(shouting)

256
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,215
(screams)

257
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,930
(electronically distorted chatter)

258
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,668
(roars)

259
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,120
(panting)

260
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,734
(groaning)

261
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,837
Give me the lock!
Give me the lock!

262
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,312
- What lock?
- Get me the chain!

263
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,279
- I don't need your help.
- Get out of the way.

264
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,149
Come on, come on.
Put the chain on there.

265
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,280
- Bobby: Mickey!
- Josh: Hey, Mickey!

266
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,517
I need some help.
Adrien got shot.

267
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,083
- Put him down over here.
- What? Okay.

268
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,789
- Whoa, whoa.
(groans)

269
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,492
Hey, somebody fucking
get something. He got shot!

270
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,434
(Whimpering)
- Oh, shit.

271
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,961
- I got to look.
(Adrien screams)

272
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,372
Oh, shit, Bobby.

273
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,171
- What the fuck?
- Somebody get a medical kit.

274
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,408
Thank you.

275
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,484
- I got it. I got it.
- I don't know what to do.

276
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,282
- I got it. I got it.
- There's nothing here that's usable.

277
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,983
It's all from, like,
1934 or something.

278
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,049
- You gotta take the bullet out, right?
- It's gonna sting, okay?

279
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,991
All right.

280
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,690
(Screams) Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.

281
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,358
- You're gonna be okay, man.
- He's gonna die.

282
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,368
- Eva: He's fine.
- He's gonna fucking die.

283
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,837
Shut up!
He's not gonna fucking die.

284
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,430
What do you want me to do?

285
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,533
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, all right?

286
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,340
- Arch your back. Just lean a bit.
- Come on.

287
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,347
- Almost got it.
- Almost? He's gonna be all right?

288
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,007
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He's gonna be okay.

289
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,881
You're lucky it didn't hit
the artery.

290
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,681
- He's gonna be okay.
- Okay, you got to clean that out.

291
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,948
I got it. Thank you.

292
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,922
Come over here.
Come over here.

293
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,050
Okay?

294
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,151
Put your hand on the back there.

295
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,093
Press hard on the front,
keep your hands on the back.

296
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,098
- That's fine. That's good.
- Yeah.

297
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,691
Just like that.
He'll be all right.

298
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,628
Where's Sam?

299
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,732
- Hold this.
- Yeah, I'm here.

300
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,869
- Hold this as hard as you can.
- I'm here. I'm here. I got it.

301
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,712
Sam. Sam.

302
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,718
You okay?
You hurt?

303
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,500
You're alive.

304
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,299
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?

305
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,274
I'm okay.

306
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,950
(grunting)

307
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,456
(panting)

308
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,459
(shivering)

309
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,042
Looks like some sort
of biohazard suit.

310
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,136
Mickey:
It's a radiation suit.

311
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,808
Bet we got hit by one of those loose
nukes I've been reading about.

312
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,647
It's just a matter of time
before one of them hajis

313
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,415
got their hands on one of them.

314
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,014
So you're saying it's the Arabs?

315
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,457
Of course they're Arabs.

316
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,892
They've been at war
with us for 20 years.

317
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,487
It's just that we've been too busy

318
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,261
stuffing ourselves
at the trough to notice.

319
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,825
We should have wiped them
off the map when we had the chance.

320
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,666
Now it's probably too fucking late.

321
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,474
(Moans)

322
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,602
Oh, shit.

323
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,607
Okay, that's disgusting.

324
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,686
Let me guess, North Koreans.

325
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,528
- You're a fucking idiot.
- Get out of here.

326
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,432
Oh, fuck!

327
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,801
(screaming)

328
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,828
Holy shit.

329
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,466
Grab the tape.

330
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,074
I got her.
All right. Okay.

331
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,141
I got her. Ow!

332
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,311
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

333
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,343
Grab her arms.

334
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,023
Put her in the storage room.
Come on.

335
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,363
Get the door.
Get the door.

336
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,364
No!
(wailing)

337
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,742
(radio squealing)

338
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,161
Top rations.
Mickey's orders.

339
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,325
I'm fine. You take it.
You take it.

340
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,269
Can you make anything out?

341
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,207
Only thing I caught was something
about finishing up the sweep.

342
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,873
And they're American accents.

343
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,080
Mickey:
Turn off the fucking radio, man.

344
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,017
That's what got us in trouble
in the first place.

345
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,688
Hey, Mickey,
what is that in your pocket?

346
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,125
Whether it's making
a damn fine sausage

347
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,695
or exterminating
an entire race of people,

348
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,139
those Germans
don't fuck around.

349
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,200
You're holding out food
on us now?

350
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,473
I got a couple of bits and pieces
in my room.

351
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,482
It's my place.
It's my right.

352
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,110
- Just go back to your room.
- Damn it!

353
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,555
Has anyone fed Marilyn?

354
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,359
(laughs)

355
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,797
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Don't waste that.

356
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,595
What's so funny?

357
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,735
What?

358
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,933
What's so funny?

359
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,239
Oh, nothing.

360
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,506
Just what you said
and how you said it.

361
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,777
"Has anyone fed Marilyn yet?"
Like she's your fucking dog.

362
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,080
(Barking) (laughing)

363
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,210
He gets it.

364
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,020
Show some respect.
She just lost her kid.

365
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,821
Go back to sleep, Adrien.

366
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,124
Where are you going?

367
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,432
(Mocking) Where are you going?

368
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,807
She's pissed.

369
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,776
You've got something on your face.

370
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,473
Other side.

371
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,546
That's it.

372
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,854
(Sobbing)

373
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,301
She's all that's good in me.

374
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,605
She's all that's good in me.

375
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,546
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,315
(Sobbing)

377
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,270
(wailing)

378
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,813
- Too risky.
- What do you mean it's too risky?

379
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,477
Eva: Whatever's in the air outside,
it's in here.

380
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,418
Your goddamn duct tape
won't make any difference.

381
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,252
At least we can find out
what's going on out there

382
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,780
even if we don't find her kid.

383
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,419
- You're volunteering?
- I'm volunteering.

384
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,520
He's volunteering.
I say if he wants to go, let him go.

385
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,021
- Let me go. Come on.
- I don't trust you coming back.

386
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,829
What is your problem with me?

387
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,268
- He's got a problem with everybody.
- What about Josh?

388
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,862
- No. Fuck, no.
- Me?

389
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,395
- What about Josh?
- You want me to go?

390
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,931
He ain't got the brains
and that faggot ain't got the balls.

391
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,342
- He'll come back for his brother.
- Thanks, Mickey.

392
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,937
I'll go.

393
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,141
Sam: No, no, no, Eva.
Eva, you can't be serious.

394
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,741
- I'll go.
- Don't be stupid.

395
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,753
- I'll go.
- Delvin: You happy, Mick?

396
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,812
You a punk. You know that?
You a punk.

397
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,882
When you ain't got no ax in your hand,
then you got something to say.

398
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,254
I don't think he's gonna like
what he finds out there.

399
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,789
At least we have to try.

400
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,146
Glove.

401
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,459
- How's your tube?
- Tube is good.

402
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,722
Excuse me.

403
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,889
Do you have air?
Is it working?

404
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,729
- You got one more to go.
- Is the compressor gonna work?

405
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,326
- Yeah, it's fine.
- There it is.

406
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,269
(Breathes deeply)

407
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,136
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

408
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,664
Let's go.

409
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,882
Promise me you'll bring her back.

410
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,415
I'll do my best.

411
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,089
- Delvin: Let's go, guys.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

412
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,333
Let's do it.

413
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,012
What the hell is that?

414
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,033
Hey, Josh.

415
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,970
Don't worry, man.
I... I got this.

416
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,274
(Breathing heavily)

417
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,003
(machines beeping)

418
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,644
Wendy.

419
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,851
Hold it.

420
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,315
Go.

421
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,950
(alarm sounding)

422
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,257
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

423
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,458
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What did you see?

424
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,364
- You're okay.
- I think I got two of 'em.

425
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,891
- What did you see?
- Where's your gun?

426
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,666
They got this... this lab set up there.
It's like... it's like...

427
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,470
- Sam: Josh, what else?
- Like what?

428
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,237
- What else?
- What do you mean what else?

429
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,245
That's it.
There's no survivors.

430
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,838
There's no other civilians.
There's no fucking Red Cross.

431
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,452
I don't know if they're army.
I don't even know if they're American.

432
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,801
I'm sorry.

433
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,377
(clanking)

434
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,722
(clanking)

435
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,562
They're coming back.

436
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,156
Mickey: No.

437
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,663
They're welding us in.

438
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,433
(Voices shouting)

439
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,783
- How are you holding up?
- Uh, I'll live.

440
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,583
Delvin gave me his pain meds.

441
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,783
Mind if I take a look?

442
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,152
I just want to clean it.

443
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,856
You know it's gonna sting a little.

444
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,369
(Groans)
- Sorry.

445
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,733
You a nurse or something?

446
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,876
No.

447
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,780
You're just gonna have
a nasty scar.

448
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,546
Yeah, well,
chicks dig scars, right?

449
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,547
(sighs)

450
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,252
You lived below us, right?

451
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,127
Yep.

452
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,030
Was that you who played guitar?

453
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,729
Yeah. Did that annoy you?

454
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,828
No.

455
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,237
No, I actually really liked it.

456
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,503
Helped me sleep sometimes.

457
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,705
It keeps most people awake.

458
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,915
Not me.

459
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,566
Is everything all right?

460
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,470
Yeah. Everything's fine.

461
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,312
(coughing)

462
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,357
Marilyn: Ugh, how can you
eat with that smell?

463
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,887
We've got to get rid
of those bodies.

464
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,830
How, exactly?

465
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,132
Chop 'em up,
toss 'em down the septic.

466
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,764
Should have tried harder
to get that door open.

467
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,640
That door is welded shut.

468
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,309
We should have put the bodies out
when Josh went out.

469
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,009
Shame we let
those bodies go rotten.

470
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,574
Sam:
What do you mean?

471
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,110
You ever heard about that rugby team
that survived the Andes?

472
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,884
Their plane crashed.

473
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,982
They were forced to eat
their friends and family.

474
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,959
They survived up there
for months.

475
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,427
They ate everything...

476
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,489
ears, toes, assholes.

477
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,900
Uh-huh, arms, legs,
brains, the spleen.

478
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,427
The only thing they didn't eat
was the penis.

479
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,101
If worse comes to worst, you all have
full permission to eat my body.

480
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,974
Yeah, you do.
But not my penis.

481
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,072
Nobody... nobody but nobody

482
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,107
- eats Bobby's penis.
(giggles)

483
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,141
(ax clanks)

484
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,086
What's that for, Mickey?

485
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,292
Uh-uh.

486
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,626
Delvin?

487
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,041
Well, yeah.

488
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,176
Fuck, yeah.

489
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,513
Yeah, I'll do it.

490
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,711
Come on.

491
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,518
I can do this, man.
I got this.

492
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,952
But can he live with it?

493
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,833
- Hey, Bobby?
- I got this, man.

494
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:42,503
Yeah, I'll be... fine.

495
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,684
(Exhales)

496
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,817
It's just like cutting lumber.

497
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,794
I'll start with the arms.

498
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,826
I'll just get my swing down.

499
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,199
(Breathing heavily)

500
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,700
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

501
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,579
Chop a body from head to toe.

502
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,253
(screams)

503
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,617
(screaming) (ax hacking)

504
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,062
(ax scraping)

505
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,184
(ax clatters)

506
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,321
It's blunt.

507
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,604
(groaning)

508
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,638
(unzips pants)

509
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,304
(urinating)

510
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,872
(door opens)

511
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,938
Man, what you doing in here?

512
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,804
What?

513
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,400
How did you get in here, man?
I heard you.

514
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,173
- When did you come in here?
- Fuck off.

515
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,272
How did you get in here?
What you got in your pocket?

516
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,640
Punk.

517
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,786
I was dreaming about Mom.

518
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,660
You think she's okay?

519
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,897
I don't care.

520
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,668
She's your mom.
She's not mine.

521
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,233
Just 'cause she cut
my sandwiches...

522
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,713
- Hey, Adrien.
- Yeah?

523
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,591
I only went out there to see
if there's a way out for us.

524
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,099
(Sam coughing)

525
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,275
Hey, was Mickey an aviator
or something?

526
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,543
Look at these.

527
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,778
What the hell's going on in here?

528
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,121
Come on, Mickey, we're just looking
for some escapism, all right?

529
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,648
I told you from day one
that this was my room

530
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,456
and you were to stay out.

531
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,226
Your casa is our casa now.

532
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,432
I don't know what
you're talking about,

533
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,200
but you're gonna regret this.

534
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,105
This is my ball.

535
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,269
You got it out of my apartment?

536
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:25,041
- I got it out of your ass.
- You got it out of my apartment.

537
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,605
Hey, he's got forks.

538
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,580
- Adrien.
- I've been looking for this ball.

539
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,316
Don't need to use
your dirty fingers any... hey!

540
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,553
- This is a very valuable ball.
- You got it fixed.

541
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,430
Hit down here, come this way,
and jab real hard

542
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,558
and start firing like this.

543
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,195
Now if they're behind you
and they have a gun behind you...

544
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,069
- This is amazing.
- ...what you want to do is feel that tip.

545
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:53,870
Once you feel it,
come to the outside.

546
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,899
The gun will discharge this way.

547
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,173
Take your arm,
take both their hands,

548
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,580
pull with this hand, and go forward
and you'll take the gun away.

549
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,949
All right, soldier, fight safe

550
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,181
and come back
to the United States.

551
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,825
- Oh, another one?
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,388
- Where the hell did you get that one?
- It's the last one.

553
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,263
(Knocks)
- Marilyn: Come in.

554
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,798
Hi.

555
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,067
Here's the makeup.

556
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,268
Thanks.

557
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,175
Makeup.

558
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,281
(Coughs)

559
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,755
Hey, listen, Marilyn.

560
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:18,316
You know, if you need
to talk about anything,

561
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,885
anything like that, I'm here.

562
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,560
You know?
'Cause...

563
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:29,593
I'm sure she's better off
than we are right now.

564
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,630
- What are you talking about?
(coughing)

565
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,736
Wendy.

566
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,079
Eva.

567
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,989
You are a very beautiful girl.

568
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,289
(laughs)

569
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,428
And I know you know
what men are like.

570
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,503
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think's gonna happen

571
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,562
the longer that we stay
down here, huh?

572
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,039
What do you think
is already happening?

573
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,975
- I don't know.
- I do.

574
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,818
Listen, if you need to talk
about anything, I'm here, all right?

575
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,378
Don't you think
you should just be

576
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,686
a little nicer
to the rest of the boys?

577
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,885
Especially Josh.

578
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,353
Fucking hands off me.

579
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,235
(Clatters)

580
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,464
Delvin: All you knew
we had was this much?

581
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,201
That's all there is!
What do you want me to do?

582
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,903
- That's not all there is.
- That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.

583
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,377
That's impossible. There is no way
we can survive with that.

584
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,903
No way. No way.

585
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,677
Josh: You got us
into this situation, now fix it.

586
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,744
Mickey: I got us into this situation?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

587
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,483
I was rationing them.

588
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,081
We're gonna fucking starve
to death, Mickey.

589
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,092
We're gonna die of thirst, Mickey.
Where's the food?

590
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,889
What do you want me to do?

591
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,658
I'm not your nanny,
you arrogant prick!

592
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,426
I'll bet you're just waiting
for one of us to die

593
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,435
so you can have all the food
that you can fucking eat, huh?

594
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,835
(Grunts)
- Oh, shit. What are you...

595
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,567
What is your problem, Mickey?
What is your problem?

596
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,041
(Shouts) My problem is you!

597
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,839
- You're fucking dead.
- And you, and you!

598
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,436
- You're fucking dead, Mickey.
- You're my fucking problem!

599
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,846
- Get back. Get out of here.
- You get out of here!

600
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,440
- Take a walk.
- You get out of here.

601
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,474
- It's my fucking-
- Take a fucking walk!

602
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,113
Sam: Guys, please.
Delvin, come on.

603
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,297
You see he's the only one
not dropping any pounds?

604
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,133
Always stuffing his pig face.

605
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,503
I'm telling you, that motherfucker
is up to something.

606
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:52,578
Stop playing around with that.
Okay? I'm trying to talk to you.

607
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,979
What do you want to do, Josh?

608
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,244
I want to get
that fucking door open,

609
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,650
- even if we rip it off its hinges.
- Fucking-A right, man.

610
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,451
Do you agree with everything
my brother says?

611
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,526
You mean
your half-brother, right?

612
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,653
What, you don't agree?

613
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,896
Have you looked at us?
Huh?

614
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:20,100
Look at me.
We're dying in here.

615
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,166
Where would you rather be?

616
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,642
Door's welded shut.

617
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,650
We got one working suit.

618
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,913
There's not a lot of options.

619
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,550
There's always options.

620
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,184
(Door opens)

621
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,988
I knew you had some stuff
in here somewhere.

622
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,654
You crazy fuck.

623
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,858
It's a peace offering for...

624
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,334
Thank you. Uh-huh.

625
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,030
Back up.

626
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,433
Back up and open it.

627
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,840
All right.

628
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,242
Move over so I can see it.

629
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,115
Start again.

630
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,950
Don't give me an excuse
to use this. Open it.

631
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,614
(clicks)

632
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,719
Got it.
Now push it open.

633
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,229
- Where's it lead to?
- The fucking White House.

634
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,235
- Where are the lights?
- There ain't no fucking lights.

635
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,498
Don't you fuck with me.

636
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,897
Oh, man.

637
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:45,315
(Shouts)

638
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,585
(gunshot) (gasps)

639
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,888
Help!

640
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,298
It's Delvin and Mickey.

641
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,638
Holy shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?
