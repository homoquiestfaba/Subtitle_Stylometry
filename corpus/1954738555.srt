00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,650

Completely untraceable.

Alright...

41
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:31,224
I guess this ain't going to be
no friendly race.

42
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,725
I'm about to up the stake
big time.

43

I want to race.

55
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:31,393
I got the pink slip to my car that says
I can take all of you.

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,735
You think you can just strolled up and race

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,834
Vin Serento?

58
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,928
What are you driving?

59
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:44,949
A car.

60
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:47,310
With unicorns.

61
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,918
Let's see what're you packing
under the hood.

62
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,326
Whoa!

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,543
He's got one of those big shiny things

64
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,735
with a lot of tubes and curly curls
coming out of it .

65
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,576
With a red doeken.

66
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,250
Vin, he's got one of those fancy thing
in the jiggers.

67
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,285
That's the real deal.

68
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,934
But it's not the car you drive.

69
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,634
It's the driver who's driving the car...
that's doing the driving.

70
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,500
That's right

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Let him race.

Let's see what you got.

74
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,076
If you win, you get me.

75
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:50,951
But..

76
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,199
if you lose ...

77
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,442
You get her.

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,709
We've got a black guy in a white neighborhood,
minding his own business.

79
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,079
All units respond.
Repeat.

80
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:07,367
All units respond.

81
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,334
We're good to go,
the cops are going to be busy for a while.

82
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,134
Yo!
Start the race!

83
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,000

Ready.

85

Hey, white boy!

86
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,834
You're grinding your gears.

87
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,867
You have to stop accelerating
as you put it in the first.

88
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,884
Thanks, I've never actually driven
a stick before.

89
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:03,793
Go!

90
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,016
Aww..!

91
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Oh!

92
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,262
Damn it!

93
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,117
Forgot to get gas!

94
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,468

But if you lose ...

100
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,000
You get her.

101
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,525
Oh, hell no!
I ain't going out like that!

102
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,850

I'm going to win.

113
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,625
I'm going to win.

114
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,692
Did I win?

115
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:45,217
Smoked them!

116
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,559
Alright guys,

117
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:03,085
Come here,
puppy.

118
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,284
What you grinning about?

119
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,585
I almost beat you.

120
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:19,835
You almost beat me?

121
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,618
You only can't beat me,
you can't even beat yourself.

122
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,283
Not true Serento.

123
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,549
I've beating myself
since junior high.

124
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:30,576
No way.

125
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:34,085
You wagered a 10 sec car,
you owe me a 10 sec car.

129
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,115
Polpol?

130
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,634
You know five-O.

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,250
Pigs, bacon, barney.

132
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,850
The heat, the law,
the fuzz, the man.

133
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,309
No.

134
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,210
The boys in blue.
The thin blue line.

00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:55,210
Johnny Law, Smokey,
Gunshoot, Flatfoot.

136
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,230
Come on man?

137
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:59,517
Haven't you ever seen an episode
of of CSI or NCIS or Illinois SBU.

138
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,393
Are they on Netflix?

139
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,684
I'm out of here!

140
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,676
Damn,
it's the cops!

141
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,750
Thanks for the heads up
bro!

142
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,159
Where do you think you are going?
Cupcake.

143
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,250
Take it easy.

144
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,643
- Who were you racing with?
- Nobody.

145
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,710
I was taking a romantic midnight drive.

146
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,668
Oh, bullshit.

147
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,000
Give me a name.
Was it Serento?

148
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Aw..

149
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,143
Funny now?

150
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:57,393
Aw..

151
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:58,750
He's a kind of robot.

152
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,018
Oh, yeah.
Alright.

153
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,335
Ready?
Here we go!

154
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,868
Come on, cupcake, you're done.
Let's go.

155
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,301
Give me your hands.

156
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:20,701
Come on.

157
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,143
Hey!

158
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:24,118
Jeez, Hanover,
you have to be so rough?

159
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,659
I had to make it look real.
Serento might had been watching.

160
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:29,725
Serento ever found out I'm was an undercover cop,
he would kill me.

161
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,556
Don't worry. I
erased your files.

162
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,792
No one on the force even
knows you're a cop.

163
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,710
Your secret dies with me.

164
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,298
It's just. Maybe I'm not
the right guy for the job.

165
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,966
I mean.
I don't exactly fit in.

166
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:42,335
- I'm really white.
- You'll be fine.

167
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,663
I'm so white that when i went to
an all white boarding school.

168
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:47,125
Nicknamed was "Cracker".

169
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,460
- I get it.
- No, I don't think you do!

170
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,875
I love hockey.

171
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,418
I water ski,
I have a favorite lacrosse team.

172
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,710
I have a crush on Martha Stewart.

173
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,835
People mistake me
for the WikiLeak's guy.

174
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,841
Okay.

175
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,000
I still buy Kid Rock albums.

176
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,543
I put purplery sachets
in my underwear drawer.

177
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,793
I wear Crocs.

178
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,850
I take a weekly Zumba class.

179
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,500
Oh,
for Christ sake.

180
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,875
I cried.
When 'Friends' went off the air.

181
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:21,250
My favourite actress of all time,
is Kristen Stewart,

182
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,375
And my favourite movie off all time,
is Pitch Perfect.

183
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,393
Oh, dear God!

184
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,629
I'm so white,
that I put mayonnaise on sticks,

185
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,659
and freeze them to
make mayonnaise sickles.

186
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,643
You have no family,
you got no friends.

187
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,918
You score through the roof

188
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,201
on the criminal aptitude test.

189
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:53,933
Take a look.

190
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,460
Score higher than Charles Manson.

191
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:56,918
Dexter.

192
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,625
You score higher than Kanye.

193
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,210
It's a fine line, which side
of the law you even belong.

194
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:07,250
That makes you perfect for undercover work .

195
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,125
Or being a journalist for TMZ.

196
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:13,918
I guess so.

197
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,460
Now look, Serento and his crew
are responsible for everything.

198
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,467
From truck heist to counterfeiting
 Bed Bath & Beyond gift cards.

199
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,168
There is something big going down.

200
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,842
We think that they might be working
for this man.

201
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,225
J.Lo's ex-hubby, Marc Anthony?

202
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,750
No!

203
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,534
That's Juan Carlos De La Sol,
the criminal king pin of LA (Los Angeles).

204
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:37,772
Right ...

205
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:39,418
Now look.

206
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Tonight you got closest to Serento
than anyone ever has.

207
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,210
But I need you to get closer still.

208
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,418
I need you to join their crew.

209
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,168
So we can get the evidence
that we need to take these guys down.

210
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,793
Are you with me?

211
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,000
That's my boy.

212
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:59,585
But, how do I explain to Serento
why you release me?

213
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,543
Just tell him you beat my up and ran away.

214
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,393
- You think he'll go for that?
- Yeah, if it looks right.

215
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,417
What do you mean?

216
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,250
Hit me.

217
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,710
- Come again?
- Look, we got to make it look real.

218
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,362
Like we really got into a brawl.

219
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,875
And you knuckles got to look
 you had been hitting somebody.

220
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:15,835
So, hit me.

221
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,345
Oh, I can,t.

222
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,750
I mean , can't we just like.. puts some fake blood
on my knuckles or something.

223
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,085
Serento's a streetwise thug,
he's going to see right through that..

224
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,960
Now hit me!

225
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,026
Oh..
That hurts!

226
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,125
I never actually hit someone before!

227
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,335
Now do it again, and harder.

228
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:41,343
Harder.

229
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,960
Harder!

230
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,292
Oh shit, I'm sorry.
Your lips bleeding.

231
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,285
It's nothing.
Okay, my turn.

232
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,884
What do you mean,
my turn?

233
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,026
Serento will never believe
that you beat a hard detective,

234
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,009
without taking a few beats yourself.

235
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,875
I guess so but ...

236
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Hey ?

237
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,183
You alright?

238
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,393
You good?
Yeah, you alright.

239
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,042
(NO TRESPASSING)

240
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,067
Hey.

241
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,660
You got my car 10 second car?

242
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,992
As promised.

243
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,460
Come on ...

244
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,934
- This thing is tiny!
- Exactly.

245
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,875
With it's light body and a beef engine,
this could be ...

246
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,000
The fastest car in the circuit.

247
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,460
But Vin,
it's all busted up.

248
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
It's a ton of work.

249
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,625
Then fix it up!

250
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,292
And you're going to help him.

251
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,460
- Cos now you work for me.
- What?

252
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,542
We have a full medical and dental plans.

253
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,542
We recognized same sex partnership
for health benefits.

254
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,834
And last but not least ...

255
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,250
Casual Fridays.

256
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,085
That's when I get to wear
my dope ass Hawaiian shirts.

257
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,960
Deal with it,
bitch!

258
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,085
Alright, Vin.

259
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,910
Where can I put my stuff?

260
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,417
Over there.

261
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,233
Whoa.

262
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,667
A lot of stolen merchandise .

263
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,367
Whoa..
(A LOT OF STOLEN MERCHANDISE)

264
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,984
Son of a bitch!

265
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,542
Come on, drink it!

266
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,484
Drink it,
you son of a bitch!

267
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,567
What are you doing!

268
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,625
You're going to kill him!

269
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,292
You know how fattening this stuff is!
(SUNDAE SYRUP)

270
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,768
He's a cop!

271
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,259
- I saw him snooping around.
- I ain't not cop!

272
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:35,542
You're wearing a wire!

273
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,433
Aww..

274
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,710
I hate cops.

275
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,250
I saw him get arrested last night.

276
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,125
They beat him down trying
to get him to give me up.

277
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,710
And he never dropped a dime.

278
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,042
- Vin!
- I live by my instincts.

279
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,710
And he's as much as a cop

280
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:58,250
as my girlfriend is in the class
about her true sexual identity.

281
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,050
I can't believe this ...

282
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,509
Why don't he go out with your
sister while he's at it.

283
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,818
Pick you up at 7?

284
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,192
It's a date.

285
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, come on!

286
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,442
Nice.

287
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:36,917
Nervous?

288
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:37,817
No.

289
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,951
I am,
I'll admit it.

290
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,585
- You are?
- Sure.

291
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,835
I'm not so good at this.

292
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:45,981
The whole time we're out.

293
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:48,817
I'm going to be thinking about when
is the right moment to kiss you.

294
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,942
Really?

295
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,643
I propose that we just do it now,
and get it out of the way.

296
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,867
Do the first kiss now?

297
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:56,184
What do you say?

298
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,701
Alright.

299
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,660
- I feel better already.
- Me too.

300
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,476
So. What do you have planned
for our date.

301
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,042
I was thinking a little dinner.

302
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,085
Sounds great.

303
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:31,925
Fondue?
How romantic.

304
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,826
- May I ?
- Please.

305
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:47,152
Sorry.

306
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:49,218
Awkward first date moment.

307
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,742
Yeah.

308
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,500
So tell me about your brother.

309
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,489
What do you want to know ?

310
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,792
I do not know.

311
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,851
How does Vin have the money
to pay for all those

312
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,585
suit up cars?

313
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,143
Does he engage in illegal activities.

314
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,059
on regular..
basis?

315
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,585
What is he planning to do

316
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,167
with LA king pin

317
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,492
Juan Carlos De La Sol?

318
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:18,434
- I don't want to talk about my brother.
- Right.

319
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,960
- Let's talk about you.
- What about me?

320
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,550
What are you there?
You're not a tough girl.

321
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:31,750
Sure, on the outside.
You have this take no shit hard exterior.

322
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,667
But,
on the inside..

323
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,085
You're completely different.

324
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,384
I am?

325
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,800
Your ideal night,
is cuddling up with your snuggie.

326
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,417
Watching your favorite movies.

327
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:47,175
The Notebook, Dear John
and The Human Centipede.

328
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:51,500
You donate all of your extra money,
to the causes closest to your heart.

329
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,792
Save The Whales
Amnesty International,

330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
No Child Left Behind Without
an Xbox.

331
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,625
And on New Year's eve,
when the clock strikes midnight,

332
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,042
Just as Ryan Seacrest
ushers in the new year.

333
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,125
When the big ball thingy.

334
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:06,792
lowers on that..

335
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,634
thing.

336
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,617
You make a wish that the new year

337
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,300
will bring you,
the true love.

338
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,750
Flat tire.

339
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,050
Jordana told me what went down
on your date last night.

340
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,750
About the fondue
and flat tire?

341
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,292
About the..

342
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,542
relationships,
You had at the back of her apartment.

343
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,367
Sorry, Vin.
it won't happen again.

344
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,875
It better happen again.

345
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:33,285
I've never seen my sister
so happy before.

346
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,960
She's glowing.

347
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:50,659
Yeah.

348
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:52,093
I got it.

349
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,835
I'll be right there.

350
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,375
Michelle, let's bounce.

351
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,601
Vin.

352
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:02,785
Vin, baby.
You know I got softball every Tuesday!

353
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,593
You're ready to take your shot?

354
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,417
- Where are we going?
- Don't ask so many questions.

355
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:12,835
Why?

356
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,367
That's another question.

357
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,476
Why so curious?

358
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:24,000
So, if I knew where we were going,
I would know how to dress.

359
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,125
Fancy, casual ...

360
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,101
nautical.

361
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:30,808
Whoa.
Hey, hey!

362
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,835
You taking him over me?

363
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,026
Thought we were BFFs.

364
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,460
Fine.

365
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,695
You can forget about
coming over tonight and

366
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:45,843
watch the season finale
of the Bachelor.

367
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,384
Cos you are no longer invited!

368
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,067
Let's go.

369
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:02,710
"Heading out. Something big
going down with De La Sol."

370
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,125
HANOVER:
"Will monitor your activities..."

371
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,375
On behalf of Juan Carlos De La Sol,

372
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,300
Thank you for coming.

373
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,042
You are here
because you are the best in the city.

374
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,125
But alas,
we only need one driver.

375
00:27:58,585 --> 00:27:59,351
This is bullshit!

376
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,585
To get the job...

377
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,667
you are going to have to audition.

378
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,326
We'll see who is the best
of the best.

379
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,550
Oh, yes.

380
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,710
I think you know what you got to do

381
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,960
to impress De La Sol.

382
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,585
And to show you have the cojones (balls)..

383
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,375
to work for him.

384
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,542
Vin.
What's going on?

385
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,009
Just follow my lead.

386
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,585
Freestyle.

387
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,460
Oh yes, yes.
Come on twerk!

388
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,192
Twerk like Miley Cyrus!

389
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:37,718
Yes.

390
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:42,242
Yes.

391
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:49,585
Diego!

392
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,085
Man, I had you.
I totally out danced you.

393
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:21,042
You never out dance me.
Who're you kidding?

394
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,917
3 years dance repertory.

395
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,410
Ballet, modern,
contemporary and even tap.

396
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,250
Right then,
but next time ...

397
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:35,542
Next time.

398
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,417
- Nice moves.
- Thanks.

399
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,242
I only need one driver.

400
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,359
But you guys had ball so good.

401
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,701
I decided I'm going to hire
the two of you.

402
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,710
- What's the job?
- Very simple.

403
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,800
You must drive my super car
to this location.

404
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,201
Upon delivery,
you will be paid $ 100,000.

405
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,210
- Super car?
- Yeah.

406
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,167
- She's a tiger.
- I know.

407
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,109
It's the only one of it's kind.

408
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:23,709
It's priceless.

409
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,526
You got yourself a deal.

410
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,634
- Question.
- Here we go again.

411
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:28,835
Excuse me?

412
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:30,710
Why don't you just drive the car yourself?

413
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:35,460
I would. But I have
a million unpaid parking tickets.

414
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,167
So they raise my insurance premium.

415
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:41,167
Besides that, the car is a
like a cop magnet. You know.

416
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,460
You tried Geico?
15 minutes can save you 15%.

417
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:48,792
Yes. And half like it even Progressive,
but it's still a little worth to have.

418
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,067
Are you a college graduate?

419
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,492
Cos if you are a college grad,

420
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,143
she could be eligible for a
pretty substantial discount.

421
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,550
I once took a French league class

422
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,009
in the college, does that count?

423
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:00,835
Did you pass?

424
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,292
No, the professor flunked me.
So I shot him.

425
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:08,035
Look I rather just pay criminals
like yourself to drive the super car.

426
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,701
Whenever I have to move it's location,
okay?

427
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,460
- Make sense to me.
- But the math doesn't add up!

428
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,460
You are offering us $ 100,000
in a down economy.

429
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,960
What was your best bid from Aflac?

430
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:24,401
Look! Do you want the job or not?
God damn it!

431
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,667
Yes, he does.

432
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,585
- Let's go.
- Get the fuck in the car!

433
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,460
It's not working.
Dumb car must be broken.

434
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,460
- Your foot is on the brake.
- What?

435
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,292
Oh right ...

436
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,835
I got a bad feeling about this.

437
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:43,292
Why?

438
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,460
Listen to the score.

439
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:52,585
Dissonant chord progression.

440
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,101
Heavy use of Strings.

441
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:03,742
Oboe.

442
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:08,251
It all seems quite ominous.

443
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,335
You got the money?

444
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:29,300
There you go, sir.

445
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,793
Count it.
Make sure it's all there.

446
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,217
Nah.
This guy seems alright to me.

447
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,043
Oh, oh.

448
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,117
- I got it!
- Throw it, you idiot!

449
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:49,451
Not to me!

450
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:52,376
I don't want it!

451
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,076
What you waiting for, Vin.
Throw it!

452
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,085
Nah. I'm going to time it just right.
So when I throw it.

453
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:58,409
They will catch it.

454
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,659
and it will explode before they have
a chance to throw it back.

455
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:03,885
Good thinking, right?

456
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:06,081
Get ready!

457
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,217
Wait for it.

458
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:08,271
One.

459
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:11,083
Two.

460
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,009
And three.

461
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:18,460
You okay?

462
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,592
I think we got double crossed.

463
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,576
Oh, you think so?

464
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,326
Where're you going?

465
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,543
Oh, shit!

466
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,967
No!

467
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:21,293
Oh, shit..

468
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:27,568
Serento ever found out I was an undercover cop,
he would kill me.

469
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,101
DonÂ’t worry.
I erased your file.

470
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:31,750
I'm the only one in the force
who knows that you're a cop.

471
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:33,559
Your secret dies with me.

472
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,751
Oh, shit!

473
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:47,909
Come on,
you bastard!

474
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:51,518
Take it easy.

475
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,460
He's dead.

476
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:00,268
You're a cop killer now.

477
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,085
High five.

478
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:08,460
Let's go,
come on.

479
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:09,751
Let's go!

480
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,918
(BABY OIL)

481
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,951
He killed a cop.

482
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,260
Son of a bitch!

483
00:38:11,076 --> 00:38:13,076
Detective Johnson,
I got some files for you to look at ...

484
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,693
This is no time for paper work.

485
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,217
I got regular, decaf,
latte ...

486
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,543
I'll drink some coffee when
I solved this crime.

487
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,617
Here are the urine samples
you requested.

488
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:29,376
Oh smell this!

489
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:30,583
Look.

490
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:31,617
People.

491
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:34,400
The only thing I want right now is
to know what happened here.

492
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,710
Officer Canaro,
what have you got?

493
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,951
There is a camera.

494
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:44,650
Yeah.
So?

495
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:45,751
So.

496
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:49,184
Maybe, it recorded what happened.

497
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:49,960
And then what?

498
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:52,251
And then..

499
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,001
And then
you could watch the tape.

500
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,168
And see..
who shot him.

501
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,210
It just might worked.

502
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,460
(Come on, you bastard!)

503
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,085
Who is he?

504
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,007
Initiating Facial Recognition

505
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:21,768
- NO MATCH-

506
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,311
There's nothing on him.

507
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:24,492
No record.

508
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,668
Guy kills a cop,
has no priors ...

509
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:30,326
Doesn't make any sense.

510
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:34,226
Let's check the body,
I want a fingerprint.

511
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,425
What the hell is that?

512
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,826
The black light will expose
what the human eye can't see.

513
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,034
Like what date line uses,
for those exposes

514
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:44,085
or Motels with dirty sheets.
covering disgusting bed bugs.

515
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,242
Got cha.

516
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:55,675
You, son of a bitch.

517
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:02,284
What?

518
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,376
Nothing.
Nothing.

519
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:24,425
Where is my car?

520
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:25,650
Well, Carlos.

521
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:29,550
I don't mean to be the bearer
of bad news, but..

522
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:31,918
I don't have it.

523
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,159
So.
You don't have my car?

524
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:36,143
Well uh ...

525
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,800
The double cross didn't go as planned,
per se.

526
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,101
Per se?

527
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,760
Yeah, per se. You know.
As a matter of speaking.

528
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:47,650
Yeah, but you say per se,
when what you said wasn't exactly accurate.

529
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:49,168
So what happened?

530
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,751
The double cross didn't go as planned.

531
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:53,510
So, Not per se after all.

532
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:58,126
I guess not.
Not per se.

533
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:00,768
And that!

534
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:01,918
That!

535
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,876
Per se!

536
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:08,617
I have more information.
Senor.

537
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,284
I was going to tell you,
but you stabbed me.

538
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:14,335
Yeah well,
you must always kill the messenger.

539
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,900
That's sort of how we work,
 right?

540
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:19,576
Si, si.
I understand, but ...

541
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:22,701
Quick.

542
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:24,626
Make him comfortable.

543
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:27,293
Bring a pillow
and some coconut water.

544
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:29,818
Here

545
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,335
- Bless you.
- This pillow is down filled!

546
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,001
I'm allergic!

547
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:41,460
You have a hypoallergenic one?

548
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:44,534
I don't know.
Perhaps cotton or I don't know..

549
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,001
Something in the soft, microfiber.

550
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,168
Thank you.

551
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:57,125
There, feel better now.

552
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,210
It will help to replenish your electrolytes.

553
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,293
It's filled with mango and peach.

554
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,166
Feel better now?

555
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,867
Oh, Serento.

556
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,293
He shot the other three.

557
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,043
I barely got out with my life...

558
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,001
Serento, huh.

559
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,251
Get rid of him.

560
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,103
Carlos ...

561
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:22,376
Madre de Dios, que me asustÃ³ !
(Mother of God, you scared me!)

562
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,043
I wasn't done.

563
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:28,251
Forgive me please.
I constantly interrupt people.

564
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,751
It's a terrible habit,
I'm working on it.

565
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:35,476
But my therapist says
it's a form of narcissism.

566
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:37,434
Anyway,
you were saying?

567
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,034
I know where Serento
and his crew hideout.

568
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,217
It's at the warehouse of...

569
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,588
I interrupt again,
didn't I?

570
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:47,376
Yeah.

571
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:50,501
Therapy is a process.

572
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:53,210
Get my car.

573
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:55,626
As for Serento and his crew.

574
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,893
kill them all.

575
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:01,085
I have more information, senor.

576
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:21,001
(- WE'RE CLOSED -
definitely not hiding out inside! )

577
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:24,668
Alright people. We are in serious
lock down mode.

578
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:26,085
No one leaves the garage.

579
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,543
De La Sol is out to kill me,
and the rest of you.

580
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,668
How can you be so sure?

581
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,050
By follow my Tweeter.

582
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:34,360
(You're all #dead!)

583
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:39,835
( New episode of #DuckDynasty tonight,
can't wait .)

584
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:42,418
Check this out.

585
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:44,492
A Tragedy has occurred.

586
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:47,717
Where a veteran detective
has been brutally murdered.

587
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:55,293
Come on,
you bastard!

588
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:58,284
Police had been ordered
to shoot this man.

589
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,710
Police are also encouraging
Angelenos to take the law

590
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:02,235
into their own hands.

591
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:05,418
If you see this man,
please shoot him, stab him,

592
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:09,018
or if the opportunity arises,
slap him upside the head.

593
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,309
Oh,
come on!

594
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:13,235
What?

595
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,668
- We have to get out of here.
- Go where?

596
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:19,492
Some place where no one would find us.

597
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,835
Some place with no extradition,

598
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:24,510
like Tokyo or Rio

599
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:25,918
or Florida.

600
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:28,793
You are talking fake passports,
plane tickets,

601
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,043
living off the grid ...

602
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,534
We donÂ’t have that kind of money,
Vin.

603
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,826
Then we need to get some money,
fast.

604
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:37,043
Or we're all dead.

605
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:38,543
Ideas?

606
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,376
How about we moved to San Francisco
and open an alternative lesbians coffee shop.

607
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:51,485
What?
I'm just big ballin.

608
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:56,418
Why don't we just sell this bitch
super car.

609
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:57,543
We'll be rich!

610
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:58,967
Boom!

611
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:01,626
Problem solved, bitch!

612
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,268
Great idea,
if it were actually a "super car".

613
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,467
What?

614
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,534
87 octane?

615
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,960
Super cars only run on premium.

616
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,409
I know it .

617
00:45:19,626 --> 00:45:23,001
Why would De La Sol have us drive this car
unless it was valuable.

618
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,251
Something smells fishy.

619
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:33,710
(DE LA SOL ILLEGAL ACTIVITY)

620
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:36,793
(BRIBES TO POLITICIANS,
 MY HOUSE OF HOES,
 I HAVE $100M INA VAULT)

621
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,010
It's a break down of all De La Sol's
illegal activity.

622
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:42,425
Records of bribes to corrupt politicians,

623
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,034
where he houses his hoes,

624
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:46,268
Where he keeps his stash of money
worth over a $100 million.

625
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:48,626
Wait ...
That's it!

626
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:49,809
Right!

627
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:52,668
We go to the house where he keeps his hoes
and we keep it.

628
00:46:00,918 --> 00:46:02,668
We steal his $100 million.

629
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:04,818
and get out of town for good.

630
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:07,293
Who's in?

631
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:22,867
I'm in.

632
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,376
Boss, I got the lunch.

633
00:46:38,793 --> 00:46:40,925
Thank God,
I'm starving.

634
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,543
What is this?

635
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,349
Burger and fries.

636
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:48,309
Yeah I can see that.
I'm not blind!

637
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:50,518
But I ordered a kid's meal.

638
00:46:50,585 --> 00:46:51,451
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,893
You know that I've been collecting

640
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,360
the 'Despicable Me' minions.

641
00:46:55,668 --> 00:46:57,300
- I told you. You know that.
- Yes

642
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,976
I have them all,
except for Carl.

643
00:47:00,543 --> 00:47:02,210
I have Jerry,
I have Stuart,

644
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:04,126
I have Kevin, Dave,

645
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,418
but I needed Carl.

646
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:07,835
Carl says

647
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:11,826
"Bee-doh! Bee-doh."

648
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:13,835
And you forget about it.

649
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:16,710
I need the BeeDoh BeeDoh guy,
to complete my collection!

650
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,376
Okay, I go back.
I go get a new one.

651
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:19,534
No, no, no..

652
00:47:19,543 --> 00:47:21,418
I don't even want it anymore.

653
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:26,434
Robbing Juan Carlos' of a $100 million,
ain't going to be easy.

654
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:29,784
If we are going to pull off this heist,
we're going to need a bigger crew.

655
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:32,568
First thing first,
we need a black guy.

656
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:36,717
As Ja Rule or Bow Wow
or Ludacris.

657
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:38,418
Why does he have to be a rapper?

658
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,659
Cos movies like these always have a rapper
doing the cameo.

659
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,467
It brings in the urban demographic.

660
00:47:44,585 --> 00:47:45,793
Dummy.

661
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,885
Plus, they get to do a soundtrack title.

662
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:52,751
Hey, what about uh ..
Lil Wayne, T.I., DMX,

663
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,534
Gucci Mane and Akon?

664
00:47:54,543 --> 00:47:58,117
No, all those guys are either on their way to jail
or just getting out of jail.

665
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,726
We'll film a reality show that
chronicles going to jail

666
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:02,385
and then getting out of jail.

667
00:48:04,293 --> 00:48:05,943
And then go back to jail.

668
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:07,067
I got it.

669
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,967
I know the perfect guy to do the cameo.

670
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,668
RAPPER
CAMEO

671
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:16,659
And we need an Asian guy.

672
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:22,960
- Some one who can drift?
- Because Asian guys are cool.

673
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:25,501
COOL ASIAN GUY

674
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:27,831
And last but not least,
we need a beautiful model

675
00:48:27,831 --> 00:48:29,826
making her future acting debut..

676
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,085
She's not going to have a lot of lines
or a lot to do.

677
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:57,010
But she's smoking hot.
Fine to look at.

678
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,851
MODEL TURNED ACTRESS

679
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:00,867
- How do you do that?
- What?

680
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:03,367
You describe them and then like
instantly they're here.

681
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,592
Well, I had to.

682
00:49:04,626 --> 00:49:07,159
It's a classic multi-ethnic
round up scene.

683
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:09,284
It's in every
Fast & Furious movie.

684
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:14,050
Plus, I like to give my heist a sort of
United Colors of Benetton feel.

685
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,951
Now let's get down to business.

686
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,701
Alright, these are the blueprints to the building

687
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:30,976
De La Sol is holding his $100 million in.

688
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,784
Does anyone
have any idea.

689
00:49:34,668 --> 00:49:36,110
How to read a blueprint?

690
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,010
Oh, damn dog of my.

691
00:49:39,335 --> 00:49:40,992
That's not what you asked me.

692
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:44,110
You said, can I drive fast
and can I use a gun.

693
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:48,085
- Damn!
- So many numbers.

694
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,394
Right, then i say
we go over there

695
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,724
and see for ourselves
what we are up against.

696
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,300
You, Rapper Cameo and
Cool Asian Guy.

697
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,960
Let's roll.

698
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:02,092
Wait!
I'm not going?

699
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:04,876
No, why don't you stay behind
with the girls.

700
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,193
Killed him.

701
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:17,800
That was our secret handshake!

702
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:20,585
- Now it's his.
- Deal with it.

703
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,251
Bitch!

704
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,717
There's something I need to talk to you
about when you get back.

705
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:36,510
Can you give me a hint?

706
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,043
Rock-a-bye baby

707
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,418
 on the treetop.

708
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:54,601
When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock.

709
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:57,425
Okay...

710
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:02,034
When the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall.

711
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:04,710
And down will come
BABY...

712
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:06,476
cradle and all.

713
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:08,460
Oh my God!

714
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:10,626
Are you serious?

715
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,543
You taken up singing.

716
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,068
You should totally try out
for The Voice.

717
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:21,342
Avril Lavigne is going to love you!

718
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:25,376
When a man and a woman
make love,

719
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:28,668
sometimes there can be,
unintended

720
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,210
consequences.

721
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:32,335
I know exactly
where this is heading.

722
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:34,135
And I want to talk to you about it.

723
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:35,429
Great.

724
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,742
Cos I'm pretty sure
you gave me herpes.

725
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,666
I'm...

726
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,876
We'll talk about this later.

727
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,168
Who are you?

728
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,659
Where is the rest
of the money?

729
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,976
What do you mean?
It's all here.

730
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:57,163
Watch out!

731
00:52:57,188 --> 00:52:58,742
I'm on it, bro.

732
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,501
De La Sol's stash is worth
over a $100 million.

733
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:12,860
Where is it?

734
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:15,409
- Who's De La Sol?
- Who's De La Sol.

735
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:17,134
Aw...

736
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:18,992
You think I was born yesterday?

737
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:22,451
Question.

738
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,576
Is this 1414 Becker Street?

739
00:53:25,793 --> 00:53:27,219
This is 1414

740
00:53:27,744 --> 00:53:29,224
Becker Lane.

741
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:30,550
What's with all the cash?

742
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,818
We're a church,
it was Bingo night.

743
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:37,626
I am the pastor,
you asshole!

744
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:42,925
(CHURCH COMMUNITY CENTER)

745
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,451
Que paso?
(What happen?)

746
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:03,335
Someone just robbed the church
on Becker.

747
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:05,534
I know they wanted
my money.

748
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:07,061
You think it was Serento?

749
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:07,942
Duh!

750
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:10,918
He thinks
he can steal my money?

751
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,701
Listen to me, Cesar.

752
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,635
Please pay attention.

753
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:18,418
- I want my building guarded.
-Okay.

754
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:21,626
Put the money in the
strongest vault there is.

755
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,092
And kill Serento.

756
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:27,143
- You got it?
- I got it, boss.

757
00:54:29,385 --> 00:54:31,210
Lo QuÃ© es, el medio parte que?
(What was it? The middle part ?)

758
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:32,710
What?

759
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:34,248
Uh..

760
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:35,460
Building.. guarded.

761
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:36,708
No..no.

762
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,643
The vault?

763
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:41,001
No, no.
Not that, the..

764
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:43,751
- Kill Serento?
- Right!

765
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:45,659
Now I understand.

766
00:54:45,668 --> 00:54:48,284
Guard the building and
put Serento in the vault!

767
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:53,985
I'll just better text you
the needs, mijo (my son).

768
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:55,251
It's for the best.

769
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,717
Now, now you have instructions
in your cellphone.

770
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,534
- I didn't get it.
- But I already sent it!

771
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:03,675
No.

772
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:05,918
Aye!
You have the 4G network?

773
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,400
Yes.
Of course.

774
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:09,701
I'm still under the 3G,
it's much slower.

775
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:13,501
How can I run a major criminal empire..

776
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,726
And not having the same network?

777
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:18,099
Well uh,
in three months.

778
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:19,666
my contract is going to end.

779
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,175
And then I plan to upgrade
to the newest network.

780
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:25,710
But in 3 months,
that would be 5G!

781
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,034
Okay.

782
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:30,550
How about you give me your phone.
And then you get a new one.

783
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,885
- I'm going to kill you.
- We go now.

784
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:43,585
They're wearing ski masks.

785
00:55:44,043 --> 00:55:47,918
They must have gone skiing
immediately before or after the crime.

786
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,626
Contact the Aspen police,
the Canadian Mounties,

787
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:53,259
and Whistler in the Swiss Alps special forces.
See what they know.

788
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:54,409
Right sir.

789
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:56,085
And take a look at this.

790
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:03,867
That's Vin Serento.

791
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,260
He's involved too.

792
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:06,612
Triangulate the area.

793
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:09,760
I want every available officers
to be on the lookout for these guys.

794
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:11,543
Serento's chop shop must be close by.

795
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:17,376
And for God sake.
Someone get me some more baby oil!

796
00:56:20,217 --> 00:56:22,001
How is it going on fingerprint match?

797
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:24,851
Uh,
still nothing.

798
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:30,501
Wherever you fugitives are,
I'll find you.

799
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,168
You hear me?
I will find you!

800
00:56:38,085 --> 00:56:39,460
How about this t-shirt?

801
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:41,501
Sir?

802
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:42,717
Is it tight enough?

803
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:44,534
Is it tight enough?

804
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:47,485
Yes, I mean I can see your nipples
and everything.

805
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,610
You're damn right.

806
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:50,559
That's what I'm going for.

807
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:58,960
Alright.
Here's the deal.

808
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,451
1414 Becker Street,
is a Mexican restaurant,

809
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,050
called Big Ass Tacos.

810
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:05,010
De La Sol's using it as a front.

811
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,059
I love Big Ass Tacos.

812
00:57:13,585 --> 00:57:15,135
It's a perfect cover.

813
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,184
While unsuspecting customers
chow down,

814
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,409
De La Sol got a secret room
at the back.

815
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,498
De La Sol's stash must be there.

816
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:25,824
Cos they brought in "The
strongest Vault There is."

817
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,501
A vault big enough to hold
a $100 million plus.

818
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:33,376
But this place is locked down harder than
Lindsay Lohan's liquor cabinet.

819
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:35,146
If they see us,

820
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:36,525
we're dead.

821
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,601
But I got a foolproof plan.
That's going to get us the money.

822
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,576
And they'll never know what hit them.

823
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:44,235
First, we need eyes on the inside.

824
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:46,117
That's where Jordana and Michelle
come in.

825
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:49,668
Now before you get into the vault,
there is a counting room.

826
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:52,050
De La Sol doesn't trust the counter
from stealing.

827
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:54,701
So to make sure they are not
hiding cash in their clothes.

828
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,742
He makes them all work butt naked.

829
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,217
Everyone's nude.

830
00:57:58,251 --> 00:58:00,025
Even the guards.

831
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:04,143
You two will get jobs
as new counters.

832
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,342
Wait.

833
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:08,760
All of these girls are
totally naked and super hot?

834
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,300
Perfect tits.

835
00:58:11,543 --> 00:58:13,550
Every last one of them.

836
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:15,385
Continue.

837
00:58:15,918 --> 00:58:19,418
Now everyday at 3 o'clock,
right after he finishes watching Judge Judy.

838
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:23,043
De La Sol comes in to check
on the money in the vault.

839
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,393
Michelle,
you improvise a distraction.

840
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:44,775
The guard rush over.

841
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,717
Alone, Jordana will slip away
and spy on

842
00:58:46,742 --> 00:58:49,043
De La Sol as he opens the vault.

843
00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:55,559
What you'll find is that.

844
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:59,693
The vault is encrypted with a high tech
DNA code that matches De La Sol's.

845
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,460
So. We need a sample
of De La Sol's DNA.

846
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:12,791
If we're going to
get into that safe.

847
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,476
Come On!
Get out of here!

848
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:17,867
Out!

849
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:22,668
De La Sol takes a 10 mile run
every morning through the city.

850
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,284
And that's where Model Turned Actress and
Cool Asian Guy come into play.

851
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:30,818
Model Turned Actress will drive by
getting De La Sol's attention.

852
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,018
And he will say something like..
"Nice boobies."

853
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:35,559
Then Cool Asian Guy will appear

854
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:37,335
and say something like..

855
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:39,784
"Did you just said 'nice boobies'
to my girlfriend? "

856
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:43,385
And he will reply:
"I don't know, it's that your girlfriend?"

857
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:44,583
"Yup"

858
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:47,610
"Well then,
I said 'nice boobies'."

859
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,335
That's when you have to defend her honor.

860
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:52,159
"So then I must defend her honor
and challenge you to a ...

861
00:59:53,168 --> 00:59:54,217
"Karate fight."

862
00:59:54,376 --> 00:59:57,451
Oh, cos I'm Asian.
You automatically assume I know karate?

863
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:58,293
Do you?

864
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:00,692
Yeah, I'm a 3rd degree
black belt.

865
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,110
That's a total coincidence.

866
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:05,726
Anyway,
you'll fight him.

867
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,460
You will do spinning windmills.

868
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:17,309
Leg sweeps,
and flying side kicks.

869
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:35,668
Then De La Sol will start working your face
like a punching bag.

870
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:38,726
All in the effort to get De La Sol
to build up a nice sweat.

871
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,226
So Model Turned Actress can collect
DNA sample from his upper ass crack.

872
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:43,326
Ass crack?

873
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:45,492
The purest form of DNA.

874
01:01:02,168 --> 01:01:05,592
Now that we have a sample of his DNA,
we can unlock the safe.

875
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:07,992
How we ever get near the vault
to open it?

876
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,576
That's where you come in,
Rapper Cameo.

877
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:12,753
We're going to give you the DNA
sample to unlock the vault.

878
01:01:12,778 --> 01:01:14,617
Shove you in a box and
shipped you there.

879
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:15,876
Say what?

880
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,409
We'll send you ground.
3 to 5 days shipping.

881
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:20,001
3 to 5 days?

882
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,867
We looked into overnight.
But the rate was outrageous.

883
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,335
Come on, man!

884
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:28,251
You will get delivered and placed by the vault,
waiting further instructions.

885
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,967
That brings us to Curtis.

886
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,876
You'll be the decoy.

887
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:34,710
You'll knock on the door.
And when the guards open up.

888
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:35,842
You tickle him.

889
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:38,242
- Did you say tickle?
- Did I stutter?

890
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:41,793
You'll run around the alley dodging bullets.

891
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:44,559
And that will draw the other naked guard to

892
01:01:44,626 --> 01:01:46,309
rush outside and shooting you.

893
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:47,943
When Rapper Cameo

894
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,175
hears all the gun fire,
he'll pop out like jack in a box.

895
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:53,967
He'll run over to the door
and lock out the guards.

896
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:58,550
He'll then use the ass crack
DNA sample to unlock the vault.

897
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,826
Now back outside,
Curtis will finally get shot.

898
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:03,085
Get shot?

899
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:06,309
Yes.
And mainly in the groin.

900
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,492
And when the guards go to check to see
if Curtis is finally dead ...

901
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:12,768
I die?

902
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,260
We pull up.

903
01:02:14,425 --> 01:02:16,951
Catching them off guard,
and take them out.

904
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:22,085
Rapper Cameo opens up from the inside,

905
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,268
We load up the cars with the cash.

906
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:25,460
Then me and bro,
rendezvous with Jordana,

907
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:29,418
Michelle, Model Turned Actress,
Rapper Cameo and Cool Asian Guy,

908
01:02:29,585 --> 01:02:31,818
in an extradition free exotic locale.

909
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,576
And the best part of the plan?

910
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,068
No casualty what so ever.

911
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:37,809
Except for Curtis.
Of cos.

912
01:02:38,668 --> 01:02:39,710
Son of a...

913
01:02:42,543 --> 01:02:44,342
So, what do you say ?

914
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:56,309
Okay, second idea.

915
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:58,643
We bust in, blow open the vault and
drive off.

916
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,001
- Yeah! Uh-huh.
- That's good.

917
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:01,668
- Yeah! I like that, plan B.
- I like that one.

918
01:03:01,835 --> 01:03:02,934
I'm down with that.

919
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,585
Yeah, yes.

920
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:08,201
We ride at dawn.

921
01:03:08,226 --> 01:03:09,750
Dawn, really?

922
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:11,335
What's wrong with dawn?

923
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:15,385
It's so early,
dawn is before breakfast.

924
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,193
Yeah.
And I am no good without breakfast.

925
01:03:21,668 --> 01:03:23,960
Fine.
We ride after breakfast.

926
01:03:24,126 --> 01:03:27,643
How about we all go out for breakfast.
iHop would be fun?

927
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:29,418
- Yeah!
- Yeah. That's good, that's good.

928
01:03:30,085 --> 01:03:31,885
Their pancakes are the bomb.

929
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:33,918
We ride...

930
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,126
after iHop.

931
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,601
Hey Curtis.

932
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:47,101
Did you finish fixing up the Smart car?

933
01:03:48,668 --> 01:03:50,226
What you think?

934
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,568
Nice.

935
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:54,168
Real nice.

936
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,501
And I got a little something for you.

937
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,876
Thanks, man.

938
01:04:01,168 --> 01:04:02,851
My unicorn car!

939
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:05,951
- What?
- You fixed it up?

940
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:08,168
For me?

941
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,760
Surprise.

942
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,000
No.

943
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:12,085
It's a simple gesture.

944
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:13,835
to show how special you are to us.

945
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:19,085
Giving your sweeten
loving present to him.

946
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,393
What's his name?

947
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,568
Mom was right.

948
01:04:25,835 --> 01:04:28,842
I should have joined an ordinary
motorcycle gang instead!

949
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:38,150
What a baby ...

950
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,967
I still need to talk to you.

951
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:46,543
Before you do.
There's something I need to tell you.

952
01:04:47,585 --> 01:04:48,751
I know what's going on.

953
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,793
- You do?
- Of course. Every one does.

954
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:54,684
It's not like you have done
a very good job at hiding it.

955
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,635
You don't know what a relief
that is.

956
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:59,684
- You're fat!
- Excuse me?

957
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:02,617
I'm sorry, but it's obviously
you got quite a muffin top going on.

958
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:07,443
Jeez,
you look like a fat Jonah Hill!

959
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:10,550
Wait, Jonah Hill might actually be skinny now.
Let me think.

960
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:13,610
Fat in Superbad,
Really fat in Moneyball,

961
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:15,251
then in 21 Jump Street ...

962
01:05:15,543 --> 01:05:17,635
I don't know if he is fat or thin.

963
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:19,960
I'm so confuse now.

964
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:28,034
Anyway, have you no pride
in your appearance?

965
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,918
- I am pregnant.
- Why didn't you tell me?

966
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:47,159
What car is this?

967
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:50,135
It's my old man's car.

968
01:05:50,751 --> 01:05:52,251
He died in it.

969
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,550
(WORLD GREATEST DAD)

970
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:58,043
You guys get along?

971
01:05:58,418 --> 01:05:59,835
He was the best.

972
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:02,835
I never knew my father.

973
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,751
He went out for a pack of smokes ...

974
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:07,251
And he never came back?

975
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,751
No, he came back and told me to
"Smoke up, because he was leaving."

976
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:12,376
I was 8 years old.

977
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:15,001
You were just a kid.
It wasn't your fault.

978
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:17,210
He kind of said it was.

979
01:06:17,376 --> 01:06:18,626
He said before I was born,

980
01:06:18,793 --> 01:06:21,126
He used to have sex with my mom
all the time.

981
01:06:21,335 --> 01:06:23,001
They would go out and see movies.

982
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,001
Travel to interesting places
like Naper Valley or Belize,

983
01:06:26,168 --> 01:06:28,735
But now, he couldn't do
anything fun anymore.

984
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,184
But you still had your mother.

985
01:06:30,293 --> 01:06:33,342
Wow, he made such compelling argument
that she left too.

986
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:36,751
- You grew up in an orphanage?
- And from foster home to foster home.

987
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:41,168
Seems that no one wants a perfectly
good blue eye white baby anymore.

988
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:45,126
Unless you are from Namibia with
flies buzzing around your eyeballs.

989
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,291
You are no good to anyone.

990
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,226
You can't fight celebrity trends.

991
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:49,851
Brangelina,

992
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,768
Madonna,

993
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:53,476
Sandy Bullock,

994
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:55,101
they all have black babies.

995
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,260
I know.

996
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,793
I knocked up your sister.

997
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,226
She told me.

998
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,010
So, what are you going to do?

999
01:07:13,585 --> 01:07:15,735
You going to be like your old man
and take off?

1000
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:18,726
Or you're going to
stick it out like my dad?

1001
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:28,876
Right after that picture was taken,
he took me for ice cream.

1002
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,168
What a special memory.

1003
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:33,610
And we robbed the joint.

1004
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:57,469
I'm sorry Detective Johnson but,

1005
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,349
I don't know what any of
those hand signals mean.

1006
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:01,210
I have to go pee pee.

1007
01:08:03,543 --> 01:08:05,460
Go by the dumpster.

1008
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:08,992
Thanks,
don't go in without me.

1009
01:08:19,626 --> 01:08:20,917
Son of a bitch!

1010
01:08:23,442 --> 01:08:25,442
Go, go, go...

1011
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,609
Everyone freeze!

1012
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:32,951
Don't you move.
You son of a bitch.

1013
01:08:33,018 --> 01:08:34,600
Or I'll blow your head off!

1014
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,001
I said freeze.

1015
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,085
Lower your weapons and
surrender now!

1016
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:40,167
Finally got you, Serento.

1017
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,876
Your ass is mine.

1018
01:08:45,393 --> 01:08:46,393
Uh..

1019
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:50,126
No one's there
and my hand is starting to cramp up.

1020
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:56,760
Fine!

1021
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:00,775
Must have just missed them.

1022
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:03,060
I know we shouldn't have gone to iHOP.

1023
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:04,926
I just can't resist those pancakes.

1024
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:07,975
Those chocolate eyes,
whipped cream hair.

1025
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:09,693
Take a look at this.

1026
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:19,126
( ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT DE LA SOL
  AWAY FOR 3 LIFETIMES)

1027
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:23,201
There's enough evidence here to put
De La Sol away for 3 lifetimes.

1028
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,835
What's Serento up to?

1029
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:28,126
And how's it link to De la Sol?

1030
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,725
DON'T FORGET TO ROB DE LA SOL
OF HIS $100 million!  (HEIST DAY!)

1031
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:41,609
HEIST DAY!

1032
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,010
What do you know ...

1033
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:53,118
They are having a once in a year sales
at Bloomies.

1034
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:54,185
Bloomies
Once a Year Sale

1035
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:57,143
Men, let's roll.

1036
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,500
Everyone.

1037
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,385
Masks on.
Now.

1038
01:10:24,085 --> 01:10:25,592
What the hell is that?

1039
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:28,784
What?
You said bring your own mask.

1040
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:33,193
Oh, come on!

1041
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,001
Forget it.
Forget it.

1042
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,318
No masks.

1043
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,376
Masks off!
Masks off!

1044
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:50,842
Okay

1045
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:53,440
We take these chains
and hook them to the back.

1046
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:54,965
Pull the wall down.

1047
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:56,375
Catch them by surprise.

1048
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,967
They never see us coming.

1049
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,835
They totally saw us coming.

1050
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:24,342
Somebody must have set us up.

1051
01:11:25,876 --> 01:11:26,885
Hi, Curtis!

1052
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:32,076
You want to grab dinner later?

1053
01:11:32,085 --> 01:11:33,251
Call me.

1054
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,318
I'm going to kill you.

1055
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:42,368
Watch out, Vin!

1056
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:53,810
Why you do it,
Curtis?

1057
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:56,585
Sorry, Vin ...

1058
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:01,060
He was going to take me
to see One Direction.

1059
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,960
One Direction?

1060
01:12:09,376 --> 01:12:10,525
That's it!

1061
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:12,667
Now, it's personal!

1062
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:16,400
I'm going to kill you,
Cesar.

1063
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,909
He was my best friend.

1064
01:12:21,335 --> 01:12:23,409
I thought we were best friends.

1065
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:27,126
Well, you are.

1066
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,835
Well, he was my BFF for a long time.

1067
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:32,501
You got to understand that.

1068
01:12:38,126 --> 01:12:40,217
We had our fun together.

1069
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:47,176
- What are we going to do?
- Get in the car.

1070
01:12:47,876 --> 01:12:50,475
Stick to the plan.
Pull that wall down.

1071
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:53,234
We're taking that vault.

1072
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,193
You just hit my smart car.

1073
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,751
Now , it's personaler ...

1074
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:09,301
It's more personal.

1075
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:12,859
I'm taking it personally.

1076
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:15,551
It's a personal matter!

1077
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:18,443
Ah.. screw it.

1078
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:32,534
Keep flooring it,
give it all she's got.

1079
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:34,885
Why are we using walkie talkies?

1080
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,510
Because I got them on sale.

1081
01:13:50,518 --> 01:13:51,518
Whoa..

1082
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:54,085
Holy shit ...

1083
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,475
We do not see that every day.

1084
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:08,260
Is everything okay?

1085
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,167
Not exactly,
per se.

1086
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:14,667
Per se?

1087
01:14:25,835 --> 01:14:27,085
My money ...

1088
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,984
Follow that
Big Ass Tacos.

1089
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:38,685
Move, move, move!

1090
01:14:41,509 --> 01:14:42,609
Adios !

1091
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:54,710
Stop!

1092
01:14:55,835 --> 01:14:57,417
Let her retract.

1093
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:00,335
And then,
this time,

1094
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:04,185
slower and evenly,
pull the seat belt.

1095
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,609
No, no..

1096
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:16,835
No, no.

1097
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:17,958
Cesar!

1098
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:21,792
Do it again,
but this time ...

1099
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:25,001
Do it, even slowerly..

1100
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,768
I think it's broken.

1101
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,993
Å” now, por favor , mijo.

Go Faster, Ã¡ Ndale way!  Vamos!
(Go faster, come on..!)

1104
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:48,301
Where the hell are they going?

1105
01:16:48,501 --> 01:16:49,909
Follow that Big Ass Tacos!

1106
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:52,260
Repeat:

1107
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:53,960
Copy that.

1108
01:17:14,784 --> 01:17:16,385
Go, go, go...

1109
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:20,018
Looks like we got company.

1110
01:17:20,085 --> 01:17:21,693
Take them out!

1111
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:24,510
We're on it,
Vin.

1112
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:40,251
( Fashion Model Survival KIT )

1113
01:17:48,574 --> 01:17:50,074
Ahh...!

1114
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,409
Whoa..!

1115
01:18:08,635 --> 01:18:09,967
Nice work.

1116
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:12,618
Real smooth.

Cool Asian Guy,

1118
01:18:15,292 --> 01:18:17,393
Now break up,
we'll rendezvous as planned.

1119
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,768
Copy that.

1120
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:34,542
RAPPER CAMEO
"HOLIDAY SLOW JAMS"

1121
01:18:41,251 --> 01:18:42,775
Oh,
hell no!

1122
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:49,085
How you like a little taste of my
ill received slow jam project.

1123
01:18:56,009 --> 01:18:58,509
Oh...
Ahh...!

1124
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,092
Nice work,
Rapper Cameo.

1125
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,701
Thanks, Vin.
I'm rolling out.

1126
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:30,685
Jordana, Michelle!
Heads up.

1127
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,393
I see her, Vin.

1128
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,284
- She hit the tank.
- Stop the car and let me out.

1129
01:19:45,292 --> 01:19:46,055
What?

1130
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,268
I'll slow her down.

1131
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,935
No!

1132
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,210
I'm not letting you get arrested,
and let you have your baby in prison.

1133
01:19:50,443 --> 01:19:53,643
But Michelle. How are you going to survive
in a all woman's prison?

1134
01:19:54,585 --> 01:19:55,618
Stop the car!

1135
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:27,792
Please, not too rough.

1136
01:20:29,126 --> 01:20:30,518
Unless you want to.

1137
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:34,001
I taking you downtown and immediately
strip searching you for weapons.

1138
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,667
Full body cavity search?

1139
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:43,710
Definitely.

1140
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,960
Thank you,
God.

1141
01:20:58,417 --> 01:20:59,626
Go faster!

1142
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:01,551
Si, si.
(Yes, yes)

1143
01:21:01,585 --> 01:21:02,460
Understand!

1144
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:07,826
It's freezing in here.

1145
01:21:07,835 --> 01:21:09,377
I'll put the heater up for you.

1146
01:21:09,403 --> 01:21:10,449
Thanks

1147
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:13,375
There.

1148
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:35,626
Still chilly.

1149
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:37,701
It's at 90 degrees.

1150
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,585
Yeah.
But yours is at 60!

1151
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,935
This Perros is dual-climate,
my side is 60, your side is 90.

1152
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:46,001
The climates are not separated.

1153
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,626
It's just one climate!

1154
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:50,868
Do you see any invisible divider here?

1155
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:51,917
Look, look, look..

1156
01:21:52,126 --> 01:21:54,143
My hand pass through.
Look, look.

1157
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:57,743
Combines!

1158
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,451
So if you really are at 60.

1159
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:02,626
And I'm at 90,
we are really at ...

1160
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,251
75 degrees.

1161
01:22:05,275 --> 01:22:06,475
Si, pero..
(Yes, but..)

1162
01:22:06,484 --> 01:22:08,426
We are in the middle of
a car chase right now.

1163
01:22:08,451 --> 01:22:10,350
And my temperature
is really high.

1164
01:22:10,368 --> 01:22:13,585
Please, please.
I just prefer prefer much cooler.

1165
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:17,717
So.
What's you solution? Mijo.

1166
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:20,876
Seat warmer.

1167
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:23,626
Seat warmer.

1168
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:27,268
- Hun?
- Please open your door.

1169
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:30,768
Now,
get out!

1170
01:22:36,626 --> 01:22:39,659
It's okay ...
I'm okay, I'm okay!

1171
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:57,143
Let's play.
Come on!

1172
01:22:58,376 --> 01:22:59,693
I got you!

1173
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,826
Go GTA on your ass!

1174
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:15,743
- You only 5 foot 8?
-Yeah

1175
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:18,025
You look taller.

1176
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:20,010
Thank you.

1177
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,467
I pride myself of my good points...

1178
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,710
(Wasted)

1179
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,234
Totally out smart him.

1180
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:31,859
What a dummy ...

1181
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,810
Son of a bitch!

1182
01:23:39,835 --> 01:23:41,626
Locked my keys in my car again!

1183
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,551
Yes.

1184
01:23:56,626 --> 01:23:59,501
Vin, we can't outrun him.
We need a way out of the city.

1185
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,217
I'm way ahead of you.
Getting directions now.

1186
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,210
Calculating route.

1187
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:07,626
Calculating.

1188
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:10,685
Right turn in 200 feet.

1189
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:16,342
Damn it,
missed the turn.

1190
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:17,501
Bald loser!

1191
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,042
I shave my head because it makes me
look cool and tough..

1192
01:24:21,585 --> 01:24:23,917
Oh darn.
Your dashboard is dirty.

1193
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:26,460
Could use some..
Mr. Clean..

1194
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,326
I'm not going bald.
If that's what you are implying.

1195
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,085
Whatever,
penis head.

1196
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:33,792
Just because I am bald.
with thick veiny neck muscles.

1197
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:37,542
Does not.. make me..
a penis head!

1198
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:40,243
Damn it!

1199
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:43,467
Pull over!

1200
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:44,493
Pull over!

1201
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:46,167
Pull over!
This must end now!

1202
01:24:46,376 --> 01:24:48,518
This action scene has
gone on for long enough.

1203
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,009
The movie is way over budget!

1204
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:53,225
Vin, they are gaining!
We really need those directions!

1205
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:54,667
- So annoying.
- So annoying..

1206
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:56,126
So annoying..So annoying..

1207
01:24:56,335 --> 01:24:57,326
Shut up!

1208
01:24:57,335 --> 01:24:58,335
- Shut up!
- Vin..

1209
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,393
- We are waiting!
- Shut up.

1210
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,525
I'm on it!

1211
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:04,893
We can't out run him.
We got to dislodge the Big Ass Tacos.

1212
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,868
When we hit the intersection.
You go left, I'll go right.

1213
01:25:08,001 --> 01:25:09,010
Question.

1214
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,409
My left or your 1eft?

1215
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:14,292
You only have one left,
right?

1216
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:15,510
Got it!

1217
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:20,926
Hang on.

1218
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:23,751
Are you saying 'right' like
you agree..

1219
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,493
or right ,
like you are going to turn right?

1220
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,768
We are at the intersection,
turn now!

1221
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:42,292
Whoa.

1222
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:55,993
Not on my watch,
De La Sol.

1223
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:04,542
Freeze.!
Don't move!

1224
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,217
Hands up.

1225
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,850
Get out of the car.

1226
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:23,443
How do I get out of the car
when my hands are up?

1227
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:25,876
Get out of the car.

1228
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:39,826
What the hell are you doing?

1229
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:42,693
You told me to "Hands up."

1230
01:26:43,626 --> 01:26:46,251
Look's like you are going away for
a long time. De La Sol.

1231
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:48,368
(BUSTED)

1232
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:50,359
Come on,
Detective...

1233
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,859
I'm sure we can work something out.

1234
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,693
Are you seriously trying to bribe
a federal officer?

1235
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:06,126
I can give you whatever you want.

1236
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:08,126
Even tighter spandex shirts.

1237
01:27:09,376 --> 01:27:11,792
Human growth hormones agent?

1238
01:27:13,126 --> 01:27:15,126
Or perhaps..
a deluxe ...

1239
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,493
Manscaper razor set.

1240
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:23,960
Get out of here.

1241
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:26,826
Scored!

1242
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,949
Serento!

1243
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:46,484
You're under arrest .

1244
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:47,600
Let her go.

1245
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,275
Take it easy with her,
she's pregnant!

1246
01:27:49,335 --> 01:27:51,784
Don't move,
Put your hands where I can see them.

1247
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:54,818
Not you, Officer White.
You can put your hands down.

1248
01:27:56,335 --> 01:27:57,618
White officer?

1249
01:27:58,376 --> 01:28:00,060
Did a little checking into you.

1250
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,600
I fell in love with you
and you're a cop?

1251
01:28:05,835 --> 01:28:08,493
Undercover,
brought in to take you down.

1252
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:11,542
Good work.
You will be given a promotion for this.

1253
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,210
I'll personally see to it.
Personally.

1254
01:28:14,284 --> 01:28:16,376
I'll let you do the honors.
Officer White.

1255
01:28:24,835 --> 01:28:26,284
Son of a bitch!

1256
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,217
I'm not a cop anymore.

1257
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,126
I am with them.

1258
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:40,100
You're going to turn down
$ 32,500 a year before taxes.

1259
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:43,243
Three unpaid vacation days,
and a bankrupt picture plan and what.

1260
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,534
Run off with a $ 100 million,
scott free?

1261
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:48,368
Living on an exotic beach,
raising your baby with a beauty woman?

1262
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:50,167
Well ...
yeah.

1263
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:53,201
That's kind of no brainer.

1264
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:58,876
Damn it!

1265
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,335
My baby oil!

1266
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:10,759
No!

1267
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:42,042
Race you to Rio?

1268
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:44,159
When're you going to learn.

1269
01:29:44,184 --> 01:29:45,684
You ain't going to beat me.

1270
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:50,751
- Usually bet?
- No, let's up the stakes.

1271
01:29:50,876 --> 01:29:52,534
We're talking all in.

1272
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:54,734
Jordana's unborn baby?

1273
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:57,167
Exactly.

1274
01:29:57,585 --> 01:29:58,835
You're on.

1275
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,542
Don't worry babe,
I got this.

1276
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:19,210
It's over now!

1277
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,326
Now give me back my money.

1278
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:26,835
Or I'll kill all of you.

1279
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:30,251
And I'll going to start with ...

1280
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:32,876
you.

1281
01:30:37,835 --> 01:30:39,350
Did you hear that?

1282
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:40,375
No.

1283
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:01,960
Calculating route.

1284
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,335
Calculating, calculating,
calculating..

1285
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:05,926
That's what I'm talking about.

1286
01:31:06,126 --> 01:31:09,001
Right turn
 in 200 feet.

1287
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:13,960
Who's the boss?

1288
01:31:14,126 --> 01:31:16,510
Left turn
in 100 feet.

1289
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,667
Who's in charge?

1290
01:31:20,835 --> 01:31:23,435
Me, that's who.
Me.

1291
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:24,542
Congratulations.

1292
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,960
You have reached your destination.

1293
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:35,376
(WIGS AND HAIRPIECES)

1294
01:31:39,585 --> 01:31:40,859
Come on!

1295
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:42,176
Deal with it,

1296
01:31:42,177 --> 01:31:43,435
Bald bitch!

1297
01:31:51,835 --> 01:31:53,626
I didn't heard "cut"!

1298
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,751
Fine.

1299
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:00,042
Stop, dude.

1300
01:32:00,917 --> 01:32:01,876
Do you know ...

1301
01:32:02,001 --> 01:32:02,917
Shit!

1302
01:32:03,626 --> 01:32:05,210
You taking him over me?

1303
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:06,376
This is tough, dude.

1304
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:07,960
- Stop!
- Sorry.

1305
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:12,876
You can forget about coming over tonight
and watch the season finale of the..

1306
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:15,667
You son of a bitch

1307
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,268
Sorry!

1308
01:32:27,835 --> 01:32:30,501
You want the job or not?
God damn it.

1309
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:32,460
Do you want?

1310
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:35,876
Don't laugh!
You take it or not?

1311
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:39,710
I'm sorry.

1312
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,960
What car is this?

1313
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,042
What are you doing?

1314
01:33:07,835 --> 01:33:09,167
I can't!

1315
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:12,409
Is that rolling it.

1316
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:15,001
And?

1317
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:20,217
Sorry.

Come on.

1320
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:32,585
Before you do,
there's something I need to tell you.

1321
01:33:32,876 --> 01:33:34,667
I know what's going on.

Sorry.

1324

How about I borrow your phone.
And then you go buy a new one.

1325
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:57,585
- You don't like it?
- I don't deserve you, Cesar.

1328
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,126
You make me cry, when you cry.
Don't cry please.

1329
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:06,167
- Am I crying?
- You're crying.

You're crying.

- Why am I crying?

1333
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:12,710
This is a funny movie,
why am I crying?

1334
01:34:12,917 --> 01:34:14,292
I do not know!
Please.

1335
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:17,042
I don't know sorry!

1336
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:20,626
- It's suppose to be a funny movie!
- It wasn't funny.

1337
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:24,085
You just want to prove
that you are a good actor!

1338
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,835
They never get Oscar from
these spoof movies!
