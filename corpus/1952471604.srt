1
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:14,821
Sir, how often should one
exonerate one's bowels?

2
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,700
One should never, ever interrupt
one's desire to defecate.

3
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,081
I have inquired at the Bronx
and London zoos...

4
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:24,570
as to the daily bowel
evacuation of primates.

5
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:27,741
It's not once, twice
or three times, sir, but four.

6
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,592
At the end of an average day
their cages are filled...

7
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,724
with a veritable mountain
of natural health.

8
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,070
And sex?

9
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,886
Sex is the sewer drain
of a healthy body, sir.

10
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:42,773
Any use of the sexual act other than
procreation is a waste of vital energy.

11
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,756
Wasted seeds are wasted lives.

12
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:47,198
- Eating meat?
- He that killeth the ox...

13
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,368
is as if he slew a man.

14
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,661
Each juicy morsel of meat is alive
and swarming with the same filth...

15
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,660
as found in the carcass
of a dead rat.

16
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:01,042
A meat eater, sir, is drowning
in a tide of gore. What is a sausage?

17
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,702
A sausage is an indigestible balloon...

18
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:06,260
of decayed beef
riddled with tuberculosis.

19
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,857
Eat it and die.

20
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:11,192
For I have seen
many a repentant meat glutton...

21
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:15,797
his body full of uric acid and remorse,
his soul adrift on a raft...

22
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,752
in an ocean of poisonous slime...

23
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,956
sloshing against the walls
of the body's kitchen.

24
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,268
Smoking?

25
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:24,403
The liver is the only thing
standing between the smoker and death.

26
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:27,406
Also certain other things
have to be avoided...

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,998
like feather beds...

28
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,664
and romantic novels...

29
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,004
and the touching of one's organs.

30
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,299
Masturbation is the silent killer
of the night...

31
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,912
the vilest sin of self-pollution,
the sin of Onan.

32
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:45,552
Dr. Kellogg, how did you come
to invent the cornflake?

33
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,611
The cornflake, sir, is just one of 75
of my creations for healthy living...

34
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,749
among them peanut butter
and the electric blanket.

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,463
And what about your imitators?
There are 103 other cornflakes...

36
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,181
presently being manufactured
here in Battle Creek.

37
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,096
Sir, corn is the Injun's gift
to the New World...

38
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,943
and the cornflake is my gift
to the entire world.

39
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,918
And what do you think
about your brother?

40
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,512
My younger brother, W.K. Kellogg,
worked for me...

41
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:12,454
as a low-paid assistant for many years.

42
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,456
Now he's on his own and amassing
fortunes with my cornflake invention.

43
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,006
Unfortunately he has chosen
the family name to promote it.

44
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,980
But the whole world knows
only one Kellogg:

45
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,322
Me, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg...

46
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,829
surgeon, inventor, author and crusader
for biological livin'.

47
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,267
I do not seek monetary reward...

48
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,266
for I am called to a greater glory.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,834
Here, at the Battle Creek Sanitarium...

50
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:40,038
the spirits soar,
the mind is educated...

51
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:43,303
and the bowels...
the bowels are born again.

52
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,683
Every woman

53
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,882
And every man

54
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,432
Is at the temple of health

55
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:57,667
Here at the Battle Creek San

56
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,728
In, out. In, out.

57
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,132
In, out. In, out.

58
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:06,041
- Did you?
- Nothing.

59
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,178
Oh, my darling Will, I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,453
Eleanor, if I could only
eat something.

61
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,562
My poor thing.

62
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:14,390
Not now, Will.

63
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,093
Excuse me, sir. But would you mind
if we joined your table?

64
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,858
I'm afraid the dining car
is rather crowded.

65
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,194
- No, no, no. Not at all. Please.
- Thank you.

66
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:36,268
- Ossining. Charles Ossining.
- Eleanor Lightbody.

67
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,316
And this is my husband, Will.

68
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,216
- How do you do.
- Allow me to give you my card.

69
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,202
I'm in the breakfast food business.

70
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,730
Really? Which one? Try-a-Bita?
Krinkle? Foodle?

71
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:49,651
Cero-Fruito? Fush?
Goodness, there's so many, suddenly.

72
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,024
- It's hard to keep up.
- Per-Fo.

73
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,195
Per-Fo? Don't believe
I've heard of that one.

74
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,957
Actually, we haven't started yet.

75
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:57,197
In fact, I'm on my way to Battle Creek
to start the company.

76
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,948
- How nice.
- You're eating oysters.

77
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:02,088
Yes. Bluepoints.
They're quite good.

78
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,819
- Would you like to try one?
- No!

79
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:08,042
- It's his stomach.
- May I take your order, sir, madam?

80
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,794
Oh, yes.

81
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:13,351
I'll have the cucumber salad
and a glass of water. Thank you.

82
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,461
- And sir?
- Toast. And a glass of water.

83
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,256
- Toast?
- Toast.

84
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,114
And how would you like that, sir?

85
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:23,431
Toasted. Dry. On its own.
On a plate.

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,994
Certainly, sir.

87
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:29,697
Battle Creek, you say.
Well, what a coincidence.

88
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,641
That's our destination too. We're going
to the sanitarium for the cure.

89
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:34,983
- I've never been.
- Third time for me. First for Will.

90
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:36,675
I'm one of those Battle freaks
that you read about.

91
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,787
Well, well, well.

92
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,726
- Scavengers of the sea, you know.
- Excuse me?

93
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,524
Eleanor, not again, please.

94
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,982
Oysters live in muck and filth,
and they feed on it.

95
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,617
You said you wouldn't do this.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,175
Oyster juice
is nothing more than urine.

97
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,660
- Urine?
- Piss, to use the vernacular.

98
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,223
Eleanor, that's enough!

99
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,392
But, Will, the gentleman should know
that he's ingesting slimy piss.

100
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:01,087
Will you never shut up!

101
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,378
Oh, my God!

102
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:13,538
Terrible thing, indigestion.

103
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,862
Bye, Mr. Ossining.
Good luck with your new company.

104
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,304
Good-bye.

105
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,763
Bend and stretch.

106
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:50,998
Twist, twist.

107
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,690
And I will show to you...

108
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:35,408
that in the sluggish bowels
of the flesh eater...

109
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,898
lays the source of 9/10...
9/10...

110
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,557
of the chronic ills
from which human beings suffer.

111
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,799
Ah, Mr. Dab, you're back.

112
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:46,894
Good. We can continue with the " Question
Box" with a small demonstration.

113
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:49,614
- Sir, he's here.
- Later, Poult, later. Sit down.

114
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:55,466
Ladies and gentlemen, here I have
in front of me a steak...

115
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:58,187
which my assistant, Mr. Poultney Dab,
assures me...

116
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:02,184
is the finest porterhouse the nearby
Post Tavern Hotel has to offer.

117
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:06,217
Also, I have here
a bag of horse excreta.

118
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,699
Oh, yes. Manure.

119
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:14,761
Dung from our very own stables,
so fresh it is still warm.

120
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:18,829
Hey, and steaming!

121
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,673
Dr. Linniman, would you be so kind
as to prepare a sample of each...

122
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,398
for the microscopes, please?

123
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,486
Ladies and gentlemen, I will now
provide you with proof...

124
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,529
which I fervently hope
will forever turn you away...

125
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,937
from the disgustin' habit
of eating meat.

126
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,424
Disgustin' not only because
we should never take the lives...

127
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:38,913
of our fellow creatures, but disgustin'
because, my friends, what lurks...

128
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,993
within that steak...

129
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:45,091
is as bad or worse than that which
crawls inside that bag of barnyard dung.

130
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,391
Now, may I have a volunteer, please?

131
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:53,056
Oh, come on, don't be shy.

132
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,432
Miss Muntz, who I see
in the second row here.

133
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,283
Would you be so kind as to come
to the table, Miss Muntz, please?

134
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,055
Watch your step.

135
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,261
- Thank you.
- Watch your step, sir.

136
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:24,408
Oh, breathe it in, Will.
Can't you just smell it?

137
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:30,236
We're both going to get well.
I just know it. It's a promise.

138
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,504
What do you see, Miss Muntz?

139
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,647
White specks crawling.

140
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,532
Dr. Linniman, please, please,
do not keep us in suspense.

141
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:45,241
Please reveal to our good friends here
the identity of the offensive slide.

142
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:50,425
Sir, Miss Muntz has identified
the porterhouse steak.

143
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:55,028
Ladies and gentlemen, please come
to the podium and see for yourself.

144
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:36,457
Oh, it's Dr. Kellogg's "Question Box."
What a pity we missed it.

145
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,736
- How much do I tip?
- Oh, no dear. Not at the San.

146
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:41,705
Ah, Mr. Birdwhistle...

147
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:45,575
Look, Will! There's the great man
himself. There's Dr. Kellogg.

148
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,780
Working that program, are we?
Good girl.

149
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,289
Mr. Abernathy. I trust the Protose broth
is helping with the flatulence?

150
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,947
- Very well, Doctor.
- Good. Splendid.

151
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:59,845
Ah, Mrs. Portois, a glow
in your cheeks I detect.

152
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,953
A veritable beacon
of natural health!

153
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:04,647
How pleasing.

154
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:08,199
Hello, Father.
Aren't you going to introduce me?

155
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,045
- Do you have some spare change, miss?
- Excuse us, please.

156
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,346
How dare you, son?
I've told you never to come here.

157
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,875
Come on, Father,
give us a cuddle.

158
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:18,917
- You stink, sir.
- Don't we all in one way or another?

159
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,191
Your behavior is unconscionable.

160
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,731
- Now, why are you here?
- Money.

161
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,811
You've had all the money
you'll ever get from me, boy.

162
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,605
Dr. Kellogg,
what a pleasure to see you.

163
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:32,424
- Ah, yes, Mrs...
- Lightbody. Eleanor Lightbody.

164
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,391
I'd like to introduce you
to my husband. This is Will.

165
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,293
Hello, You look like you're on your
last leg. Can you spare some change?

166
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:41,223
Excuse us, please.

167
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,858
- How much?
- One hundred.

168
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:48,576
Mr. Wilcox. Take this gentleman
to Mr. Phipps...

169
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,720
and tell him to give him $100.

170
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,650
Then show him the front gate.
Thank you.

171
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:58,907
Poor wretch. A charity patient.
Ah, now, Mr. Lightbody, is it?

172
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,210
How do you do, sir?
Oh, dear, you are unwell.

173
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,571
Let me see your tongue, please.
Out more.

174
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,287
Wider. More. That...

175
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,947
Oh, yeah.

176
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,156
The tongue is the billboard
to the bowels, Mr. Lightbody...

177
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:15,325
and this piece of furry flesh between
my fingers shouts S-l-C-K, sick.

178
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,735
You're a sick man, sir. As severe a case
of autointoxication as I've ever seen.

179
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:23,037
Is there anything you can do? We're both
tremendous believers in your methods.

180
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:26,453
I am, anyway. But Will is really
keen to learn. Aren't you?

181
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,382
- Uh...
- You've come to the right place.

182
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,674
But we are merely lifeguards at watch
on the shores of the alimentary canal.

183
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,881
A wheelchair immediately
for Mr. Lightbody! Hurry!

184
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,212
I don't need a wheelchair.
I do not need a wheelchair.

185
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,889
Sir, I am a doctor, and you take my word
for it. You are in need of a wheelchair.

186
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,705
Wheelchairs are for amputees,
for Civil War veterans...

187
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,357
old people with one foot in the grave.

188
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,275
Lucky if you have only one foot
in the grave, because I can help you.

189
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,023
Two feet in and your money will be
better spent with an undertaker.

190
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,263
Mr. Johnston, I want the finest care
for this gentleman.

191
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:58,106
So get the very best attendant.
Graves. Yes, get Nurse Graves.

192
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,438
Hey, one foot in the grave! Ha!

193
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,255
I will see to you personally
first thing in the morning.

194
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:05,654
- If you're still alive, that is.
- Thank you.

195
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,696
Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,925
Frank!

197
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,202
Oh, darling, it's Dr. Linniman
who I told you about...

198
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,856
who looked after me so wonderfully well
the last time... you remember.

199
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,488
No, I don't remember.

200
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,313
How are you?

201
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,421
Oh, it's heaven to be back.

202
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,104
It's good to see you again.
Eleanor, you've lost weight.

203
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:28,305
Wait. I want my wife!

204
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:42,673
- You Charles Ossining?
- Yes!

205
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,646
Mr. Bender says
you're to come with me.

206
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,958
Thank God, boy! Where's the cab?

207
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:48,999
No cab, sir.
Mr. Bender said to walk.

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,368
He did, did he? Is it far?

209
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,287
It wouldn't be
if we weren't walkin'.

210
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,172
- Where are you taking me?
- Your room. Your wife will go to hers.

211
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:09,513
- We're together.
- Oh, no, sir. That just wouldn't do.

212
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:11,653
If you get my meaning?

213
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:15,815
Up, please, Harold.
Best air in the place. Lovely view too.

214
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:24,134
Hello, Irene. Here he is.

215
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,241
Welcome to the San.
I'm Nurse Graves...

216
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:28,680
and I'll be your personal nurse
during your stay here.

217
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,800
Ah, you must be tuckered, sir,
what with all that rail travel.

218
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,733
Terrible. Shakes you up
like an eggnog.

219
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,198
Here we are. Nice, cheery room.

220
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:14,903
Torture. Worse than
the Spanish Inquisition.

221
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,367
- Torture?
- Rail travel.

222
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:20,190
Well, I will bid you good night...

223
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:23,419
and leave you in the capable hands
of Nurse Graves.

224
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:25,592
- Night, Irene.
- Good night, Ralph.

225
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,476
Undress, please.

226
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:35,255
- You're very beautiful, Irene.
- Please. Don't talk, Mr. Lightbody.

227
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,464
Not in your condition.

228
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,914
Now, we're gonna have you asleep
in no time at all.

229
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:42,449
But it's only 6:00.

230
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:45,589
And I haven't slept a wink
in 22 days.

231
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,751
Well, tonight you'll sleep like a baby.
That's why I'm here.

232
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,138
Now, I want you to relax.

233
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,592
And I'll be back later
to give you your bath.

234
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:08,207
Where are you taking me? I thought Mr.
Bender was staying at the Post Tavern!

235
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:11,028
He is. Only you're up there.

236
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:15,087
$3.25 a week due every Saturday.

237
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:20,080
Breakfast at 7:00, dinner at 1:00,
supper at 6:30...

238
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,833
and she wants a week in advance.

239
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,814
I'm sorry, Nurse, but I think
that I'm hallucinating.

240
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,749
Just kneel in the bath, please,
Mr. Lightbody.

241
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:50,635
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Ever since I got here, I keep seeing...

242
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:53,289
I came here with my wife, you know.

243
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,555
Oh, yes, I know.
She's on the second floor, room 212.

244
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,276
She won't be staying here?

245
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:02,276
Oh, no. All couples are
kept separate here, Mr. Lightbody.

246
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,810
- They are?
- Of course.

247
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,772
Our patients need complete rest.

248
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,968
Any sexual stimulation could be fatal.

249
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,338
Now, I want you to relax.

250
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:16,104
- What is that?
- This... is a colonic wash.

251
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:18,625
It is hot paraffin,
soap and tepid water.

252
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,871
Now, bend over a little bit please.

253
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,327
There. Just relax, Mr. Lightbody...

254
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,671
and we will purge you
of all that ails you.

255
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,704
Oh, but I don't even eat meat.
Not anymore, anyway.

256
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,460
Just relax. It'll all be over
in a second.

257
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,325
No, l... Honestly, lately it's just
beet tops and savory broth.

258
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,294
Your intestines are probably putrid
with disease and germs.

259
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,992
Nurse Graves...

260
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:45,469
I have to confess to you
that I'm very sexually stimulated.

261
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,449
I think that I have an erection.

262
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:50,339
Clean thoughts make for clean bowels,
Mr. Lightbody.

263
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:53,272
Please, just try and think of me
as one of nature's nuns...

264
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:55,136
here at the temple of health.

265
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,454
One card, my dear sir.

266
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,181
Is your wife still available?

267
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,317
It's room 25, sir.

268
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,567
Ah, Charles! You made it!

269
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,608
So sorry I couldn't be there
to meet you.

270
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,912
But I was busy cultivating
the garden of business.

271
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,729
These gentlemen behind me
are the very princes of this town.

272
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:47,958
Pillars. Important people.
How are your lodgings?

273
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:49,814
Disgusting. Why didn't you
put me up here?

274
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,703
Tut, tut, Charles.
We're on a budget.

275
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:54,702
We can't throw your good aunt's money
around now, can we?

276
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,112
- But you're staying here!
- Show, Charles. All show.

277
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,405
For the gentlemen at the table.
Did you bring Mrs. Hookstratten's check?

278
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:03,570
Yes, and she's very anxious to hear
about the factory site you've acquired.

279
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:05,200
- Ah, the factory.
- And the ovens.

280
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,303
Ah, the ovens. There's been
a slight hiccup. There are no ovens.

281
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,026
But you wrote that the Vita-Malta flake
factory came with ovens.

282
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:14,322
There are no ovens, because,
alas, there is no factory.

283
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,448
There's no factory?
Bender, in your letter...

284
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,865
Goodloe. Charles, please.
Call me Goodloe.

285
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,038
We are partners, after all.
Would you like a brandy?

286
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,726
I don't want a brandy!
I want an explanation!

287
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,892
It's true, I almost had a factory.

288
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,418
But the thief I was dealing with
wanted rather too much for the lease...

289
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,531
and I lacked the necessary spondulicks.

290
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,569
- Spondulicks?
- Capital, Charles.

291
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,943
Money. As in "running short of."

292
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:46,671
Do you mean that you have spent
the whole of the start-up money already?

293
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:50,793
Please, please. Not in front of company.
Step into my office.

294
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,772
I know you're probably tired
after the trip.

295
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:57,035
And it might seem that I'm living it up
here in the lap of luxury.

296
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:00,298
Now you listen to me,
you jumped-up streak of pompous piss.

297
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,917
You don't think you could start
a company like Per-Fo just like that!

298
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,127
- You've stolen my aunt's money.
- It's not stealing!

299
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,498
It's capitalism, you ignorant prick!

300
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:11,305
And palms are the wheels of capitalism,
and they have to be greased, boy.

301
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,509
I'm not your boy, Bender.
Get that straight!

302
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,874
Charles, Charles.
It all takes money.

303
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:20,799
You had money! You had my aunt's money,
and now you've pissed it all away!

304
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:24,517
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing.
We have a great product.

305
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,577
- We don't have anything!
- You're wrong, Charles. You're wrong.

306
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:34,110
We have cartons. Beautiful
Per-Fo cornflake cartons.

307
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,710
And why is it a great product?

308
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:39,872
Because " it perks up tired blood
and exonerates the bowels."

309
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,916
- Didn't you write that?
- I did write that.

310
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,160
- It's brilliant.
- It's good.

311
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:46,366
It's an inspiration, is what it is.

312
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:48,325
It's good. I know it's good.

313
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:54,207
But you can't sell empty boxes
no matter what it does to the bowels.

314
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:57,470
It has to mean something.
We have to make something.

315
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,694
Something that tastes great
and is easy to prepare.

316
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:05,306
- Something good for you.
- Right! Health!

317
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,798
The "open sesame"
to the sucker's purse.

318
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,283
- Who are you?
- George.

319
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,693
I'm called George.

320
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,370
What's your name?

321
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:05,773
Eleanor Lightbody.
Do you work here?

322
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:10,932
I'm Dr. Kellogg's son.

323
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:15,789
- Not his real son. I'm adopted.
- Oh, of course.

324
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,354
He adopted lots of us.

325
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:19,434
Yes, I know.

326
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,208
I've got 39 brothers and sisters.
Lucky, aren't I?

327
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,642
Yes, that's very nice.

328
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,922
But why are you here?

329
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,990
I came for my allowance.

330
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,055
And I like to look at the nude ladies.

331
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,425
You have a very nice body,
Mrs. Nicebody.

332
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,827
Lightbody. Mrs. Lightbody.

333
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,998
My mother had a nice body.

334
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:55,147
She did?

335
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,425
She was a whore.

336
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:05,992
She was?

337
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,374
In Chicago.

338
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:24,164
She was dead
when the doctor took me in.

339
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,594
They found me sitting
by her dead body.

340
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,312
George Kellogg!

341
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,943
Come here.

342
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:17,692
Your coat, George.
Where's your coat?

343
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,612
Look at me.

344
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,926
Why don't you ever speak, George?

345
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:29,746
It is of great distress to me, to Mrs.
Kellogg, to your brothers and sisters.

346
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,667
Your coat, George. Your coat
is on the floor, not on the hook.

347
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:37,111
How many times must you be told
to hang your coat up on the hook?

348
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:39,253
Speak to me.

349
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:43,505
Hannah!

350
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,544
Yes, sir, Doctor.

351
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:52,398
You will supervise. George will enter
this house, close the door...

352
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:55,374
climb the stairs, remove his jacket
and hang it on its hook.

353
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,203
He will do so until bedtime...

354
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:01,329
and then continue after breakfast
until this time tomorrow.

355
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:04,813
Until 4:00 tomorrow.
Is that understood?

356
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,058
Yes, sir, Doctor. Understood.

357
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:17,807
Sir!

358
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,493
I said until 4:00 p.m.
It is now 7:00.

359
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:24,653
He won't stop, sir. We've tried to,
all of us, but he won't take any notice.

360
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,695
George, that's enough now.
You've learned your lesson.

361
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,544
Run off to your supper.

362
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,877
George, stop this moment, I say.

363
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,721
Stop, I say!

364
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,501
Very well, suit yourself. I have work
to do. You'll continue until you drop.

365
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,923
George, stop this madness immediately!

366
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,364
Stop it. George, stop, stop, stop!

367
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:42,078
Stop it!

368
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:44,319
George, I'm so sorry.

369
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:49,372
I'm sorry. Please, please go
to your room and sleep.

370
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,312
Oh, Virginia, isn't this wonderful?

371
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:15,731
Don't you sometimes feel you're in the
healthiest spot on the whole planet?

372
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:19,102
My dear Eleanor, there is
no greater pleasure for a woman...

373
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,302
than bicycling in one's bloomers.

374
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:25,049
You know, bicycling for women is still
very much frowned upon in Peterskill.

375
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:26,545
Oh, what they're missing.

376
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,356
Fresh air, the exercise!

377
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:33,908
And the pleasure of a leather saddle
between one's thighs.

378
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,865
Oh, Virginia, what do you mean?

379
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,671
"Bicycle smile," I believe they call it.
It's changed my life.

380
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,329
I'm afraid I don't follow.

381
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:45,012
My dear, I have very little use
for my husband...

382
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,152
in the sexual gratification department.

383
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:51,413
And so I find a long ride on my bicycle
once a week does the trick.

384
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,991
Come on, you two!
Keep up. You're lagging.

385
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:59,765
You go ahead, Eleanor.
I feel a smile coming on.

386
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:07,029
Every woman, every man

387
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:11,184
Every woman, every man

388
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,179
- Is at the temple of health
- Nurse Graves? Irene?

389
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:19,243
I'm Nurse Bloethal. Would you join me
in the bathroom, please?

390
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:22,032
I've already had one of those.

391
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:24,999
Well, now you get another.

392
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:08,969
Sir?

393
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:12,675
Bender, Mr. Bender.
Fetch him this instant.

394
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:21,745
- Where the hell have you been?
- Please, Charles, please.

395
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:23,762
You're making a scene.
Have a seat.

396
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,722
Are you hungry? You must be.

397
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:29,050
We had an appointment. We're supposed
to be out looking for factories.

398
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:32,049
Ah, slipped my mind.

399
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:34,195
Delmonico steak, rare,
for this gentleman.

400
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:38,389
Smothered with onions and a plate
of your delicious fried potatoes.

401
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:40,431
- You look starved.
- We're supposed to be on a budget!

402
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:43,023
Hello. I'm George.

403
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:47,116
Meet my luncheon companion,
George Kellogg.

404
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:50,736
Charles Ossining. Pleased to meet you.
Did you say "Kellogg"?

405
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,400
Mm-hmm.

406
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,245
George has the proud distinction
of being John Harvey Kellogg's son.

407
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:59,438
The doctor's a very great man.

408
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,516
He's a fuck pig. I hate him.

409
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:09,106
Charles, this worthless bundle
of piss and vomit beneath our table...

410
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,853
is the good doctor's
estranged adopted son.

411
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:16,331
- No love lost between them, I'm afraid.
- Did you say "worthless"?

412
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,500
- Yeah.
- Goodloe, hear me now.

413
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,805
This man is the key to our fortune.

414
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,628
You need your steak.
You're delirious.

415
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:26,085
- What if we made him our partner?
- You're most certainly delirious.

416
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,995
- Where the hell is this man's luncheon?
- The name!

417
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:33,031
The magic name. Kellogg.

418
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:36,332
The good doctor's brother has spent
millions advertising it.

419
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,372
Don't you see? It's so simple!

420
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:41,446
- We become...
- Ah!

421
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:44,267
Kellogg's Per-Fo Incorporated!

422
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,177
It's brilliant, Charles.

423
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:50,375
You are brilliant.
There's no doubt.

424
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:54,337
I feel a wind crackling
with banknotes blowing in our direction.

425
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:57,056
- But maybe it's...
- It's what?

426
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,519
Maybe it's a tad dishonest.

427
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,318
It's enterprise.

428
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:05,663
It's the lifeblood that pumps through
the veins of this wonderful country.

429
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:07,232
It's a stroke of genius.

430
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:12,260
Lift up your eyes.
Look. What do you see?

431
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:16,224
- Wellville.
- Yes!

432
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,500
The shining spires of Wellville,
gleaming in the sun.

433
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,955
A magical land of health and money.

434
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,096
It's a good idea, if I do say so
myself. It is a great idea!

435
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:30,020
You are a genius, Charles.

436
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:34,077
You know, last night I awoke
to the sound of spoons.

437
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:35,936
- Spoons?
- Millions of them.

438
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,175
Rattling against a hundred million
breakfast bowls...

439
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:40,030
brimming with our cornflakes.

440
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:41,952
Listen, Charles.

441
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,463
What do you hear?

442
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,129
The sound of money!

443
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:11,604
Where would you like to sit, sir?

444
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,709
- I was looking for my wife, actually.
- Here's a menu, sir.

445
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,301
The nut Lisbon steak with the
gluten gravy looks delicious today.

446
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:20,339
No. Toast. Dry toast and water.

447
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,105
Won't you join us?

448
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:29,237
Introductions, please,
Mr. Hart-Jones.

449
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:30,800
Endymion Hart-Jones.

450
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:33,044
No, I'll just have the toast.

451
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,048
That's my name. I'm not on the menu.

452
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,032
This is Mrs. Tindermarsh.

453
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:41,399
Miss Muntz you've met, I believe.

454
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,407
The Russian gentleman at the end
we call Mr. Unpronounceable...

455
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:46,795
is from Saint Petersburg, and neither
speaks nor understands English.

456
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:52,849
Do smile at him.
He has chronic wind, poor fellow.

457
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:02,961
- Will Lightbody.
- Eleanor's husband. What a pleasure.

458
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,520
- Sore rectum?
- Yes, somewhat.

459
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:11,344
The enemas take some getting used to,
but in time you'll learn...

460
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,515
to look forward to them
like an old friend with a cold nose.

461
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:17,097
I must say five a day does seem
a bit too, well, purgative.

462
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,217
Five?

463
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:22,957
The doctor is rather addicted to his
enemas as befits a broom maker's son.

464
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:28,101
I understand he got the idea
in India. He was studying...

465
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,793
Africa. It was Africa.

466
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:33,796
Africa, India. Anyway...

467
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:38,888
he was studying apes that apparently ate
and pooed, as it were, simultaneously.

468
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:42,372
Oh. Well, I don't eat very much.
I don't eat very much at all.

469
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:44,714
But the apes suffer not
in the slightest...

470
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,984
from the ailments that afflict
the civilized bowel.

471
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:49,636
We're all too house-trained,
Mrs. Tindermarsh.

472
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:53,187
But we couldn't go around evacuating
at will, Mr. Hart-Jones.

473
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:55,080
The mess would be frightful.

474
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:57,382
Do you masticate, Mr. Lightbody?

475
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,879
Do I what?

476
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:00,197
Masticate?

477
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:03,109
You're not a follower
of Horace Fletcher?

478
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:04,833
Fletcherize.

479
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,665
- You really must chew, Mr. Lightbody.
- Oh.

480
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,108
One, two, three, four.

481
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,949
Chew, chew, chew
That is the thing to do

482
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,475
Chew, chew, chew

483
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,687
Good food is good for you

484
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,644
Chew, chew, chew

485
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,618
But only if you chew

486
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:30,008
That is the right thing to do

487
00:37:02,463 --> 00:37:05,845
Poor thing has eaten nothing but toast
for days. He's probably a little weak.

488
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:07,772
Drink the water, Mr. Lightbody.

489
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:13,074
I think I fainted. Ellie.

490
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,057
We'll leave you to it,
Mrs. Lightbody.

491
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:16,954
It's all right, Will.
Everything's fine.

492
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,287
Oh, I miss you, Eleanor.

493
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:22,136
I miss... I miss your kindness.

494
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:23,893
But I'm here, Will. I'm here now.

495
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:26,166
I'm scared, EI.
I want to go home.

496
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:29,167
- No, please. Pull yourself together.
- I wanna go home!

497
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,899
Please, you're making
an exhibition of yourself!

498
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:32,823
I just won't let you
spoil this for me.

499
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,473
I don't like this place.
I want to go home.

500
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,808
But we both made a promise.

501
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:43,883
We're not well. Neither of us.

502
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,576
Don't you see we can never be happy
until we're healthy again?

503
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,396
It's such a small sacrifice
for all the happy years ahead of us.

504
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,633
But I feel violated here.

505
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,294
I give up.

506
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:55,219
I love you, Eleanor, sick as I am.

507
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:57,106
I'm sick too.
I'm sick of your self-pity.

508
00:37:57,172 --> 00:38:00,270
Can't you see this is the only place
where I'm completely happy?

509
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,502
Eleanor, I know it's been hard
for you, but it's these people.

510
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:07,563
These good people were at my side
when I had my baby. You weren't.

511
00:38:07,634 --> 00:38:10,450
You told me to stay away.
You made me stay away.

512
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:13,829
I was in Peterskill chewing at
my insides waiting for your telegram.

513
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:16,653
- I wanted to come.
- You were a useless drunk!

514
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,654
I didn't want you near me, and I
certainly didn't want you near my baby!

515
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:22,312
By the time you'd sobered up,
our baby was dead!

516
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,996
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,141
I'm truly sorry.

518
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:48,961
Is something wrong?
What's the matter?

519
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,061
So why on earth
did you bring him here?

520
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:00,195
I had to. He's very sick.

521
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:03,395
- And in a way, it's all my fault.
- Oh, rubbish.

522
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:05,186
It's true, Virginia.

523
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,664
You see, I poisoned him.

524
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:12,604
You poisoned him? When?

525
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:15,231
How? Strychnine? Arsenic?

526
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:17,124
It wasn't deliberate.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

527
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,775
He used to take Hostetter's Bitters
for his stomach and...

528
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:23,041
Don't tell me... 80% alcohol.
Wonderful stuff.

529
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,411
I used to take it for my monthly.

530
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:29,251
Then he went on to drinking
a whole bottle of Old Crow a night.

531
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:32,185
He was like a stranger.
And he always wanted...

532
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,534
Sex?

533
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,113
- It was...
- Don't tell me.

534
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:40,482
Grunt, grunt, thank you very much.
Good night, spit, snore.

535
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,854
- It wasn't that I didn't want him...
- Marriage is legalized prostitution.

536
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,343
I wanted to be more than a hole
in the mattress that answers to a name.

537
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:50,008
Amen.

538
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:55,445
So I saw this cure for drunkenness
in the Lily magazine.

539
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,828
The Sears White Star Liquor Cure,
it was called.

540
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:03,348
And I used to slip a drop
into his coffee each evening...

541
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,276
and he slept.

542
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:11,132
He didn't go out or get drunk,
he just slept and slept.

543
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:14,675
It was... It was wonderful.

544
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,634
But then when I was here last,
he found the bottle and had it analyzed.

545
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,560
What was in it?

546
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:25,814
The juice of the poppy.

547
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,727
Opium?

548
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,214
Yes.

549
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:37,046
I'd turned him into an opium addict.

550
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,525
He had terrible nightmares.

551
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:43,380
And finally his stomach just
completely gave up on him and...

552
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:52,590
Supposing he dies,
just like my baby died.

553
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,634
Oh, everything's my fault.

554
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:02,344
I want so much to love him.

555
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:05,680
I've... I've just forgotten how.

556
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,300
Who is that man?

557
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,983
Bartholomew Bookbinder.
One of Kellogg's top men.

558
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:39,491
And now he works for us.
He's good, and he's cheap.

559
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:41,569
Never heard of him.

560
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:44,577
- You've never heard of him?
- No.

561
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,139
- You know of him?
- No.

562
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,387
- Seen him around?
- Nope.

563
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,313
- The name must ring a bell.
- Nope.

564
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,040
Here she is.

565
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:21,466
It doesn't seem very... well...
hygienic.

566
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:28,347
Don't be petty, Charles.
From humble beginnings...

567
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,083
Gentlemen, I think
a little celebration...

568
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,843
is called for.

569
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:40,823
Charles, please...

570
00:42:40,897 --> 00:42:42,838
as president and chief...

571
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:45,464
I think a few choice words from you...

572
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:47,640
are in order.

573
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,455
To our prosperous futures.

574
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:59,763
No, no, no, no.

575
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:03,633
To the shining spires of Wellville.

576
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:05,778
To Wellville.

577
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:15,029
We love good food!

578
00:43:15,098 --> 00:43:18,642
No fish or fowl...

579
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:23,634
is a friend of the bowel.

580
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:26,901
We eat good food.

581
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,098
Puts us in a...

582
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:32,207
good mood.

583
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:38,451
Ah, Mr. Lightbody, good morning.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

584
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,366
- Have a pomegranate.
- I don't think that I ought to...

585
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:45,324
No? Antitoxic. The finest roughage
God ever provided.

586
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:47,250
Off with the robe, please.

587
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,946
A sample of your stool, please.

588
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:54,505
Here? Now?

589
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,105
Behind the screen, sir.

590
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,747
You are autointoxicated, Mr. Lightbody.
Quite frankly, it was obvious.

591
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:10,887
Drawn features, dry hair,
mournful expression, sunken eyes.

592
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:13,606
Coated tongue.

593
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,072
Now, ready?

594
00:44:27,724 --> 00:44:29,351
Is that it?

595
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:31,013
Well, I don't eat very much.

596
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:32,840
And with the enemas...

597
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:35,557
Your stool, Mr. Lightbody,
quite frankly, is pathetic.

598
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:37,862
Formless, mushy and foul-smelling.

599
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:40,418
- Take it away, Nurse.
- How should they be?

600
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,117
My own stools, sir, are perfect.

601
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:45,285
They are gigantic and have no more odor
than a hot biscuit.

602
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:48,103
On to the Morris-Scope,
if you will, please.

603
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,205
Ha! Just as I thought!

604
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:13,472
Mr. Lightbody, you, sir,
are the reason why so many women...

605
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,988
like your dear, beautiful wife,
are old longer than they are young.

606
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:18,816
But I've done everything I could
to help her...

607
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,673
to comfort her, to...

608
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,689
Connubial relations, sir.
Your natural urges.

609
00:45:26,754 --> 00:45:27,801
Sex.

610
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:32,506
Candidly, Mr. Lightbody, the lump of
flesh that dangles between your legs...

611
00:45:32,578 --> 00:45:34,552
is a dangerous weapon.

612
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:37,112
It will have to be harnessed, locked
away, retired. For both your sakes.

613
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:40,119
But we don't... Well, not lately.
Not for a long time.

614
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:41,947
Not since the...

615
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:44,982
It is my scientific conclusion
that sex is unnecessary and dangerous.

616
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:46,550
But isn't that a bit drastic?

617
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:48,662
You cannot afford
the loss of life-giving fluids.

618
00:45:48,734 --> 00:45:51,383
The shock to the system can be fatal.
Please, blow into this.

619
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:55,735
I get erections.

620
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:58,007
- You get what?
- Erections.

621
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:01,750
He gets erections.

622
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:06,259
I warn you, sir, an erection
is a flagpole on your grave.

623
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:07,705
I can't help it.

624
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:11,960
You listen to me, Lightbody. Our baser
appetites can and must be controlled.

625
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:15,090
I myself am a monk with regard
to the sexual intercourse...

626
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,495
and hence I am a beacon
of good fine health...

627
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:19,416
and more importantly,
so is my dear beautiful wife.

628
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:20,886
- I didn't realize...
- Fortunately, I can help you.

629
00:46:20,953 --> 00:46:23,635
- And so can someone else.
- Who?

630
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:26,007
- The Bulgarians.
- The Bulgarians?

631
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:29,868
The Bulgarians live longer than any
other humans on earth, and you know why?

632
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,917
No, I'm sorry,
I don't know any Bulgarians.

633
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,797
- Yogurt.
- Yogurt?

634
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,812
Nurse Graves!

635
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,051
- Yes, Doctor?
- Take Mr. Lightbody...

636
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:41,646
to the yogurt room
and give him 15 gallons.

637
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:44,083
Oh, no, no, I can't eat
15 gallons of yogurt.

638
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:47,443
Oh, it's not goin' in that end,
Mr. Lightbody.

639
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:29,160
But I get desires.

640
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,845
You mustn't. Not at the San.

641
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:33,889
It's very bad for your health.

642
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:35,907
Erections?

643
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,110
Yes! All the time.
Since I got here.

644
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:41,763
Ah, the silent killer
of the night.

645
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:45,378
They say nothing takes
the rosiness from the cheeks...

646
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,782
as fast as personal fornication.

647
00:47:57,383 --> 00:48:00,612
Oh, the pleasures
of the sinusoidal bath.

648
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,098
One of the doctor's better inventions.

649
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,029
Feel the current tingle, Will?

650
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:08,159
- I do. Isn't it dangerous?
- Apparently not.

651
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:10,847
Can you feel those electric ants
nibbling at your privates?

652
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:15,454
Fish. Fish! More like being
eaten alive by fish.

653
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:19,803
They say it's the equivalent of climbing
the steps of the Washington Monument.

654
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:24,063
- You don't even loosen your tie.
- I think it's giving me an erection!

655
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:26,551
More amperes, please, Mr. Woodbine.

656
00:48:27,744 --> 00:48:30,527
Let us brave the foothills
of Mount Everest to...

657
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:37,402
Nibble, nibble.

658
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:52,056
In and out.

659
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,508
In and out.

660
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,100
Seize the air with your lungs.

661
00:48:58,172 --> 00:49:01,881
That's the way.
In and out.

662
00:49:04,187 --> 00:49:07,088
Inhale, exhale the toxins.

663
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:19,535
Well, I leave you to the warm threads
of the doctor's electric blanket...

664
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:22,129
one of his inventions that I fear
will not catch on.

665
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:24,085
Enjoy your little nap.

666
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:27,861
I'm off to the warm embrace
of my afternoon enema.

667
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:38,130
Mr. Lightbody?

668
00:49:40,756 --> 00:49:42,349
It's Ida.

669
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:44,972
- Ida Muntz.
- Oh, Miss Muntz.

670
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:48,299
How are you enjoying
your stay at the San?

671
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:51,113
Still feeling my way.

672
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:52,878
Feeling any better?

673
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,017
Ah, yes, lots.

674
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:58,885
- And you?
- About the same.

675
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:02,311
Miss Muntz, please forgive me
for asking...

676
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:04,937
but what exactly
is the matter with you?

677
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:06,600
Oh, green sickness.

678
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,159
Oh, green sickness.

679
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:11,913
Don't you just hate the food?

680
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:14,315
Well, I don't eat very much.

681
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,163
Do you have a bad stomach?

682
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:22,721
You have very kind eyes
and a very noble nose.

683
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:23,908
I do?

684
00:50:24,844 --> 00:50:28,421
Will, I have a confession
to make.

685
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:33,029
At nights I lay in my bed just across
the hallway from you...

686
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:36,513
and I think but for my green sickness,
you might find me attractive.

687
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,047
But I do.

688
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,252
I look at myself in the mirror
and think, " Who would kiss me?

689
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:43,687
Who would make love to a plate
of moldy bread?"

690
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:46,600
Oh, don't say that, Miss Muntz.
You mustn't say that.

691
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,486
Can't you see my face?

692
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:50,493
Yes, I see your face.

693
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,933
Well?

694
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:56,610
It's a bit pale, that's all.

695
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,824
I've made up my mind.

696
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,860
If I've been scheduled to die,
I've decided to live.

697
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:09,886
Could I ask you a very great favor?

698
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:15,960
Inhale fresh air.
Exhale the toxins.

699
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:17,888
In and out.

700
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,016
Seize the air with your lungs.

701
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:26,944
That's the way.

702
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:31,390
In and out.

703
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:35,253
In, out.
That's the ticket.

704
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,984
In, out.

705
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:18,738
Will, I came to say I'm sorry.

706
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,300
For everything.

707
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:22,829
It's okay.

708
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,356
I just... I just want you to get better.

709
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,877
I want us both to get better. It was
wrong of me to blame you for the baby.

710
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,838
It was my fault.

711
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:33,290
No, I blame myself because
I just wasn't healthy enough.

712
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:35,468
That's why this is so important to me,
don't you see?

713
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,026
I do.

714
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:41,262
I know you'll grow to love this place
as much as I do.

715
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,218
I'll try.

716
00:52:43,282 --> 00:52:46,413
I really will. That's a promise.

717
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,513
And when we're both well...

718
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,301
I want you to come to me.

719
00:52:52,368 --> 00:52:55,368
I want you to give me another baby.

720
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:13,864
Not yet, not yet.

721
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:15,493
In a month or so.

722
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:17,986
- A month?
- When we're both well.

723
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,451
You're so beautiful.

724
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:28,649
Mr. Lightbody! Mrs. Lightbody!

725
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:33,735
Ellie! Eleanor, please!

726
00:53:33,802 --> 00:53:35,775
I'm very disappointed in you, Will.

727
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,841
Please make sure you drink your milk.

728
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,530
We only kissed.
We didn't do anything.

729
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,772
We were just talking. Just talking.

730
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,074
About how much we like it here.
About how much we like the San.

731
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:48,998
Just drink your milk!

732
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:51,746
- I have feelings, you know.
- So do I.

733
00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:22,588
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just...

734
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:24,543
I was passing by
and your door was open.

735
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,028
It's my face, isn't it?

736
00:54:27,103 --> 00:54:28,892
Your face?

737
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:31,261
You're staring at my face.

738
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,843
No, I was...

739
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,019
What color is it?

740
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,538
Viridian.

741
00:54:41,565 --> 00:54:43,867
What color is it? Say it.

742
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,099
Creme de menthe?

743
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,755
What color is it?

744
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,301
It's green.

745
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,476
Well, no, no. It isn't really green.

746
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,264
It's more, uh...

747
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:00,567
It's more pale than green.

748
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:03,759
Will, I'm cold.

749
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:06,807
Would you like me
to get you a blanket?

750
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:11,086
Would you please lay on top of me?

751
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:33,808
Would you please close the flap?

752
00:55:44,561 --> 00:55:46,469
Now do it.

753
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:48,236
Do it?

754
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:49,679
Do it.

755
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:19,240
Mr. Lightbody.

756
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:21,282
Sorry.

757
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:24,420
There is nothing finer

758
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:28,003
Than toasted flakes

759
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:31,869
And rice Carolina

760
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:34,334
It's the natural law

761
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:38,117
To eat the corn and grain

762
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:40,966
So the spirits soar

763
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:44,642
And bowels are born again

764
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,297
Every woman

765
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:50,659
Every man

766
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:04,156
Eleanor, look.

767
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:08,087
Do you see who it is?
It's Lionel Badger.

768
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,201
- Lionel who?
- Dr. Lionel Badger...

769
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:11,998
of the American Vegetarian Society.

770
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:15,743
Surely you've heard of him.
Oh, he's a wonderful fanatic.

771
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,664
No, I don't know him.

772
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,892
He wrote a fabulous paper
on the clitoris.

773
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,064
But I thought you said
he was a vegetarian?

774
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,990
It's all related, darling.

775
00:57:25,054 --> 00:57:26,909
It is?

776
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:51,286
What actually did you do
over at Kellogg's, Bart?

777
00:57:51,355 --> 00:57:54,289
Mostly I vacuumed the doctor's cows.

778
00:57:54,362 --> 00:57:58,354
Let me chuck some salt in here, sir.
See how that works.

779
00:57:58,425 --> 00:58:01,425
I call this batch number seven.

780
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:02,959
Excuse me.

781
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,814
Bender?

782
00:58:07,224 --> 00:58:09,874
What is it, Charles? You have
that look on your face again.

783
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,114
They don't look very appetizing.

784
00:58:12,183 --> 00:58:14,037
They will.
Give it time.

785
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:16,240
Bookbinder doesn't seem
to have much of a clue.

786
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:18,731
Do you think maybe we hired him
a bit too hastily?

787
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:21,194
He wasn't even a baker at Kellogg's.
He worked in the cow sheds.

788
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:24,335
Never underestimate the abilities
of the common man.

789
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:28,523
Okay, there are 22 batches here.
Each one of them different.

790
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:31,049
An ounce of salt this way.
A touch of malt the other.

791
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:33,610
And I've got it all written down.

792
00:58:33,682 --> 00:58:35,789
And this is batch number one.

793
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:38,707
Batch number one, it is,
Mr. Bookbinder.

794
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,014
Gentlemen...

795
00:58:41,906 --> 00:58:44,271
history is about to be eaten.

796
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,167
Shit!

797
00:59:07,597 --> 00:59:11,208
Well, one down, twenty-one to go.

798
00:59:11,276 --> 00:59:13,348
Batch number two, please,
Mr. Bookbinder.

799
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,274
We mustn't get disheartened.

800
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:19,686
Right, Goodloe?

801
01:00:05,345 --> 01:00:07,964
"The nipples, tongue,
neck and lips may be utilized...

802
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,164
to maintain and increase
the libido sexualis."

803
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:13,088
And read that bit at the bottom.

804
01:00:13,153 --> 01:00:17,014
About " it's no more than a woman has the
right to demand. Any sexual pleasure..."

805
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:19,509
What does Dr. Kellogg think
of our Mr. Badger?

806
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,176
Hates him.

807
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,733
Tell me, Virginia, honestly,
do you think that sex is harmful?

808
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:31,668
Oh, another ridiculous idea
dreamed up by men.

809
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:35,767
The only thing harmful
about sex, my dear...

810
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:37,976
is when women don't get enough
of it when they want it...

811
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,532
or don't get to enjoy it
when they do.

812
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,759
Is there another batch?

813
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,672
I've got it! We'll sell
this batch as pig food.

814
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,673
Vegopork.

815
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:09,710
No, no, Per-Fo-Korno
for vegetarian pigs.

816
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,473
Don't think so.

817
01:01:13,623 --> 01:01:15,477
Even the pigs won't eat it.

818
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:43,529
Oh come let us adore him

819
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:57,293
You did not knock.
I'm at my ablutions, sir.

820
01:01:57,358 --> 01:01:59,725
- He's here again, sir.
- Who, Badger?

821
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,034
No, sir.

822
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:03,654
Your son, George.
He's throwing projectiles.

823
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,415
Projectiles?

824
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:07,971
Cornflakes boxes, sir.
At the guests.

825
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:11,108
Boxes? Our cornflakes?

826
01:02:11,178 --> 01:02:13,066
- No, sir.
- Not my brother's?

827
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,677
No, sir. They're cornflakes boxes,
but there's no cornflakes in 'em.

828
01:02:16,746 --> 01:02:18,437
They have...

829
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:19,880
rice Carolina.

830
01:02:19,947 --> 01:02:21,058
Rice Carolina?

831
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,261
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.

832
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:25,704
Actually...

833
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:28,932
used rice Carolina,
to be more precise.

834
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,307
Used?

835
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,311
I think young George has gained access
to the latrines, sir.

836
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:35,009
Latrines?

837
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:37,250
He's throwing boxes of shit
at the guests!

838
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,645
What?

839
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:59,032
Stop this at once!

840
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:01,527
You're a bad boy.
You're very, very naughty.

841
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,288
Give us a cuddle.

842
01:03:04,355 --> 01:03:06,361
Silent night

843
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:11,768
Holy night

844
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,457
All is calm

845
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:18,204
All is bright

846
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:23,610
Round yon virgin

847
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:26,525
Mother and child

848
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:30,745
Holy infant

849
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:35,569
So tender and mild

850
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:38,676
Sleep in heavenly...

851
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:39,795
Who was it?

852
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:42,289
Stop it!

853
01:03:42,363 --> 01:03:44,664
Stop laughing! Who was it?

854
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:50,359
The American foot. Underline.

855
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:54,451
The American foot, like American teeth
and American woman, is deteriorating.

856
01:03:54,521 --> 01:03:57,869
The big toe being so long
and so separated as to be useless.

857
01:03:57,944 --> 01:04:01,141
The Japanese, on the other hand,
have smaller toes.

858
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:04,851
I once had a Japanese patient
who could play the violin with his feet.

859
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:08,179
Vivaldi, Beethoven, Mozart,
Palestrina.

860
01:04:14,485 --> 01:04:16,340
You all right, Poult?

861
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,346
What's the matter with you?

862
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,794
Poult?

863
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:24,173
Get that last note
about the violin, Poult? Hey!

864
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:30,253
Poultney Dab, you've had a heart attack.
And much worse...

865
01:04:30,322 --> 01:04:31,915
you're dead, sir.

866
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:35,695
You're a good man. Maybe I worked you
too hard, but damn it all, man...

867
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,891
it's very unprofessional of you,
if I may say so.

868
01:04:38,961 --> 01:04:40,936
How could you,
right here for everyone to see?

869
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:43,429
What will people think?

870
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,569
A fine advertisement for biological
livin' you are, Poultney Dab!

871
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:51,048
Very unprofessional.
Do you hear me?

872
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:05,798
Will, there you are.
We'd quite given up on you.

873
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:11,081
Mr. Unpronounceable and I were having an
interesting conversation about the czar.

874
01:05:14,282 --> 01:05:16,137
Woodbine, more amperes.

875
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:18,920
My John Thomas is limp
between my thighs.

876
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,485
Who are you thinking of?

877
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:39,102
My dear, dear wife.
A lonely religious woman.

878
01:05:39,173 --> 01:05:42,784
And the waitress at the kiosk
with the enormous breasts.

879
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:45,602
Cornflake-fed and yogurt-toned.

880
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:46,779
And you?

881
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:49,339
Eleanor, my wife.

882
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:52,542
And Ida Muntz, no doubt.

883
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:55,773
Yes, Miss Muntz.
And Nurse Graves.

884
01:05:55,842 --> 01:05:57,914
Oh, ho-ho, Nurse Graves.

885
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:01,052
More amperes please, Mr. Woodbine.

886
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:05,816
And you, Mr. Unpronounceable?

887
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:10,775
Oh, come now, Mr. Unpronounceable...

888
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:13,269
I can't believe
there isn't a tit or two...

889
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:16,309
you would have liked to have squeezed
in Saint Petersburg.

890
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,115
What happened?
Are they hurt?

891
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,667
I do believe it's worse.
I think they're dead.

892
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:37,594
What? What should we do?

893
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:41,203
Well, Woodbine, I'm sure,
is a Seventh-Day Adventist...

894
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:43,991
but I know no prayers whatsoever
of the Russian Orthodox Church.

895
01:06:44,056 --> 01:06:45,966
They're dead, Endymion?

896
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:48,144
They're dead!
They've been electrocuted!

897
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:51,761
Please don't get hysterical. It's
terribly American and rather vulgar.

898
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,702
These crackpot machines murdered them!
Don't you understand?

899
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:57,426
It is rather a severe cure
for flatulence, I do admit.

900
01:06:57,496 --> 01:06:59,251
You're a lunatic.

901
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:03,279
Mr. Unpronounceable is dead!
He's dead!

902
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:06,480
These... crazy contraptions
killed him!

903
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:09,931
You must get a perspective on things.
I talked to the man.

904
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:12,339
There was very little for him
to look forward to in Russia.

905
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,029
You're mad.

906
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:15,987
And Woodbine?
What about Woodbine?

907
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:18,864
He's a bath attendant.
He's probably never heard of Russia.

908
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,730
Nurse Graves? Irene!

909
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,411
- Where is she?
- It's her day off. Can I help you?

910
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:49,127
Ida?

911
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:51,910
Ida? Miss Muntz?

912
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:54,086
I'm afraid poor Ida's
no longer with us.

913
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,980
- She left?
- She died.

914
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:59,499
- What?
- Last night, 4:00 a.m.

915
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:02,922
It was very peaceful.

916
01:08:20,936 --> 01:08:23,205
- What happened?
- Looks as if he had a heart attack.

917
01:08:23,272 --> 01:08:25,476
Everybody's dying!

918
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:27,845
If this is the healthiest place
on earth, why is everybody dying?

919
01:08:30,662 --> 01:08:33,445
Do we not hear the bleating
of the calves?

920
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,898
The bellowing of the bull?
The cackling of frightened geese?

921
01:08:35,972 --> 01:08:38,078
The gobbling of reluctant turkeys?

922
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:43,229
Do we not hear the shrieks
of thousands of animals...

923
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,307
we dare to call dumb?

924
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,478
What are you having, sir?

925
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,820
A whiskey. A double.

926
01:09:09,888 --> 01:09:11,894
And a beer chaser.

927
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:14,267
And a hamburger... with bacon.

928
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,238
Mr. Lightbody!

929
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:20,538
Charles, Charles Ossining.
We met on the train.

930
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:22,328
We're all dying.

931
01:09:22,397 --> 01:09:25,014
Every man, woman and child.
I'll drink to that.

932
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,674
How would you like
that hamburger, sir?

933
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:33,167
Rare. No, not just rare.

934
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,738
Really rare. In fact,
cold in the middle.

935
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,830
They make glue from animal's hooves.

936
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,423
Buttons from bones.
Combs from horns.

937
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:51,471
Soap from their fat.

938
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:54,892
They even make quack medicines
from their testicles.

939
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:57,966
That's awful.
It's so sad.

940
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:03,145
I've been so blind.
You're a wonderful man.

941
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,721
Dr. Badger!

942
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:14,130
Your corset is gone,
I'm pleased to see.

943
01:10:14,196 --> 01:10:16,748
The bust is the fountain of life.

944
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,372
Flat-chested women
are a danger to themselves.

945
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:23,889
Now your glasses.

946
01:10:24,593 --> 01:10:25,738
My glasses?

947
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:28,525
Mere crutches for the eyes.
You don't need them.

948
01:10:28,593 --> 01:10:30,251
Throw them into the fire.

949
01:10:38,927 --> 01:10:42,919
We had the factory. We had
the machinery. We had the staff.

950
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,772
And, may I add,
we had a great product!

951
01:10:45,837 --> 01:10:48,739
We were poised and ready for success.

952
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:54,055
- And we run out of money.
- Oh, you want money!

953
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,457
I can give you money.

954
01:10:56,524 --> 01:10:58,377
No, no. I couldn't.

955
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:01,225
Charlie, you haven't got
a pot to piss in.

956
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:03,012
But I envy you.

957
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:04,359
You do?

958
01:11:04,425 --> 01:11:06,564
I envy you your dreams.

959
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,697
Charlie. Charlie.

960
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,965
We must never, ever...

961
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:16,675
live in a world where dreams
are rarer than money.

962
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:25,284
How much do you want?
Five hundred? A thousand?

963
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:30,273
A thousand would be very helpful.

964
01:11:30,341 --> 01:11:32,796
Rejoice ye hands

965
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:36,796
And be joyful on earth

966
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:40,162
Rejoice in the face of the Lord

967
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,017
For he cometh

968
01:11:42,084 --> 01:11:43,229
Hallelujah

969
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,464
Hey, folks!

970
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,345
Here at the San,
the goose is not cooked!

971
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:56,413
Merry Christmas to you all!
Merry Christmas!

972
01:12:35,578 --> 01:12:38,839
The place is filled with shams...

973
01:12:38,904 --> 01:12:41,752
murderers and wife stealers.

974
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:45,080
- Charlie?
- Yes?

975
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:47,152
Tell me truthfully, as my friend...

976
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:49,396
- I am your friend.
- You're my friend.

977
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:52,144
Do I look any better
for eating this seaweed?

978
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:56,437
For having my insides
sucked out of me? Do I?

979
01:12:56,502 --> 01:13:01,040
- No, you look like shit.
- I look like shit. I feel like shit.

980
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,012
- And you're in the shit.
- I am definitely in the shit!

981
01:13:04,086 --> 01:13:06,287
Charlie, with friends like you...

982
01:13:06,355 --> 01:13:08,211
Who needs enemas?

983
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:17,287
To friendship
and to looking like shit.

984
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:19,467
To being full of shit.

985
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:22,952
To bad health. To indigestion.

986
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,453
To shitsville!

987
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:37,258
Why pretend that sex doesn't exist?

988
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:40,773
Surely it's the clearest expression
of health and vitality.

989
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:45,131
But Dr. Kellogg says the loss of bodily
fluids is a drain on the nervous system.

990
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:47,051
But supposing he's wrong.

991
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:49,899
Supposing these fluids
build up inside you.

992
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:52,779
And if they're bottled up,
what happens to them?

993
01:13:52,844 --> 01:13:54,730
Will they explode?

994
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:59,110
But isn't it true
the good doctor has never had sex?

995
01:13:59,177 --> 01:14:01,567
- Mumps.
- No!

996
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:04,097
Are you saying that he's...
That he can't...

997
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,078
- Exactly.
- I don't believe...

998
01:14:08,585 --> 01:14:11,432
Please excuse me. I'm terribly sorry.
I'm afraid it's Will.

999
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:12,775
Every woman, every man

1000
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:16,867
Every woman, every man

1001
01:14:16,936 --> 01:14:19,837
Is at the temple of shit

1002
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:22,148
Here at the Battle Creek San

1003
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,923
We thought you should know, ma'am,
before the boss finds him.

1004
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:27,930
Thank you.

1005
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,722
Will, what have you done?

1006
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:37,152
You've been drinking.

1007
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,903
Yes, thank you very much.
I'll deal with it.

1008
01:14:40,994 --> 01:14:43,645
Ellie. Ellie, they killed them.

1009
01:14:43,714 --> 01:14:46,234
You're drunk!
I can't believe you!

1010
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:49,688
After all everyone's done for you!
How could you do this to yourself?

1011
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:53,535
They were murdered.
Mr. Unpronounceable and Woodbine!

1012
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,318
Oh, shut up! Did you actually think
that you could get away with this?

1013
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:58,718
They didn't just close
their eyes and die.

1014
01:14:58,783 --> 01:15:02,644
They were electrocuted!
In the suicidal bath!

1015
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,133
- Fried like pork chops!
- Will Lightbody, I've had enough.

1016
01:15:06,206 --> 01:15:09,620
Let me take you away from this place...

1017
01:15:09,694 --> 01:15:13,174
before we end up like Miss Muntz,
before they kill us all.

1018
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:16,219
You make it so difficult
to love you.

1019
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,458
Mr. Lightbody!

1020
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:24,050
Pull him out!

1021
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:29,202
Sorry, sir.

1022
01:15:33,498 --> 01:15:37,173
You have disobeyed my orders,
risked your life...

1023
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,247
plunged into
some reckless debauch.

1024
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:41,393
Are you mad?

1025
01:15:41,464 --> 01:15:42,990
I smell alcohol.

1026
01:15:43,063 --> 01:15:44,972
You are intoxicated, sir!

1027
01:15:53,975 --> 01:15:56,657
Sir, I see pickles
and relish and ketchup...

1028
01:15:56,725 --> 01:15:58,798
and pork, yes, I see pork.

1029
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,387
Meat. Red flesh and blood.

1030
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,875
How could you, sir?

1031
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:11,946
You obviously don't give two hoots
about your own life, sir, but I do.

1032
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:14,123
I'm gonna schedule you
for surgery.

1033
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:18,022
Not the knife! Please not the knife!
I'm really sorry.

1034
01:16:18,096 --> 01:16:20,484
Too late to be sorry, sir.
I'm gonna remove your kink.

1035
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:23,821
- But I haven't even touched my wife.
- I'm not talking about your penis.

1036
01:16:23,888 --> 01:16:26,125
I'm gonna chop out
your offending intestines. Nurse!

1037
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:31,429
Gastric lavage! Put Mr. Lightbody on
the enema machine until further notice.

1038
01:17:13,606 --> 01:17:14,980
Be quick!

1039
01:17:48,194 --> 01:17:49,566
Ladies.

1040
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:52,054
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning.

1041
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,489
Good-bye! Good luck!

1042
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:34,997
Did I die?
Am I in heaven?

1043
01:18:35,064 --> 01:18:37,486
Heaven on earth.
You're at the San.

1044
01:18:37,561 --> 01:18:41,452
Will, it was a success.
Your kink is gone.

1045
01:18:58,676 --> 01:19:02,986
But surely if the testicles are never
called upon, wouldn't they grow useless?

1046
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,481
I can't believe that nature
has made such a blunder...

1047
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:08,337
as to provide the human race
with such mischievous organs...

1048
01:19:08,402 --> 01:19:10,857
if we're not meant
to put them to good use.

1049
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:13,928
Mr. Badger, I think the other guests
are less than pleased.

1050
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:17,513
I'm not ashamed of my body.
It's completely natural.

1051
01:19:17,584 --> 01:19:19,045
I agree.

1052
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,389
Dress reform is about liberating the
body from its artificial constraints.

1053
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:25,711
- Isn't that what Professor Kuntz says?
- You've read Freikorper Kultur, eh?

1054
01:19:25,775 --> 01:19:27,717
Are you familiar
with the nudism movement?

1055
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,196
Professor who?

1056
01:19:29,261 --> 01:19:30,888
"Cuntz."

1057
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:33,510
Kuntz. Kuntz.

1058
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:36,580
No, I haven't read him,
but I think you're right.

1059
01:19:36,653 --> 01:19:38,725
What the heck.

1060
01:19:40,397 --> 01:19:42,981
Do you know what I'm wearing
under these shorts?

1061
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:45,669
- Nothing?
- Nothing?

1062
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,352
I'm sorry.
I can't keep up with this.

1063
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,036
I was just getting the hang
of vegetarianism.

1064
01:19:52,906 --> 01:19:54,563
To the Germans.

1065
01:19:54,633 --> 01:19:56,903
Professor Cu... Kuntz.

1066
01:19:56,971 --> 01:19:59,587
And to Dr. Spitzvogel.

1067
01:19:59,657 --> 01:20:01,695
Who is Dr. Spitzvogel?

1068
01:20:01,768 --> 01:20:02,979
I don't know.

1069
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:07,203
- He's a specialist in movement therapy.
- Eleanor, you have to try it.

1070
01:20:07,271 --> 01:20:11,394
When I left, after my first session,
I was floating on clouds.

1071
01:20:12,806 --> 01:20:15,044
But what did he do?

1072
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,256
Well, he...

1073
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:18,397
- He manipulates the womb.
- And the breasts.

1074
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:21,316
Die Handhabung Therapeutisch,
to give it its German name.

1075
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,768
Oh. I'm not doing anything German.

1076
01:20:23,845 --> 01:20:27,837
After only one session,
I was weak. Weak!

1077
01:20:27,908 --> 01:20:28,835
Weak?

1078
01:20:30,403 --> 01:20:33,851
I am sure Dr. Kellogg
would not approve.

1079
01:20:34,817 --> 01:20:36,573
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1080
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,057
There's a woman wearing a fox collar
with head, feet, the whole thing!

1081
01:20:46,465 --> 01:20:48,439
That's not wine I spilled, madam,
it's blood!

1082
01:20:48,512 --> 01:20:50,485
No animal should suffer
for you to look beautiful.

1083
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,413
- You're mad!
- As you are ugly!

1084
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,326
No amount of animals slaughtered in your
behalf will make you look different.

1085
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,627
Madam, control yourself.

1086
01:20:57,695 --> 01:21:01,142
Look at me, sir! Would you skin
the flesh from my body as well?

1087
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:05,723
- Bravo, Eleanor.
- Bravo, Eleanor.

1088
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:10,235
We're so proud of you, Eleanor.

1089
01:21:41,654 --> 01:21:43,562
It was a great success, Charles.

1090
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:47,052
Just cast your eyes over those figures,
and have a cigar.

1091
01:21:47,126 --> 01:21:49,777
Thirty-two thousand in advance orders.

1092
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:53,131
I feel like Caesar returning
from the Gaelic wars.

1093
01:21:54,612 --> 01:21:56,978
Have a cigar.

1094
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:59,183
You should be pleased.
We're on our way!

1095
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:07,916
This is a letter from my aunt.
She arrives on Friday.

1096
01:22:07,985 --> 01:22:10,124
Arrives? Mrs. Hookstratten?

1097
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:14,021
Yes! She's going to the San
for her nerves.

1098
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,136
- She wants to visit the factory.
- What factory?

1099
01:22:17,072 --> 01:22:20,868
Oh! Oh, yes. Our factory.

1100
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:24,740
Well, that is rather inconvenient.

1101
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,220
Inconvenient?

1102
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:31,911
You hooked me like a fish, Bender.

1103
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:35,177
You scaled me, you gutted me,
you stuffed me and fried me!

1104
01:22:35,244 --> 01:22:38,090
Chewed me up, swallowed me,
and shat me out again!

1105
01:22:38,156 --> 01:22:41,450
You bet your ass it's inconvenient!
Don't you see?

1106
01:22:41,514 --> 01:22:45,289
We have no factory! These orders
are for someone else's cornflakes!

1107
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:48,517
You made me lie, you son of a bitch!
Bender, I lied!

1108
01:22:48,586 --> 01:22:52,229
As day follows night, Charles,
one truth is undeniable:

1109
01:22:52,297 --> 01:22:57,281
Behind every shining fortune
lurks the shadow of a lie.

1110
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,116
That's what business is.

1111
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:09,094
Good-bye, Will.
Time to go.

1112
01:23:10,213 --> 01:23:14,914
If I eat any more roughage, I feel I'd
do my back passage a permanent injury.

1113
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:16,671
Good-bye, Endymion.

1114
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,196
I've grown quite fond of you
these past few months.

1115
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:21,724
Take care of yourself, dear boy.
It's worth it.

1116
01:23:21,795 --> 01:23:23,683
Is it? Is all of this worth it?

1117
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:25,603
Dear Will, what is life...

1118
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,962
but a temporary victory over that
which causes our inevitable death?

1119
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:33,116
Looks like rain.

1120
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:36,569
- Oh! I have a little gift for you.
- What is it?

1121
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,739
It's a Dusselberg Belt.
German apparatus.

1122
01:23:39,808 --> 01:23:43,386
- Most sexual inventions are these days.
- Sexual?

1123
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:48,539
I didn't use it. I thought it might
be useful to you in the twilight hours.

1124
01:23:49,407 --> 01:23:51,512
Thank you.
Endymion, I'll miss you.

1125
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:53,436
Good-bye, Will.

1126
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,199
Follow your heart.
It's the one organ...

1127
01:23:58,268 --> 01:24:01,650
that will surely let you down one day,
so don't waste it while you're living.

1128
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:05,073
I'll remember.
Endymion, you're a special man.

1129
01:24:05,147 --> 01:24:06,643
Bye, Will.

1130
01:24:06,717 --> 01:24:08,210
Bye, Endymion.

1131
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:44,916
I'm so glad you could come.

1132
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:46,955
Come then, ja?

1133
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:30,633
Please, you will remove your clothing
and slip into this.

1134
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:34,213
And then please,
lie on the table and relax...

1135
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:38,406
and dream and think
only beautiful thoughts.

1136
01:26:04,646 --> 01:26:07,679
Here we have a beast of the wild.

1137
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,065
And over here, folks, on the table,
docile and benign...

1138
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:13,245
we have our dearest Fauna.

1139
01:26:13,315 --> 01:26:16,034
The San's much-loved vegetarian wolf.

1140
01:26:18,915 --> 01:26:21,633
And relax, Mrs. Lightbody.

1141
01:26:21,701 --> 01:26:23,074
That's good.

1142
01:26:24,035 --> 01:26:26,336
That's good. Yes.

1143
01:26:26,403 --> 01:26:29,501
Breathe in, breathe out.

1144
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:33,725
Open your legs, please.
Just relax.

1145
01:26:33,793 --> 01:26:37,786
Don't worry. I am a doctor.
That's good.

1146
01:26:37,857 --> 01:26:40,312
Relax. Yeah.

1147
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,449
That's good. Enjoy it. Yes.

1148
01:26:43,519 --> 01:26:46,999
Think beautiful thoughts.

1149
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:49,526
Dream.

1150
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:31,379
See, not the slightest interest.

1151
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,868
A beautiful passive animal.

1152
01:27:35,574 --> 01:27:37,427
Oh, yes, indeed.

1153
01:27:39,508 --> 01:27:42,377
A beast of the wild.

1154
01:27:43,893 --> 01:27:46,030
He's known only the carnal pleasures.

1155
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:27,113
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

1156
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:29,385
I think that I'm getting better.

1157
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:32,451
I'll come back after you've had
your nap. Can I get you anything?

1158
01:28:32,524 --> 01:28:36,776
No, not at the moment.
Thank you, Irene. Maybe later.

1159
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:23,644
I shall introduce it to the San
early next year.

1160
01:29:23,714 --> 01:29:25,208
Mrs. Hookstratten!

1161
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:26,972
Doctor!

1162
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:29,408
How delightful to see you again.

1163
01:29:29,475 --> 01:29:31,447
I'm so sorry to hear about your nerves.

1164
01:29:31,521 --> 01:29:33,887
Please sit beside me.
Tell me all about it.

1165
01:29:34,848 --> 01:29:38,742
But didn't the Alcotts practice
free love, is it called? I mean, really.

1166
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,368
You shouldn't sneer at free love.
Its roots are purely feminist.

1167
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:43,544
Conventional marriage is a prison.

1168
01:29:43,615 --> 01:29:46,516
One should go wherever love leads.

1169
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,216
It's jealousy that's the obscenity.

1170
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:52,857
And I want to see my nephew Charles
whilst I'm here.

1171
01:29:52,924 --> 01:29:57,397
He's not really my nephew. He's the son
of one of my under parlor maids.

1172
01:29:57,467 --> 01:30:01,875
Stupid woman. Always getting pregnant
by some gate man or other.

1173
01:30:01,948 --> 01:30:05,013
Anyway, he has a thriving
new breakfast food company.

1174
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,156
Oh, really?
What is it called?

1175
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:10,933
Kellogg's. Of course.
Kellogg's Per-Fo.

1176
01:30:11,001 --> 01:30:14,449
I thought you would've known, what
with your son being one of the partners.

1177
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,790
Partners?

1178
01:30:26,902 --> 01:30:28,146
George?

1179
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:31,630
George Kellogg?
What seems to be the problem?

1180
01:30:31,703 --> 01:30:34,451
I don't think
he feels well, sir.

1181
01:30:34,517 --> 01:30:38,378
No? Then perhaps
he needs a purgative.

1182
01:30:38,453 --> 01:30:41,168
What about calomel or castor oil?

1183
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:44,717
Or shall we stop this nonsense
and eat up our food?

1184
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:47,023
Food? You call this food?

1185
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,444
What did you say?

1186
01:30:50,514 --> 01:30:53,863
We want proper food.
Meat and potatoes is what we want.

1187
01:30:55,218 --> 01:30:57,191
Ida, stop laughing!
David, stop laughing!

1188
01:30:57,265 --> 01:30:58,791
Meat and potatoes!

1189
01:30:58,864 --> 01:31:00,774
Stop it, George!

1190
01:31:00,848 --> 01:31:01,862
Stop it!

1191
01:31:04,912 --> 01:31:07,593
I command you to stop now!

1192
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:09,518
George, stop it!

1193
01:31:31,339 --> 01:31:33,345
Why is he like this?

1194
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:35,785
What did I do wrong?

1195
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,982
I mean, didn't I give him
everything? Everything?

1196
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:42,625
Everything you could.

1197
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,031
Then why does he hate me so?

1198
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:48,095
Maybe what you're giving him
isn't what he wants.

1199
01:32:13,443 --> 01:32:15,298
Mr. Bender, please.
It's Charles Oss...

1200
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:19,256
I know, sir. Mr. Charles Ossining.
You're president of Per-Fo Food Company.

1201
01:32:19,329 --> 01:32:22,842
Indeed. Well, tell Mr. Bender
I'm here, will you?

1202
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:26,688
That's not possible, sir. Unfortunately,
Mr. Bender is no longer a resident.

1203
01:32:26,753 --> 01:32:30,429
- What?
- He checked out, or rather disappeared.

1204
01:32:30,496 --> 01:32:33,463
The second floor maid
found his room empty, but...

1205
01:32:33,535 --> 01:32:37,756
he did leave a note saying
that you would be settling his account.

1206
01:32:37,822 --> 01:32:41,171
Which is a substantial sum.
A very substantial sum.

1207
01:32:42,206 --> 01:32:44,214
And these two gentlemen
also would like a word with you.

1208
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:45,530
- Yes?
- Mr. Ossining?

1209
01:32:45,597 --> 01:32:47,898
- Yes.
- Mr. Charles Ossining?

1210
01:32:47,966 --> 01:32:50,932
I have to serve due process, sir,
to inform you...

1211
01:32:51,004 --> 01:32:54,167
that separate lawsuits have been filed
in the Calhoun County court...

1212
01:32:54,234 --> 01:32:58,326
to enjoin the production, sale
and transportation of Kellogg's Per-Fo.

1213
01:32:58,396 --> 01:33:00,697
And substantial damages
are being claimed.

1214
01:33:00,762 --> 01:33:02,966
And I have
Mr. Bender's bill here, sir...

1215
01:33:03,034 --> 01:33:05,139
and his instructions
to give it to you.

1216
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:12,401
Stop him!

1217
01:33:14,233 --> 01:33:16,567
Stop that man!

1218
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:19,347
Stop! Stop!

1219
01:33:26,102 --> 01:33:27,565
Lightbody!

1220
01:33:30,582 --> 01:33:32,882
Mr. Lightbody, please sit down.

1221
01:33:34,006 --> 01:33:37,320
Something has come to my attention
that I think you should be aware of.

1222
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:39,784
It is your wife.

1223
01:33:39,859 --> 01:33:42,029
Yes. To my displeasure...

1224
01:33:42,099 --> 01:33:44,968
she's been seeing an outside physician.

1225
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:50,161
Not Badger. No.
Although he is no doubt responsible.

1226
01:33:50,226 --> 01:33:52,844
No, it is worse.
It is a German.

1227
01:33:52,914 --> 01:33:55,879
- A German?
- Yes, sir, a German.

1228
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:57,840
By the name of...
What is it, Jarvis?

1229
01:33:57,904 --> 01:34:00,358
Spitzvogel. Dr. Spitzvogel.

1230
01:34:00,432 --> 01:34:03,397
It seems that Eleanor's
been taken by...

1231
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:06,341
Die Handhabung Therapeutisch.

1232
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:07,909
Is it serious?

1233
01:34:07,984 --> 01:34:10,917
It is not a disease.
It is a treatment.

1234
01:34:10,989 --> 01:34:13,509
- I'm sorry, I don't follow.
- It is her womb.

1235
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:15,304
Her womb?

1236
01:34:15,372 --> 01:34:18,242
She's been having it manipulated.

1237
01:34:19,212 --> 01:34:22,027
Manipulated?
Is that dangerous?

1238
01:34:22,093 --> 01:34:25,669
There are certain things a doctor and
a priest cannot share with his flock...

1239
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:28,195
but I will say this,
look to your wife.

1240
01:34:28,267 --> 01:34:31,234
You're neglecting
a beautiful woman, sir.

1241
01:34:31,306 --> 01:34:34,176
And now I will move on.
Into the next room, please.

1242
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:36,802
Miss Jarvis, item two,
if you will.

1243
01:34:36,874 --> 01:34:38,912
Into the room, sir.
Thank you.

1244
01:34:42,151 --> 01:34:44,387
- Morning, ladies.
- Morning, Doctor.

1245
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:49,666
Nurse Bloethal found this apparatus
under your bed, sir.

1246
01:34:49,735 --> 01:34:51,838
Don't you know this thing
can kill you?

1247
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:55,106
How could you be so foolish?

1248
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:58,684
Let me tell you this, sir...

1249
01:34:58,756 --> 01:35:00,829
build up your resolve...

1250
01:35:00,901 --> 01:35:03,518
not your genitals.

1251
01:35:04,868 --> 01:35:06,876
That will be all.

1252
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:14,874
Masturbation is the vilest sin
of self-pollution!

1253
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:17,856
The most loathsome reptile rolling...

1254
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:21,237
in the slush and slime
of a stagnant pool...

1255
01:35:21,313 --> 01:35:23,702
would not demean himself thus.

1256
01:35:23,776 --> 01:35:26,297
It is the sin of Onan.

1257
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:00,210
Do you bicycle?

1258
01:36:00,283 --> 01:36:02,486
Oh, what a shame!
There's some beautiful terrains.

1259
01:36:02,553 --> 01:36:03,764
Charles?

1260
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:07,889
We're over here!

1261
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:10,416
- Aunt!
- Oh, my dear boy.

1262
01:36:10,488 --> 01:36:12,463
Oh, how are you?

1263
01:36:12,536 --> 01:36:14,804
You look so different.

1264
01:36:14,872 --> 01:36:19,027
Have you lost weight?
Are you growing a beard?

1265
01:36:19,095 --> 01:36:21,198
You look wonderful as always.
It's so nice to see you.

1266
01:36:21,269 --> 01:36:23,179
I'm so sorry to hear
about your nerves.

1267
01:36:23,254 --> 01:36:25,970
Listen, about our little visit
to the factory.

1268
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:29,004
I think it would be best if we postpone
it for a few days, perhaps a week.

1269
01:36:29,077 --> 01:36:31,565
I understand you know
Eleanor Lightbody.

1270
01:36:31,636 --> 01:36:33,578
- Of course.
- Yes, we've met.

1271
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:36,968
How are you? May I introduce my friend,
Virginia Cranehill. Charles Ossining.

1272
01:36:37,044 --> 01:36:38,504
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's mine.

1273
01:36:38,579 --> 01:36:40,617
And how is the breakfast food
tycoon today?

1274
01:36:42,098 --> 01:36:43,027
Just fine.

1275
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:45,097
If you'll excuse us.

1276
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:46,860
You're not joining us
for the luncheon?

1277
01:36:46,928 --> 01:36:48,816
Virginia and I are sneaking off.

1278
01:36:48,882 --> 01:36:50,474
Mr. Ossining.

1279
01:36:50,544 --> 01:36:52,202
- It's very nice meeting you.
- Ladies.

1280
01:36:52,272 --> 01:36:56,711
Sadly, so must I. So much to do, so
little time. You know me. Work, work.

1281
01:36:56,783 --> 01:36:59,597
Nonsense. We're going for lunch.
Give me your arm.

1282
01:36:59,662 --> 01:37:02,249
Now, tell me all about the factory.

1283
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:16,235
Will.

1284
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,188
Irene. You look very pretty.

1285
01:37:18,251 --> 01:37:20,422
I hardly recognized you
with your clothes on.

1286
01:37:20,491 --> 01:37:23,272
- I mean, out of uniform.
- Thank you.

1287
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,997
Is Eleanor here?

1288
01:37:25,067 --> 01:37:28,100
No, she's off
to a vegetarian seminar.

1289
01:37:28,171 --> 01:37:30,274
They're going to eat
dandelions with Badger.

1290
01:37:30,346 --> 01:37:33,128
Both guaranteed to make me vomit.

1291
01:37:33,193 --> 01:37:35,680
I was thinking of going
to Goguac Lake.

1292
01:37:35,753 --> 01:37:37,607
That's nice.

1293
01:37:37,674 --> 01:37:41,087
We could go together. That is,
if you're not doing anything.

1294
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:44,291
No. That would be very nice.

1295
01:38:27,967 --> 01:38:31,261
I want it to be perfect for you.

1296
01:38:37,949 --> 01:38:39,956
Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon.

1297
01:38:40,029 --> 01:38:44,982
I do not wish to spoil the festivities
of celebration day...

1298
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:48,498
a special day that marks the
anniversary of this establishment...

1299
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,545
founded by those visionaries
of vegetarianism...

1300
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:54,002
the Seventh-Day Adventists
some 42 years ago.

1301
01:38:54,075 --> 01:38:58,067
No, my friends, I will be brief because
I have an unpleasant duty to perform.

1302
01:38:58,136 --> 01:39:01,268
Quite simply, friends,
we have among us an impostor.

1303
01:39:01,337 --> 01:39:03,793
A charlatan. A fraud.

1304
01:39:03,864 --> 01:39:06,711
A criminal of the very worst stripe.

1305
01:39:06,775 --> 01:39:08,881
A man so heinous
and without conscience...

1306
01:39:08,952 --> 01:39:12,692
that I have taken time out of my
busy schedule to ensnare and expose him.

1307
01:39:12,759 --> 01:39:16,107
A man who has violated
every principle of human decency.

1308
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:18,037
To defraud his own patron.

1309
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:20,491
The very woman who
took him up from poverty...

1310
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:23,500
to dress him, educate him
and give him a start in life.

1311
01:39:23,573 --> 01:39:28,111
That woman is Mrs. Hookstratten,
and that man was you, sir.

1312
01:39:29,013 --> 01:39:30,418
The factory?

1313
01:39:30,482 --> 01:39:31,945
The letters?

1314
01:39:32,019 --> 01:39:34,386
Charles, how could you do this to me?

1315
01:39:34,451 --> 01:39:38,247
It wasn't me. I tried. I really tried.
It was this man, Bender!

1316
01:39:39,443 --> 01:39:41,547
Oh, yes, Mr. Goodloe Bender.

1317
01:39:41,618 --> 01:39:44,812
Who I once knew as Nevada Ned
of the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Show.

1318
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:47,531
A villain of the very first order.

1319
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,541
He's now safely in police custody
in Buffalo.

1320
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:52,518
You took advantage of this good woman,
sir, for vulgar profit.

1321
01:39:52,592 --> 01:39:54,283
Oh, yes, you did.
Oh, yeah.

1322
01:39:54,352 --> 01:39:56,685
Not just profit!

1323
01:39:56,751 --> 01:40:00,013
It wasn't just profit.
I had hopes, great hopes!

1324
01:40:01,486 --> 01:40:04,802
What's wrong with profit?
Don't you profit, sir...

1325
01:40:04,879 --> 01:40:09,611
from these good people who you've
conned into eating grass and sawdust?

1326
01:40:09,678 --> 01:40:14,826
So that they'll defecate and you can
suck it out of them with enemas?

1327
01:40:14,892 --> 01:40:17,160
So that you can feed them
more sawdust?

1328
01:40:17,226 --> 01:40:20,935
Don't you have workers who strive
through the night for a pittance?

1329
01:40:21,003 --> 01:40:23,304
Is there one nurse
in this whole sanitarium...

1330
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:25,279
who dabs ointment...

1331
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:29,127
on the piles of rich, fat asses...

1332
01:40:29,194 --> 01:40:31,429
who washes out the bedpans...

1333
01:40:31,498 --> 01:40:33,350
who makes more than...

1334
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:37,856
the cost of this pile of horseshit
you call food, sir?

1335
01:40:37,926 --> 01:40:41,243
Mr. Farrington,
the manacles, please.

1336
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:44,099
Lock him away, and as far as I'm
concerned, you can throw away the key.

1337
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,095
- I can't do this.
- I know, because...

1338
01:41:16,161 --> 01:41:18,049
Certain things have to be avoided...

1339
01:41:18,113 --> 01:41:22,006
like feather beds and romantic novels
and the touching of one's organs.

1340
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:24,894
No, that's not the reason.
It's got nothing to do with the doctor.

1341
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:27,772
I love my wife.
It's Eleanor.

1342
01:41:27,838 --> 01:41:29,910
That's why I can't do this.

1343
01:41:31,614 --> 01:41:33,500
Good-bye, Irene.

1344
01:41:33,565 --> 01:41:36,630
I'm sorry.
You're really very beautiful.

1345
01:41:40,411 --> 01:41:43,445
Sex is the sewer drain
of a healthy body, Will.

1346
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:45,783
I'm sure that you'll see that.

1347
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:48,698
Any use of the sexual act
other than procreation...

1348
01:41:48,763 --> 01:41:51,445
is a waste of vital energy.

1349
01:41:51,515 --> 01:41:54,775
An erection is a flagpole
on your grave.

1350
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:54,694
Eleanor, you're naked!

1351
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:56,621
It's Die Freikorper Kultur!

1352
01:42:56,685 --> 01:42:59,752
- And you're being manipulated!
- It's Die Handhabung Therapeutisch!

1353
01:42:59,821 --> 01:43:01,676
Don't give me that German crap!

1354
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:05,156
He was handhabunging you!
You let a stranger handhabung you!

1355
01:43:05,228 --> 01:43:07,749
Herr Spitzvogel is a doctor!

1356
01:43:09,004 --> 01:43:13,989
And you, you ginger-haired pig balls,
you were masturbating!

1357
01:43:14,059 --> 01:43:15,618
Sir, I was not!

1358
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,861
I saw you with my own eyes!

1359
01:43:17,929 --> 01:43:20,069
I was massaging my colon!

1360
01:43:20,138 --> 01:43:22,690
Massaging your colon?

1361
01:43:22,763 --> 01:43:26,985
I know where the colon is,
and it doesn't stick up in the air!

1362
01:43:27,049 --> 01:43:30,725
Will, I know how all this must look,
but understand he's a doctor.

1363
01:43:31,752 --> 01:43:32,963
Doctor, my ass!

1364
01:43:33,032 --> 01:43:35,617
Nurse, my ass! What have you
been doing with Irene Graves?

1365
01:43:35,687 --> 01:43:38,054
Nurse Graves! Nurse Graves.

1366
01:43:38,119 --> 01:43:39,745
And your green friend, Miss Moss.

1367
01:43:39,815 --> 01:43:40,927
Miss Muntz.

1368
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:44,284
Shut up! Shut up.

1369
01:43:47,492 --> 01:43:50,525
Shut up! Shut up!

1370
01:43:50,596 --> 01:43:53,563
If I hear one more German word...

1371
01:43:53,635 --> 01:43:56,864
I'll shove this stick
right up your alimentary canal!

1372
01:43:57,955 --> 01:43:59,232
Eleanor, wait!

1373
01:44:04,897 --> 01:44:08,607
Eleanor, don't you think
I deserve an explanation?

1374
01:44:08,674 --> 01:44:10,527
It's not what it looked like.
You're overreacting.

1375
01:44:10,593 --> 01:44:13,080
Overreacting?
A man had his hand up your crotch.

1376
01:44:13,152 --> 01:44:16,697
- It was medicine!
- Medicine? He was up to his elbows!

1377
01:44:16,767 --> 01:44:20,247
Stop it, Will! All right, maybe I went
too far, but you know something?

1378
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:23,635
It felt good! It felt very good.
I felt good!

1379
01:44:23,709 --> 01:44:25,914
- You'd never understand.
- But I do understand.

1380
01:44:25,983 --> 01:44:28,534
You don't know how to feel good!
You're incapable!

1381
01:44:28,605 --> 01:44:31,736
But I feel good.

1382
01:44:31,805 --> 01:44:33,877
I feel great!

1383
01:44:33,948 --> 01:44:37,657
As a matter of fact,
I never felt better in my whole life!

1384
01:44:40,667 --> 01:44:42,521
You do?

1385
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:55,181
Then I guess we can go home.

1386
01:45:52,942 --> 01:45:54,317
Hello, Dr. Vegetable.

1387
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:57,258
You get out!

1388
01:45:58,285 --> 01:46:01,099
You can't wait to stick that tube
up your ass, can you?

1389
01:46:01,165 --> 01:46:03,106
I said get out!

1390
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,416
I'm gonna burn this place
to the ground.

1391
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:08,548
You're mad, and you're drunk.

1392
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:12,902
Too late for that.

1393
01:46:16,715 --> 01:46:18,087
Do you like fireworks?

1394
01:46:27,271 --> 01:46:28,646
Fire!

1395
01:46:32,614 --> 01:46:34,524
Come back here,
you confounded maniac!

1396
01:46:56,418 --> 01:46:59,135
George, stop this insanity!

1397
01:48:05,751 --> 01:48:07,538
I'll give you $250!

1398
01:48:09,748 --> 01:48:11,178
Five hundred!

1399
01:48:21,012 --> 01:48:22,833
Stop it!

1400
01:48:33,937 --> 01:48:37,678
George Kellogg, you've been a pain
to me all my life!

1401
01:48:47,183 --> 01:48:49,004
Come back!

1402
01:49:04,266 --> 01:49:06,754
Georgie, speak to me.
Say something.

1403
01:49:10,218 --> 01:49:12,389
Georgie, say something to me.
Speak to me.

1404
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:16,896
Daddy.

1405
01:49:16,969 --> 01:49:19,522
Give us a cuddle, Daddy.

1406
01:49:24,456 --> 01:49:26,310
Give us a cuddle, Daddy.

1407
01:50:36,122 --> 01:50:39,418
The San burned for three nights
and three days.

1408
01:50:39,484 --> 01:50:43,124
The glow in the sky could be seen
from as far away as Kalamazoo.

1409
01:50:45,721 --> 01:50:49,297
Will and I lived happily in Peterskill
where we had four daughters...

1410
01:50:49,367 --> 01:50:52,270
and I opened Westchester's
first health store.

1411
01:50:53,335 --> 01:50:55,245
- Huh!
- What is it?

1412
01:50:55,320 --> 01:51:00,053
It's a check for $1,000.
From Charles Ossining.

1413
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:03,380
By all accounts, the charges against
Mr. Ossining had been forgotten...

1414
01:51:03,445 --> 01:51:06,063
in the confusion as the San burned.

1415
01:51:06,133 --> 01:51:09,428
And he eventually became very rich.

1416
01:51:09,492 --> 01:51:11,979
Apparently he had struck upon the idea
of taking sugar water...

1417
01:51:12,051 --> 01:51:15,085
and impregnating it
with the leaf of the coca plant.

1418
01:51:16,467 --> 01:51:18,440
And as for Dr. Kellogg...

1419
01:51:18,514 --> 01:51:22,541
he rebuilt the San and soldiered on
in his crusade for biological living.

1420
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:27,399
Gentlemen, I will now perform
a forward somersault with a half-twist.

1421
01:51:27,475 --> 01:51:31,148
I'm well in advance of the Biblical age
of threescore and ten.

1422
01:51:31,216 --> 01:51:34,989
I'm in perfect health,
and I'm convinced I will live forever...

1423
01:51:35,056 --> 01:51:36,616
because...

1424
01:51:36,688 --> 01:51:39,176
my bowels are immaculate!

1425
01:51:41,871 --> 01:51:44,684
Alas, Dr. Kellogg died
midsomersault.

1426
01:51:47,917 --> 01:51:49,477
He said he was healthy.

1427
01:51:49,549 --> 01:51:51,621
Proving once and for all that...

1428
01:51:51,693 --> 01:51:54,059
even he was not right
about everything.
