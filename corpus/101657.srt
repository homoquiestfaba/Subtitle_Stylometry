1
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:21,430
The Indian knew
that deer moved in circles...

2
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:25,700
that if the hunter calculated
his moves with skill...

3
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,470
he could run the swift deer
into submission.

4
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,572
Its hooves would bleed,
and the animal stumbled.

5
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:39,916
The Indian was to kneel
above his dying prey...

6
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:43,184
putting his mouth
to that of the deer...

7
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,783
stealing its last breath.

8
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:50,958
While he had earned
the swiftness of the beast...

9
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:55,866
in its death he was struck by
its peace and stillness...

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,893
and by his own.

11
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,305
I tried telling myself
I'd done my job...

12
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,007
defended my life.

13
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:33,311
But I didn't believe me.

14
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:38,655
You killed my boy, Joe Roberts.

15
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,388
You killed my baby boy.

16
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,659
This is how houses catch fire.

17
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:50,193
Murderers' houses! Murderer!

18
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,262
Mrs. Baker, come on.
This isn't helping anything.

19
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,331
He killed my baby!

20
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,344
Robert, you and Jim
want to get Mr. Baker there?

21
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,970
I'm real sorry.

22
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:07,111
Captain said, John Henry

23
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:10,554
I'm gonna bring
my steam drill round

24
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,218
Bring my steam drill
out on the job

25
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,386
I'm gonna whup
that steel on down

26
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,556
Lord, Lord, I'm gonna
whup that steel on down

27
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:21,226
Henry said to Captain

28
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,930
Whoa, man ain't nothin'
but a man...

29
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:45,450
My brother Frank was due back
from Vietnam within the week.

30
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,428
We hadn't seen each other
since I'd lost the farm in '65.

31
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:54,956
I took the uniform job
to make ends meet.

32
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,873
In one of his letters,
he complained...

33
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,876
that his fellow soldiers
were disturbed...

34
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,378
by the killing they'd seen.

35
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,881
He wrote...

36
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:14,012
"Guys over here expect their
hair to stay dry in the rain."

37
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,807
Good.

38
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,542
Your mom called.

39
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,643
Yeah? What's happening?

40
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:50,952
First the plane was going to be
delayed in Hawaii or somewhere.

41
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,514
Then it was going to be
on time again.

42
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:57,656
Now she says
9:30 Tuesday for sure.

43
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,257
He's got to go through Fort Dix.

44
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,707
Raffael asleep?

45
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:11,176
Yes, babe.

46
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,181
You worried about today...

47
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,284
or about Franky coming home?

48
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,625
No. This kid today...

49
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,509
His parents came into
the station making threats.

50
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,409
What threats?

51
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,777
Threats.

52
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,682
When they pulled the father
outside, he started singing.

53
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:38,588
Joe.

54
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,066
- Don't move!
- Hey! It's me.

55
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,035
Shit.

56
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,441
You scared the hell out of me.
Come here.

57
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,438
I almost kill you!

58
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,643
He's got you trained, ain't he?

59
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,276
You are early.

60
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,787
I didn't want
to hang around Fort Dix...

61
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,288
so I took a Greyhound.

62
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,791
Joey's going to be
so happy to see you.

63
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:21,060
Joe is so happy to see you.

64
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,836
Come on, baby, come on.

65
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:27,931
Come on, a little bit.

66
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,003
Hey.

67
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,315
Share with
your Uncle Franky, shorty.

68
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,817
I'm going to take Frank
over to the folks.

69
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,819
I'll be back in a bit.

70
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,320
You'll be here?

71
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,653
Yeah. I've got two lessons
this afternoon.

72
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,818
See you.

73
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,326
Welcome home, Franky.

74
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,692
Bye-bye.

75
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,558
Bye-bye, say...

76
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,304
Bye-bye.

77
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,808
Bye-bye.

78
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:05,470
Your uncle is a barnyard dog.

79
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,941
Town looks same-same.

80
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,014
So you're a dad, man.

81
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,488
How's that?

82
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,115
Undescribable.

83
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,551
It's great.

84
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,488
He's amazing.

85
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,727
What?

86
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,535
Just looking at you.

87
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,380
Got to admit,
it feels kind of strange...

88
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,884
riding up front
in the man's car...

89
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:48,512
no handcuffs,
my own brother driving.

90
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:50,988
Shit.

91
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:55,791
Remember we used
to plug cop cars with snowballs?

92
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,028
Pull over.

93
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:42,574
Hey! Don't you do that.

94
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,939
You did it.

95
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,396
Hey, get the cop!

96
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,192
Come on.

97
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,793
All right!

98
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,605
Fire!

99
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,878
King of the mountain!

100
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,578
Need an army to fight me?

101
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:10,990
What are you doing?

102
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,270
Listen, I just wanted
to see you guys...

103
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,298
meet the baby and all.

104
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,606
I ain't going over
to see Mom and Pop.

105
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,977
What are you talking about?

106
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,482
Franky.

107
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:34,612
You caught me off balance here.
What are you saying?

108
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,912
Good-bye?

109
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,291
Let's just call it
see you later.

110
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:49,001
Hey, I came to see you,
brother man.

111
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,662
What about Mom and Dad?

112
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,364
What about them?

113
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,566
You're going
to break their hearts.

114
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,338
You're the one who always
takes shit personal.

115
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,871
Wait.

116
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,453
If anything,
they'll be relieved.

117
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:10,716
You'll see.

118
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,656
Where are you going?
You got a place to stay?

119
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,056
You got money?

120
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,898
I already took forty bucks
from your wallet.

121
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,563
It's in the glove box.

122
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:33,769
I don't want you to go.

123
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:37,374
Hey, Joe, this whole town's
talking about you.

124
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,883
Good shot, boy.

125
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,510
Thanks, sir.

126
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,718
You know, if I could
figure out the difference...

127
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,719
between what gets you a kiss
on the ass and me locked up...

128
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,811
I used to know my brother...

129
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:12,477
like I used to know
I'd always be a farmer...

130
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:16,045
but drifting off on the train
that day was a stranger.

131
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,688
He looked like a hero.

132
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,598
The closeness
I felt with my brother...

133
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,691
was with that
rough-and-tumble kid...

134
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:31,532
I knew before
high school distractions...

135
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,904
and then later my wife and farm
occupied our time together.

136
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:41,202
In the last few years
before going overseas...

137
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:45,343
Frank had become branded
the hell-raiser of town...

138
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,217
that he'd come to no good.

139
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:51,223
Maybe leaving so suddenly
was the only mercy he knew...

140
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:54,249
for the grief
he'd caused before.

141
00:16:56,262 --> 00:17:00,266
As for my parents,
Franky was right.

142
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,791
They would not
take it personally.

143
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,206
They say some of
the boys coming back...

144
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,299
are coming back real confused.

145
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:13,712
Frank left confused.

146
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,715
Well, maybe
it'll straighten him out.

147
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,307
That's what Randall said.

148
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:23,288
Oh, my God, now my boy's
comparing his mama to a moron.

149
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,257
It wasn't a comparison, Mom.

150
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,254
He's a very restless boy,
that Franky.

151
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,562
That's what got him
into trouble, you know.

152
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,261
That's why he left.

153
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:39,396
I thought maybe
he just hated cops.

154
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,732
Don't say that.

155
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,305
Listen to your mama.

156
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,049
You are a good man, you hear me?

157
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,385
You are a good man.

158
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,721
That don't exempt you
from having the time come...

159
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,193
when you have to kill a man.

160
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,719
You can't regret it.

161
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:08,461
If it hadn't have been him,
it might have been my son.

162
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:13,200
No, sir. Don't you regret it.

163
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,207
You just keep saying
the Serenity Prayer...

164
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,232
and you get on with it.

165
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:38,353
We didn't see or hear from Frank
for a good six months...

166
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,297
when our lives took a turn.

167
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,315
There was a crack
of thunder outside.

168
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,322
Mrs. Roberts must have
jumped a foot off...

169
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,823
Do you want anything?

170
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,827
No. I know where it is.
Thank you.

171
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:45,297
She sure could make
good apple pie.

172
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,993
Do you need anything?

173
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,024
No. Thanks, Maria.

174
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,837
Thanks.

175
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:02,177
You know, Joe,
it didn't sit right with me...

176
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,547
when you married
a Mexican woman.

177
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:09,918
But I look at her today...
she's beautiful.

178
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,751
She's a beautiful
and good woman.

179
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,563
Boy, was I wrong.

180
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,531
I was dead wrong.

181
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:33,378
I'm going to check
the teletype at the station.

182
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:36,313
It wouldn't surprise me if he
were somewhere in the system.

183
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,943
He is. Yeah.

184
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,954
He sent out a card
about a month ago...

185
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,947
but I didn't want her to know.

186
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:49,961
He's got twenty-four more days.

187
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:53,294
Twenty-three and a wake-up.

188
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,391
Oh, yeah.
I've been counting.

189
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,326
Where is he?

190
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:00,895
Columbus.

191
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,071
Now, he didn't send a card,
but a girl named Dorothy.

192
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,945
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Roberts...

193
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,950
"Frank hit me.

194
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:15,943
"My daddy said
he had to go to jail.

195
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:19,014
"But don't worry, because
I'm here to take care of him."

196
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,386
He's a likable son of a bitch.

197
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,296
Where does he get it, Joe?

198
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,857
I don't know.

199
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:46,544
Frank, he took his clothes off
to take a shit!

200
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:50,241
He took his clothes off
to take a shit.

201
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:12,764
Look.

202
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,246
That's a great-Iooking kid, Joe.

203
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,716
Thanks.
He has a great-Iooking mama.

204
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,127
What'd she say?

205
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,635
She asked would you mind
playing with the kid...

206
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,638
while we chatted a bit?

207
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,469
Sure thing. Kids love me.

208
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,804
Come here, Raffael.

209
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,935
How you doing, boy?

210
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,668
Incest product?

211
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,481
That ain't really
what she said, is it?

212
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,143
I knew that.

213
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:06,089
I got a real bad idea
I want to follow through on...

214
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,752
and I need your OK.

215
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,660
It's about Franky, huh?

216
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,662
I want to offer him a room
in our place for a while.

217
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:21,468
I got to try
and get close to him again.

218
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:26,308
I got to try... something.

219
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:30,145
Why do you think he'll want to?

220
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:33,640
I thought he had that little
masochist waiting for him.

221
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:36,586
Maybe the little masochist
will come, too.

222
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,146
Now, wait a minute.

223
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,385
No, Maria,
you're probably right.

224
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:43,223
He probably won't want to come.

225
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:45,696
Joe, we have a child
in the house.

226
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,995
I've thought about that.

227
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,694
I'd talk to him first.

228
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,193
If he wants to come,
if he wants to bring the girl...

229
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,730
I'd meet her
and decide from there.

230
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,643
I'm not going to say no.

231
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:06,617
Doggone it!

232
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,644
Raffael,
what did you do that for?

233
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,714
Put sand down my pants for?

234
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,762
I'd spoken
to Franky's jailers...

235
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:54,254
who told me that releases
didn't start till 10 a.m.

236
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,767
I'd only driven through
three states...

237
00:25:56,802 --> 00:26:00,670
but, man, this country
looks smaller on a map.

238
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:53,808
Franky seemed to have few enough
moments of tenderness in him.

239
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,514
I didn't need
to interrupt this one.

240
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:01,526
I thought it better
to wait my turn.

241
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,495
Collect from Joe.

242
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,566
Hiya, baby.
Yeah, I'm still here.

243
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,546
No, I haven't yet.

244
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:34,441
Well, soon, I figure.

245
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:37,512
Kid's got me smoking again.

246
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:41,459
I will.

247
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:44,951
I know. I will.

248
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,486
I love you.

249
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,522
Bye-bye.

250
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,728
Little sister, that you?

251
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,066
Will big brother do?

252
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,665
How about Winnie the Pooh?

253
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,676
He's in the zoo.

254
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,974
This I knew.

255
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:35,912
He don't like the view.

256
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,347
'Cause he sniffs glue.

257
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:40,613
Open your damn door.

258
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:46,784
Are you sore?

259
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:59,398
How the hell
did you find me here?

260
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:00,961
Nice guy.

261
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:05,008
Are you going to invite me in?

262
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,826
I owe you forty bills.

263
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:25,557
So... pay me.

264
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,699
Repeat... how the hell
did you find me here today?

265
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:35,934
Well, I followed you
from the jail...

266
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:39,102
and I've been sitting
out there across the street...

267
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:42,079
smoking, which I had quit, but...

268
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,774
You followed me?

269
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,181
What you got there?

270
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,486
You got some squares for me?

271
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,838
Mommy's gone.

272
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,812
Bye, Mommy.

273
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,331
Where the hell is she?

274
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:55,048
The funeral
was almost a month ago.

275
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:58,021
I was in fucking jail, Joe.

276
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,217
I know where you were.

277
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,818
What difference does that make?

278
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,624
You wouldn't have known anyway.

279
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:21,474
What are you doing here?

280
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,875
Did you come here
to fucking guilt me to death?

281
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:50,435
Meet my old lady
Dorothy or Dotty...

282
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:55,310
or Doe or Dute or whatever.

283
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:58,111
Not whatever.

284
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,913
Hi, Dorothy. I'm Joe.

285
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:02,852
I'm Franky's brother.

286
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,325
Nice to meet you.

287
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:16,467
Joe followed us.

288
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,796
Like a common criminal.

289
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,108
Well, here's your beer
and stuff.

290
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:40,114
Joe come here to tell me...

291
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:46,387
that my mother died.

292
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:12,881
What do you say
we all go for some chow?

293
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:15,825
- Piñatas are from Spain.
- From Mexico.

294
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,193
Catch you smoking again in
the motor home, I'll shave you.

295
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:28,072
That woman has a beard.

296
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:32,435
That woman has a beard.

297
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,411
Are you saying that twice...

298
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:38,906
because you think we can't
hear or see or what, girl?

299
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,080
I'm going to go say hello.

300
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,884
You do that.

301
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,517
How do you do?
My name's Dorothy.

302
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,493
Is it real?

303
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:52,496
A way-out lady I got, huh?

304
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,021
She used to be
one of them flower children...

305
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,863
before I set her course.

306
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,396
All right, come on.

307
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:10,904
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

308
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:17,877
Frank, I want you
to come back with me.

309
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:20,482
What?

310
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:22,390
I knew you were
going to say that.

311
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:27,922
So, come back with me,
live at the house a while.

312
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:30,935
Oh, yeah, Maria'd love that.

313
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,929
I got Dorothy. I'm cool.

314
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,942
You're cool?
You're living in a motel.

315
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,434
No. Just for now,
till I find another place.

316
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:44,471
She's staying
at her folks till then.

317
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:49,453
Why don't you come back
and spend time with me...

318
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:53,981
Raffael?
Spend time with the family?

319
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,553
- How's he doing?
- He's OK.

320
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,591
She let me touch it.

321
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,075
She's just a little squirrel,
ain't she?

322
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,242
Bring her with you.

323
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:21,843
Bring her with you.

324
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,480
What would I do there, man?

325
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,686
Have a few laughs with Pop?

326
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,498
You stay out of trouble.

327
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:37,501
Get yourself a damn job.

328
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:40,095
I don't want a damn job.

329
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:44,370
Besides, I got a deal where
I'm scamming G.I. Bill checks.

330
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,377
Far as Mr. Trouble goes...

331
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,437
he ain't no less
in one place than another.

332
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,573
Why is that, Frank?

333
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,019
I always figured
it was Trouble had a car.

334
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,079
You know what I mean?

335
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,485
The law is here.

336
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:44,296
Never smoke this stuff
in front of the law.

337
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:46,462
The law gets upset.

338
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:48,062
I'm home!

339
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,735
Dispose of the evidence!

340
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:57,945
Woman.

341
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:00,416
Man.

342
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,045
- Hey there.
- Hey there.

343
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,724
He didn't come?

344
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,567
I'm sorry, Joe.

345
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,570
No surprise.

346
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:22,072
Where's the boy?

347
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,506
In there shooting heroin?

348
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:29,445
Thank you, Lord, for the gift
of this woman's cooking...

349
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,074
for the food to cook...

350
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:35,882
and the family
we have to share it.

351
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,387
Amen.

352
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,912
Amen.

353
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,790
You want some?

354
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:59,201
Going to sell the house,
I think.

355
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,642
Are you?

356
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,771
Think so.

357
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,582
Where are you
thinking of living?

358
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,523
There's a trailer park
over on Bright's.

359
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,719
They got
a pretty good deal there.

360
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,194
That's nice there.

361
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:21,824
They have a vegetable garden
in the back...

362
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:29,398
where you can rent a plot,
grow your own vegetables.

363
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,170
That's right... vegebulls.

364
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,802
Vegetables.

365
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,307
Vegebulls, that's right.

366
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:45,687
Did you know your daddy
grew vegebulls, Raffael?

367
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:53,095
Your daddy was a farmer
before he was a po-lice-man.

368
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,705
Very good, Raffael.

369
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:10,976
You miss the farm, Joe?

370
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,711
Sometimes.

371
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,652
It's a bitch, ain't it?

372
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:19,713
The same thieves
that took your farm...

373
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:21,952
now have you work for them.

374
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:26,286
We get by fine.

375
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,198
We get by fine.

376
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,702
Oh, sure. Of course you do.

377
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,042
Joe Roberts.

378
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:56,052
Hey, boy, did I wake you?

379
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:57,553
Who is it?

380
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:00,284
It's my father.
No, it's all right.

381
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:02,656
I'll tell you why I called.

382
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:05,161
You know
that strip of molding...

383
00:48:05,196 --> 00:48:08,563
that you have between
the kitchen linoleum...

384
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,126
and the carpet
in your living room?

385
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:16,363
Well, I noticed this evening
that it was loose.

386
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,375
You might get yourself
a screwdriver...

387
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:21,378
and tighten up on it before
somebody trips and falls.

388
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:24,904
OK, Dad. Thanks.
I'll take care of it.

389
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:30,382
Good night, son.

390
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:32,013
Good night, Pop.

391
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:22,298
Who is it?

392
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,857
It's me, Joe.

393
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:28,896
How you doing?

394
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:33,309
Well, it's pretty early,
Randall.

395
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:35,869
What's going on?

396
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:38,780
Got your paper.

397
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,556
Joe, your daddy
shot hisself last night.

398
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:02,738
Is he dead?

399
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:13,476
Can I use your john?

400
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,605
Mr. Roberts?

401
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:57,370
Mr. Roberts?

402
00:53:57,414 --> 00:53:59,382
I just took a telephone call...

403
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,079
from somebody claiming
to be your kin.

404
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:08,082
I think there's been
some kind of family emergency.

405
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,894
Mr. Roberts?

406
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,307
Did you have
a nice walk up here?

407
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,573
I don't understand.

408
00:54:37,054 --> 00:54:38,578
What are you doing here?

409
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,089
I just told you.

410
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:42,648
Your family needs you
to get ahold of them...

411
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,661
because apparently
there's been some kind of...

412
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:46,185
Family emergency.

413
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:47,696
Right.

414
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:50,256
OK, thank you.

415
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:02,101
Did you like that?

416
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:29,137
Joe, Franky's girl just called.

417
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:31,572
He didn't want
to get on the line.

418
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:33,303
Did you tell her?

419
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:35,368
I told her.

420
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,403
I don't know how
much got through, man.

421
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:45,815
At least he knows.

422
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,758
Have you been
on my property lately?

423
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:54,389
Have you seen those hippies
down there with their tents?

424
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:58,060
They have fires down there
at night, you know.

425
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:00,934
Well, I sent Randall
down to talk to them.

426
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:03,439
Why don't you come over
to talk to them?

427
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:04,940
I'll do that, honey.

428
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,239
- Pardon?
- I'll do that.

429
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:12,442
Well, if you need
moral support about your dad...

430
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:14,541
you could just stop by.

431
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,110
I appreciate that.

432
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,384
You just can't carry
that stuff alone.

433
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:25,395
It's pretty emotional, you know.

434
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,192
I got a family helping me out.

435
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,697
I appreciate it.

436
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:32,190
Well, sometimes you can
talk to another person...

437
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:35,227
a lot more openly than
you can your own family.

438
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,230
You know, let it out?

439
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:44,536
So, if you could just
come over on the property...

440
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,880
and I could even have
something to eat there.

441
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:51,854
Thank you.
You're a lovely lady.

442
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,090
You afraid of me?

443
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,185
- Am I what?
- Afraid of me?

444
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:00,696
What do you mean
am I afraid of you?

445
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:04,189
Can't you open up
and talk to me a little bit?

446
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:06,702
What do you mean open up
and talk to you?

447
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:09,205
I'm offering to share
some time with you...

448
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,207
while you're there
checking out these people.

449
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:14,267
I don't like them there.
I do own the land.

450
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:18,475
I don't really
want to prefer charges.

451
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:20,142
They're just kids.

452
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:24,085
Well, I don't want
to cause them problems...

453
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:28,581
but with fires and stuff,
and then at night...

454
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,958
the pop cans and everything,
for crying out loud.

455
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:33,963
How's your pig doing?

456
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:36,795
- Pardon?
- How's your pig?

457
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,425
He's fine.

458
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:41,437
He still living in
that old pickup truck?

459
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,939
Yes, he is.

460
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:46,442
He's a good guy, that pig.

461
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:49,468
Want to come to play with him?

462
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,171
That's an awfully
nice color on you.

463
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:55,116
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

464
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:56,642
Did you, uh...

465
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:00,256
You missed a spot.

466
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,757
That's just...

467
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,250
Well, you missed a whole spot.
The whole fender.

468
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:09,254
I'll take care of them hippies.
Don't you worry about that.

469
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:11,267
You need a lift anywhere?

470
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:12,768
To my house.

471
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:14,771
To your house. Just get in.

472
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:16,796
In front or back?

473
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:23,837
Can you squeeze in there?

474
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:38,658
Adios, Mrs. Roberts.

475
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:39,992
What do you say?

476
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,964
I don't speak no Mexican.

477
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:48,062
Good-bye, and please give
for me prayers to Mr. Roberts.

478
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:50,595
Thank you, Lucy, I will.

479
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,541
Work on your past tense.

480
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:56,273
Lucy, George Washington.

481
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:11,055
Glow in the dark.

482
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,043
Are you Joe Roberts' wife?

483
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:38,577
Yes. Who are you?

484
00:59:38,622 --> 00:59:40,590
Me?

485
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:43,092
I'm Dorothy.

486
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:20,422
You in there, Frank?

487
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:51,756
It's me... Joe.

488
01:00:54,164 --> 01:00:56,359
You in there, kid?

489
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:58,765
That you, Joe?

490
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,531
It's me, kid.

491
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,906
What are you doing in there?

492
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:10,436
Working on my draw.

493
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,347
All right if I come in?

494
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:15,783
Sure, Joe, come on in.

495
01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:30,722
Bang. Gotcha.

496
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:38,404
So I had a bit to drink.

497
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:44,376
Somebody was boring me.

498
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,974
Think it was me.

499
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:14,239
You want to get dressed, Frank?

500
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,240
Take you to see your lady.

501
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:41,330
Pass me my drawers, would you?

502
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:54,783
I just hope he's OK.
Sometimes he hurts himself.

503
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,810
No, he'll be fine.
Joe'll bring him home.

504
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:04,749
So where did you and Frank meet?

505
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:06,159
Shoot.

506
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:08,664
Everywhere, I guess.

507
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:24,474
Excuse me.

508
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:57,045
Do you have a six?

509
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:01,917
Go fish.

510
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:06,521
I got what I asked for.

511
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:12,752
Do you have a nine?

512
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:16,898
Go fish.

513
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:25,134
Welcome back.

514
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,877
I'm sorry.

515
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:50,164
Feel sort of funny
showing up like that.

516
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,226
I don't know.
I'm glad you're here.

517
01:04:54,938 --> 01:04:56,929
And Dorothy, too.

518
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,065
Finally got lucky, huh?

519
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:05,106
I sure hope so, because...

520
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,187
she's got my little monkey
in her belly.

521
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:14,122
You're going to be a pop?

522
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:15,488
Joe, Dorothy's pregnant.

523
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,925
I know. So I just heard.

524
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,658
Come here, Slappy.

525
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,160
I knew that Frank had come back
as a result of Dad's suicide.

526
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:30,434
It was an unsettling thought...

527
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:33,203
but that he'd come back
at all...

528
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:34,710
Help me with this shit!

529
01:05:34,744 --> 01:05:38,236
And that he was going to
have a baby with his girl...

530
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:42,115
was enough for me to feel that
he'd not gone completely numb.

531
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,296
What am I, black?

532
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,002
Messy.

533
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:05,634
What are you doing?

534
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:10,135
This is where you
used to be a little boy.

535
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,841
It's where I grew up.

536
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:15,646
We're going to be
in the big room, girl.

537
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:19,416
I know.
I just want to smell it.

538
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:25,260
Sorry.

539
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:29,659
I love you more than anybody
ever loved anybody before...

540
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:31,257
in the whole wide world.

541
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:37,296
Come on, Franky.

542
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,776
It's our first night
alone together in a big house.

543
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,413
I love you back, OK?

544
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:35,764
Honey, I got to go.

545
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:38,266
I told Joe
I'd meet him at 11:00.

546
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:41,759
I'm late.
You're a beauty.

547
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,071
What?

548
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:54,010
If you see a shooting star...

549
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:59,249
or if you see
anything else...

550
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:00,949
will you think of me?

551
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:06,089
Little sister, you really
asking me those questions...

552
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:09,462
or are you just
stalling me here?

553
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:11,296
Both.

554
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:17,897
I'll be back soon.

555
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:29,183
Used to be bears out here.

556
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:32,881
Not so damn long ago.

557
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:38,089
This place wasn't even
timbered when we were kids.

558
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,788
New ground.

559
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,897
New ground, shit.

560
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:47,630
New ground.

561
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,542
Not new ground.

562
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:56,568
What do you mean,
not new ground?

563
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,475
Old ground!

564
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,349
Old ground, shit.

565
01:09:04,387 --> 01:09:07,117
Old ground. Dad said.

566
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:10,250
Said what?
What did Dad say?

567
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:13,558
You had a Sioux village
twenty-five miles north.

568
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:16,997
You had another
ten miles southwest.

569
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:20,002
He said,
when this was all woods...

570
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:25,565
you had Indian runners traveling
messages right through here.

571
01:09:25,608 --> 01:09:27,405
Getting chewed by wolves.

572
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,933
Safe from wolves!

573
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:31,708
Shredded by grizzlies.

574
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:33,146
Safe from grizzlies.

575
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:35,742
Safe, shit.

576
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:43,056
Safe, Dad said.

577
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:46,221
Said what?

578
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:51,859
"Independent of time and space,
the Runner becomes his message."

579
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:55,268
Ain't no wolf, no bear
going to eat a message, Joe.

580
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:56,771
Never fucking happen.

581
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,797
Since when do you...

582
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:07,605
Wait a minute.

583
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:11,977
I get it.

584
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:22,892
I know you think that way.

585
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:24,126
What way?

586
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:31,907
I still love you.

587
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:37,470
Dad finally did something
you respect.

588
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:06,238
Hey, Pop should have been
an Indian Runner.

589
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,373
This place looked better
when I had it.

590
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:21,280
I'll bet it did.
You know why?

591
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:23,849
Because you had the fire in you.

592
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:26,885
People got it now don't live
on the land they're working.

593
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:30,126
Ain't got no fire.
Never had it.

594
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:33,159
This fire?

595
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:36,660
The fire's out now.
So what?

596
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:40,164
Between the cradle and now,
you happened.

597
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:42,609
You burned, brother.

598
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,285
What do I have to show for it?

599
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:57,521
What you got, Farmer Joe,
is knowing you once was.

600
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,585
On fire.

601
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:04,560
Shit.

602
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,837
Man...

603
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,771
I burned.

604
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:15,038
The land was churned.

605
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:17,238
- I burned.
- The soil was turned.

606
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:19,747
- I burned.
- They took what you earned.

607
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:21,909
A lesson learned.

608
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:26,111
Meeting adjourned.

609
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:41,333
I've missed this, Franky.

610
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:46,333
I've missed having
a laugh with you.

611
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,434
Me, too.

612
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:59,145
Oh, man...
what'd you do that for?

613
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,247
Come on.

614
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:06,719
OK, Big Bear.

615
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,822
I'm an Indian Runner.
I'm a message.

616
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,526
And the message is...

617
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,970
bet you can't find me.

618
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,236
I'll get you.

619
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:11,318
Ready to give up?

620
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,294
God damn it.

621
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:33,441
All right!

622
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:37,117
All right, you win!

623
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:41,385
You're a message.
You win.

624
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:47,192
Oh, Joseph.

625
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:48,753
Oh, Joey.

626
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,077
The message is...

627
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,048
never trust a bear.

628
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:12,076
I thought you're a tough guy.

629
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:44,109
Frank worked hard,
every shift he could get on.

630
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:46,137
And Dorothy
tended to the house...

631
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:50,709
got the old place
looking remarkably new.

632
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:52,584
Me...

633
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:57,787
I wanted to burn again.

634
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,217
How much longer
do I have to do this, Franky?

635
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:03,224
Forty seconds.

636
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:07,285
I don't think
this is good for the baby.

637
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:10,424
Thirty-five seconds.

638
01:18:13,502 --> 01:18:16,266
Why do I have to do this?

639
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:19,534
Because I got to know.
Twenty-five seconds.

640
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:21,634
Got to know what?

641
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:23,474
Twenty.

642
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:34,385
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

643
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:40,123
five, four, three, two, one.

644
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:43,097
Good.

645
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:47,259
I'll marry you... if you want.

646
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,768
Did you say you'd marry me?

647
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:52,364
If you want.

648
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:58,110
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be your wife!

649
01:18:58,147 --> 01:19:00,411
Go!

650
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:20,929
Go, Franky, go!

651
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,246
Good, little sister.

652
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:58,856
It's kicking!

653
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,761
Franky, it's kicking.

654
01:22:02,898 --> 01:22:04,263
Let me see.

655
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:07,763
There?

656
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,107
That ain't a kick,
that's a punch.

657
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:15,609
That's the last wild son
you're baking, baby.

658
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,112
Is that right,
what your papa said?

659
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:20,341
You going to be
a big, strong, handsome dude?

660
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,117
What about me?

661
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:27,053
I got some skeeter bites
that need scratching.

662
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:31,116
How about you and me
go fiddle with the hydraulics?

663
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,687
Frank, don't talk like that!

664
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:53,112
Why are you looking
at me like that?

665
01:22:57,219 --> 01:23:00,746
Come on, Franky,
you're scaring me.

666
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:27,782
Frank, you're scaring me.

667
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,187
Did I say the wrong thing?

668
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:36,756
Is it that you don't know me...

669
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,420
you don't know when
I say something nice?

670
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:40,723
Don't.

671
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:44,391
You don't know how to see
good things from bad things?

672
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:45,730
That it?

673
01:23:47,269 --> 01:23:49,897
Is it that we're strangers?

674
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,408
We're not strangers.

675
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,815
I don't know what
you're talking about.

676
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:05,549
Let's eat.

677
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:08,882
You eat.

678
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:12,259
You eat.

679
01:24:22,137 --> 01:24:23,798
Stop it.

680
01:24:32,914 --> 01:24:35,212
Wait. Where are you going?

681
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:43,390
It's OK, baby.

682
01:24:44,926 --> 01:24:47,724
He's just restless, that's all.

683
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:49,788
Put your hands on him...

684
01:24:49,831 --> 01:24:52,595
and you can't bring
any charges against him.

685
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:54,101
You weren't here.
You didn't see what he did.

686
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:56,104
He blind-sided me, man!

687
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:57,605
Listen to me.

688
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:59,266
Get in there!

689
01:24:59,307 --> 01:25:01,775
No, you're not going
to get in there!

690
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,404
I'll run you in, man.

691
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:09,608
Damn it, he blind-sided me!

692
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,119
We tried to get you at home.

693
01:25:12,154 --> 01:25:14,122
Maria said she didn't know
where you were.

694
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,124
Inside. It's Frank.

695
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:18,626
He busted this guy up
pretty good.

696
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,628
The guy's talking
about pressing charges.

697
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,653
Settle down. Take it easy.

698
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:25,325
Keep him there, Jim.

699
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,135
Where is he?

700
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,637
He's in there, boss.

701
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:32,663
I had to handcuff him
to the bar rail.

702
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:46,748
Looks like he ran up
a tab tonight, huh, Caesar?

703
01:25:46,788 --> 01:25:50,121
He did that.

704
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:52,626
He tells me
he can sell some furniture.

705
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:54,754
Can you give us a minute,
Caesar?

706
01:26:06,808 --> 01:26:10,835
Is that right, Frank?
You can sell some furniture?

707
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:13,314
That's good.

708
01:26:13,348 --> 01:26:18,547
You blow off some steam,
Dorothy's got nothing to sit on.

709
01:26:18,587 --> 01:26:22,216
What are you going to sell off
to keep this fella...

710
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:25,488
with the big eye from
pressing charges against you?

711
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:28,155
With your record,
you could do a year on this.

712
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:30,664
What can I say?
I fucked up.

713
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:33,998
I get in a violent way,
look around a room...

714
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:35,832
I want to bust it all to hell.

715
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:37,805
I see a guy like that...

716
01:26:37,839 --> 01:26:39,739
I don't want him
to look at me cross-eyed.

717
01:26:39,774 --> 01:26:42,299
I want that excuse
to fucking do him.

718
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:45,336
So you spend your life in jail?

719
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:49,546
That's a bear, man.

720
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:51,552
I'm a message!

721
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:59,722
Jail can't touch me.

722
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:06,894
Give me a cigarette.

723
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:17,940
I thought you were done
with this shit.

724
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:19,537
Well...

725
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:23,017
What about Dorothy? The baby?
Can it touch them?

726
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,212
- Outside parties.
- What?

727
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:29,087
Outside parties.
Give me a light.

728
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,651
I'm tired.
I just want to sit here, OK?

729
01:27:32,694 --> 01:27:35,629
I'll sit here. I'll relax.

730
01:27:35,664 --> 01:27:39,566
- You got something...
- Wait a minute, Clyde!

731
01:27:39,601 --> 01:27:42,593
- Let me get in there!
- Listen to me.

732
01:27:46,274 --> 01:27:50,301
Boy, I've had some
western times in this joint.

733
01:27:50,345 --> 01:27:54,111
Frank, you got a job.

734
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:57,016
Oh, yeah.

735
01:27:57,052 --> 01:27:59,987
You got a great girl.

736
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:01,921
You have a baby coming.

737
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:11,759
Give me your free hand.

738
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:16,128
Frank, give me your hand.

739
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:23,771
What are you doing?

740
01:28:23,812 --> 01:28:27,304
I'm going to cut you a break.

741
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:35,054
Yeah, boss?

742
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,115
Bring that fella in here.

743
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:40,753
He's just going to jump
all over Frank.

744
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:42,592
I know.

745
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,522
You're bleeding.

746
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:11,184
Goddamn rocket scientist,
I tell you.

747
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,226
I'm going to go, Frank.

748
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:23,733
Be sure he comes by
to see me tomorrow.

749
01:29:23,772 --> 01:29:25,763
I'll hold on to
the car keys till then.

750
01:29:25,807 --> 01:29:27,172
All right.

751
01:29:28,309 --> 01:29:30,641
Good night.

752
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,470
Good night, Joe.

753
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:41,450
What happened?

754
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:47,859
Ask Joe.

755
01:30:18,226 --> 01:30:20,820
Joe, you've done
everything you can.

756
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,354
I know.

757
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,891
I know.

758
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:37,468
I look at him...

759
01:30:42,016 --> 01:30:44,484
and I see this little boy...

760
01:30:46,688 --> 01:30:49,680
with his little toy gunbelt on.

761
01:30:56,464 --> 01:30:58,455
My little brother.

762
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:03,468
He's not
a little boy anymore.

763
01:31:03,505 --> 01:31:05,063
He's got a problem.

764
01:31:05,106 --> 01:31:07,233
He has to deal with it.

765
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:34,334
Dotty?

766
01:31:39,741 --> 01:31:41,174
Dotty!

767
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:44,675
Yeah, Franky?

768
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:46,577
Come here.

769
01:31:57,058 --> 01:32:00,221
I guess I got
a little off course last night.

770
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:01,660
I know.

771
01:32:04,799 --> 01:32:06,630
I love you, little sister.

772
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:10,504
I know.

773
01:33:31,019 --> 01:33:33,510
Look who I caught in
the parking lot doing wheelies.

774
01:33:44,632 --> 01:33:46,896
I came to get the car...

775
01:33:46,935 --> 01:33:49,927
but if you got a minute,
I'd like to talk to you.

776
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:51,063
Sure.

777
01:33:52,907 --> 01:33:54,306
Can you follow?

778
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:57,106
- Drop Frank's car at his place?
- Sure, boss.

779
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:01,238
You ride with me.

780
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:07,715
- Randall?
- Yeah, boss?

781
01:34:07,755 --> 01:34:09,245
Where's your gun?

782
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:20,094
There it is.

783
01:34:24,973 --> 01:34:26,873
Damn it!
That ain't funny, Frank.

784
01:34:48,963 --> 01:34:51,193
I know you're worried about...

785
01:34:52,633 --> 01:34:55,431
will I take care of business...

786
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:58,098
with the old lady...

787
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:00,573
when the baby comes.

788
01:35:02,777 --> 01:35:04,267
I appreciate it.

789
01:35:10,418 --> 01:35:13,581
But I don't want you
to worry about me no more.

790
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:16,913
I'm good, Joe.

791
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:20,026
I'm good.

792
01:35:22,964 --> 01:35:25,125
I want you to have
a good life, Frank.

793
01:35:30,872 --> 01:35:32,362
I know.

794
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:36,668
I guess...

795
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:41,239
I guess what I'm here
to say is that...

796
01:35:45,386 --> 01:35:47,877
I'm sorry about all the shit.

797
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:52,018
I'm sorry about Mom...

798
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:55,885
and Pop.

799
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:03,901
And, you know,
I ain't said it, so...

800
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:09,376
I'm saying it.

801
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:27,919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Joe.

802
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:22,536
- Have.
- I have.

803
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:23,537
Have.

804
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:24,970
My pen.

805
01:39:25,006 --> 01:39:26,530
She.

806
01:39:28,643 --> 01:39:32,101
- Had?
- Has.

807
01:39:32,146 --> 01:39:35,604
Has. Telephone!

808
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:37,845
Her.

809
01:39:37,885 --> 01:39:40,012
She has...

810
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:45,648
Joe Roberts.

811
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:49,061
What is it, Frank?

812
01:39:51,732 --> 01:39:53,723
We'll be right there.

813
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:02,032
The baby's coming.

814
01:40:17,692 --> 01:40:21,753
The baby was come.

815
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:23,991
Present.

816
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:26,932
I'm checking
the baby's head now...

817
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:31,370
and the back of the baby
is right over here.

818
01:40:37,645 --> 01:40:40,239
The baby's coming.

819
01:40:56,364 --> 01:40:58,355
We'll see if there's a horsy.

820
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,827
We'll see if there's a horsy.

821
01:41:15,983 --> 01:41:18,008
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

822
01:41:36,337 --> 01:41:38,305
Would you ask the doctor
where Frank went?

823
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:40,534
I just saw him drive off.

824
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:55,647
He said he left the room
just to let us in.

825
01:41:59,226 --> 01:42:01,217
I'm going to go find him.

826
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:19,703
Did you ever
want to kill someone...

827
01:42:19,747 --> 01:42:21,738
just out of rage...

828
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:28,953
and you don't do it
because you're afraid?

829
01:42:29,957 --> 01:42:31,754
And it's all about fear.

830
01:42:34,195 --> 01:42:37,187
Fear of the law
coming down, sure...

831
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,292
but mostly...

832
01:42:44,205 --> 01:42:46,469
fear like in sin...

833
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:51,473
sin with God.

834
01:42:54,849 --> 01:42:57,716
Yeah, Almighty God.

835
01:43:00,087 --> 01:43:03,955
What if he ain't almighty?
What if he ain't sacred?

836
01:43:03,991 --> 01:43:08,223
You might just as well
have done the fella, right?

837
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:14,390
Goodness...

838
01:43:14,435 --> 01:43:17,529
maybe ain't nothing but fear.

839
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:19,232
You know?

840
01:43:30,985 --> 01:43:32,475
What you doing here?

841
01:43:34,388 --> 01:43:35,878
Looking for you.

842
01:43:35,923 --> 01:43:37,982
You found me.

843
01:43:40,694 --> 01:43:42,685
What are you doing here?

844
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:45,597
I'm having a drink.
Buy you one?

845
01:43:46,901 --> 01:43:50,064
Don't you think you ought to be
by your lady's side?

846
01:43:53,574 --> 01:43:56,134
Leastways, over at the house?

847
01:43:56,176 --> 01:43:58,144
The house.

848
01:44:03,284 --> 01:44:04,478
Why not?

849
01:44:04,518 --> 01:44:06,076
Why?

850
01:44:12,826 --> 01:44:15,761
Come on, Frank,
don't give me that horseshit!

851
01:44:15,796 --> 01:44:18,094
How are you, Joe?

852
01:44:20,367 --> 01:44:22,267
Afternoon, Caesar.

853
01:44:22,303 --> 01:44:24,737
You boys watch the place
for a minute?

854
01:44:24,772 --> 01:44:28,708
I got to go pay a visit
to the captain's chair.

855
01:44:35,249 --> 01:44:36,739
Chickenshit.

856
01:44:38,786 --> 01:44:40,447
Chickenshit.

857
01:44:44,525 --> 01:44:47,494
I'm trying to understand
why you are...

858
01:44:47,528 --> 01:44:50,520
such a selfish son of a bitch.

859
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:56,325
I want to know how
to help you, Frank.

860
01:44:58,138 --> 01:45:00,800
You're my brother.

861
01:45:00,841 --> 01:45:02,968
You're the angriest man I know.

862
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:04,875
I want to know
why you hurt people...

863
01:45:04,912 --> 01:45:07,278
why you're not with Dorothy
when your baby's being born.

864
01:45:07,314 --> 01:45:09,282
Let me ask you something.

865
01:45:09,316 --> 01:45:12,285
How'd it feel
when you killed that fella...

866
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:15,311
that kid out on the highway?

867
01:45:17,858 --> 01:45:19,155
Not good, Frank.

868
01:45:19,193 --> 01:45:23,653
No? I would have thought
that felt real fucking good.

869
01:45:23,697 --> 01:45:26,097
It was clean. It was legal.

870
01:45:26,133 --> 01:45:28,567
You saved your own life.

871
01:45:28,602 --> 01:45:30,661
I mean, that's common sense.

872
01:45:30,704 --> 01:45:33,901
It's common fucking sense,
right?

873
01:45:33,941 --> 01:45:36,102
It's how these people think.

874
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:38,270
What people?

875
01:45:38,312 --> 01:45:39,336
What people?

876
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,348
Man, you're on
a fucking tangent.

877
01:45:41,382 --> 01:45:43,282
I ain't on a fucking tangent!

878
01:45:43,317 --> 01:45:46,150
These fuckers don't give you
time to figure out the problem.

879
01:45:46,186 --> 01:45:49,587
It's a math class.
The whole deal.

880
01:45:49,623 --> 01:45:53,582
Just like every math class,
there's a clown in the front...

881
01:45:53,627 --> 01:45:57,859
and everybody hates this clown
because he raises his hand.

882
01:45:57,898 --> 01:45:59,422
He's answering
all the questions.

883
01:45:59,466 --> 01:46:01,957
What do we do? Move on.

884
01:46:02,002 --> 01:46:06,462
Just fucking move on,
ready or not.

885
01:46:06,507 --> 01:46:12,241
He's deciding
we got to move on.

886
01:46:13,781 --> 01:46:15,715
He knows his math.

887
01:46:17,217 --> 01:46:22,314
I hadn't even figured out
about Santa Claus yet, dragons.

888
01:46:22,356 --> 01:46:24,722
Gasoline was my favorite smell.

889
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:29,686
It's like your farm.

890
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:32,824
Who grew better crops,
you or the math man...

891
01:46:32,866 --> 01:46:35,300
who bought it
out from under you? You!

892
01:46:35,335 --> 01:46:38,862
What's a farm for?
It's for crops.

893
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,199
That's the world, Joe...

894
01:46:44,011 --> 01:46:45,808
and it's a beauty.

895
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:47,541
Am I right?

896
01:46:52,886 --> 01:46:54,217
You're right.

897
01:46:54,254 --> 01:46:56,415
Am I wrong?

898
01:46:56,457 --> 01:47:00,484
There is no common sense.
Right? I'm right.

899
01:47:05,232 --> 01:47:07,564
All right.

900
01:47:07,601 --> 01:47:08,898
All right.

901
01:47:08,936 --> 01:47:10,563
So you're angry.

902
01:47:10,604 --> 01:47:12,196
All your problems
are the world's fault.

903
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:15,402
That's right.
It's the world's fault.

904
01:47:15,442 --> 01:47:17,910
Your fault. My fault.

905
01:47:17,945 --> 01:47:22,109
The fault of every
motherfucking human being...

906
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:24,982
every fucking one
of them out there.

907
01:47:28,522 --> 01:47:30,513
Life lacks tenderness, does it?

908
01:47:36,764 --> 01:47:38,755
Go on back there.

909
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:43,935
Go see my angel get born.

910
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:51,307
Life must be great
if you laugh it up.

911
01:47:53,514 --> 01:47:55,675
No, mister...

912
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:00,042
I'll just stay here
and drink it down...

913
01:48:03,123 --> 01:48:07,924
because there's only
two kinds of men in this hell.

914
01:48:07,961 --> 01:48:10,555
There's heroes and outlaws.

915
01:48:11,665 --> 01:48:14,793
Which one are you?

916
01:48:30,083 --> 01:48:33,052
Men come strong or weak,
and you ain't strong.

917
01:48:33,086 --> 01:48:36,419
You're in a bar when
Dorothy needs you the most...

918
01:48:36,456 --> 01:48:38,253
so you go ahead, Frank.

919
01:48:38,292 --> 01:48:40,692
You go ahead. Drink it down.

920
01:48:40,727 --> 01:48:43,252
You got it right.
There ain't nothing.

921
01:48:43,297 --> 01:48:46,289
Ain't nothing worthwhile left,
not even our own children.

922
01:48:49,736 --> 01:48:53,172
Your eyes are closed.
Keep them that way.

923
01:48:53,207 --> 01:48:55,767
My eyes are open, Frank...

924
01:48:55,809 --> 01:49:00,906
and I love looking at
my little boy and my wife...

925
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:03,109
and my house
and my little garden.

926
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:05,141
And I love you, Frank.

927
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:10,747
That all there is?

928
01:49:14,027 --> 01:49:16,359
Why does that scare you so much?

929
01:49:16,396 --> 01:49:18,694
Why doesn't it scare you?

930
01:49:18,732 --> 01:49:20,825
Why?

931
01:49:20,868 --> 01:49:24,463
I'm fixing a bridge
for fat retired men...

932
01:49:24,504 --> 01:49:27,598
and their fat wives
and fat fucking little kids...

933
01:49:27,641 --> 01:49:32,442
to drive over it
in their motor homes.

934
01:49:34,114 --> 01:49:38,210
I'm making an impact.
That's what I'm doing.

935
01:50:05,746 --> 01:50:08,078
That's all there is, Frank.

936
01:50:11,184 --> 01:50:13,175
Out there it's family.

937
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:21,290
In here it's hell.

938
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:57,797
I'll be right back.

939
01:50:57,831 --> 01:51:00,527
I'm here.
I'll be right back.

940
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:09,609
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

941
01:51:09,643 --> 01:51:11,042
She all right?

942
01:51:11,078 --> 01:51:12,545
She's tough.
Where's Frank?

943
01:51:12,579 --> 01:51:14,547
- Not here.
- Where?

944
01:52:21,314 --> 01:52:23,805
God! No!

945
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:25,249
Breathe!

946
01:52:25,285 --> 01:52:27,253
You're doing beautifully.

947
01:52:27,287 --> 01:52:29,721
- You're doing great.
- Almost there.

948
01:53:39,593 --> 01:53:43,222
Oh, God! Help me!

949
01:55:02,409 --> 01:55:04,468
Where's Franky?

950
01:55:29,135 --> 01:55:30,625
What?

951
01:56:36,703 --> 01:56:39,467
Take a deep breath
and blow it away.

952
01:56:46,413 --> 01:56:48,472
Keep pushing.

953
01:56:49,949 --> 01:56:51,541
It's just about here.

954
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:22,141
This is Unit Three.
I got him.

955
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,504
The baby's coming.

956
01:57:49,542 --> 01:57:51,567
He's coming.

957
01:57:51,611 --> 01:57:54,444
The head is being delivered.

958
01:58:09,662 --> 01:58:11,493
Stop!

959
01:58:30,116 --> 01:58:32,107
Can you see it?

960
01:58:35,121 --> 01:58:36,713
Oh, God.

961
01:59:32,378 --> 01:59:36,041
Here we come out,
and it's a boy.

962
01:59:43,022 --> 01:59:44,922
A healthy boy,
it looks like.

963
02:01:36,102 --> 02:01:39,435
I knew I'd never see or hear
from Franky again.

964
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:43,568
He turned his back...

965
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:45,737
on himself...

966
02:01:45,778 --> 02:01:47,370
and on his family.

967
02:01:52,118 --> 02:01:54,109
I went home that night...

968
02:01:55,321 --> 02:01:56,982
watered my garden...

969
02:01:58,224 --> 02:02:00,055
kissed my baby...

970
02:02:00,093 --> 02:02:02,721
and I held my wife
until morning.

971
02:02:04,697 --> 02:02:06,255
Life is good...

972
02:02:08,835 --> 02:02:10,598
my brother Frank.
