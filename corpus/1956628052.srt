Susan: when you're
fighting for your life,

15
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,930
you've got to have a reason
to keep going.

16
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:04,499
You've got to love someone
or something so much

17
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,675
that you refuse to give up.

18
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,068

00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,200

Debbie, give him the cheapest thing on tap.
Nothing for me.

48
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:30,585
So tell me about
this proposal of yours.

49
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:33,022
Ok.

50
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,371
How would you like
to make good money

51
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,939
on a beautiful boat
with a killer crew?

52
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,767
This guy i sailed with
last year, rick foster,

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,552
he's bringing a 68-foot irwin
up to vancouver next week, ok?

54
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,859
It's a private gig.
He's delivering it to the owner.

55
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:44,860
We need a crew. We...

56
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:45,817
matt, i don't know.

57
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,297
Come on.
It'd be a blast.

58
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,343
It sounds great.
I'm sure we'd have fun.

59
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,780
But you know i've given up sailing for a while.

60
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,869
Now, that's the most tragic thing i've heard all day.

61
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:54,609
Hey, hey, hey.

62
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:56,132
Rick foster.

63
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,351
Pleasure to meet you,
ms. Clarkson.

64
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,135
Nice to meet you.

65
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,745
You sneak. You planned this,
didn't you?

66
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:01,964
Guilty as charged.

67
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,226
Plan was
to ambush you.

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,794
Now, tell me why
you're landlocked.

69
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,230
Bunch of reasons.

70
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,927
I gotta settle down,
find a steady job.

71
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,146
I understand.

72
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,235
It'll only be
a couple of weeks.

73
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,410
Owner wants the boat in vancouver

74
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,803
by the end
of the month.

75
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,979
I'll pay 500
plus expenses.

76
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,285
That sounds great.

77
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:19,242
Excellent.

78
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,113
We set sail
next week.

79
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,637
But i can't.

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,335
Thanks for the offer.
I really wish i could.

81
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,946
It was nice
to meet you, rick.

82
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,730
See you later, matt.

83
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:29,905
Right.

84
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,430
I'll call you.

85
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:36,955
Don't worry.
We got other people we can go to.

86
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,609
Not like her.

87
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,786
So, matt,
how much of this interest is professional?

88
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,918
All of it.

89
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,750
All right.
Well, most of it.

90
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,491
Any luck yesterday?

91
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,057
Nothing i could handle.

92
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:56,453
$6.00 an hour to give boat rides to tourists just isn't me.

93
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,195
Maybe something without boats would be nice for a change.

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,023
Maybe.

95
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,461
Susannah, i, um...

96
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,462
uh-oh.

97
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,508
Uh-oh what?

98
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,118
That's what you used to
call me when i was a kid

99
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,513
and we were gonna
have one of our talks.

100
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,298
But i can't help not wanting you to leave again,
not yet,

101
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,213
not when i feel like we're finally starting to talk.

102
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,345
I'm not leaving.

103
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,347
In fact, i just
turned down an offer

104
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,305
to sail a 68-footer
up the coast.

105
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,266
I worry so much
when you're out there.

106
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,745
I just wish your father
hadn't made you...

107
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,052
he didn't make me
love the ocean.

108
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:31,923
I just always have.

109
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,360
It's like i never
had a choice.

110
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,451
Such a nomadic
lifestyle.

111
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,280
Constantly moving,
changing friends.

112
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,020
I never know where you are,
whether you're safe.

113
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:42,891
Mom, stop pushing.

114
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,916
Guess who.

115
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,874
Someone who won't
take no for an answer.

116
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,920
Come on.
You're gonna take the rest of the day off.

117
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,748
It's 10:20. The day
hasn't even started.

118
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,489
Well, all the more reason
to take advantage of it.

119
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,534
No, i can't.
I have to find a job.

120
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:18,492
Come on.

121
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,232
No, really,
i can't. I can't.

122
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,409
So why is
your mother

123
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,236
so dead set
against sailing?

124
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,542
My dad was a sailor.

125
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,502
Not sailboat racing.
You know, shipyard stuff.

126
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,460
He left
when i was 10,

127
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,810
took a job on some oil rig,
and that was that.

128
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:35,247
Wow. I'm sorry.

129
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,294
It's ok.
It was years ago.

130
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,514
So why are you
taking this gig?

131
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,214
All i want to do is
build my racing boat,

132
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,303
and that's why i'm taking this job with rick.

133
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,958
That's why i take
all my jobs.

134
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:50,959
Well, good luck.

135
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,090
Thank you.

136
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:00,882
Wow.

137
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:05,539
Matt: she's a beauty, huh?

138
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,106
Go on. Go for it. Rick
wants to show you around.

139
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,456
Keep an open mind.

140
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,725
Not too shabby, huh?

141
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,682
It's an irwin.

142
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,468
Beautiful
craftsmanship.

143
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,165
And she's certainly got all the toys.

144
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,778
So, when did you do
the whitbread?

145
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,433
Um, halfway through my sophomore year of college.

146
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,739
Around the world.

147
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,784
All the way.

148
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,265
Wow. Ha.

149
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:37,701
Welcome to "no sweat"

00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,399

No. The only thing
i do on a boat is tan.

Rick's my boyfriend.

163
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,526
I'm just along
for the ride.

164
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,657

no, i'm not going.

Nice to meet you, susan.

Of course not, rick.
I just think you're pushing it here, ok?

175
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,076

susan. Hey.

537
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,013
It wouldn't have mattered if the engine hadn't overheated, really.

538
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,275
That's not
the point.

539
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,624
I mean, rick
dropped the ball.

540
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,583
How much do we really know about this guy anyway?

541
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,193
Look, guys,

542
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,760
i've sailed
with him, ok?

543
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:01,935
And i've hung out with him at the roost.

544
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,589
He seems ok to me.

545
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,721
Look, the bottom line is
with us crewing for him,

546
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,855
he's gonna be fine.
No matter what, he's gonna be fine.

547
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:12,075
You're right.
We're acting like this is some trip around the world.

548
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,642
Come on.
We'd better hurry up and get those parts.

549
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,165
He wants to shove off right after dinner.

550
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,350
I liked college, but
i just couldn't help it.

551
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,527
I had to get away, sail.

552
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,705
I'm sorry,
but living on one of these things for 3 years

553
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,055
sounds like
a living nightmare.

554
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,144
And for me, it was
a dream come true.

555
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,844
You never feel like
you're in prison,

556
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,151
just totally cut off
from reality?

557
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,240
No one can tell me
what to do here...

558
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:49,025
or pull on me.

559
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,550
Someday i want to sail solo
across the pacific.

560
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:55,075
Hey, allie, how about
making some sandwiches?

561
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:57,468
I'm not hungry.

562
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,558
Rick: well, we are.
Come on. Help out a little.

563
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,559
You do it.

564
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,082
I'm on watch.

565
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,475
So that makes me the cook?

566
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,303
I don't think so, rick.

567
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,696
I'll make 'em.

568
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,177
No, no.
Allie will do it.

569
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,439
Forget it.

570
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,354
You're part
of this crew.

571
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:14,964
It means you work
like everybody else.

572
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,706
Sleeping with you
is plenty of work.

573
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,449
You always
pull this crap.

574
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:27,716
I swear, allie,
you're not gonna ruin this job, too.

575
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,375
It is so typical
of rick to blame me

576
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,898
for getting fired
off his last boat.

577
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:39,336
He knew the owner didn't
allow drinking on board.

578
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:42,426
What's with you two?

579
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,993
You seem so different,

580
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,866
i can't figure out
why you're together.

581
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:49,433
Rick helped me when i split up with my husband.

582
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,653
It got pretty ugly.

583
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:52,959
I didn't know
you were married.

584
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,351
Yeah.

585
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:01,663
Rick's a sweet guy
who loves me

586
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,360
and doesn't
expect much,

587
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,145
and that's
just what i need

588
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,451
till i get to canada
to start over.

589
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,975
And he's ok with that?

590
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,022
Every relationship doesn't have to be a lifelong commitment.

591
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,377
Look. Dolphins.

592
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,424
Those aren't dolphins.

593
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,297
They're sharks.

594
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,765
Mmm. Mmm.

595
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,505
I thought you
were getting coffee.

596
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,898
That's
too much trouble.

597
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,378
And i thought
this was a dry boat.

598
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,119
It's just a little whiskey
i brought for cold nights.

599
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,250
It won't hurt anything.

600
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:10,297
I don't drink
when i'm on watch.

601
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:14,431
Oh, and you've never
done 60 in a 55?

602
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,563
It's not the same.

603
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:19,175
Ahh.

604
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,307
Ok.

605
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,526
You're right.

606
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,658
I'm sorry.

607
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,748
Don't mention it
to rick, ok?

608
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,406
I guess i, uh...

609
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:33,886
i also drink sometimes when i'm nervous.

610
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:35,801
It takes
the edge off.

611
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:36,932
What are you nervous about?

612
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,850
You.

613
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:42,982
And me. Us.

614
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,375
Us?

615
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,813
Yeah, you know
what i mean.

616
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,250
The other night before we left san diego.

617
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,426
Yeah, i remember.

618
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,819
Look, matt...

619
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,298
i like you a lot,

620
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:56,996
but i just can't...

621
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,781
it's jason, isn't it?

622
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,609
There's a story there.
I know it.

623
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,916
What? No. I was
gonna say i'm wary

624
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,656
about getting involved
with someone i'm sailing with.

625
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,876
Hmm. Didn't seem to be
a problem with him.

626
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,532
A perfect example
of why i'm wary.

627
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:20,802
Hey. I'm sorry.
I'm...

628
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,325
being a jerk.

629
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,806
Give me another chance.

630
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,162
Matt, look,
i didn't...

631
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,817
no, don't... don't worry.
You don't have to spell it out, ok?

632
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:39,516
If you want to go off and relight some fire with jason,

633
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,997
that's fine.
That's fine, really.

634
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,478
I gotta go. I gotta
go get something.

635
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:45,958
No, matt, look,
i don't...

636
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:57,839
it's one afternoon, rick,
a couple of hours.

637
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,624
Besides, it was 4-1.
You lost.

638

a democracy.

Where'd you find this place anyway?

640
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,849
Friends of mine and i stumbled across it a few years ago.

641
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,721
Owner has a house on the other side,
but he's never home.

like a nice enough guy, huh?

00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,834
Yeah. He's a little hyper sometimes,
but he means well.

682
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:06,707
How long have you known him?

683
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,579
A few months,
maybe more.

i guess...

687
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:22,418
i guess i remember
a time when, uh...

688
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,377
when i was the one
you were looking at.

689
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,031
I'm not looking
at matt.

690
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,338
I appreciate that,
but you don't need

691
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,514

I already know.

692
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,342
Know?

693
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,171
I saw you the other night in the cockpit.

694
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,433
Well, then you
missed the part

695
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,392
where i said i just want to be friends.

696
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,177

697
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,396

aren't, uh...

699
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:47,443
and you're not...

700
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,187
aw, jeez.

701
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,972
Aw, susan,
that's great.

702
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,192
I mean, the minute i saw you,
my heart was just like...

703
00:32:57,236 --> 00:33:00,065
i mean it was like we weren't even apart.

704
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,240
I just
kept thinking,

705
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,111
maybe this means that we can still, uh...

706
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,910
i'm sorry. I mean, that's...
that wasn't right.

707
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:22,043
Just because you're not interested in matt doesn't mean...

708
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:25,003
it's not that, jason.
Look...

709
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,482
i thought
about you, too,

710
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:29,703
a lot, but...

711
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:32,619
the reason
we broke up...

712
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,055
it's still there.

713
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,364
The reason i never understood,
i remember.

714
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,061
I just wasn't ready
for what you wanted.

715
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:43,195
All i wanted was...

716
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,066
was you, susan.
That's it.

717
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,289
I know.
I wanted that, too,

718
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,291
but every time i thought
about the future, you know,

719
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,727
us being together...

720
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,819
i just wasn't ready
for that kind of commitment.

721
00:33:58,862 --> 00:33:59,950
Yeah.

722
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,176
I miss my best friend,
though.

723
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,483
Me, too.

724
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:12,137
I'm glad
you're here.

725
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:27,152
Matt, buddy,
what's wrong?

726
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:29,893
Huh? Nothing.

727
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,852
Let's just say
i'm as anxious

728
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,158
to get to vancouver
as you are.

729
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,162
[Thunder]

730
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,607
hey, matt.

731
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:32,739
Grab some rest.

732
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,567
Me and susan are up for the night shift.

733
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,090
Yeah.
I bet you are.

734
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,657
What's that
supposed to mean?

735
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,006
Nothing.

736
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,748
Stay outta my face, ok?

737
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,143
Is this about susan?

738
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,493
'Cause if it is,
you're way off, matt.

739
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,059
This is...

740
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,454
we're just trying to patch up an old friendship, ok?

741
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,803
That's it.

742
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,066
Ha.
Well, if that's what you really think, jason,

743
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,807
you're dumber
than i thought.

744
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:02,421
Look, we got a long way to go, matt.

745
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:05,902
Ok? Let's just forget about this.
Let's just...

746
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,514
let's just
drop it.

747
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:09,819
All right?

748
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,213
Are we cool?

749
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,736
Yeah, we're cool.

750
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,998
All right.

751
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,478
Just stay outta my face.

752
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,650
Something wrong?

753
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,260
Well, barometer's
dropping,

754
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,871
which usually means
a storm's coming,

755
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,917
but the weather service
predicted clear skies,

756
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,920
plus i can't find
this one chart.

757
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,443
You mean we're lost?

758
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,794
No. We're not lost.

759
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,232
I just...
i was wondering how much time we could save

760
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,583
by skipping our pit stop at morro bay.

761
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:20,934
Hey...

762
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:26,331
don't put so much pressure on yourself, ok?

763
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:29,769
Not everything is riding on this one job.

764
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,249
Yeah, i know.

765
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:36,166
Don't worry, ok?

766
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,519
I'm fine.

767
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:44,262
It's all gonna be...
fine.

768
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:54,968
Come on.

769
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,753
[Thunder]

770
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,759
where'd all this
weather come from?

771
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,195
Don't know.

772
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,675
Last report said conditions were supposed to be good.

773
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,112
Heh.
That's our tax dollars hard at work.

774
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,244
Maybe we should stay
in morro bay

775
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,419
until we see
what this turns into.

776
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:12,551
We're not going
to morro bay.

777
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,466
We passed the channel
about an hour ago.

778
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,119
We what?
Why?

779
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,165
'Cause i made a decision
based on the reports.

780
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,995
I had no idea we were
getting into this.

781
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,958
Radio: a violent storm is battering the northern california coast.

782
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:33,049
Tv 8 has just received word that winds up to 70 miles per hour

783
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,051
and waves
cresting at 30 feet

784
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:39,186
are causing widespread damage from monterey bay to san francisco...

785
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,543
sitting at home with mom is sounding pretty good right now.

786
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,414
Oh, yeah.

787
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:56,638
This rigging's
too loose.

788
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:59,206
All this jibing's
gonna snap a mast.

789
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,339
Roll in the jib and take down half the main.

790
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,427
Yeah.

791
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:14,395
God, i hate
this stupid rig.

792
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,831
We need some help.

793
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,836
I guess you should
go get matt.

794
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,055
Go.

795
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,365
Matt, wake up.

796
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,149
Come on, wake up.

797
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:31,107
I think
he passed out.

798
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,328
Perfect. We're up there fighting a gale,
and he's drinking?

799
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,025
It's pretty
rough out, isn't it?

800
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,115
How would you know?
You've been down here all night.

801
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,726
Look, i didn't
mean it, ok?

802
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,771
I'm just wiped out.

803
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,512
Aah!

804
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:45,905
You ok?

805
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,123
Yeah.

806
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,124
Man,
what's going on?

807
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,953
We need your help
up on deck.

808
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,086
Can't handle a little
foul weather?

809
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,653
Give me a clue,
matt.

810
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:55,784
You gonna be
a jerk all night,

811
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,133
or are you gonna
come up and help?

812
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,005
Somebody get up here fast!

813
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:00,963
Rick!
Rick, we need you.

814
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:01,921
What happened?

815
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,009
We're trying
to reduce the sail.

816
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:04,053
The rig is jammed.

817
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,751
Ok.

818
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,977
Allie,
put some gear on.

819
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,894
Take it down.

820
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,243
I'm gonna
reduce the sail.

821
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,202
Ok. Fasten
your safety line.

822
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:37,739
I'm trying to reef the main,
but it's bound off!

823
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:38,740
Rick!

824
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,089
Ohh!

825
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,570
Rick, hang on!
Hang on, rick!

826
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:49,055
Rick, are you ok?

827
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:50,970
I'm all right!

828
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:52,058
Allie, what
are you doing?

829
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,407
I want to help.

830
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,278
It's too dangerous.
Get below.

831
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:56,497
No.

832
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,154
[Muttering]

833
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,639
far enough!
Hold it there!

834
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,600
Hold on!

835
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,561
Jason!

836
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:23,785
Susan:
jason, are you hurt?

837
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,613
No, i'm...
i'm all right.

838
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,486
Need help
on the stern.

839
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:31,663
Make sure you fasten
your safety line.

840
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,840
Secure the lines
and clear the deck!

841
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:35,971
Ok!

842
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,718
Aah!

843
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:46,329
Ohh!

844
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,027
Allie!

845
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,115
Rick!

846
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:53,946
Rick, allie's hurt!
She's on the stern!

847
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:55,382
Ok, i'm coming!

848
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,259
Allie, i'm here.

849
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:04,304
You ok?

850
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:07,437
Baby, what happened?

851
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,614
I was trying to help.

852
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,224
You shouldn't
have been up here.

853
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,008
I know.

854
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:15,097
I hit my back.

855
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,664
It really hurts.

856
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,927
We got to get allie
to a hospital.

857
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,494
We'll never make it
in this storm.

858
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,844
Rick, please,
the coast is deadly.

859
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:25,151
We've got to move away from land,
not closer in.

860
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,456
Look at the chart.

861
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,284
I can't.
I can't find them.

862
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:29,285
Somebody lost them.

863
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:30,417
You're kidding!

864
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,374
No. I wish i was.

865
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:33,768
This is crazy...
look out!

866
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:40,209
All right, that's it.
That's it.

867
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,515
We're going in.

868
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,908
I'll put in a call
to the coast guard.

869
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,736
You guys bring her down.

870
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,303
Ok. Come on. Come here.
Watch your back.

871
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:49,349
Oww...

872
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:50,698
i got you.

873
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,576
Rick: we've lost our charts.
Can you assist us? Over.

874
00:42:58,619 --> 00:42:59,620
"Sea-brook,"
i need your position.

875
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,317
What are your
coordinates? Over.

876
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:06,192
Ok, coast guard.
Um, my coordinates are 35 degrees, 33 minutes

877
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:09,282
by 121 degrees,
29 minutes.

878
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:10,500
Copy that,
"sea-brook."

879
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:12,154
Got it.

880
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:16,289
Wait. We're showing your position to be morro bay.
Over.

881
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,640
Uh... uh, that's
right, coast guard.

882
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,947
That was my last position.
My mistake.

883
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,862
I feel horrible
about allie.

884
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:25,864
Aw, she shouldn't
have been up here.

885
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:27,474
She wouldn't have been up here if it wasn't for me.

886
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:29,084
I was yelling at her
for not helping out.

887
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,782
It's my fault.

888
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:33,219
All right!

889
00:43:33,262 --> 00:43:36,744
The coast guard says san simeon's our closest dock.

890
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:39,486
Rick wants us to change the heading to 300 degrees.

891
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:40,835
That's a bad idea,
matt.

892
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:41,923
We'll be broadside
to the waves.

893
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,011
We'll risk...

894
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:44,970
nobody asked you.
Just do it, susan.

895
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,449
Matt, we're
gonna be swamped.

896
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:47,581
Matt, you're
not thinking.

897
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,713
You don't know
what you're say...

898
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:49,975
change course now!

899
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,890
No, i won't.
It's suicide!

900
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,203
My god, matt,
you're jeopardizing all of our lives!

901
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:03,945
You're both relieved of your duties effective immediately!

902
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,686
You and rick can't handle this boat

903
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:06,774
by yourselves
in this storm.

904
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:07,949
Aw, forget it.

905
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:10,125
He'd rather kill us all than look weak.

906
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:12,214
If you don't get down below,
i'll drag you down myself!

907
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:14,869
No. No. I am staying
here to help...

908
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:18,351
matt, stop it... aah!

909
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,222
Jason!

910
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:22,964
Jason! Oh! No!

911
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,357
No, jason!

912
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,185
Jason!

913
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,536
Susan: that's enough.

914
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,190
Stop it!

915
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,631
Jason!

916
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,850
Jason!

917
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:42,027
Aah!

918
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,029
Jason!

919
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,247
Jason!

920
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,858
What happened?

921
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,381
I didn't mean to.

922
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,298
What happened,
susan?

923
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,604
They had a fight.
Jason went over.

924
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:55,649
Jason!

925
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,346
Jason!

926
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,610
Jason!
Jason!

927
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:01,568
Where is he?

928
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:03,309
Susan,
it's too late.

929
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:04,571
He's gone.

930
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:06,225
No! Don't say that.

931
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,530
Jason!

932
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,924
Jason!

933
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,190
Susan: jason!

934
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:17,236
Jason!

935
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:21,153
Rick: jason!

936
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:22,981
Please, where are you?

937
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,373
[Gasping]

938
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,374
there he is!

939
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,768
Jason, over here!

940
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,727
Swim for it!

941
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,554
Grab it!

942
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:33,600
Grab the line!
Hold on!

943
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,297
Pull, pull. Help me.

944
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:37,212
Hang on!

945
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:40,999
Jason, please!
Hold on!

946
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,217
Hold on!

947
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:43,915
Ok, come on.

948
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,266
Pull! Pull!

949
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,533
Pull!

950
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:56,362
We got ya!
Come on!

951
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,538
Come on!
Come on. Yeah!

952
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:19,298
Hey, how ya doing?

953
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:20,995
I'm ok.

954
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,823
Is jason all right?

955
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,259
Yeah. He's fine.

956
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,827
Looks like it hurts.

957
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:27,828
Uhh...

958
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,830
only when the boat moves.

959
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:34,704
Here. This should
cushion the bumps.

960
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:37,403
Thanks.

961
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:40,362
So how are you guys
doing up there?

962
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,407
It's tough,

963
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,018
but we're
hanging in there.

964
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,195
It's bad, isn't it?

965
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,503
"Sea-brook"
can handle it.

966
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,506
Yeah, but can rick?

967
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,688
I guess i really don't know what kind of captain he is.

968
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,777
He's doing fine.
Don't worry.

969
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:21,926
All this pounding,
it feels like we're just falling apart.

970
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:23,449
I'm gonna
go back up, ok?

971
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:38,246
"Sea-brook," "sea-brook,"
request to know your situation. Over.

972
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,595
Uh, roger, coast guard.

973
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:40,988
This is "sea-brook."

974
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:44,165
Um... my radar shows
the storm moving west.

975
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:47,168
I think
we're gonna be ok.

976
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,822
Seas are
pretty rough out here,

977
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,258
but i think we're
gonna make it.

978
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:52,217
We're heading into
san simeon. Over.

979
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,479
Roger, "sea-brook."

980
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:54,610
Glad to know
you're ok.

981
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:55,742
Coast guard out.

982
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,744
Roger. "Sea-brook" out.

983
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:59,920
Will you
file that report?

984
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:02,009
Come on, baby.

985
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:09,712
Oh... shee...

986
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:11,671
man, the owner's
gonna have rick's hide.

987
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:14,021
Well, at least she's
still floating.

988
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,763
Jason...

989
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,373
i was so scared
when...

990
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,202
i know.

991
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:22,334
Thank you.

992
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:23,596
[Beeeeep]

993
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,511
no. No, not again!

994
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:26,947
Oh, man.

995
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:30,037
Check the engine, rick.
Check the engine!

996
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,823
We need more sail.

997
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:35,782
Ok. I'll go let her out.
Can you hold her?

998
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:36,914
Yup.

999
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:44,399
Careful, susan.

1000
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:52,233
Ease her out slow.

1001
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,104
I'm trying.

1002
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:57,630
Slowly...

1003
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,066
i can't clear it.

1004
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,384
Aah!

1005
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,342
Jason! Help me!

1006
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:15,474
Susan!

1007
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,869
Jason!

1008
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:21,610
All right. Hold on.
Hold on.

1009
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:23,525
I got you. All right,
don't let go.

1010
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,440
Pick your feet up.

1011
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,659
I can't.

1012
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:28,966
You can. Come on.
There you go.

1013
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:31,098
Come on,
it's all right. I got you.

1014
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:33,144
I got you.
Hang on to me.

1015
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:35,407
Get up. Ok.

1016
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,538
All right.

1017
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,238
I'm ok.

1018
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:42,066
I'll finish
loading up the main.

1019
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:44,720
No, no. No, forget it.
The storm's too big.

1020
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:49,029
If we can't fix the engine,
we gotta call for help.

1021
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:01,999
You all right?

1022
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah.

1023
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,001
Huh? You ok?

1024
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,089
Yeah.

1025
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:15,664
Rick, what
are you doing?

1026
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:18,841
You're supposed to be fixing the engine, remember?

1027
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,582
Could you fix
the mainsail?

1028
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:22,062
I couldn't free it.

1029
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:26,197
That seals it.
We're done for.

1030
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,068
Rick, what about
the engine?

1031
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:31,202
Forget it.
We're screwed.

1032
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:33,552
Rick, get off your ass and start acting like a captain.

1033
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:36,337
Radio the coast guard
for help.

1034
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,078
The storm,
i think it's moving west.

1035
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,862
The hell it is.
We're right in the middle of it.

1036
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:42,952
If i call
the coast guard...

1037
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,737
i'll never work
again.

1038
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,173
What?

1039
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,306
You're sitting here thinking about your career?

1040
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:50,656
Rick, we're in trouble,
big trouble.

1041
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:51,961
We've got to call
the coast guard

1042
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,747
and pray we can hold on
till they get here.

1043
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,140
What was the name
of the vessel, ma'am?

1044
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,097
The "sea-brook."

1045
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:58,316
It's sailing
up to vancouver.

1046
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:00,057
I'm afraid it may be caught in this storm.

1047
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,450
Uh, ma'am, we are
very busy right now.

1048
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:04,104
But i'll see if i can
raise them on the radio.

1049
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,758
Call us back
in an hour, ok?

1050
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:07,499
Please. It's...
it's my daughter.

1051
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,892
We're gonna do our best.
I promise.

1052
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:19,032
Lieutenant, i just saw a report on the "sea-brook."

1053
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,555
It seems
they called in

1054
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,514
and said they were safely en route to san simeon.

1055
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:23,906
Good.

1056
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:31,566
Coast guard?

1057
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:34,874
Coast guard,
come in.

1058
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:37,268
Rick, i cannot
hold her alone!

1059
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:41,054
Aah!

1060
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,665
Oh, my god.

1061
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:45,276
Jason,
start the pumps!

1062
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,452
I can't get up!

1063
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:49,715
Matt! Matt,
we need you!

1064
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:50,672
Help allie.

1065
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,457
I'm getting
the life raft.

1066
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,285
Come on,
we gotta go!

1067
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:55,547
Aah!

1068
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,464
There's no power.
The pumps won't work.

1069
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:01,683
Mayday! Mayday!

1070
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:06,514
It hurts to walk!

1071
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:09,604
I'm popping the raft.
Abandon ship!

1072
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,215
We're sinking!
Mayday!

1073
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:15,175
Stay right here.
I gotta launch the zodiac.

1074
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,013
Aah! No!

1075
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:28,493
Uh...

1076
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:29,363
uh...

1077
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:33,802
jason, let's get outta here!
We're goin' down!

1078
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:39,765
Aah!

1079
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:41,245
Aah!

1080
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,036
Aah!

1081
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:54,997
Help!

1082
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,912
Somebody help me!

1083
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:02,527
Aah!

1084
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,664
It's ok, allie.

1085
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,665
Hold on...

1086
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:11,797
hold on.

1087
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:27,204
Ok, you're free.

1088
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:29,206
Swim away from
the boat. Hurry!

1089
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:52,403
Jason!

1090
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:55,232
Allie!

1091
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:07,766
Jason!

1092
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:10,116
Susan, over here!

1093
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,688
Over here!

1094
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:26,045
Where's allie
and jason?

1095
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:27,176
I don't know.

1096
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,917
Allie!

1097
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,528
Jason!

1098
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:31,920
Allie!

1099
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,444
Jason!

1100
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:38,318
Rick... rick!

1101
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:41,408
Over here, matt!
Over here!

1102
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,367
Over here!

1103
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,805
Over here, matt!

1104
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:50,330
Rick! Ohh...

1105
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,723
you ok, baby?

1106
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,290
My legs hurt.

1107
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,378
Hold on!

1108
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,385
Where's jason?

1109
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:02,690
I don't know.

1110
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:04,039
What happened
to the other raft?

1111
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,737
I couldn't
hold on to it.

1112
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,042
Jason!

1113
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:08,348
What do you mean,
you couldn't hold on to it?

1114
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,785
That had all our
emergency supplies.

1115
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,439
We're in the middle of
a storm here, remember?

1116
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:13,919
We're dead
without that stuff.

1117
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,181
Stop it!

1118
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:17,575
It's over!
It's all over!

1119
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,316
Shut up, rick!
Shut up!

1120
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,665
Jason!

1121
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:21,840
I can't hold on.

1122
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,277
Hold on, baby.
Just hold on.

1123
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,801
Let's flip the zodiac
and get in.

1124
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,978
Ok. We'll take the back.
You take the bow.

1125
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:32,503
All right.
That's a good idea.

1126
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,289
Ok, you ready?

1127
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,378
Hold on, baby.
Hold on.

1128
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,686
1... 2...

1129
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:42,817
3!

1130
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:46,691
[Screaming]

1131
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:54,394
come on, baby, swim!

1132
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:55,395
I can't...

1133
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:56,744
you can do it!

1134
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:11,585
Jason, thank god!

1135
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:13,326
I got caught.

1136
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,110
I got
dragged under.

1137
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:18,549
Ok, we got to
flip this and get in.

1138
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:20,551
It'll blow away again!

1139
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:22,335
We'll grab the line
over the leeward side

1140
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,293
and let the wind
turn it over.

1141
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:25,425
All right,
let's do it.

1142
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:29,168
Go! Go!
Out of the way!

1143
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:32,519
Go to the
other side, allie!

1144
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,745
Get ready to pull!

1145
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:44,139
Ok. I'm ready.
Go ahead.

1146
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:46,054
All right... aah!

1147
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,585
Give me your hand!

1148
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:56,064
Here!

1149
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,283
Give me it!

1150
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:15,083
Oh, my god...
your legs.

1151
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:16,781
It was the rigging.

1152
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,218
This wind
is so cold.

1153
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,828
It's killing me.

1154
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,091
I'm telling you,
we're better off in the water.

1155
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,484
He's right.
We should get back in.

1156
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,833
No!

1157
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:27,400
I can't.

1158
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,924
Maybe if we bunch up...
conserve body heat.

1159
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,883
Rick: it's too
cold out here.

1160
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:33,667
Please don't make me
get back in.

1161
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:34,668
Ok. We won't.

1162
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,061
Let's just stay close.

1163
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,500
It's over.

1164
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,980
I just
know it's over.

1165
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,111
Oh, shut up!

1166
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:44,896
Come on, guys, we
have to work together.

1167
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:47,202
It's our only hope
until we get rescued.

1168
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:50,162
Somebody must have
heard your mayday.

1169
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:51,772
They're not coming.

1170
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:52,773
Stop saying that!

1171
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,296
No, i mean,
they're not coming.

1172
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,081
I told them
not to come.

1173
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:57,648
What?
What?

1174
00:57:57,691 --> 00:58:00,477
I saw you talking... i mean,
before the boat went down.

1175
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,566
I tried. It was
waterlogged by then.

1176
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:04,002
Damn!

1177
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:06,134
We are gonna die.

1178
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:08,746
No. We're gonna survive.

1179
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,356
In the morning they'll
be looking for us.

1180
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:11,705
We can certainly
hold out till then.

1181
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:13,359
There are sharks
all through these waters.

1182
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,447
There's great whites.

1183
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,276
But we should be
safe in here.

1184
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:24,544
This is my fault.

1185
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:28,592
This is all my fault.

1186
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:47,393
Susan: when day
finally broke,

1187
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:49,569
what i saw scared me.

1188
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,919
Of course, our boat
was long gone...

1189
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:55,444
resting quietly on the bottom of the pacific ocean.

1190
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,359
Plus we had no supplies...

1191
00:58:57,403 --> 00:59:00,754
no food, no water,
and no captain.

1192
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,322
As rick had lost all hope,

1193
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:06,717
he had nothing to offer
in terms of leadership.

1194
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,894
Allie was in terrible pain,
trying hard to be rong,

1195
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:12,461
and matt was edgy
and quick-tempered.

1196
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:16,509
It was up to me and jason to keep everyone's spirits up.

1197
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,728
I was scared as hell.

1198
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:18,772
We need a cover.

1199
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:20,600
Jason...

1200
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,429
do we have anything
to make a canopy?

1201
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:24,561
Um...

1202
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,653
yeah. Um...

1203
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:40,707
this will work.

1204
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,317
Let's set it up,

1205
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:43,971
and then we can take
turns keeping watch

1206
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,538
until a ship comes.

1207
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:49,803
Hey...

1208
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:50,891
get up, guys.

1209
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:51,936
Help us ou

1210
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,459
we're gonna make a canopy.

1211
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:06,793
What are you doing?

1212
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:09,970
Stop. Don't drink that.
It'll make you crazy.

1213
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:12,016
A small amount
won't hurt.

1214
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,061
You're better off drinking your own urine.

1215
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:17,630
You drink what you want,
i'll drink what i want.

1216
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,415
Here you go, baby.
Have a little water.

1217
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:21,373
No!

1218
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:22,591
Damn it!
You little...

1219
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:23,854
aah!

1220
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:24,855
Stay away!

1221
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:26,421
Aah! Get off!

1222
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,206
Hey, what are
you doing?!

1223
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:30,077
Oh, man!

1224
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,342
It's ok.

1225
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:36,780
It's ok.
I'm fine.

1226
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,739
It's just my leg
hurts so bad. [Sobs]

1227
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:42,568
it's ok.

1228
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:45,919
It's ok, baby.

1229
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:53,579
Oh...

1230
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:57,801
oh... what have i done to my beautiful baby?

1231
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,324
What have i done?

1232
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,720
I've ruined
everything.

1233
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:13,860
At least the storm passed.

1234
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:22,521
Here comes the sun.

1235
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:13,920
I don't think i can stand
another night here.

1236
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,185
This is the last
one, allie.

1237
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:20,840
We'll be rescued
tomorrow.

1238
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:21,972
Really?

1239
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,235
Mm-hmm.

1240
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:27,978
Rick, do you think so?

1241
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:31,416
We don't need
to be rescued.

1242
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:32,373
I see shore.

1243
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,680
Where?

1244
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:35,986
Rick:
over there.

1245
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:41,295
We're off
mission bay.

1246
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:42,993
We're nowhere near
mission bay.

1247
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,951
Yes, we are.
I recognize the buildings.

1248
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,692
Are... are you sure?

1249
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:48,259
Rick, you're
seeing things.

1250
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:51,044
You've been drinking too much sea water.
You're confused.

1251
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:52,480
No, no, no.
It's there.

1252
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,656
Come on, buddy,
sit down.

1253
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,049
Sit down.

what are you doing?

1255

Rick, no!

don't leave me!

I gotta go
after him!

No, no!
It's pitch dark out there.

1261
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:13,066
You'd both be lost.
It's suicide.

i'm losing it.

No, no, you're not.

It was just a bad dream,
just a bad dream.

Ok. I'm ok now.

1272

We're all just so hungry and thirsty.

1273
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,439
It's ok to lean on me
a little bit, you know.

1274
01:05:21,482 --> 01:05:24,268
No, it's not.
We have to be strong.

1275
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:27,575
You can't be expected
to do it for both of us.

1276
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,927
This is not
a competition, susan.

1277
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:35,540
What's going on?

1278
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,194
Nothing, allie.
Go back to sleep.

cover you up, ok?

No, i don't
wanna wake up.

1282
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,207
I don't.

remember...

1284

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,966
i don't think
he made it.

Do you think
he made it?

No.

But we're still here.
We're gonna live through this.

1290
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:29,550
It just seems so much easier to die now...

01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:32,684
like he opened
the door.

1292
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,599
Rick didn't die.

1293
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:36,557
Allie, he killed
himself.

1294
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:43,042
Rick gave up when
the boat sank, allie.

1295
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,349
After that, all he
cared about was you.

1296
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:56,186

1302

My daughter could
be lost out there.

Listen, i understand
your concern,

1304
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:30,872
but we have no evidence
of any trouble.

1305
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:33,223
Now, last we heard,
they were headed north.

And i am telling you,
i know my daughter.

What seems to be
the problem?

1311
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:44,060
The trouble is my daughter's boat is missing.

1312
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,409
Everybody keeps saying her boat is safe,

It never arrived.
She would've called me.

1318

I understand,
but maybe she just forgot during all the confusion.

1319
01:07:58,204 --> 01:07:59,510
She didn't forget.

to risk her life

Matt, they sank with the boat, remember?

1331
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,041
No. I'm talking about
the other cigarettes.

What other cigarettes...

kill himself!

around her leg

01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,690
All right.
Just hold still for one second, ok?

1424
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:39,257
What are you...

1425
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,482
[gasps] oww!
Guys, get away from me!

1426
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:47,526
All right,
all right!

1427
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,659
Stop! Get off!

1428
01:14:49,702 --> 01:14:51,399
All right, all right!
It's off, it's off.

1429
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:52,444
All right.

1430
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,185
Don't touch me.

1431
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:56,317
It's ok,
it's ok, it's ok.

1432
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,452
[Sobbing]

1433
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:04,456
it's all right. It's over.
It's ok, it's ok.

1434
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,418
I'm just gonna play it real straight with you, mrs. Clarkson...

1435
01:15:10,462 --> 01:15:12,290
we cannot find any evidence

1436
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:16,163
that your daughter's boat
ever reached san simeon.

1437
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,730
And, uh...

1438
01:15:17,774 --> 01:15:20,820
what are you doing
to try to find her?

1439
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:24,868
We are checking every harbor and marina up the coast.

1440
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:28,349
We have a watch alert out to all vessels in the area.

1441
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:30,177
Uh, what about airplanes, helicopters?

1442
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:31,962
We're considering
that, too.

1443
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:33,746
Considering isn't
enough, damn it!

1444
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,706
You just get the hell out there and find her!

1445
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,843
2-way radio: point reyes,
this is coast guard 1503,

1446
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:47,455
on scene,
commencing papa-sierra search at minute 0-8.

1447
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:50,458
Major axis is
1-3-5 degrees true.

1448
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:53,200
Tracking space
is 5 miles...

1449
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:16,310
ah... ahh... ohh...

1450
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,922
so hot. There's no breeze.
There's no nothing.

1451
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:21,315
Let's get in the water
and cool off.

1452
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:23,187
Come on, susan,
come on. No, you can't.

1453
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:24,580
No, i have to cool off.

1454
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:28,322
Susan, stop it.
Come on, stop. Stop!

1455
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,934
What... what
are you doing?

1456
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:33,545
Please, you can't...
you can't leave me here.

1457
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,765
We're not going
anywhere, allie.

1458
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:55,393
Look... look.

1459
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,322
Ah! Ha ha!

1460
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,367
I caught one!
I caught it!

1461
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:15,413
Ha ha ha ha!

1462
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:16,936
What's going on?

1463
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:19,809
We caught a fish.
We got something to eat.

1464
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:23,987
Heh heh.
Oh... oh.

1465
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:30,558
Ok. All right.

1466
01:17:32,996 --> 01:17:34,519
There. Here.

1467
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:36,260
Give some
to allie, first.

1468
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:38,088
Yeah, yeah.
Here, allie. No.

1469
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:39,524
Yeah, come on.
It'll help.

1470
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,221
Protein will fight the infection.

1471
01:17:41,265 --> 01:17:42,353
I can't.

1472
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:45,486
Here. Let me try.

1473
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:51,405
Come on, allie,
just a bite.

1474
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:05,811
No.

1475
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,383
What was that
back there?

1476
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:15,125
I don't know.
I just...

1477
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:18,345
i woke up and i just remembered wanting to cool off.

1478
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:20,347
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.

1479
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:22,306
You are determined

1480
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:24,656
to go through this alone,
aren't you, susan?

1481
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,223
No, but i pull
my own weight...

1482
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:29,705
damn it, susan.
Haven't you seen enough dying

1483
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:31,054
on this raft?

1484
01:18:31,097 --> 01:18:33,621
We need to help
each other, susan.

1485
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,061
Don't you
understand...

1486
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:42,021
that it's ok
to need each other?

1487
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:46,156
I know.

1488
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,776
[Thunder]

1489
01:19:05,349 --> 01:19:06,742
ah!

1490
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:08,526
Wake up, wake up.
It's raining.

1491
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:09,745
Come on, allie,
drink.

1492
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:12,008
Oh! Ahh! Yes!

1493
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,801
Oh, no.
No.

1494
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:31,288
It's time to go.

1495
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:33,464
What?

1496
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:35,727
Where?

1497
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,774
Home.

1498
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,865
Time to go home.

1499
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,652
Come here, allie.
Lie with me.

1500
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:50,960
Come on. Shh.

1501
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:56,792
It's ok.
It's time to go.

1502
01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:03,494
Allie, can you
hear me?

1503
01:20:03,537 --> 01:20:06,366
[Humming melody]

1504
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:12,329
what is it?

1505
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:16,681
She's slipping away.

1506
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:24,341
[Whispering] the lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want...

1507
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:27,561
i can't tell
what she's saying.

1508
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:31,914
Maybe she's...

1509
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:33,045
yeah...

1510
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:36,614
talking to god.

1511
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:45,666
Our father,
who art in heaven,

1512
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,538
hallowed by thy name.

1513
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,888
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

1514
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:52,848
on earth as it is
in heaven.

1515
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:58,027
[Sobbing] give us this day
our daily bread...

1516
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:28,405
she would've made it
if she hadn't been hurt.

1517
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:31,495
She was strong.
She didn't deserve to die this way.

1518
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,897
I can't believe
she's gone.

1519
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:46,466
She had this
in her pocket.

1520
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:56,041
Rest in peace,
allie.

1521
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:14,320
[Grunting]

1522
01:22:19,108 --> 01:22:20,979
jason, stop.

1523
01:22:21,023 --> 01:22:24,156
No, no, let go.
It's not what you think.

1524
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,943
Sorry. I thought you were
drinking sea water.

1525
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,903
I can't stop throwing up.

1526
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,731
Well, that's...
that's a good sign.

1527
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:35,472
Your body's getting
rid of the toxins.

1528
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:39,563
No, not anymore.
It just dry heaves now.

1529
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:40,956
It hurts.

1530
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:44,829
I'm sorry, susan.

1531
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:46,135
Sorry? About what?

1532
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:49,268
I know how much
you hate weakness.

1533
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:52,750
I just hate feeling like my life is out of control.

1534
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:55,927
Does that make
any sense?

1535
01:22:57,146 --> 01:22:59,975
About as much sense
as any of this makes.

1536
01:23:05,371 --> 01:23:07,069
I'm scared, susan.

1537
01:23:09,419 --> 01:23:12,335
I'm scared i'm gonna die
on this godforsaken raft.

1538
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:15,816
Stop it.
Don't you dare give up on me, ok?

1539
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,557
We're gonna live
through this.

1540
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:20,604
And i'm trying.
I'm trying.

1541
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:21,561
I'm just, you know...

1542
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:22,823
well, try harder.

1543
01:23:22,867 --> 01:23:24,129
It hurts so bad.

1544
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:27,045
Look, we're gonna
make it, ok?

1545
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,139
I need you
to try harder.

1546
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:36,707
Really?

1547
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,101
Yeah, really.

1548
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:14,179
Did you hear something?

1549
01:24:14,223 --> 01:24:16,051
[Distant engine rumbling]

1550
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:45,167
susan: when i finally
saw the ship,

1551
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,038
i thought it was a mirage.

1552
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,389
I was just losing it again.

1553
01:24:50,433 --> 01:24:53,131
There was no way we were
really being rescued.

1554
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:56,395
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!

1555
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:58,658
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1556
01:24:58,702 --> 01:25:01,618
[Horn blowing]

1557
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:04,795
ah, ha ha ha!

1558
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:07,450
Susan:
then i heard jason...

1559
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,452
and the excitement
in his voice,

1560
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:11,323
and figured we couldn't both be dreaming.

1561
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:12,803
They found
a raft.

1562
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:14,021
Oh, thank god!

1563
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:16,633
They still have to get them both on board.

1564
01:25:16,676 --> 01:25:18,417
Both? A man?
A woman? Who?

1565
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,027
I don't know
for sure.

1566
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:21,072
They're
on board.

1567
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,639
Who?

1568
01:25:22,682 --> 01:25:24,554
Young man... and
a young woman.

1569
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:29,254
Jason o'donnell...
and susan clarkson.

1570
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:30,386
Ha ha ha!

1571
01:25:30,429 --> 01:25:32,170
Thank you!
Oh, thank you, thank you!

1572
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:33,737
Thank you
so much!

1573
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:35,973
[Car approaching]

1574
01:26:37,714 --> 01:26:38,541
ah!

1575
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:42,545
Oh...

1576
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:53,947
susan:
it wasn't until later

1577
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:55,949
that i realized
what my mom did.

1578
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:57,516
Susannah.

1579
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,085
She refused to give up,
and she helped save our lives.

1580
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,481
I guess, in a way,
jason and my mom

1581
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:08,614
were both trying to teach me the same thing...

1582
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:12,270
there's nothing wrong
with needing people.

1583
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:16,709
That's what makes us strong,
that's what makes us human,

1584
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:18,711
and that's why
i'm alive today.
