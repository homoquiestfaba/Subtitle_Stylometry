[jazzy music]

4
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
- What do you want?

5
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
- [Lefty] I just, I
wanna talk to you, Becky.

6
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,600
- I told you I didn't
wanna see you anymore.

7
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,160
- Come on, babe, you
didn't mean that.

8
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,120
We're in love.

9
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,880
- I gotta go, my parents
are expecting me for dinner.

10
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
[door slams shut]

11
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,520
- I'll come with you.
- No.

12
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,400
How many times do we have
to go through this, Lefty?

13
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
And things just didn't
work out between us,

14
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
and now it's over.

15
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,240
I thought you understood.

16
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,560
- Yes, I understand, you
think you're better than me.

17
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
You always did.

18
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
- That's not true.

19
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,160
I just don't love you.

20
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,440
Why can't you accept
that and leave me alone?

21
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,280
- Not till I'm ready.

22
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,120
[Becky gasps]
[dramatic music]

23
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,280
- Don't you ever
come here again!

24
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,400
If you do, I'm gonna
call the police!

25
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,120
- Becky, come back.

26
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,080
I'm sorry.

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
[crickets chirping]

28
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
[laughing]
- Oh, Becky.

29
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
- A toast to our
wonderful daughter

30
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,000
who's not only had her first
novel fast-track published

31
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,600
to great critical acclaim.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,240
- Thank you, thank you.
- But has sold said novel

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
as a five-hour miniseries, hear,
hear.

34
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,720
- Television, oh, well.

35
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,480
- Whoever said there's no
business like show business

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
wasn't kidding, you're gonna
learn that, sweetheart.

37
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,320
- I already know, Dad.

38
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,760
I had to listen to
your war stories

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,920
about how the studios abuse
us writers all my life.

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
- Most of which he made up,
Becky.

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
- I know that too, Mom.
- All right, all right.

42
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Enough about my trials
and tribulations.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,520
- I'd like to make a toast.

44
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,840
To my mom for giving me life,

45
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
courage, and the strength
to survive any situation.

46
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,320
And to my dad for his support,
belief, and inspiration.

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
I love you both very much.

48
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,320
[glasses clinking]

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,280
- Well, I always seem to be
the one to call it an evening,

50
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,160
but I really am rather tired.

51
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
- [Dad] I'll get your chair.

52
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,160
- You're gonna ask Dad
to tuck you in tonight?

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
- Oh, those days are over,
my sweet.

54
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,200
And even when we were married,

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
I always preferred
sleeping alone.

56
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,960
- Liar.
[Mom chuckles]

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
- What about you, honey?

58
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,480
You're not still seeing
that guitarist, are you?

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
- No, Mom, I told you.

60
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
I broke up with him.
- Oh.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,520
- Well, I'm glad to hear
it, you deserve better.

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
- You've said that about
every guy I've ever dated.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
- And all of us know
I'm never wrong.

64
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,880
- Oh, yes, Gus, and that's
certainly true.

65
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
- Need some help?
[Becky chuckling]

66
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
- Immaculata will
take care of me.

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,960
Now call me soon, both of you.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
Goodnight.

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,560
- Goodnight, Peach.
- Goodnight, Mom.

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
- Wanna walk your old
man to his car?

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
- Only if you'll do
the same for me.

72
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,600
[gentle instrumental music]

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
- [Gus] You all right
about this breakup?

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
- [Becky] I'm fine, Dad.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,080
It took me a while
but I found out

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
I really didn't love
him after all.

77
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
- Well, I'm proud of you, Becky.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,120
You've turned into a wonderful
woman and a terrific writer.

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
- [Becky] It was easy.

80
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm my father's
daughter after all.

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
- Ah, thank you.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Drive carefully, huh?
- I will.

83
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
- Goodnight, darling.

84
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
- Goodnight, Dad.

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
[suspenseful music]

86
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,320
[doorbell ringing]

87
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
- [Gus] Who is it?

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,160
- [Detective Jackson] Mr.
Augustus Bailey?

89
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,360
- [Gus] Yes.

90
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,840
- [Detective Jackson]
Detective Jackson, LAPD.

91
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,360
I'd like to talk to you, sir.

92
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,840
- What's the problem?

93
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
- [Detective Jackson] I'm sorry
to have disturbed you, sir,

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,680
but I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,400
You have a daughter,
Rebecca Lee Bailey,

96
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,440
living at 235 West Hayden
Avenue in West Los Angeles?

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,600
- Yes.

98
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Dear God, she hasn't been
in a car crash, has she?

99
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
- No, sir.

100
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this,

101
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,560
but your daughter is dead.

102
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
It appears she was murdered.

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,040
- That can't be.

104
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
I was with her two hours ago.

105
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,720
Has to be a mistake.

106
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
- A neighbor reported
hearing screams

107
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
coming from inside your
daughter's apartment.

108
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,720
Our officers investigated
and found the body.

109
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
- No.

110
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,720
[dramatic music]

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,680
No.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Not Becky.

113
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
No, please.

114
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
Not Becky.

115
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,400
- I'll need you to make an
identification, Mr. Bailey.

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,920
- Yes.

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,480
But I hope to God you're wrong.

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,320
You have to be wrong.

119
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,280
- We have a suspect in custody,
sir.

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
- Who?

121
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,160
- [Detective Jackson] Francis
Flint, also known as Lefty.

122
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,720
- I don't believe you.

123
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,440
- The police took me to see her.

124
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
- How did it happen?

125
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
- They are not sure.

126
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,680
- How did she die, Gus?

127
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,880
- She was murdered.

128
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Strangled

129
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,600
by Lefty Flint.

130
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
- Oh, God.

131
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,240
Dear God.

132
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Not my child.

133
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Not my baby.

134
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,440
What do we do, Gus?

135
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
What do we do now?

136
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,480
- We make sure Flint goes away

137
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
for the rest of his damned life.

138
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,160
- A formal arrest has been made

139
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,560
in connection with last
night's brutal slaying

140
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,120
of Becky Bailey,
successful novelist

141
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,120
and daughter of writer Augustus
Bailey and his ex-wife,

142
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,840
socialite Peach
Prindible Bailey.

143

Francis Lefty Flint

144
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,080
has been charged with
murder in the first degree.

145
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Flint, entertainer at a
Malibu restaurant

146
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,080
and estranged boyfriend
of the victim,

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,400
has admitted to committing
the violent crime,

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
and his trial is expected
to begin shortly.

149
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
[dramatic news music]

150
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,680
Until tomorrow, this is
Bernard Slatkin for Focus

151
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
on special assignment.

152
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,440
- Honey, we gotta go.

153
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,440
The van to the
airport's waiting.

154
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,000
- [Anchorman] Thank you,
Bernard.

155
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,240
- I'm sorry, I was
watching something on TV.

156
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
- [Friend] Ruby, are
you all right?

157
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,200
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

158
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
- I have.

159
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
[solemn music]

160
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,320
- The night Peach gave
birth to Becky,

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,760
I remember thinking for
the first time

162
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
about my own mortality.

163
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,960
Suddenly my life became
more precious

164
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
because of that beautiful child.

165
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,080
I had to live long enough
to ensure her happiness.

166
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,360
I wanted to catch her

167
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
when she tried to take
her first steps.

168
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,040
I wanted to teach her how
to ride a bike,

169
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,760
dribble a basketball.

170
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
I wanted to introduce
her to the power of words

171
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,960
and watch her discover
the magic of love.

172
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,720
I wanted to walk her down the
aisle into a loving marriage.

173
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,640
And I wanted to hold her
first child and feel renewed.

174
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,680
Most of all,

175
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,640
I wanted to protect Becky

176
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,640
from any kind of harm.

177
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
Goodbye, my darling daughter.

178
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,000
- Peach.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm so sorry.

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
Gus.

181
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,520
- Thanks for coming, Faye.

182
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
- She's the daughter
I never had.

183
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,800
When Becky was seven,
eight years old,

184
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
you brought her to the
set of Memphis Belle,

185
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,840
do you remember that?

186
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,200
- Hmm.

187
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,080
- She told me that I should
read her father's lines

188
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,200
exactly as they were written.

189
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,240
And if I did, she promised me

190
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,640
that she would someday
write a movie for me.

191
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,120
You know, because of
that promise,

192
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,680
I never changed a
word you wrote.

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
[suspenseful music]

194
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,840
[reporters clamoring]

195
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,880
- Winding up what has been
a lengthy and heated trial,

196
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,640
Francis Lefty Flint, admitted
killer of Becky Bailey,

197
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,640
has just arrived at the
Santa Monica courthouse.

198
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
Flint's attorney has announced

199
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,280
that his client will take
the stand today

200
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,160
and testify on his own behalf.

201
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,520
And now I see Becky's
parents have arrived.

202
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,640
Peach Prindible Bailey herself
the victim of our cruel fate,

203
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,000
paralyzed after being thrown
from a horse five years ago.

204
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
And Augustus Bailey,

205
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
the noted Hollywood
screenwriter and journalist.

206
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,120
- Becky told me that her
parents didn't approve of me,

207
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,800
so I thought I'd make
it easy on her

208
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,400
and I told her that
maybe it would be better

209
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,040
if we didn't see one
another for a while.

210
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
- Are you saying that
you're the one

211
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,480
who ended this relationship?

212
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,000
- Yes, sir.

213
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
Not because I didn't love Becky,
I did.

214
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,400
Because I knew it would
be better for her

215
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,880
with me out of her life.

216
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,040
- And why were you at Becky
Bailey's apartment that night?

217
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,680
- Becky called me.

218
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
She said she missed me,
that she wanted to see me,

219
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,840
and that she didn't care what
her parents thought anymore.

220
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,160
- [Prosecutor] So you
went to Becky's apartment

221
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
at her request?
- Yes.

222
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,000
When I arrived, she asked
me to spend the night,

223
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,640
but I told her I didn't
think it would be right.

224
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,960
Without her parents blessing,

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,440
it would make the love we felt
for each other dirty, unholy.

226
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,080
So I started to leave,

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,680
and Becky got hysterical.

228
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,200
She started screaming
saying that if I left,

229
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,760
she'd do something crazy,
maybe even kill herself.

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,280
I tried to calm her down,

231
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,880
but she just kept hitting me,
you know,

232
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,400
just over and over again.

233
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,960
I just wanted her to stop.

234
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,720
I loved Becky.

235
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,800
I never meant to hurt her.

236
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,160
- But you did hurt
Becky Bailey, Mr. Flint.

237
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,040
You silenced her screams forever

238
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,040
and you used your hands
as your weapon.

239
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,080
[spectators murmuring]
[dramatic music]

240
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,920
- It is the judgment
of this court

241
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,080
that the defendant
Francis Flint,

242
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,240
having been found guilty of
the crime of manslaughter

243
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,480
by the jury of this court

244
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,360
for the City of Santa Monica,
California,

245
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,160
be imprisoned for a period
of three years.

246
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,560
[spectators gasping]

247
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,240
However, it is also the
court's judgment

248
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,080
that since the defendant
has no previous convictions,

249
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,600
he be allowed a parole hearing

250
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,120
after serving 1 1/2 years
of his sentence.

251
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,000
[spectators protesting]

252
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,440
The defendant will herewith
be remanded to the custody.

253
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,240
[hammer banging]

254
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,080
[reporters clamoring]

255
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,000
- You think you got a
fair sentence?

256
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,800
- God's on your side.

257
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,120
- [Woman] God will punish you!

258
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,920
- Mr. Flint, Mr. Flint.

259
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,120
Is there anything
you'd like to say

260
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,560
to Becky's parents, Mr. Flint?

261
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
- I just hope they
can forgive me.

262
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,320
God has.

263
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,600
- [Woman] God will
never forgive you!

264
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,480
- [Man] God loves you!

265
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,200
- [Man] You'll burn in hell!

266
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
[solemn music]

267
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
- Something else I can
do for you Mr. Renthal?

268
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,600
- Yes, you could sit down
and talk to me.

269
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
I can't ever seem to fall asleep

270
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,680
on these damn red-eye flights.

271
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,120
- Well, maybe for just a minute.

272
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
I thought people like you
never flew commercial,

273
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,200
Mr. Renthal, private
jets and all.

274
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
- It's Elias, and you
shouldn't believe

275
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,840
everything you read
in newspapers.

276
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm just an average
guy from Chicago

277
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,120
who's made a little money.

278
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
- Oh, I guess that's why

279
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,200
you're on the cover of Wall
Street Magazine this week.

280
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,560
- Where are you from?

281
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,360
- Someplace I just fly over now.

282
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,240
- Married?

283
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,640
- Never.

284
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,160
- I used to be.

285
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,080
My ex-wife said she didn't
want to stay with a guy

286
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,800
who had no class.

287
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,160
But, hell, you could buy that.

288
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
You got enough money, you
can buy anything you want.

289
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,160
- Yeah, you can even
erase the past,

290
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,600
become somebody important,
you know, admired.

291
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Forget all the bad things
that ever happened to you.

292
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,720
- [Elias] Did those happen?

293
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
- Not to people like me.

294
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,440
- I can make it happen for you.

295
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,680
- Oh, I'm sorry, Elias, Mr.
Renthal,

296
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,160
but I gotta get back to work.

297
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,120
I'll see you later.

298
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,440
- [Woman] There you go.

299
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,400
- [Gus] Hi.

300
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
- [Peach] Hi.

301
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
- My plane leaves in a
couple of hours.

302
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,880
Just came over to say goodbye.

303
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
- You sure you want to
move to New York?

304
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,000
I remember a time

305
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,640
when you couldn't wait
to get to Hollywood.

306
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,720
- Well, it's not popular

307
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,240
to write movies about
people anymore.

308
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Only a lot of chases,
special effects,

309
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,720
and I have to make a living.

310
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,640
- What are you gonna
do in New York?

311
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,880
- I have a few appointments
with a couple of magazines.

312
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,280
Besides, there's no reason to
hang around here any longer.

313
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,560
- Oh.

314
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,040
[gentle instrumental music]

315
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,880
- I'm proud of you,

316
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
the way you've gotten
through all this.

317
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,480
- I'm proud of you too.

318
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
You'll miss your plane.

319
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,280
- Yeah.

320
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,160
It's not over yet, Becky.

321
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
I promise you.

322
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,560
It's not over.

323
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,760
[gentle instrumental music]

324
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,760
Good evening, Charlie.

325
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,160
- Good evening, Mr. Bailey.

326
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,800
[guests chattering]
[laughing]

327
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,400
- What I simply cannot
stand is to be bored.

328
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,720
And there's never
anything boring

329
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,160
with the doers of the world.

330
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
- [Man] That's just
what I was going to say.

331
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
- Thank you.

332
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,120
- Hello, Gus.
[laughing]

333
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Aren't you glad you're
away from California?

334
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,480
Such a synchronicity of
theme at dinner, the movies.

335
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,880
The people are so superficial
and such frauds. [chuckling]

336
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,840
- Well, we couldn't accuse
anyone who comes to your parties

337
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,360
of being like that, could we,
Maisie?

338
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,680
- Well, my parties
aren't about people, Gus.

339
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,800
My parties are about
conversation.

340
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,520
After coming here for a year,
you should understand that.

341
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
Oh, excuse me, I see,
Senator Marx.

342
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,600
- Hello, Gus.

343
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,960
- Hello, Justine.

344
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,880
You look beautiful.

345
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,360
How's Lil?

346
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,040
- Oh, well, Mother is
Mother, always the same.

347
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,560
Tell me, Gus, do you
know that man over there?

348
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,280
Talking to Violet Bastito?

349
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
- That's Bernie Slatkin,
anchorman for Focus.

350
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,080
- That's where I've seen him.

351
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,480
Do you know him?

352
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
- We've met.

353
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,400
- You're sitting under the
Renoir next to Senator Marx.

354
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,120
Ezzie, I'm sitting you
next to Mrs. Renthal.

355
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,600
- Mrs. Renthal, the wife
of the hamburger king

356
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
who's in all the newspapers?

357
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
How dare you waste me
next to her.

358
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
- Oh, Ezzie, try to be nice.

359
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
This is the Renthals first
New York party,

360
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
and I want them to feel at home.

361
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,040
- Well, I'm sure they will,

362
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,040
as long as they keep
buying your paintings.

363
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,120
[Maisie scoffs]

364
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,520
- Now, Ezzie, you know
perfectly well

365
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,840
that Maisie Verdurin has
a genius for seating.

366
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,600
She absolutely agonizes
over her placement.

367
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,520
Besides which, had you
bothered to read my column

368
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,520
yesterday morning, you would
know that Elias Renthal

369
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,840
is the man to watch.

370
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,880
He made all those millions
in the past eight years

371
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,400
from hamburger franchises
to company takeovers, dear.

372
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,400
- Still say the only
respectable way to make money

373
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
is to inherit it.

374
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,800
And you can put that in
your column, sweetie.

375
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,600
- We're all wrong for
this crowd, Elias.

376
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,720
- Don't kid yourself, baby.

377
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
Once these people get
to know us--

378
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,680
- They'll ask us to leave.

379
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
- Oh.

380
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,080
I'd just about given you two up.

381
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
- I'm sorry we're so late.

382
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't think you've
met my wife Ruby.

383
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,040
- Oh, I'm so pleased
to meet you.

384
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,760
- Thank you for inviting us.

385
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,120
- Hey.

386
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,200
- Oh, is that the painting
you wanted me to see, Elias?

387
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
- Yes, Monet's Water Lilies.

388
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,920
- Well, that is the
color pink I like.

389
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
- Maisie, I think you got
yourself a sale.

390
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,840
Go ahead, baby, take
a closer look.

391
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,680
- Oh, no, uh,

392
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,880
I want you to see the picture,

393
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,480
but the waiters are just
about to serve.

394
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,720
- You got the right idea,
Maisie, honey.

395
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
[Maisie giggling]

396
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,400
Never do business on an empty
stomach, huh? [laughing]

397
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,480
- Elias, I have you
sitting next to me,

398
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
and you are sitting with
Ezzie Fenwick,

399
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,600
who's the best friend of
all the ladies in New York.

400
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,480
- Great.

401
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,640
- It's been a long time, Mr.
Bailey.

402
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,160
Bernie Slatkin.
- Gus.

403
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,640
I always wanted to thank you,

404
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,520
the way you handled your news
coverage about my daughter.

405
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,840
You're the only reporter
who didn't exploit our loss.

406
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,000
- I just tried to put
myself in your shoes.

407
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,400
That made it hard to
be objective.

408
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,320
- [Gus] Well, we appreciated
your sensitivity.

409
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,440
- Gus, be a dear, give
us some advice.

410
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,920
I've decided to take
up reading as a hobby.

411
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
Could you recommend
something with short chapters

412
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,720
about rich people?

413
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,880
- What about Trollope?

414
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,080
- Excuse me?

415
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,640
- I think he means the
author, Anthony Trollope.

416
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,760
- Can I take him home?

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,360
Or will he keep me up all night?

418
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,320
- I hate to read in bed.

419
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,200
- So do I.

420
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,360
[laughing]

421
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,520
- Just look at that
Renthal woman.

422
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,040
She absolutely won't do.

423
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,160
Dress like she's going

424
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
to the opening of the
opera in Istanbul.

425
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,040
As you must be having
a field day.

426
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
- Where did you get that dress?

427
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,720
- [Ruby] Chicago.

428
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
- [Ezzie] I thought so.

429
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
Why on earth did you ever leave?

430
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
- Well, Elias's
business is here now.

431
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,760
- Your husband's not
quite as imposing

432
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
as I thought he'd be, Mrs.
Renthal.

433
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,480
- Well, my husband can
be very imposing

434
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,400
when he opens his wallet, Mr.
Fenwick.

435
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,360
- Goodnight, Bernie.

436
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
- Goodnight, Gus.

437
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
- Mr. Bailey?

438
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
- My friends call me Gus.

439
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,720
- My name is Ruby Nolte Renthal.

440
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,400
I want to talk to you
privately for a moment.

441
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,120
- [Gus] What about?

442
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,000
- I just wanted to tell
you how sorry I am

443
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,280
about what happened to
your daughter.

444
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,840
- Thank you.

445
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
- I wish I could have
done something for her.

446
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,080
- You sound like you knew Becky.

447
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,000
- No, no, I didn't.

448
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,560
You don't always have to
know a person to feel sorry.

449
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,440
- [Elias] No, thanks, I'm
sure I'll find her, thanks.

450
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,360
- Maybe you and I could
have lunch together sometime

451
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
and just talk.

452
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,760
- [Gus] I'd like that.

453
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
- So would I, very much.

454
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
- What the hell is
going on in here?

455
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,680
- Just getting my coat, Elias.

456
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,320
- Maisie wants us to look at
that picture again up close.

457
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,840
- Elias, this is
Augustus Bailey.

458
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,720
He wrote that article
you like so much

459
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,920
on Laurance Van Degan
in the Knickerbocker.

460
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,040
- Pleased to meet you.
- Same.

461
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,680
And nice meeting you, Mrs.
Renthal.

462
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,400
- [Ruby] My friends
call me Ruby.

463
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,760
- Guy's old enough to
be your father.

464
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,640
- You're old enough to
be my father.

465
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,600
- What the hell is this?

466
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,120
We go to our first
New York party

467
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
and I find you in the
bedroom with--

468
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,640
- The coats.

469
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,960
Calm down, Mr. Bailey
writes about rich people.

470
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
- Like us?

471
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,120
- Us, I love that word.

472
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,400
- Well, we made it through
the first party

473
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,960
without anyone asking
us to leave.

474
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,680
- Oh, we haven't made it
to the door yet.

475
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,720
Will we ever fit in
with this crowd, Elias?

476
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,920
- No problem.

477
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,320
We're important people now,
a team,

478
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,920
and don't you ever forget that.

479
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,920
- I love you, Elias.

480
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
- Same here.

481
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,360
Now, let's go look at
that $6 million Monet

482
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
and make sure it's the
right color pink.

483
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
[coins rattling]

484
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
- They shouldn't allow this.

485
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,240
- You give him anything?

486
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
- It's hard to pretend
you have no money

487
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
when you're climbing
into a limousine.

488
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,840
- Oh, let's go to The
Carlyle hear Bobby Short.

489
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
- Would you like a ride
home, Miss Altemus?

490
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,120
- No, thank you, I have
a driver and a car.

491
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
Actually, it's my mother's car.

492
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,720
- Well, maybe you'd like
to give me a ride home.

493
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,880
- Well, my driver doubles
as my bodyguard.

494
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,440
- Only my thoughts
will be impure.

495
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,880
[Justine chuckles]

496
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Do you like it?

497
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,720
My place, I mean.

498
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,320
- Actually, no.

499
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,080
I know that I look crestfallen.

500
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,320
I've been brought up
on Empire sofas

501
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,240
and the neoclassic look as
dictated by Cora Mandell.

502
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,480
- [Bernie] Who's Cora Mandell?

503
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,360
- Well, the doyenne
of decorators.

504
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,040
- Is that what you do
for a living, decorating?

505
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,160
Or don't you work?

506
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,680
- I'm very involved
with several charities.

507
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,360
And one day a week, I work at
a hospital as a nurse's aide.

508
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,520
- Sounds strenuous.

509
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,760
When do you find time to relax?

510
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,920
- I'm here now, aren't I?

511
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,120
In that cab, that is what
you offered me.

512
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,560
[gentle instrumental music]

513
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,680
It's not what I was expecting.

514
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,960
- Are you sure?

515
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,760
- [Woman] They must be
here already.

516
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
- [Man] Mm-hmm.
[speaks faintly]

517
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,200
- [Woman] Nevel is so much
cleverer than Claude Montana.

518
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,120
- I don't wanna miss a minute.
- Oh, neither do I.

519
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,760
[exciting pop music]

520
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,240
[audience applauding]

521
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,800
- Thanks for meeting me, Ezzie.

522
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,120
I've never been to a
show like this before.

523
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
I'm used to buying off the rack.

524
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,040
- Never, not even in
an emergency.

525
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,520
It's better to stay home
than to be seen in rags.

526
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,040
- Oh, and I thought they
called it the rag business.

527
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,120
- It's how much you pay for the
rag that makes a difference.

528
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,040
The Nevel is very expensive.

529
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,800
- Isn't that Lil Altemus?

530
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,080
- Yes, she's matriarch of
all those gurus.

531
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,320
- Oh, I always read about
her in the society columns.

532
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,400
She has such style.

533
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,920
[camera shutter clicking]

534
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,880
- Which one do you like?

535
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
- I'm not sure.

536
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,760
[camera shutter clicking]
[audience applauding]

537
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,680
Oh, I think I like this one.

538
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,040
Yes, may I borrow your
pen for a moment?

539
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,240
- I know everyone's secrets,
Ruby.

540
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,560
- I bet you do.

541
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,240
- I'll tell you some of Lil's.

542
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,360
Her husband, Hubert,

543
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
left her for a much, much
younger woman.

544
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,800
You know, age before beauty.

545
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,960
- [Ruby] Oh, you're terrible.

546
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,480
- Oh, you love it.

547
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
- [Gus] You look great, Ruby.

548
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,320
- Very Lil Altemus,
don't you think?

549
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,440
- Very, if that's what you want.

550
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,600
- Well, it's important
for me to fit in here.

551
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,680
It's different for you, Gus.

552
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,360
You come from money,
you're used to it.

553
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
- Are you kidding?

554
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,600
Peach had all the credentials.

555
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm strictly middle-class.

556
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,720
- Well, I'm not even that.

557
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
I grew up on a ranch in Montana.

558
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
Well, not really a ranch,

559
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,840
was more like a shack with
a few chickens.

560
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,640
And a mother who didn't give
a damn about fashion or me.

561
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,760
But you seem so comfortable
around those people, Gus.

562
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,160
I'm sure in the hell not.

563
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,440
- Well, maybe it's
because I don't care

564
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,360
what they think about me,
and you do.

565
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,240
- Well, if you don't care,
then why do you bother?

566
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,920
- It's a distraction.

567
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,160
Keeps my mind off worse things.

568
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,280
Now look, Ruby, I work
for a magazine

569
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,280
that caters to those people.

570
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,960
They invite me because I
write articles about them.

571
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,960
The rich love to read
about themselves.

572
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,400
Otherwise, I
wouldn't be invited.

573
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,800
- Well, there's no
harm in mingling.

574
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,160
- Just as long as you
don't join the club.

575
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,920
Believe me, all they care about

576
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
is the money you donate
to their charities,

577
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
not at all in who you are.

578
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,360
I don't want you to get hurt.

579
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,920
- Well, thanks for the warning.

580
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,400
[sighing]

581
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,400
Artichokes, they're so ugly.

582
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,960
I guess the only thing you
can do with them is eat them.

583
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,320
- Hmm.

584
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,040
One year, my daughter made a
Christmas wreath out of them.

585
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,120
Didn't look bad.

586
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,920
And after about a week,
started to smell.

587
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,120
But Becky was so proud of it,
we kept it up until Easter.

588
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,800
- You must miss her terribly.

589
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,760
I'm sorry, Gus, maybe you
don't wanna talk about this.

590
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,000
- There was a time that
that's all I talked about.

591
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
[sad music]

592
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
I mean, all I can do
what my anger

593
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,640
was to scream at everyone
about anything.

594
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
Then I stopped talking about it.

595
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
I felt no one cared.

596
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,600
As far as everyone else
was concerned,

597
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,560
justice had been done.

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,160
The subject was closed.

599
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,280
- But your anger
hasn't gone away.

600
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,200
- No, it hasn't.

601
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,200
I don't think it ever will.

602
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,680
- You take all your dates
to such fancy places?

603
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,120
- [Bernie] You're the first.

604
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,120
Mikey.

605
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,040
- I haven't seen you for
a while, Bernie.

606
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,200
Seems like you've been
spending your time uptown.

607
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,920
- Mike, I'd like you to
meet Justine Altemus.

608
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,520
Justine, this is Mike O'Rourke.

609
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,760
He owns this dump.
- Hello, Mike.

610
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,880
- Glad to meet ya.

611
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,480
But tell me, what's a
nice girl like you

612
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,840
doing with a bum like this?

613
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,080
- Obviously trying to
change my image.

614
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,240
- Well, grab any table.

615
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
No reservations necessary.

616
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,720
- Thank you.

617
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
What do you think?

618
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,040
- I like Mike, but I
have to save my review

619
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,680
until after we eat the food

620
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,000
because it's not quite what
I'm used to. [laughing]

621
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,240
- I bet you Clarence's is
more to your taste, huh?

622
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,640
I ate there once, hated it.

623
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,240
- Was it the place or
the people you disliked?

624
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,560
- [Bernie] The food.

625
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,120
- Ah.
[chuckling]

626
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Well, that makes sense.

627
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,040
No one goes there to eat anyway.

628
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,760
Everyone who goes
there to be seen

629
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
and to look at each other.

630
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,080
- You're not like that, are you,
Justine?

631
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,920
- I'm trying hard not to be.

632
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
Why else would I be with you?

633
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,920
- You mean you're just slumming?

634
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,640
- Oh, I can accuse you
of doing the same thing.

635
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Wanting to know how the
other half lives.

636
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,240
- No, I just wanna know
how the other half feels.

637
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,640
[slow saxophone music]

638
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,680
- [Juanito] This can't be true,
Hubie.

639
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,920
This cannot be true!
- Juanito, please.

640
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,840
- Where are you going?
- Justine.

641
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
- I just had picked a bad
time to drop by, Hubie.

642
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,120
- Oh, no, no, it's okay.

643
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,120
Juanito just got some
bad news about a friend.

644
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,360
- Oh, I'm sorry.

645
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,680
- So, what brings you down here?

646
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,120
You wanna buy a piece of art?

647
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,840
- No, I just wanted some
advice from my big brother,

648
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,160
that's all.

649
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,280
- Mother would never approve.

650
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,600
[laughing]
- That's true.

651
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,600
Um, I think I'm getting
serious about someone

652
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
for the first time in my life.

653
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,280
- Congratulations.

654
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,200
Is his name Bernard Slatkin?

655
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,280
- I'm afraid so.

656
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,760
- And you're worried
about what she'll say?

657
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,040
- I'm afraid so.

658
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,560
- Don't be.

659
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,200
We can't live our lives
according to Mother's rules.

660
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,640
Or else we won't have any.

661
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,280
And God knows life is
short enough as it is.

662
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,640
- Okay, thanks, thanks.

663
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,640
And tell Juanito I hope
his friend is okay, okay?

664
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,520
[slow saxophone music]

665
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,280
[gentle piano music]

666
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,760
- It is well meant when
friends say to us,

667
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
"I know how you feel."

668
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,000
But they can't really
know how we feel.

669
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,840
Only someone who has experienced

670
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,720
the tragedy that we have
have experienced can know.

671
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,080
Someone like the total stranger
sitting next to you now.

672
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,560
That person can understand
our feelings of anger or rage.

673
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,600
But feelings, no matter
what they are,

674
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,000
they're only feelings,
aren't they?

675
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,480
They're not right or wrong,

676
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,520
and even the most negative
fantasies are not wrong to feel.

677
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,520
It would only be wrong if we
translated them into action.

678
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,600
- What about justice?

679
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
My daughter is dead,

680
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,800
but the man who murdered
her is still alive,

681
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,000
and the only
punishment he received

682
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,680
is to serve three years in jail.

683
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
Three years compared to
my child's entire life.

684
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,000
Now somehow, the rights of
the victim do not equate

685
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,120
with the rights of the criminal.

686
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,560
- That's true, and I think that

687
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,680
that's something we should
all work very hard to change.

688
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,520
- We have to change it.

689
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
We owe it to the
people we loved.

690
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,480
This is the last business
of their lives.

691
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,080
- My son,

692
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,200
he was beaten to death
in a racial encounter,

693
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,640
and I, I don't know how
to reconcile my feelings

694
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,080
towards the men who did it.

695
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,240
Mister,

696
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,760
what would you do

697
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,120
if you ever saw the man
who killed your child?

698
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
[dramatic music]

699
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,360
- What I wanna do is kill him.

700
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,560
And it scares the hell out me.

701
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,920
But that's what I feel.

702
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,320
I wanna kill him.

703
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,880
[gentle instrumental music]

704
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,920
- [Bernie] You really are
different from all the others.

705
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,480
- Others?
- Women I've known.

706
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,800
- Oh, I see.
- They all,

707
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,840
they all worked, and
they worked at working.

708
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,640
- And you don't consider
what I do a career?

709
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,840
- Sure it is, but you're
not driven by it.

710
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,440
You're just there for
me, there just for me,

711
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,200
and not always thinking about
the next power breakfast.

712
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I've never known anyone
like you before.

713
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,760
You know, I told my aunt
Hester and uncle Sol about you.

714
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
I said that you were
almost as tall as me

715
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,040
and that you were fine looking.

716
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,960
- Oh, is that all?

717
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,080
- No, I also told them

718
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,080
that I was gonna marry you.

719
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,120
- Without asking me first?

720
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,520
- That's exactly what my
aunt Hester said.

721
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,080
- Yes.

722
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,960
The answer is yes.

723
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,960
- I wonder what it's like
having sex without a condom.

724
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,880
- Another intellectual
conversation.

725
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,240
The way you get around, Bernie,

726
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,800
it's that or nothing.
- I don't get around anymore.

727
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,880
I'm reformed.

728
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,800
- Since when, three minutes ago?

729
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,800
- Brenda.
- Mm?

730
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,520
- There's something I
have to tell you.

731
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,600
I'm engaged to be married.

732
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,280
Her name is Justine Altemus.

733
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,840
- You bastard, Bernie.

734
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,080
- Hey, that hurt.

735
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,000
- That was the point.

736
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,400
I know you may think of me
as the office convenience,

737
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,640
but we conveniences
have feelings too.

738
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,040
- You're not a convenience.

739
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,360
You're the best damn researcher
I've ever worked with.

740
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,280
Then, you're a good friend.

741
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,240
- Not quite the word I
was expecting you to use.

742
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,760
Well, you can tell
Justine Altemus

743
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,440
that I feel sorry for her.

744
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,560
All that money and she winds
up with a guy like you.

745
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,120
I hope she doesn't mind
sharing her husband

746
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,200
with every woman over the
age of consent.

747
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,320
- I'm gonna change.

748
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,320
- Sure you are.

749
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,640
What makes you think that
just by marrying someone

750
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,760
you're gonna change?

751
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,640
You'll still be the same
old horny bastard

752
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,080
you always were, Bernie.

753
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,560
[gentle instrumental music]

754
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,680
[door slams shut]

755
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,760
- I know you did.
- No.

756
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,920
- [Violet] You sat there

757
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,320
and you watched Lil
pick out that white suit

758
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,520
and you told Ruby Renthal
to buy exactly the same one.

759
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,760
I know you did.
- I did not.

760
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,440
- You can't like to me, Ezzie.
- I did not.

761
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,960
- [Violet] Someone's got
to tell her what to wear,

762
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,680
for God's sakes. [laughing]

763
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,120
- Lord Biedermeier, what
makes you think

764
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
that the average Joe will
pay good money

765
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,480
to read a book about me?

766
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,640
I wouldn't.

767
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,800
- [Lord Biedermeier]
That's just it, Elias.

768
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,920
You're not the average
Joe, not any longer.

769
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,280
And please call me Lucien.

770
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,360
You've made the American
dream a reality,

771
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,440
and the public wants
to know how.

772
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,040
- A book, huh?

773
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,560
I'll have to think about that.

774
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,720
I'm going to London on business.

775
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,240
You could reach me at
the Claridge's Hotel.

776
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,640
- Simply Claridge's, Elias.

777
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,080
Not The Claridge's, nor The
Claridge's Hotel, either.

778
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,440
[patrons chattering]

779
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,440
- Hello, Justine.

780
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,160
Haven't seen you for
quite a while.

781
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,440
How've you been?

782
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,320
- I've been in love, Chick.

783
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,320
- [Chick] That's wonderful.

784
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,920
Excuse me.

785
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,040
- [Elias] People Like Us,
I like that.

786
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,560
So will Ruby.

787
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,840
- [Lucien] By the way,
who's your tailor?

788
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,320
I could recommend mine
if you don't have one.

789
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,440
- Who is that
horribly dressed man

790
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,280
lunching with Lord Biedermeier?

791
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,680
- It's Elias Renthal,
the financier.

792
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,760
- Oh, oh, I read about him in
his wife in Dolly's column.

793
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,120
The new people. [chuckling]

794
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,600
Well, I'll have whatever
Justine's drinking, Chick.

795
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,120
I suppose you invited your
mother to lunch

796
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,280
to discuss Mr. Bernard Slatkin.

797
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,520
- Who have you been talking to,
Mother?

798
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,800
- Well, Joe doesn't tell tales,

799
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,800
but you have been keeping
him and the car out

800
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,840
frightfully late.

801
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,480
- I'd like to show you the ring

802
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,360
that Bernie has given me, look.

803
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,320
- Well, that's a garnet,
for God's sake.

804
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,680
With a lot of pokey
little diamonds around it.

805
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,920
An announcer who earns as
much as he's reputed to

806
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,480
certainly can do
better than that.

807
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,320
- But he's an anchorman,
not an announcer.

808
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,240
And the ring belonged
to his aunt.

809
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,440
- Yes, I'm sure it did.

810
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,600
Well, just turn it back around,

811
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,360
so when we leave and say
hello to Violet and Ezzie,

812
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,560
they won't notice.

813
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,640
- I found someone I love,
Mother,

814
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,760
and I'm going to marry him.

815
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,680
I hoped that you'd be
happy for me.

816
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,960
- You know I've always
wanted you to marry, Justine.

817
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,800
I would simply prefer my
son-in-law to be one of us.

818
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,680
I'm sure his family
feels the same.

819
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,920
- Bernie's parents are dead.

820
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,680
He was raised by his
aunt and uncle.

821
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,160
- How unfortunate for everyone.

822
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,320
Well, since that piece of
jewelry appears to mean

823
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,400
what I think it does,

824
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,760
we should discuss plans
for the wedding.

825
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,000
- Oh, Bernie and I want to
invite family and a few friends.

826
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,160
We'd like to keep the
occasion intimate and small.

827
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,280
- Your ring is small enough.

828
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,280
You are my only daughter,
Justine.

829
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,480
And I insist on giving
you a proper wedding.

830
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
You know, I wanna do
this for you.

831
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,360
Now please, don't be difficult.

832
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,440
- If you won't be when
Daddy gives me away.

833
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,360
- I haven't cared about
anything your father has done

834
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,800
in the last 10 years.

835
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Now, when am I going to
meet your Mr. Slatkin?

836
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,240
- As soon as you say, Mother.

837
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,280
- Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres

838
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,880
with the entire family,
of course.

839
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,440
Although I don't know how
my dear brother

840
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,160
is going to react to this news.

841
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,720
- Well, he'll just have
to keep a stiff upper lip.

842
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,720
It shouldn't be too difficult

843
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,440
for uncle Laurance,
shouldn't it?

844
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,360
- I really liked your
father and your stepmother.

845
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,440
But you never told me why
your parents got divorced.

846
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,520
- Hmm, I think you'll understand
once you've met my mother.

847
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,480
She can be dreadful.

848
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,720
Polite and charming
[chuckling] but dreadful.

849
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
- I know all about
people like your mother.

850
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,960
I'm in show business, remember?

851
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,360
- So, why the party, Mother?

852
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,360
I thought you didn't
approve of Bernie.

853
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,600
- I can't ignore the situation,

854
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,840
so it's best just to
put on an approving face

855
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,560
and keep one's private
thoughts to oneself.

856
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,760
I think you'll find a
tie in your old room.

857
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,480
- I'm not staying.

858
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,640
- What?

859
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,080
[laughing]

860
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,520
- No, I can't stand the thought
of being in the same room

861
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,560
with uncle Laurance
and aunt Janet,

862
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
or my cousin and his
dreary wife.

863
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,040
- I won't hear a word
against my dear brother.

864
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,720
- Your dear brother
can't stand me, either.

865
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,120
He fired me.

866
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Didn't approve of my
lifestyle, wasn't that it?

867
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,080
- You don't work at
the bank anymore

868
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,080
and all those pressures
are behind you.

869
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,200
- I love Justine and I would
do absolutely anything for her,

870
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,680
but I am still going, Mother.

871
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,200
- And one of these days
you'll find the right girl

872
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,200
and make your old
mother really happy.

873
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,320
My dear Hubie, you look tired.

874
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,280
- Wish Justine luck for me.

875
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,560
[gentle instrumental music]

876
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,000
[all chattering]

877
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,400
- [Justine] Mother,
this is Bernard Slatkin.

878
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,640
- Hello, how are you?

879
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,160
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

880
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,040
- Mr. Slatkin, may I present
my brother, Laurance Van Degan.

881
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,400
- Mr. Slatkin.

882
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,600
- [Lil] And his wife, Janet.

883
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,840
- Hello, how are you?

884
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,960
- [Lil] And my father,
Ormonde Van Degan.

885
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,520
Father, this is
Justine's fiance.

886
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,000
- [Bernie] Nice to meet you,
sir.

887
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,640
- [Lil] Oh, and yes, our
cousin, Dodo Fitz Alyn,

888
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,720
my father's loyal companion.
- So happy to meet you.

889
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,520
- [Lil] My nephew,
Young Laurance.

890
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,680
- Mr. Slatkin.

891
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,480
- [Lil] And his wife, Laura.

892
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,760
- Hello.

893
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
- Nice to meet you both.

894
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,360
- Oh.

895
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,320
Oh, Parker, tell Gertie
the canapes look yummy.

896
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
- Thank you, Parker.

897
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,520
- Some smoked salmon, Mr.
Slatkin?

898
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,720
- [Elias] Max, just because
you're my head trader

899
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,160
and we go back a long time

900
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,040
doesn't mean that you can talk
to me any way you want to.

901
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,360
- [Max] And why not?

902
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,360
I'm the guy who sold the
hamburgers you used to make

903
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,600
while you dreamed about owning
your own franchise someday.

904
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
- [Elias] So?

905
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,040
- I also remember you
used to think

906
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,760
the world would be your
oyster if you had a million.

907
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,640
Then I remember you set
10 million as your goal,

908
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,760
then 50, then 100.
- What's your point?

909
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
- The point is, you've got
$3 billion now.

910
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,120
When are you gonna stop?

911
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,880
- I can't stop, Max, it's
too damn easy.

912
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,320
You know what it's like?

913
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,800
It's like putting a hunk of
red meat in front of a lion.

914
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,600
Besides, how else am I gonna pay

915
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,120
for that new office building?

916
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,640
- I certainly wouldn't
presume to tell you

917
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,120
what to write, Gus.

918
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,800
But the family would prefer
that you focus the article

919
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,280
more on Justine's background
rather than on Bernie's.

920
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,600
Jewish.

921
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,840
- Bernie's heritage doesn't
seem to matter to Justine, Lil.

922
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,480
- Well, it should matter, Gus.

923
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,840
Marrying an outsider
can do nothing

924
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,520
but create problems
for everyone.

925
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,440
Oh, there's Ezzie and Violet.

926
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,840
There's that cheap man
one's always hearing about.

927
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,240
What is his name?

928
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,800
- [Gus] Elias Renthal.

929
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,080
- Laurance actually wants me
to invite him and his wife

930
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,120
to Justine's wedding.

931
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,480
I mean, he says that's
important to us.

932
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,440
The world has gone mad.

933
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,000
- Mr. Bailey.

934
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,200
- Call me Gus.

935
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,520
- I want you to meet Max Luby,

936
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,800
an old friend and
associate of mine.

937
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,360
- How do you do?

938
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,000
I don't believe you've
met Lil Altemus.

939
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,320
- Hello, how are you?

940
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,280
- Fine, thanks.

941
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,680
I know your brother.

942
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,600
We're in a couple of
business deals together.

943
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,480
- Really?

944
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,920
- Well, I guess
we'll go sit down

945
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,480
before they give our seats away.

946
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,080
Well, it was nice meeting you,
Lil.

947
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,360
See you, Gus.

948
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,840
- I simply can't imagine

949
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,160
Laurance doing business
with that man.

950
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,800
I mean, it's ridiculous,
it's absolutely ridiculous.

951
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,120
[phone ringing]

952
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,000
- Hello.

953
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,560
- Damn it, Gus, I've
tried calling you all day

954
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,240
but you're never in.

955
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,440
I have some information for you.

956
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,080
- Peach, what's going on?

957
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,640
- I had a call from
Lieutenant Jackson.

958
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,200
He wanted me to be the
one to tell you.

959
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,080
The date for Flint's parole
hearing has been moved up

960
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,400
due to good behavior.

961
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,360
- I see.

962
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,400
Okay, bye.

963
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,520
[gentle instrumental music]

964
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,680
- Now, what exactly do
you have in mind?

965
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,840
I mean, in regards to this Mr.
Flint.

966
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,400
- [Gus] I want you to
keep track of him

967
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,480
if he gets out next month.

968
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,800
Where he lives and what
he does with his time.

969
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,080
- Is that all?
- For now, yes.

970
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,600
- So, you want this guy
thrown out a window?

971
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,880
- No, I don't want
anything like that.

972
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,520
- It could look like
an accident.

973
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,960
You wouldn't meet the
person who'd do it

974
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,920
and he'd never know your name.

975
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,400
Easy, not cheap, but safe.

976
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
- No, Mr. Feliciano.

977
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,880
I have something else in mind.

978
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,880
Hi, Peach.

979
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,840
How are you feeling?

980
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,760
- Old, if you want to know,
and I hate it.

981
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,320
- I wanted you to know I hired
a detective to watch Flint.

982
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,120
If he's released after
that hearing.

983
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,160
- He can't be let out.

984
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,760
Dear God, has everyone
forgotten what he did?

985
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,360
I want to go to that
parole hearing, Gus.

986
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,600
I have to tell them again

987
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,720
what he did to a
beautiful daughter.

988
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,360
I have to make them remember.

989
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,200
I want them to remember.

990
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,880
- They won't forget Becky,
Peach.

991
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,200
I won't let them forget.

992
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,520
- I wish you could go to
the wedding too, Juanito.

993
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,400
- Maybe if I dressed up
as a loaf of white bread.

994
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,000
- No, it wouldn't work.

995
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,240
You would forget to cut
off the crusts,

996
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
and then uncle Laurance

997
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,160
would see right through
your disguise.

998
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,360
- Your sister said she liked me.

999
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,880
- She does and if it were
up to Justine,

1000
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,960
she would have invited you,

1001
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,720
but she's walking on
eggshells as it is

1002
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,040
with this TV announcer.

1003
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,280
- Isn't that what's called
marrying beneath you?

1004
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,360
You know, you two are
a lot alike.

1005
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,000
- Stop that, will you, please?

1006
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,600
I hate it when you're that way.

1007
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,720
- Honest?

1008
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,920
- Bitchy.

1009
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,200
You're like my mother.

1010
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,200
[laughing]
- That's a low blow.

1011
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,880
- How does this look?

1012
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,920
- Look up here. [mumbles]

1013
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,800
Thanks.

1014
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,320
[Hubie groaning]

1015
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,120
You could never tell.

1016
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,840
Hubie, give it a little
more of an angle.

1017
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,720
- You do it.

1018
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,400
- Perfect.

1019
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,280
Now let's go.

1020
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,640
I gotta get back to the gallery.

1021
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,760
One of us has to work
for a living.

1022
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,960
[church bell tolling]

1023
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,240
- Couldn't they have
gotten married

1024
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,240
someplace a little
closer than Long Island?

1025
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,680
- Bernie told us all of
Justine's people

1026
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,480
get baptized, married,
and buried in this church.

1027
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,000
It's their family tradition.

1028
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,120
- [Sol] I still think my nephew

1029
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,840
should be married in
a synagogue.

1030
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,000
- And I say be glad that
Bernie's getting married.

1031

[gentle organ music]

1032
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,400
Where do you suppose
the girl is?

1033
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,960
- Aren't brides always late?

1034
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,160
- I wasn't.

1035
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,640
[Sol chuckles]

1036
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,080
- [Photographer] Mrs. Altemus,

1037
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,840
would you look this way, please.

1038
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,200
Thank you.

- Hello, Lil.
- Hubert.

- Hello, Hubie.

- Oh, it's a lovely bouquet,
Justine.

01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,120
- Do I look all right, Mother?

1047
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,960
- You look perfect.

1048
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,480
Nevel at his best.

1049
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
- Well, I meant me.

1050
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,920
- You look beautiful, Justine.

1051
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,000
- Hubie, it's time for
you to take me in.

1052
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,360
- Good luck, Justine.

1053
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,880
I really want you to be happy.

1054
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,000
- Hubie, what's that?

1055
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,480
- It's nothing, it's just an
irritation from my aftershave.

1056
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,840
["Bridal Chorus"]

1057
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,160
[jazzy music]
[girls giggling]

1058
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,480
- You're gaining a lot of space

1059
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,480
in the columns lately, I see.

1060
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,040
- Oh, can you believe this?

1061
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,520
You'd think I was
somebody important.

1062
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,400
- You are.

1063
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,680
- I'm with firm of Weldon
and Stinchfield, Mr. Renthal.

1064
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,280
- They handle a lot
of takeovers.

1065
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,200
- We do our share.

1066
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,280
- Let's talk later.

1067
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,160
I'm really interested
in takeovers.

1068
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,440
- If I ever strike it rich,
my wife and I

1069
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,160
would like to build a home
in Fairfield, in Darien.

1070
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,120
But it's hard with kids.

1071
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,800
We have two little girls.

1072
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,320
- I'm sure in time that
could be arranged, Byron.

1073
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,240
For the proposal I have in mind,

1074
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,560
there would be nothing risky.

1075
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,720
All you'd have to do is
identify certain companies

1076
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,480
that retain Weldon and
Stinchfield in an advisory capacity.

1077
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,360
You know, before takeovers
and mergers happen.

1078
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,480
- This is beautiful.

1079
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,400
- It belonged to Edward VII.

1080
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,320
It's the original felt.

1081
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,920
- Holy smoke.

1082
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,000
- I'd be willing to pay
5% on any profit I make

1083
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,760
with your help, paid in cash,
say,

1084
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,800
on 80,000 shares of West
Virginian Natural Gas.

1085
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,120
It would be a very
handsome amount.

1086
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,320
- Holy smoke.

1087
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,960
- Shall we go now and have
another brandy?

1088
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,680
- Okay, Gus, I want you
to be honest with me.

1089
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,040
What do you think?

1090
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,840
- Well, I seem to be at a
loss for words.

1091
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,160
I don't know how I'm gonna begin

1092
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,960
to describe all this
in my article.

1093
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,760
- Well, do me a favor, try
to write about our apartment

1094
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,640
and not about us.

1095
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,280
Elias thinks my picture's
been in the paper

1096
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,440
too much already.

1097
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,440
- It is.

1098
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,560
And we gotta be careful.

1099
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,000
There are a lot of crazy
people out there

1100
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,160
who like to read about
people like us.

1101
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,840
- Elias wants me to carry a gun.

1102
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,120
- It's for your own protection.

1103
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,640
- Look at this little
pearl-handled number he gave me

1104
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,800
as a stocking present.

1105
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,160
It used to belong to
Queen Marie of Romania.

1106
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Oh, don't be afraid, I
never keep it loaded.

1107
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,000
It's just for show,
you might say.

1108
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,760
- That's not why I bought
you the damn thing, Ruby.

1109
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,040
- [Housekeeper] Excuse me,

1110
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,800
Mr. Van Degan is on the
telephone, Mr. Renthal.

1111
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,720
- All right, tell him I'll
be right there.

1112
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,960
Ruby, why don't you
take Gus on a tour, huh?

1113
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,800
Don't forget to show
him the fumary.

1114
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,760
- You know, in California,
the first thing they do

1115
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,920
after they give you a drink,
they show you their closets.

1116
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,600
[Ruby chuckles]

1117
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,760
- [Ruby] Will you
stay for dinner?

1118
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,200
- I can't, I'm leaving
for the coast tonight.

1119
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,400
Lefty Flint, the man who
murdered my daughter,

1120
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,000
his parole hearing is
tomorrow afternoon.

1121
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,520
- But he's only been in
prison for a year.

1122
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,880
- Yeah, and Becky would
have been 24 this fall.

1123
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,760
- Is your wife going with you?

1124
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,080
- No, I talked her out of it.

1125
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,640
She's not well enough.

1126
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,280
And besides, there's no
point in her going through

1127
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,600
what we went through in
court all over again.

1128
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,440
- Well, there's a chance his
parole will be denied, right?

1129
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,760
- Slim one.

1130
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,880
He's been a model prisoner.

1131
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,160
So, as far as the judicial
system is concerned,

1132
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,560
he will have paid his
debt to society.

1133
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,200
- Well, this isn't justice.

1134
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,280
- [Gus] No, it isn't.

1135
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,680
- Look, Gus, why don't
we take the grand tour

1136
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,160
when you get back?

1137
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,640
- And missing the fumary?

1138
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,400
No way.

1139
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,240
[gentle instrumental music]

1140
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,080
- Macumber, why are you
calling me here?

1141
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,720
I told you never to do that.

1142
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,840
- I apologize, Mr. Renthal,
but I'm not in my office

1143
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,320
and this was the only
number I could remember.

1144
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,520
I thought this was urgent.

1145
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,480
- All right, so
where's the fire?

1146
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,320
- Omaha Fuel has hired Weldon
and Stinchfield as an advisor

1147
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,880
on a proposal by Tri World
Incorporated to acquire them.

1148
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,120
I thought you'd want to
know as soon as possible.

1149
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,160
- All right, but from
now on you're Mr. Brown

1150
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,360
and don't ever call
me here again.

1151
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,760
- Yes, sir, I understand.

1152
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,440
Goodnight.

1153
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,680
[phone line humming]

1154
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,560
[keypad beeping]

1155
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,840
[phone line ringing]

1156
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,440
- [Receptionist] Credit
Suisse of Nassau.

1157
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,680
- Yeah, this is Mr. Rod
Nolte, get me Mr. Gerhard.

1158
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,520
- [Gerhard] Yes, Mr.
Nolte, this is Gerhard.

1159
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,720
- Buy 180,000 shares of
Omaha Natural Gas

1160
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,440
the instant the market opens.

1161
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,440
- [Gerhard] Anything else?

1162
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,280
- [Elias] No, that's all.

1163
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,640
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1164
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,440
- The smoke.

1165
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,800
- [Elias] That's why
you got me this fumary

1166
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,080
so I wouldn't cloud up
your fancy-schmancy rooms.

1167
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,480
- Don't say fancy-schmancy.

1168
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,760
- Why not?
- Because it's tacky,

1169
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,680
we're past that.

1170
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,280
Listen, honey, I forgot.

1171
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,360
I'll need the plane real
early tomorrow.

1172
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,480
There's an auction at the
California ranch

1173
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,280
and there's a couple
of Remingtons.

1174
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,600
- Couple of who?

1175
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,880
- [Ruby] Horse sculptures.

1176
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,840
I thought they might be
nice for the country house.

1177
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,680
- Okay, have your secretary
set it up with the pilot.

1178
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,040
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1179
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,400
I love you, Elias.

1180
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,120
[gentle instrumental music]

1181
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,840
[dramatic music]

1182
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,760
- [Officer] Let's go,
single file.

1183
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,120
- [Inmate] Yep.

1184
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,960
- [Officer] I saw that one,
Peter.

1185
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,040
- And I can't believe

1186
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,560
that 15 months
constitutes enough time

1187
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,360
to rehabilitate the man
who murdered my daughter.

1188
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,040
I only pray you agree with me.

1189
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,080
- [Warden] We will consider
your remarks Mr. Bailey.

1190
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,920
Thank you.

1191
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,680
I now call Mrs. Elias
Renthal to speak.

1192
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,880
[door clacking]

1193
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,560
Mrs. Renthal, please.

1194
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,720
- My name is Ruby Nolte Renthal,

1195
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,240
and I've come here today
to plead with you

1196
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,760
not to grant Francis
Flint an early release

1197
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,040
from his prison sentence.

1198
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,760
- Warden, I object.

1199
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,520
- This is a hearing,
not a trial, Mr. Pink.

1200
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,080
Objections are not recognized.

1201
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,240
Go on, Mrs. Renthal.

1202
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,960
- I had a two-year
relationship with Francis Flint

1203
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,240
that ended before the
murder of Becky Bailey.

1204
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,920
On four separate occasions,

1205
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,680
Mr. Flint beat me.

1206
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,720
On two separate occasions, I
was hospitalized as a result.

1207
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,600
Once after he threw me
down a stairway

1208
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,240
when I tried to escape from him.

1209
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,000
Another after he broke my
nose and teeth,

1210
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,360
blackened my eyes, and
fractured my jaw.

1211
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,720
- [Warden] Didn't you
press charges at the time?

1212
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,600
- No.

1213
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,840
- I ask why.

1214
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,920
- I was warned not to.

1215
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,920
- By whom?

1216
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,840
- That doesn't matter now.

1217
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,240
All that matters is that
the jury at his trial

1218
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,760
was allowed to think that
Becky Bailey strangulation

1219
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,920
was one single isolated
incident, an accident.

1220
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,280
That's not true.

1221
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,600
Mr. Flint is a classic
abuser of women.

1222
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,120
His weapon is his hands.

1223
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,800
[chair squeaks]

1224
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:22,960
- Sit down.

1225
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,600
- Are you finished Mrs. Renthal?

1226
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:32,960
- Yes.

1227
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,840
Yes, am I excused?

1228
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,640
- Certainly.

1229
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,160
And thank you very much.

1230
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,320
- Why didn't you tell me?

1231
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,280
- Because I felt so guilty.

1232
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,120
Ever since I heard about
Becky's death,

1233
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,360
I've lived every day

1234
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,760
knowing if I had only
gone to the police.

1235
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,280
If I'd only done something,
Becky might still be alive.

1236
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,360
- [Gus] Why say anything now?

1237
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,160
- Because of you.

1238
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,200
- Dear God.

1239
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,640
- I knew Lefty years ago.

1240
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,440
Long before he met Becky.

1241
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,080
I just moved to Dallas, I
got a job as a waitress.

1242
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,440
He played guitar at the
same restaurant.

1243
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,560
I know you might find
this hard to believe,

1244
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,880
but he could be very charming,
very sweet.

1245
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,360
We started spending a lot
of time together

1246
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,040
and after a while he
moved in with me.

1247
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,680
It wasn't long before
the beatings started.

1248
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,440
Afterwards, he'd always cry,

1249
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,880
tell me how sorry he was, how
he never meant to hurt me.

1250
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,120
- Why didn't you ask for help?

1251
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,240
- I was too afraid.

1252
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,680
When I did try to break
it off and get away,

1253
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,080
Lefty came after me.

1254
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,600
Oh, Gus, I'm sorry.

1255
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,040
I am so sorry.
- I'm sorry, Ruby,

1256
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,560
for both of us.

1257
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,720
Does Elias know?
- No.

1258
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,840
No, I never told him.

1259
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,760
I've been so ashamed.

1260
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,160
I felt dirty just being alive.

1261
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,760
Even now I don't know if I
could tell him,

1262
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,240
and he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1263
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,360
Someday maybe.

1264
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,600
Not now.

1265
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,400
- Well, I'll call in
a few favors.

1266
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,440
Keep your name out
of the papers.

1267
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,640
- Oh.

1268
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,360
- [Gus] Nobody will find
out about this, Ruby.

1269
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,160
I promise you.

1270
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,880
[gentle instrumental music]

1271
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,000
- [Ruby] Tell Frida we'll
have lunch about one, I think.

1272
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,440
I'll leave the menu to her.

1273
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,080
- Very good, madam.

1274
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,280
- [Ruby] You see, there is
some justice in this world.

1275
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,200
- Hi, did I miss everything?

1276
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,080
- [Ruby] Well, you're too
late for the Easter egg hunt.

1277
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,920
- [Gus] This wouldn't have
happened without you, Ruby.

1278
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,040
- You gave me the courage
to do it, Gus.

1279
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,120
- [Gus] You remember
that other woman

1280
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:12,920
who was at the hearing?

1281
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,360
- [Ruby] Yes.

1282
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,040
- [Gus] Yeah, well, I had a
detective do some checking,

1283
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,200
and it seems like Lefty
has found his next victim.

1284
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,360
- I was afraid of that.

1285
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,200
- Thank you.

1286
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,800
Her name is Marguerite Hanrahan.

1287
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,520
She started writing to him
when he first went to prison.

1288
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,800
And I guess she believed
he was born again

1289
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
because now she's
gonna marry him.

1290
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,960
- After everything she heard?

1291
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,400
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1292
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,560
Somehow I've got to convince her

1293
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,480
she's making a terrible mistake.

1294
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,320
- You have to, Gus.

1295
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,440
Somehow you have to.

1296
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,120
- For her sake, I hope I can.

1297
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,400
- Look at your anemones,
so beautiful.

1298
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,120
Lorenza has been here, I see.
- Just.

1299
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,520
Mrs. Renthal has been
monopolizing all of her time

1300
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,280
with that damn ball.

1301
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,120
Happy Easter, Janet.

1302
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,560
Imagine, new people like that
giving that kind of party

1303
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,200
and inviting all of us.

1304
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,640
- [Janet] Laurance feels
we should play along.

1305
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,960
- Why, may I ask.

1306
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,240
- [Janet] Because they are
taking charge, darling.

1307
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,000
People like us in the
social register

1308
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,400
are practically extinct.

1309
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,360
- Janet, my brother,
your husband,

1310
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,400
is still very much in charge.

1311
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,240
The Van Degan Bank, the
Van Degan Foundation,

1312
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,880
the Van Degan Building,
they're all his.

1313
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,960
We'll just see who's in charge.

1314
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,320
I wouldn't dream of accepting
the Renthals invitation.

1315
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,160
- We should talk about that,
Lil.

1316
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,960
- Who is this coming to see me?

1317
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,600
Who is it, who?

1318
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,920
Yes, there she is.

1319
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,920
- Baby Janet loves her
grandma, don't you, sweetheart?

1320
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,280
Yes.

1321
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,480
- And then Juanito
told me that--

1322
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,480
- I didn't know you two
had gotten so close.

1323
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,680
- I bought a
painting for Ormonde

1324
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,440
at Hubie and Juanito's gallery.

1325
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,480
- Nice picture, Hubie,
big colors.

1326
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,760
- Thanks, Grandfather.

1327
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,280
- Parker, you'll be sure
I want you to tell Gertie

1328
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,800
how much we enjoyed the
crab tartlets.

1329
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,720
- I absolutely agree
with Father.

1330
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
Elias Renthal is the most
fascinating man

1331
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,640
to come into the financial
community in years

1332
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,360
and necessary to it.

1333
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,480
- It's a surprise.

1334
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,440
I didn't think you people
liked this type.

1335
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,040
- Well, we have been
known to make exceptions

1336
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,480
when they're forced upon us.

1337
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,280
[glass clinking]

1338
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,800
- To the newest member
of our family.

1339
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,400
[thunder rumbling]

1340
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,080
- Long way may it reign.

1341
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,000
[Violet laughing]

1342
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,800
[all chattering]

1343
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,280
- Where's Juanito today?

1344
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,120
- [Hubie] Oh, he's with
some friends.

1345
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,920
- Hubie, when are you
gonna tell me?

1346
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,080
- Well, I thought that
you'd already guessed

1347
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,960
at your wedding.

1348
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,280
- Well, what's gonna happen?

1349
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,600
- What eventually
happens to all of us.

1350
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,680
[Justine crying]

1351
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,000
Justine, please don't,
please don't cry.

1352
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,560
Justine, please, don't cry,

1353
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,000
not with all this family here,
please.

1354
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,080
- You are gonna tell Mother,
yes?

1355
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,160
- As soon as everyone
leaves today.

1356
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,040
- Do you want me to be with you?

1357
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,240
- Do you realize that even
though I am your big brother,

1358
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,920
you have always tried
to take care of me, hmm?

1359
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,800
I think I can do this.

1360
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,280
But thank you very much anyway.

1361
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,000
[solemn music]

1362
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,160
Please don't cry.

1363
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,400
- Fun, wasn't it?

1364
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,200
Now you know what I've had to
go through all these years.

1365
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,280
- [Bernie] You didn't
pick your family.

1366
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,640
- No, but you did.

1367
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,720
Listen, it'll be different when
we have children, I promise.

1368
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,240
They'll wanna come home
for the holidays.

1369
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,880
- Justine, you know how I feel.

1370
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't even know if I
wanna have kids.

1371
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,000
All that responsibility.

1372
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,040
- You'll change your
mind, I know you will.

1373
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,000
We won't let them even
meet my family. [chuckles]

1374
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,640
- Wasn't this nice, Hubie?

1375
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,040
Dinner on trays and just
the two of us by the fire.

1376
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,320
- Yes, it's nice.

1377
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,560
- Well, I bet you
couldn't imagine

1378
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,520
your old mother could
rustle up such a good meal

1379
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,680
with Gertie and Parker
out for the evening.

1380
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,040
- [Hubie] Mother,
there's something

1381
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,400
that I want to tell you.

1382
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,240
- Hmm, would you like to
watch television or just talk?

1383
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,840
- Just talk.
- Good.

1384
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,520
Try some of Gertie's fig mousse.

1385
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,400
I don't know how she does it,
something about egg whites.

1386
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,560
- Mother, you can see
that I'm not well.

1387
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,400
- I know they have to use
ripe figs and only white figs.

1388
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,880
I know that's very important.

1389
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,000
- I have AIDS, Mother.

1390
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,520
- It's just that your
color is not good, Hubie.

1391
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,720
You eat like a sparrow.

1392
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,560
- I have lymphoma

1393
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,960
and not much time.

1394
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,960
- Hubie, I thought you and
I might take a little trip

1395
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,120
to, say, St. Moritz
out of season.

1396
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,840
It's just too beautiful for
words and it's so healthy.

1397
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,520
- I might be dead by then.

1398
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,760
- Oh, Hubie!

1399
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,320
This talk is just so morbid.

1400
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,600
I don't know how you can
do this to your family.

1401
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,920
[laughing]

1402
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,720
- Thank you for all your
support, Mother.

1403
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,520
- Paris.

1404
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,720
Paris, that's where we
should go, Hubie.

1405
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,560
Wally Simpson left all her
money to the Pasteur Institute

1406
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,760
and they do marvelous things.

1407
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,120
- Don't you think that I
would have already gone there

1408
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,240
to get help?

1409
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,360
It's too late.

1410
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,640
But that's not why you
suggested it, is it, Mother?

1411
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,440
You just wanna hide me so
that your friends won't know

1412
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,600
that your son is gay
and has AIDS.

1413
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,840
- Hubie, please.

1414
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,360
Nevel told me all about
that disease.

1415
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,800
But I never thought people
like us got it.

1416
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,240
[gasping]

1417
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,920
[suspenseful music]

1418
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,440
Order Malvern water,

1419
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,080
Israeli melons.

1420
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,760
Gertie, please forgive

1421
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,800
the ghastly mess I made.

1422
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,880
I tripped.

1423
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,000
P.S. The fig mousse was yummy.

1424
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,160
- [Woman] Yes, we're ready.

1425
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,440
- [Marguerite] Uh, hi.

1426
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,040
The Chardonnay by the
glasses are special today.

1427
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:03,880
- [Woman] Uh-huh.

1428
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,720
- [Gus] Hi, Marguerite.

1429
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,600
I'm Gus Bailey.

1430
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,680
- What do you want?

1431
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,040
- [Woman] I like Chardonnay.

1432
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,440
- Talk you out of
marrying Lefty Flint.

1433
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,080
- That's none of your business.

1434
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,600
- Flint is a murderer,
you know that.

1435
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,720
He killed my daughter.

1436
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,840
- He was drunk when he did that.

1437
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,080
He doesn't drink anymore.

1438
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,600
Now I think you'd better get
out of here and leave me alone.

1439
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,640
- Look, here's my
telephone number.

1440
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,520
If you're ever in any sort
of trouble, you call me.

1441
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:52,360
[gentle instrumental music]

1442
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,280
- [Peach] I'm over here!

1443
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,880
- Hi.

1444
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:05,960
- Oh, hi.

1445
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,640
I bet that detective you
hired doesn't know about this.

1446
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,200
It's from Flint.

1447
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,160
When he does get out of prison,
he wants to come and see me.

1448
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,960
Our daughter's killer
wants my forgiveness.

1449
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,120
If I ever see that man
again, I'll kill him

1450
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,840
with whatever
strength I have left.

1451
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,720
- You were always stronger
than I was, Peach.

1452
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,640
- So, you left.

1453
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,160
- You asked for a divorce.

1454
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,120
I made you unhappy.

1455
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,600
- I'm not much for looking back.

1456
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,280
Don't be too hard on yourself,
Gus.

1457
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,320
You were a good father.

1458
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,640
Wheel me back inside, will you,
I've got to get back to bed.

1459
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,640
- If you don't mind, Peach,

1460
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,120
I'd like to look for something
in the basement before I go.

1461
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,320
- [Peach] What you want
to go in the basement for?

1462
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,600
- [Gus] Some letters my
father sent me

1463
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,560
when I was in the Army.

1464
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,200
- We packed all your things
and sent them to your apartment

1465
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,640
when we broke up.

1466
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,240
- [Gus] Well, they must
have been left behind,

1467
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,520
wound up down there.

1468
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,640
[suspenseful music]

1469
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,800
- Can I help you?

1470
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,560
- Yeah, I have a little Russian
made weapon here from Korea.

1471
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,720
- It's a beauty.

1472
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,920
Is it for sale?

1473
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,360
- No, I'd like to get
it into working order.

1474
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,440
Can you do that?

1475
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,880
- Sure, I'll need a deposit.

1476
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,800
Your name?

1477
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,600
- Mertens, Gene Mertens.

1478
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,560
[gentle instrumental music]

1479
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,800
[somber music]

1480
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,000
[dramatic music]

1481
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,800
[dramatic music]

1482
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:24,040
[woman chuckling]

1483
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,720
[clapping]

1484
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,040
- Happy birthday, Peach.

1485
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,560
Now let's see, how old
does this make you exactly?

1486
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,840
- Still younger than you.

1487
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,480
- Would you like me to
cut the cake now, señora?

1488
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,600
- Yes, thank you, Maggie,
my dear.

1489
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,240
We'll have some more
coffee as well.

1490
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,880
That was very sweet of
you to remember, Gus.

1491
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,240
You could've just sent a card.

1492
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,400
- Well I didn't want
you to celebrate alone.

1493
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,160
- You always were too
sentimental.

1494
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,040
- That is probably true

1495
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,840
but I'm glad there are
still a few occasions

1496
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,200
left to celebrate.

1497
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,360
- You make the best
of everything.

1498
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,840
- Not everything.

1499
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,200
Flint's lawyer got him
another parol hearing.

1500
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,480
Should take place within
a couple of months.

1501
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,120
- And he'll get out this time,
won't he?

1502
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,920
- Yes and it will all be over

1503
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,480
and justice will be satisfied.

1504
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,760
- But that's not how we feel,

1505
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,680
is it, Gus?

1506
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,440
- Maybe we will, Peach.

1507
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,200
Someday.

1508
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,760
- [PA Announcer] Arriving
passenger Miles Miller,

1509
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,280
please meet your party at
baggage carousel three.

1510
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,000
- Is that you, Gus?

1511
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,200
- Hello, Faye.

1512
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,560
- Well leave it to you not
to make a big fuss over me.

1513
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,480
- No, you look great.

1514
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,640
- That's better.

1515
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,560
But I'll just bet if I
hadn't spotted you,

1516
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,920
you wouldn't have gotten
up to speak to me.

1517
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,200
- Oh yes I would have.

1518
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,560
I was waiting for the
usual hubbub to die down.

1519
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,080
Headed for Europe or
New York like me?

1520
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:53,160
- Big Apple, honey.

1521
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,000
Gonna be shooting "Judas
Was A Redhead."

1522
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,480
- Oh, that would make
a good movie.

1523
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:00,040
- Gus, they don't make
movies of books anymore.

1524
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,680
They make miniseries.

1525
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,720
[chuckling]

1526
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,120
Gus?

1527
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,520
- Yeah.

1528
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,360
- I was in Italy shooting
a picture during the trial.

1529
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,000
You know I would've been there.

1530
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,720
Gus, you've really kept
it in control.

1531
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,960
I would've shot the
son of a bitch.

1532
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,320
Gus?

1533
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,120
You know the Elias Renthall's,
don't you?

1534
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,560
- [Gus] Yes, I do.

1535
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,360
- I know we're talking
big bucks here

1536
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,960
but is he generous?

1537
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,880
- I don't think he'd
finance a movie.

1538
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,200
- Cathy, my best friend,

1539
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,760
she's dying of the Big A.

1540
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,840
Married a guy, had no idea
that he was into needles.

1541
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,840
You know the story.

1542
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,840
[sighing]

1543
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,200
I'm trying to raise money
for the disease.

1544
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,240
In fact, big bucks.

1545
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,520
Think you could help me out?

1546
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,640
- Faye, you're famous.

1547
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,880
You don't need me to meet
Elias Renthall.

1548
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,920
- He didn't return my
phone calls.

1549
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,000
At least not after I told his
secretary what it was about.

1550
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,040
I guess he's only into

1551
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,240
the safe, social
advancement charities.

1552
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,160
Look,

1553
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
all I want is an introduction.

1554
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,280
- I'll see what I can do.

1555
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,400
- Terrific.

1556
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,320
We get to New York, I'll
take you to lunch

1557
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,720
or we'll do lunch.

1558
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,600
- How about we both
just eat lunch?

1559
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,160
[laughing]

1560
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,600
It's for an important cause,
Elias.

1561
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,640
Maybe not to some members
of the social set,

1562
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,600
but for thousands of
people afflicted with AIDS.

1563
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,840
- Okay, I'll send the
lady a check.

1564
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,960
- Good.

1565
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,280
- Better yet, I'll invite
her to the ball,

1566
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,320
I'll give it to her there.

1567
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,600
Ruby will love meeting
Faye Converse.

1568
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,680
- Yeah and you'll enjoy
the good public relations.

1569
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,400
- It's for a worthy cause,
right?

1570
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,280
- Right.

1571
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,520
- Ruby hates these things.

1572
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,640
She ever tell you how we met?

1573
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,440
- No.

1574
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,280
- It was on an airplane.

1575
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,680
Must've been the altitude
that got her to marry me.

1576
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,560
- I doubt that.

1577
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,840
- She likes you, Gus.

1578
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,520
- Well, Ruby's a terrific girl.

1579
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,000
You're a lucky man.

1580
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,200
- Well that's what
people say about me

1581
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,520
but I've had my
share of trouble.

1582
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,760
So have you, I've heard.

1583
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,760
I love my wife, Gus,

1584
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,600
and I won't let anybody
hurt her ever again.

1585
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:11,040
- I understand.

1586
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,120
[phone ringing]

1587
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,080
- Hello?

1588
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:22,920
- Hi.

1589
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,120
It's me.

1590
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,520
What're you doing?

1591
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,040
- [Young Woman]
Clipping coupons.

1592
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,440
- Just like my Aunt Hester.

1593
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,480
- So when are you coming home?

1594
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,320
- Oh, I don't think I can
get out of here

1595
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,120
at least until two or three.

1596
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,600
- Not again, sweetheart, that's
the third time this week.

1597
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,160
- It can't be helped.

1598
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,960
Don't wait up for me.

1599
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,560
- Okay.

1600
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,440
I love you.

1601
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,560
- Same here.

1602
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,480
[somber music]

1603
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,920
- Feeling guilty?

1604
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,840
- [Man] Shut up.

1605
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,120
- I liked you better when
you were single.

1606
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,480
At least then you didn't
pretend to care

1607
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,760
about anybody but yourself.

1608
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,360
- I care about Justine.

1609
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,240
- Sure you do.

1610
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,760
That's why you're here.

1611
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,080
- And that's why I'm leaving.

1612
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,680
[somber music]

1613
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,520
- It's amazing.

1614
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,240
Everyone we've
invited is coming,

1615
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,200
including your mother.
[Justine laughing]

1616
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,120
- Well I knew she'd
accept eventually.

1617
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,520
Mother just wouldn't be content

1618
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,760
having to hear about your
ball of anointed clearances.

1619
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,120
[laughing]

1620
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,360
- I'll let you in on a
little secret.

1621
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,720
First Lady is coming.

1622
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,720
- The First Lady?

1623
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,680
How wonderful.

1624
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,080
How on Earth, Ruby?

1625
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,320
- Elias has been friends
with the President for years.

1626
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:57,040
They used to do business
together when he was governor.

1627
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,280
To be perfectly honest,

1628
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
I'm happier about you
and Bernie being there.

1629
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,760
I'm gonna need the
moral support.

1630
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,280
[chuckling]

1631
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,680
- I just hope Bernie
doesn't have to work

1632
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,720
late again that night.

1633
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,920
He's been doing a lot of
that these days.

1634
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,120
- Oh, so is Elias.

1635
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,800
But he says, "Somebody
has to earn the rent."

1636
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,440
- Oh, I suppose.

1637
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,280
It's just,

1638
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,680
well, I just can't help feeling

1639
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,160
that Bernie's keeping
something from me.

1640
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,600
That there's some deep dark
secret he's afraid to tell me.

1641
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,200
I always thought when you
married someone

1642
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,680
there wouldn't be a need for
secrets between the two of you,

1643
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,200
no matter what you'd done,

1644
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,240
it wouldn't make any difference
to the person who loved you.

1645
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,360
I just wished Bernie loved
me enough to trust me.

1646
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,160
- Well he does love you,
that's what's important.

1647
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,400
Right?

1648
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,200
[pleasant music]

1649
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,440
- [Worker] Watch behind you!

1650
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,920
Oh, that's good.

1651
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,040
- Be careful.

1652
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,080
If you break any of those

1653
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,800
I'll have you all
dipped in cement.

1654
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,920
Mrs. Renthall,

1655
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,200
isn't it just fabulous
what I have done?

1656
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,200
Your ball will be magnificent.

1657
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,560
Simply magical.

1658
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,800
- Yes, I know, you've done
a wonderful job, Lorenza.

1659
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,840
Would you excuse me?

1660
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,720
- [Elias] Sounds like World
War III going on down there.

1661
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,520
- But Lorenza's
winning the battle.

1662
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,760
Elias, there's something
I wanna tell you about.

1663
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,880
- Something you lied
to me about.

1664
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,920
Like about how much this
is really costing me.

1665
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,720
[chuckling]

1666
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,560
- I've never lied to you
about anything, ever.

1667
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,440
- I know that.

1668
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,760
- Sometimes I haven't told
you everything.

1669
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,080
But I've never lied to you.

1670
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,520
I just don't think there should
be any secrets between us.

1671
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,200
I wanna tell you about
someone I used to know.

1672
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,640
- If that someone is
Lefty Flint,

1673
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,800
I know all about him
and it doesn't matter.

1674
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,280
- How do you know?

1675
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,480
- Well when you took so
long in deciding

1676
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:56,840
whether you wanted to
marry me or not,

1677
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,240
I figured there must
be another guy,

1678
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,920
so I checked out my competition.

1679
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,400
- You didn't have any.

1680
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,200
- What did I know?

1681
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,600
I just couldn't understand how
an incredible woman like you

1682
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,920
was still unattached and
even remotely interested

1683
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,800
in a guy like me.

1684
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,520
- Oh, more than remotely.

1685
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,720
You are the kindest,
most gentle loving man

1686
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,840
I have ever known.

1687
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,840
- You mean you didn't
marry me for my money?

1688
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,720
- Money?

1689
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,640
You didn't tell me
you had money.

1690
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,160
[laughing]

1691
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,720
- I'm afraid I can't get to
your file at the moment, Gus.

1692
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,000
But I'll make the necessary
adjustment in your will,

1693
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,160
eliminating the bequest
to your daughter

1694
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,160
and leaving everything
to your ex-wife.

1695
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,920
[ominous music]

1696
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,880
- Bea, who is that man?

1697
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,800
- Listen, Gus, you can come
back when I've prepared it

1698
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,800
and we'll have it witnessed.

1699
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:59,760
- What is going on here?

1700
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,160
Are those the police?

1701
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,160
- Federal ones.

1702
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,800
And that man is one of our
junior lawyers, Byron Macumber.

1703
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,360
- Oh?

1704
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,880
What's he done?

1705
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,880
- Something about an account
in a Swiss bank in the Bahamas.

1706
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,160
Look for a very big
head to roll.

1707
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,080
- [Gus] At Weldon and
Stanchfield?

1708
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,160
- Oh goodness, no, not here.

1709
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,360
Elias Renthall, inside trading.

1710
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:24,280
- This is Gus Bailey,
is Mrs. Renthall there?

1711
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,760
No.

1712
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,920
When would she be back?

1713
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,400
No, no, no, no message.

1714
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,000
Thank you.

1715
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,560
- Hello?

1716
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,960
- Hi, it's me.

1717
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,280
I know this might upset you

1718
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,800
but is it too late to
cancel the Renthall's party?

1719
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,680
- You have to work late
again tonight?

1720
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,960
- [Bernie] No, I just don't
feel like going to a party.

1721
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,720
- Well, why don't we just
go to the Renthall dinner

1722
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,240
and leave before the
ball starts?

1723
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,600
- I really don't want to,
Justine.

1724
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,000
I thought maybe we could go
out, get something to eat.

1725
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,720
Spend some time
together talking,

1726
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,600
just you and me.

1727
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,600
- I promised Ruby but
I'll call and explain.

1728
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,800
Where do you wanna go,
O'Rourke's?

1729
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,800
- That's too noisy.

1730
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,600
- Well,

1731
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,000
how about Clarence's?

1732
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,840
I know you hate the place
but it'll be empty tonight.

1733
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,760
Everybody that goes there
will be at the Renthall's.

1734
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:26,920
- That's fine.

1735
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,800
I'll meet you in an hour.

1736
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,240
- Okay.

1737
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,800
I love you.

1738
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,080
- See you in a little while.

1739
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:33,960
Bye.

1740
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,800
[phone buzzing]

1741
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,560
[crowd commotion]

1742
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,080
[cameras snapping]

1743
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,560
- Dinner for 30 and
everything matches.

1744
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:02,680
And monogram.

1745
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,520
- R is for Renthall, right?

1746
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,920
Wrong, R is for Rothschild.

1747
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,640
They bought it at the
estate sale.

1748
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,560
[people chattering]

1749
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,920
- Oh, Lil, I thought you
were gonna turn this down.

1750
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,160
- Oh, I just came to see
the furniture.

1751
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,720
Cora told me she bought
certain pieces

1752
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,040
from a palace in Yugoslavia.

1753
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,320
- Hello, Gus.

1754
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,280
Mrs. Altemus, I'm so
happy that you came.

1755
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,120
What a disappointment
that Justine

1756
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,640
had to cancel at the
last minute.

1757
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,600
- Cancel?

1758
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,640
She had an appointment Dodo.

1759
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,800
Well, I'm certain she
had her reasons.

1760
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,320
- Do you have a minute?
We have to talk.

1761
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,080
- Yes, of course.

1762
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,080
Excuse us.

1763
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,480
- [Woman] Hello, Faye!

1764
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:41,720
- Oh, here's Faye Converse.

1765
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,800
Would you excuse me?

1766
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,160
Excuse me.

1767
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,960
- Sorry I'm late

1768
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,760
and thanks again for
doing this tonight.

1769
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,160
- Oh, no thanks necessary.

1770
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,560
It's a thrill to meet you

1771
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,000
and an honor to contribute
to such a worthwhile cause.

1772
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,640
Come, I'll show you
to your seat.

1773
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,840
You'll be sitting next to Gus.

1774
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,520
- Oh, I love Gus.

1775
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,240
He's the reason I'm
here tonight.

1776
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,480
- Well I have missed you.

1777
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,200
What's wrong?

1778
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,080
Tell me.

1779
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,600
- I guess there's never
an easy way to say this.

1780
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,160
- What is it, your work?

1781
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,800
You're being transferred
to LA, aren't you?

1782
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,240
- No.

1783
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,200
I almost wish I was.

1784
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,640
That might make this easier.

1785
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,080
I...

1786
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,360
I want a divorce.

1787
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,520
- Why?

1788
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,360
- Because you expect me
to be a faithful husband

1789
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,200
and I'm not.

1790
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,520
I never will be.

1791
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,760
- Is there another woman?

1792
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,640
- There will always be
another woman.

1793
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,320
And that's the problem.

1794
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,680
It's the way I've always been.

1795
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,440
- Well is it me?

1796
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,680
Have I done something wrong?

1797
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:13,160
- No, no, you haven't done
anything wrong,

1798
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,560
except maybe marry me.

1799
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,040
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1800
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,640
I never meant to do that.

1801
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,480
- And I never thought you would.

1802
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,520
[dramatic music]

1803
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,400
[sobbing]

1804
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,960
[eerie music]

1805
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:14,920
[crying]

1806
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,360
[somber music]

1807
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,160
[fire crackling]

1808
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,960
- Are you sure you're up
to making dinner?

1809
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,760
- I have to do things.

1810
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:41,080
- You know, I've always
hated these chairs.

1811
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,920
- Well then you can sell
them after I'm gone.

1812
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,360
Drive mother insane.

1813
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,160
Would you like a drink?

1814
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,880
- I'd like some wine.

1815
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,320
- Ugh.

1816
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,920
I can do it, I have
to do things!

1817
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:00,960
- I know.

1818
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,960
But let me.

1819
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,880
You see to the food,
I'll be bartender.

1820
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,920
[ominous music]

1821
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,800
- Juanito!

1822
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,280
- Hubey.

1823
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,520
- I think you better
get me to the hospital.

1824
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,680
- Should we call your
mother or Justine?

1825
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,400
- No, they're both at the
Renthall ball.

1826
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,200
You wouldn't be able to
reach either of them.

1827
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,280
- Who needs them anyway?

1828
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,600
I'll take care of you.

1829
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,600
Just like always.

1830
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,200
Just like always,

1831
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:47,760
I'll take care of you.

1832
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,800
[people chattering]

1833
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,960
[glass shattering]

1834
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,120
- So sorry, darling.

1835
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,680
- Oh, don't give it
another thought, no.

1836
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,680
Only give me an excuse
to change into

1837
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:02,240
another one of your
marvelous creations.

1838
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,120
Excuse me.

1839
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,520
- Splendid woman.

1840
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,520
The Duchess couldn't
have handled that better.

1841
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,800
- Gus, who the hell are
these people?

1842
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,760
- Well, seated next to
you is Lord Biedermeyer,

1843
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,120
the publisher.

1844
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,080
- Oh, Lucerne, darling.

1845
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,040
How are you?

1846
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:21,880
- Faye.

1847
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,280
- I didn't see you.

1848
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,760
Probably thinks I'm blind drunk.

1849
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,560
- And to his left is Mrs.
Laura Van Degan.

1850
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,560
To her left is the
Earl of Castoria.

1851
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,360
- Oh my God, he looks
like my third husband.

1852
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,320
After the wake.

1853
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,640
[laughing]

1854
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,720
- And need I say any more
about this great star's career

1855
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,200
and the 40 pictures
that she's made?

1856
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,240
- 60, darling, not 40.

1857
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,760
[laughing]

1858
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,080
- Well, whatever, anyway.

1859
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:51,960
Faye,

1860
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,280
here's the check
towards the cure

1861
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,840
for the pestilence

1862
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,160
that is dwindling the ranks
of the artistic community.

1863
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,080
- Thank you.

1864
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,560
[applauding]

1865
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Oh my God.

1866
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,600
Two million dollars.

1867
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:09,480
Oh, Elias!

1868
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:16,600
Thank you!
[applauding]

1869
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,080
[applauding]

1870
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:21,080
Thank you.

1871
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,880
Whoa.

1872
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,720
Friends,

1873
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,960
we are an army

1874
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,040
fighting an enemy that
has no allies.

1875
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,440
However,

1876
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,840
every army must enlist support,

1877
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,000
financial and otherwise.

1878
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,720
The Renthall's generosity

1879
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,240
will aid in the struggle

1880
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:49,320
in which we must all bear arms.

1881
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:54,000
Therefore I shall dedicate the
rest of my life to this cause

1882
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,320
and I shall forever

1883
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:00,440
be indebted to his
charitable gentlemen,

1884
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,760
this extraordinary humanitarian.

1885
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,800
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
Elias Renthall.

1886
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,280
[applauding]

1887
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:24,280
[ominous music]

1888
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:28,520
- [Hubert] I can walk in.

1889
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,760
Let me walk in.

1890
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,240
- [Juanito] Don't worry, Hubey.

1891
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,120
I'm with you.

1892
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,480
Everything's gonna be fine.

1893
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,920
[pleasant instrumental music]

1894
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,480
- There can't be a tulip
left in all of Holland.

1895
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,120
- These new people spend
more on flowers

1896
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,080
than we used to
inherit in my day.

1897
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,760
And all they want in return
is to be accepted by us.

1898
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,200
- That'll never happen.

1899
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,520
- Oh, it will.

1900
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,040
Times change.

1901
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:10,080
- Why don't we retire
upstairs for a cigar?

1902
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:12,120
There's an elevator we can use.

1903
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:16,440
- It will never happen.

1904
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:19,400
- Look around, Lily, it
has happened.

1905
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,320
[pleasant instrumental music]

1906
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,800
[applauding]

1907
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,840
- Isn't it magnificent?

1908
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,080
Of course, they could have
never done it without me.

1909
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,560
- You mean, without me, darling.

1910
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:55,360
- I'd like nothing better
than to publish a biography

1911
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:56,960
of the Van Degan family.

1912
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,480
- Damn good cigar.

1913
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,480
- After all, Ormonde,

1914
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:04,400
your roots in this city
and this nation

1915
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:07,400
can not be matched by
any other family.

1916
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:08,760
- Good cigar.

1917
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,920
- You're looking
particularly well these days.

1918
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:19,200
- Nothing like a good cigar.

[coughing]

1920
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,200
- Your father was governor,

1921
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,200
you uncle, ambassador to France.

1922
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:31,200
I think it's time for
important work.

1923
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:35,840
Yes, yes indeed.

- Ruby?

1926
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,480
Ruby, I have to talk to you.

1927
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,920
- Yes, I know but can it wait,
Gus.

1928
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,280
I gotta go change for
the First Lady.

1929
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,400
- I didn't know she was coming.

1930
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:55,400
- Yes, any minute.

1931
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,320
We'll talk later, I promise.

[ominous music]

1933
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,200
- I'll pick up the rest of
my stuff later in the week.

1934
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,560
I'll call first.

1935
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,560
I'm sorry, Justine.

1936
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,960

1938
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,760
Stop saying you're sorry!

1939
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:19,800
Stop saying!

1940
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,240

- Well, Lil, how about a dance?

1944
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,160
- How kind, Mr. Renthall.

1945
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,880
- I must have a word with you,
Elias.

1946
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:30,480
- Not until I've convinced
Lil to drop the formalities.

[upbeat instrumental music]

1948
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,560

01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,160
- Goodbye.

[upbeat instrumental music]

1951
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,680
- Elias, it's been so gay.

1952
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,320
- I don't think that's quite
the right word anymore.

1953
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,920
- No, it's a marvelous word

1954
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:22,080
and I simply refuse
to give it up.

1955
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:25,680
My friends all know that I
mean it in the old fashion way.

1958
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,120
- He's dead.

1959
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,040
- Oh, this is gonna
ruin Ruby's party.

1960
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,960
- It'll certainly put a
damper on it.

1961
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,120
- Did you tell anyone?

1962
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,240
- Heavens no.

1963
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,640
- All right, how about we
don't say a word

1964
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:55,760
until after the first
lady leaves,

1965
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,000
then we call an ambulance,

1966
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,120
get him back down on the
freight elevator.

1967
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:04,000
He was an old man, it's not
like it's a big tragedy.

1968
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:06,880
- All right.

So lovely.

1973
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:25,760
- [Man] Just wait,
there's more to come.

1974
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,240
- I'll let you in on a
little secret.

1975
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:31,240
I told Ruby to allow 45
minutes for waltzing.

1976
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,360
- I've got a better one.

1977
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,880
I heard that she was warn
not to come here tonight.

1978
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:39,920
Apparently Elias is under
investigation by the SCC

1979
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,440
for insider trading.

1980
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,160
- Nonsense.

1981
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:43,120
- Exactly what I said.

1982
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,720
Even I wouldn't
print that rumor.

Laurance, we're
looking for father.

1986
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,880
He came up here over
an hour ago.

1987
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,880
Now what's in that room?

1988
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:06,120
- Edward the
Seventh's pool table.

1989
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,520
It's off limits.

1990
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,640
Elias doesn't want the
old felt stained.

1991
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,160
- It's locked but maybe
he's in there.

1992
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,000
Old felt wouldn't mean
a thing to him.

1993
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:17,080
- Look through the key hole,
Dodo.

1994
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:21,440
- Oh yes, he's asleep.

1995

Right on the pool table.

It's too sweet.

02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,440
- Well, I better get
back downstairs.

1998

Janet will be
wondering where I am.

- What about father?

2000
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:35,520
- Let him sleep.

2001
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,600
- Well, Dodo, push the door!

2002
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:44,320
Or get one of the
servants to open it.

2003

signed over to me.

done before me

02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,440
some of my guests are
in the hospital,

2086
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,080
dead butterflies everywhere

2087
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:33,320
and Elias is in some
kind of trouble.

2088
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:36,360
- I wanted to tell you
about Elias last night.

2089
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,240
- What?

2090
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:42,200
- Have you ever heard of
someone named Byron Macumber?

2091
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:45,400
- No, why?

2092
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,120
- Well he was arrested

2093
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,200
for leaking inside information.

2094
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:51,080
It's in all the morning papers.

2095
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,400
Elias was mentioned.

2096
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:56,400
Not accused but the
implication is unmistakable.

2097
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,720
- Well that's illegal.

2098
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,000
- It would be pretty bad.

2099
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,120
- I just wish he'd been
honest with me.

2100
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:07,440
There weren't supposed to be
any more secrets between us.

2101
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:13,200
We're leaving for Europe today.

2102
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,200
Look, Gus, if you need me,

2103
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:17,840
if anything comes up
about Lefty,

2104
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,440
you just call Max Luby,
he'll know how to reach us.

2105
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:23,040
- I don't want you to worry,

2106
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:24,360
especially about Lefty.

2107
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,840
You just take care of yourself.

2108
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,560
- You're a good friend, Gus.

2109
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:32,800
The only one I have.

2110
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,160
I'll miss you.

2111
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,200
- I'll miss you too.

2112
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:41,240
[somber music]

2113
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,240
- This is Mr. Renthall,
put me through.

2114
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,040
Larry.

2115
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,080
I just wanted you to know

2116
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:04,400
that I'm leaving the
country for awhile.

2117
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,080
In case you're sweating,

2118
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,240
I never squeal on a friend.

2119
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:11,080
- That's very gentlemanly
of you, Elias.

2120
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,680
- Well that's what
people like us are.

2121
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:15,880
Gents, right?

2122
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,920
[pleasant music]

2123
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:36,600
- Mrs. Renthall?

2124
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:37,880
Would you care for
something to drink?

2125
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,200
Coffee, tea.

2126
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,520
- Oh no.

2127
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,080
I've had enough bad
coffee and weak tea

2128
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:44,840
at 30 thousand feet to
last me a lifetime.

2129
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,240
Thanks anyway.

2130
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:48,880
[somber music]

2131
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:00,200
[dial tone buzzing]

2132
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,760
[sighing]

2133
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,040
- Well there's no answer
at the loft or the gallery

2134
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:08,320
and the machine's not on.

2135
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:12,640
- You look terrible.

2136
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:13,440
Do you know that?

2137
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:14,480
Simply terrible.

2138
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:19,400
- Wow, I must be such a
disappointment to you, Mother.

2139
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:20,720
How embarrassing to
have a daughter

2140
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,800
who is so emotionally unstable.

2141
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,040
- Justine, you don't have to
over dramatize the situation.

2142
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:30,880
- Bernie's left me and it hurts!

2143
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,320
Weren't you hurt when
father left you

2144
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:36,160
or wasn't that proper behavior?

2145
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:38,120
- Of course it hurt.

2146
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:41,360
But in our family, personal
misfortunes are not fodder

2147
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,840
for public consumption.

2148
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:46,400
I dealt with it silently

2149
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:49,800
and I kept my dignity.

2150
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,160
- How are you gonna keep
your precious dignity

2151
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,240
when Hubey dies?

2152
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:57,880
Your son's personal
misfortune is AIDS.

2153
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,720
Not a wounded ego.

2154
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,080
- He does not have that disease,
Justine,

2155
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:04,280
and I don't want you
saying that to anyone.

2156
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,040
It's just not true!

2157
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:11,400
Now you go and you pull
yourself together

2158
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,280
and you meet me at Campbell's

2159
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:16,560
to go over some arrangements
for your grandfather.

2160
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,840
Whatever we do, it should
be extremely private.

2161
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:20,720
- What else?

2162
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,440
- Yes, Jane?

2163
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,760
- A Mr. Juanito Perez
is on the phone.

2164
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:28,760
- Who?

2165
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,480
- Hubey's lover, Mother.

2166
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,760
- You know how I loath
that kind of talk, Justine.

2167
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,800
You answer it.

2168
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,960
- Hello, Juanito, it's
Justine, what is it?

2169
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,560
[ominous music]

2170
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,480
- It was good of you, Gus,
to come by

2171
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,080
and take me out for a
breath of air.

2172
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:01,560
- It's nothing, Lil.

2173
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:03,760
- Well the doctor prescribed
something for my nerves

2174
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:07,360
but I honestly don't know
what's to become of me.

2175
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:11,680
Father dying and now
Hubey's ill.

2176
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,200
Cancer.

2177
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:20,400
I don't know how I can
live without my son, Gus.

2178
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,120
I mean, know one knows
really what we had.

2179
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,200
I adored him.

2180
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,520
I absolutely adored him.

2181
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:30,520
Then no one knows more about
that kind of thing than you do.

2182
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:33,120
- Give Hubey my best.

2183
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:34,920
Tell him I'll come see
him tomorrow.

2184
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,120
- Well, at least your
grandfather died

2185
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:43,720
with a smile on his face.

2186
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,960
- He always said that a good
cigar was better than sex.

2187
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,240
[laughing]

2188
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:53,240
- He was feebleminded,
wasn't he?

2189
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,840
- Juanito, before my
mother arrives.

2190
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:59,880
- Don't ask me to leave.

2191
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,000
- No, never.

2192
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:03,920
Would you take out your earring?

2193
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:06,800
- But you gave it to me.

2194
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:08,680
- I know

2195
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,600
but the diamond is from my
mother's engagement ring.

2196
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,280
She gave it to me
when she thought

2197
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,920
I was going to marry
Violet Bastito.

2198
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,640
[chuckling]

2199
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:21,160
- Well she would never
recognize it now.

2200
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,520
But if it makes you happy.

2201
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,240
[groaning]

2202
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,680
- Juanito,

2203
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:44,880
this is my mother.

2204
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:48,120
Mother,

2205
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,440
this is Juanito Perez.

2206
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:52,960
- Hello, how are you?

2207
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
- Mrs. Altemus.

2208
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:56,920
- My word.

2209
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:01,080
The World Trade Center
just out the window.

2210
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:06,320
Prettier angle from here than
from Uncle Laurance's boat.

2211
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,480
- Yes, much.

2212
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:14,280
By the way, we're going to
scatter your grandfather's ashes

2213
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,080
from his boat on the north side.

2214
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,600
He had his happiest days
there as a child.

2215
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:22,520
- How is Dodo taking it?

2216
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:25,920
- She's coping.

2217
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:28,880
We're all coping.

2218
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
- I'm gonna split.

2219
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:37,200
I'll come back later.

2220
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:40,760
Goodbye, Mrs. Altemus.

2221
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:49,440
[door closing]

2222
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,440
- I brought you some magazines

2223
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,200
and I thought you'd
like that new book

2224
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:56,920
on the Princesses of Monaco.

2225
02:13:58,680 --> 02:13:59,520
- Thank you.

2226
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:03,360
- Well,

2227
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:06,000
I'm going to let you sleep now.

2228
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,680
[ominous music]

2229
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,440
[pills clinking]

2230
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:15,040
[dramatic music]

2231
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:24,400
[groaning]

2232
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:27,120
[ominous music]

2233
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:31,600
[water sloshing]

2234
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:38,800
- Maybe you oughta call Gus.

2235
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:40,800
Ask him to do another
article about us.

2236
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,960
Talk about our charity work.

2237
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,880
Now might be a good time.

2238
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,360
- Don't think Gus is
the kind of guy

2239
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:49,680
who will do a puff piece
on us this moment in time.

2240
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,960
- Why not?

2241
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,360
You're friends, aren't you?

2242
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,600
I called Max this morning.

2243
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,720
I told him to sell the plane.

2244
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:02,400
No sense on holding on to
anything that they can seize.

2245
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:03,840
Rent is my new policy,

2246
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:06,160
whether it's sails,
sores or screws.

2247
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:10,080
- How do I fit into
that new policy?

2248
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:11,840
Am I rented?

2249
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,240
- I meant the plane.

2250
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,640
I meant this boat.

2251
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:17,680
I didn't mean you.

2252
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,240
- Well I guess it's
better to rent something

2253
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:23,280
than to steal it.

2254
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,000
- What the hell does that mean?

2255
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:26,920
- You're the brains around here,

2256
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,680
why don't you figure it out?

2257
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:31,760
Don't.

2258
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,640
I promised myself if a
man ever laid

2259
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:38,160
a hand on me again ever,

2260
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:39,880
I'd kill him.

2261
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:48,840
For your information, Gus
explained things to me.

2262
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,040
Something you never
bothered to do.

2263
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:50,920
- Explained what?

2264
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,120
- About how you were
paying off Byron Macumber.

2265
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,040
- He doesn't know about that.

2266
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,640
Nobody knows about that.

2267
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:02,880
- I spoke to Gus yesterday.

2268
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,480
He told me Macumber was
just the well known tip

2269
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:07,160
of the the well known iceberg.

2270
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:09,000
Elias,

2271
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:13,080
the SCC has enough
information to press charges.

2272
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,440
- I'm gonna need you to help me,
Ruby.

2273
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,680
We're a team, remember?

2274
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,880
- What do you want me to do,
Elias?

2275
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,640
- Swear to my lies, if it
comes to that.

2276
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,360
- No.

2277
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,040
No, Elias, not that.

2278
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,000
No.

2279
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,440
- Mother sends her love.

2280
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:53,720
She'd come by but she just
can't cope after her last visit.

2281
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:55,640
- It doesn't matter.

2282
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,360
- Of course it matters, Hubey.

2283
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:01,600
- Justine?

2284
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:07,440
About my inheritance,

2285
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,600
you don't need money and
certainly Mother doesn't.

2286
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:14,320
So I'm leaving it
all to Juanito.

2287
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,640
- You can't, Hubey.

2288
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,480
- I never thought I'd hear
you say that, Justine.

2289
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:23,280
- Leave him 500 thousand,
even a million,

2290
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,720
but not the whole thing, Hubey?

2291
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,600
Uncle Laurance will just
take it to court

2292
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,640
and call it undo
influence by Juanito.

2293
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,880
He'll use everything he
can to discredit him.

2294
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,000
- I love Juanito

2295
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,320
and that's what I'm going to do.

2296
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,640
Besides, I hired my
own attorney.

2297
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,360
One of our kind.

2298
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:46,720
It won't be so easy for Uncle
Laurance to win this one.

2299
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,920
- But all of your money, Hubey.

2300
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:54,960
You could leave some to
medical research.

2301
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,920
- I know but

2302
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:00,080
there's just
something inside of me

2303
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:03,600
that wants to get even
with Uncle Laurance.

2304
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:07,480
All my life he made me
feel like I was worthless.

2305
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:10,120
Juanito never made me
feel that way.

2306
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:18,560
So what's with your
TV announcer?

2307
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:20,840
Has mother insist
upon calling him?

2308
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:25,920
- Well he's up some
tropical isle.

2309
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:29,560
Wherever it is your go to get
a quickie divorce these days.

2310
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:31,080
- Are you taking it okay?

2311
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:34,160
- Well,

2312
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:35,720
I loved him

2313
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:38,000
and someday I hope I
can forget him.

2314
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:40,600
[chuckling]

2315
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,920
Yeah, won't be easy.

2316
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:43,960
I'm pregnant.

2317
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,680
- Does Bernie know?

2318
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:53,600
- No and Mother doesn't either.

2319
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:58,560
- Are you going to
have the baby?

2320
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:59,440
- Oh yes

2321
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,680
and I'm going to be a
wonderful mother.

2322
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,960
[laughing]

2323
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:13,760
And you know what I'm going to
name the baby if it's a boy?

2324
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:16,720
Hubert Altemus Slatkin.

2325
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,600
[somber music]

2326
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
- It has a certain
insouciant charm.

2327
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:31,320
[dramatic music]

2328
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:35,680
- I love being your sister,
Hubey.

2329
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:39,200
And I am so proud of you.

2330
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,280
[dramatic music]

2331
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:52,080
[pleasant organ music]

2332
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:01,720
- [Lil] Wouldn't you
think they could afford

2333
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,320
some heat in this church?

2334
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:05,840
- [Justine] Yes, Mother.

2335
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,240
- [Lil] The lilacs are lovely.

2336
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:11,200
- [Justine] Yes, Mother,
thank you.

2337
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:39,600
[speaking foreign language]

2338
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:40,480
- Amen.

2339
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:43,360
- What is that man doing here?

2340
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,880
Who asked him?

2341
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:47,920
- You don't have to be
invited to a funeral, Mother.

2342
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,400
The church is a public place.

2343
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,800
He has much right to be
here as we have.

2344
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:56,520
- Juanito.

2345
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,600
- That's the lover.

2346
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:15,760
- Did you notice the
whole family ignored him?

2347
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:17,560
- Well everyone knows
he died from.

2348
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:22,240
- Even though the obit
in the times said cancer.

2349
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:26,520
- I do not want that man
at my house afterward.

2350
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:30,400
Thank God we'll never have
to hear from him again.

2351
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:32,800
- Well that's what you think,
Mother.

2352
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:34,960
Hubey left
everything to Juanito.

2353
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,320
- What?!

2354
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,520
- Will you please rise?

2355
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:49,920
The Lord is my Shepard I
shall not want.

2356
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:54,440
He maketh me to lie
down in green.

2357
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:55,360
- Oh, there's Gus.

2358
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:58,760
Make sure you ask him to
come by, Justine.

2359
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:00,520
- Yes, Mother.

2360
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:02,560
- No one, else.

2361
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,040
I repeat, no one.

2362
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:09,760
- Juanito.

2363
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,680
- I know how hard this
must be for you.

2364
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:15,880
It is for me too.

2365
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,680
We both lost someone we love.

2366
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:23,920
- Thank you for saying that,
Justine.

2367
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,880
- How could you even
speak to that man?

2368
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:39,480
- He was my brother's
friend and heir.

2369
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,000
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

2370
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,480
My dear son would never have
done anything like that.

2371
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:46,840
It's not only the money but
those Charles the Tenths chairs

2372
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:49,400
are from the Altemus
side of the family

2373
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:50,280
via Aunt Willaby.

2374
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,720
Well, Uncle Laurance will just
contest the will, that's all.

2375
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:58,160
- It's what Hubey wanted,
Mother.

2376
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:00,760
Can't you at least
respect his last wishes?

2377
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,560
- And have that man think
he is one of us?

2378
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,440
Never.

2379
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:07,400
- Well Hubey was one of us.

2380
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:11,160
- Yes, he was.

2381
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:15,560
[dramatic music]

2382
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,200
[somber music]

2383
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:35,200
- I wanna go back to New York,
Elias.

2384
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:39,040
I can't stand hiding like
this any longer.

2385
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:43,320
I wanna go back and face the
music, noisy as it may be.

2386
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:45,960
- You know what that means.

2387
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,960
Not only did I got to jail
but I'd have to give back

2388
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,480
everything I made and more.

2389
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:52,800
Where does that leave you?

2390
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,720
- I've been poor most of
my life, Elias.

2391
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:58,880
I can take care of myself.

2392
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,720
- I wanted to take care of you,
Ruby.

2393
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,800
[somber music]

2394
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:43,960
- You have to walk home
from parties, Gus?

2395
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,480
Don't you have a limo or
a private station wagon?

2396
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:48,840
- I don't even have a bicycle,
Bernie.

2397
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,440
Sorry to hear about
your and Justine.

2398
02:25:50,480 --> 02:25:51,960
- I'm sorry too.

2399
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I'll miss Justine but she
deserved better.

2400
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,360
- Are you going away?

2401
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:57,360
- No, Justine's put the
apartment up for sale

2402
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:59,160
and she wanted me to get
the rest of my junk out.

2403
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,160
Network sent a car for me.

2404
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,440
Hop in, I'll give you
a ride home.

2405
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:02,280
- Thanks.

2406
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:12,040
According to Dodo, Lil
wanted to sue Juanito.

2407
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:14,240
Laurance thought it would be
bad publicity for the family,

2408
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:15,320
so Lil dropped it.

2409
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:17,400
- The Van Degans are
a tough act.

2410
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,360
- They're all tough,
those people.

2411
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,600
- Tell me about it.

2412
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:22,520
Ormonde Van Degan dies
and they stash his body

2413
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,160
so as to not spoil the
First Lady's entrance.

2414
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,840
- Yeah, well, there's
a strong indifference

2415
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:28,320
to death everywhere, Bernie.

2416
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,200
- I know, Gus.

2417
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,480
It's about time for Lefty Flint

2418
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,600
to be getting out of jail,
isn't it?

2419
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:34,480
- So I heard.

2420
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:35,920
- How're you gonna handle that?

2421
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:39,680
- I'm gonna kill him.

2422
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:42,600
But first I'm gonna
call out his name

2423
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:45,520
because I want him looking at me

2424
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:47,760
and know who it was.

2425
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,200
- You're not really gonna
kill him, Gus, are you?

2426
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:56,040
- Of course I am.

2427
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,520
- I must tell you, Gus,

2428
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:07,120
I've heard that you've
started declining invitations.

2429
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:09,000
To Maisie's and Violet's.

2430
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,880
You don't return calls.

2431
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,600
You don't write thank you notes.

2432
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:17,880
I say this as a friend, Gus.

2433
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:19,600
No one will invite you anymore.

2434
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:21,000
- I don't care.

2435
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,120
- You don't care?

2436
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:25,160
- I've seen enough.

2437
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:28,560
- Well is it because of
what's happened

2438
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:30,920
to your friends, the Renthalls?

2439
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:35,240
I know you were especially
fond of what's her name, Ruby.

2440
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,560
- No, it's not that, Lil.

2441
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,600
- They never would have
fit in, you know, Gus.

2442
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,720
Money can not equate
with breading.

2443
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,280
- Well that may be my problem,
Lil,

2444
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:47,160
I've never cared enough
about either.

2445
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:50,760
- You must come to the country.

2446
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:53,040
Come to Violet's with
me this weekend.

2447
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:54,640
- I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.

2448
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:00,280
[people chattering]

2449
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,720
- Poor Lil, she's had so
much tragedy in her life.

2450
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:09,280
Make the most wonderful book.

2451
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:11,240
- I suppose Gus will
write it someday.

2452
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:14,080
Carefully changing all of our
names to protect the guilty.

2453
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,720
How disappointing.

2454
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:19,360
[somber music]

2455
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:09,480
- This was Hubey's jacket.

2456
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:11,600
- I always liked it.

2457
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:12,280
It's smart.

2458
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:15,440
- Why are you here,
Miss Altemus?

2459
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:18,560
- You really shouldn't
smoke, it's bad for you.

2460
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:27,320
- What do you want?

2461
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:29,680
- I'll pay you, whatever
you ask, for these.

2462
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,360
- They're not for sale,
they're my possessions.

2463
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,360
- It's really quite
charming here.

2464
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:40,200
But it's so cold.

2465
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,200
What do you think you're doing?

2466
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:50,920
Those are priceless chairs!

2467
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,040
Stop that!

2468
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,360
For God sake.

2469
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,240
What?

2470
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,040
Stop it.

2471
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,120
Stop that! Stop that!

2472
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:59,360
You just stop that!

2473
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:01,200
They're priceless!

2474
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,040
Stop that!

2475
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,400
- Now I can tell you,

2476
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:08,080
had you bothered to
speak civilly to me

2477
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:10,520
or offered me a seat at
Hubey's funeral

2478
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:12,880
or invited me back to your
home afterwards

2479
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:15,320
or if your lawyers hadn't
returned my letters unopened

2480
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:16,760
in which I offered to return

2481
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,600
the family heirlooms
I inherited,

2482
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:21,080
I would've give you
those chairs.

2483
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:23,720
But now there's no way.

2484
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,200
- Whatever did my
son see in you?

2485
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:32,440
- Love, Mrs. Altemus.

2486
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,320
Please leave, now.

2487
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:41,560
[dramatic music]

2488
02:30:57,400 --> 02:31:00,000
[somber music]

2489
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:33,640
- Senora,

2490
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,840
it's getting cold, I
brought you this.

2491
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,600
- Oh, Candalaria, thank you.

2492
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,320
That's so sweet of you.

2493
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:43,800
Sit here.

2494
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:45,640
- Oh no, no, no, gracias,
senora, no.

2495
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:49,360
- There's a woman over there.

2496
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:51,480
She sleeps here every night.

2497
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,320
I see her from my
bedroom window.

2498
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:57,480
Later, when it gets dark,

2499
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:01,200
I want her to give you this.

2500
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,240
- Oh, no, no, no, that's
too much, senora.

2501
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,560
- No, no it's not.

2502
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:09,240
Imagine what she must
think every night,

2503
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:10,680
looking up to where we live.

2504
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:23,560
- Ruby?

2505
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,400
Hello.

2506
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:26,680
- Justine.

2507
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:29,320
Oh, Justine, it is so
good to see you again.

2508
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:30,360
- You too.

2509
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:32,120
Well do you mind if I join you?

2510
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,000
- I'd love it.

2511
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:38,080
I just had an urge to sit here
and look up at my own house.

2512
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,400
Too big, I've decided.

2513
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:45,000
I was so sorry to hear
about your brother.

2514
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,680
- Yeah, well, thank you
for the lovely flowers.

2515
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:48,720
That was very thoughtful.

2516
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:50,560
- Somehow flowers
never seem enough.

2517
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,520
How is your mother handling it?

2518
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,680
- Well, she'll recover,
she always does.

2519
02:32:57,720 --> 02:33:00,080
Just takes some of us a
little longer, that's all.

2520
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:04,080
- Well at least you have
Bernie to help you through it.

2521
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:07,200
- Well, Ruby,

2522
02:33:07,240 --> 02:33:09,400
he finally told me his
deep dark secret.

2523
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:12,120
He wanted a divorce.

2524
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:13,000
- Oh, Justine.

2525
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:15,480
- But

2526
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:19,080
one wonderful thing did
happen while we were together.

2527
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,440
I'm gonna have a child.

2528
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:22,600
- Oh, how wonderful.

2529
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:23,560
- Thank you.

2530
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:26,000
- Oh, I've always
wanted children.

2531
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,160
A whole house full.

2532
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:27,840
- Me too.

2533
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:31,040
But I think one's just
fine for now.

2534
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:33,880
[laughing]

2535
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:34,720
Ruby,

2536
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:38,320
I want you to know how
much I admire you.

2537
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:43,320
No matter how hard Mother
and the rest of the old guard

2538
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,520
try to keep you out,

2539
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:48,360
you always fought back
and never let them win.

2540
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:52,600
All my life I wanted to
stand up to them

2541
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:56,240
and make them accept me
for who I was

2542
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:00,000
but I just never
found the courage.

2543
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:04,320
- You're wrong about me,
Justine.

2544
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:07,040
Oh, I wanted them to like me

2545
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:09,760
but for who I'd become,
not for who I really was.

2546
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:12,840
But it's over.

2547
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,800
Now I can go back to
being myself

2548
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,240
whether they like it or not.

2549
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:22,000
- Well you make it
sound so easy.

2550
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,600
- No.

2551
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,400
It isn't easy at all.

2552
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:38,040
- Well, I guess I
better be going.

2553
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,760
It was really very good
to see you again, Ruby.

2554
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:41,800
- Oh, good luck, Justine.

2555
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:42,640
- Thank you.

2556
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:43,920
- With everything.

2557
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:45,000
You stay in touch.

2558
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,880
- You too.

2559
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:59,160
- How very sweet, Gus.

2560
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,160
- They're from my terrace.

2561
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:03,280
- I'll go put them in water.

2562
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:04,720
Can I get you
something to drink?

2563
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:05,800
Ice tea?

2564
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,040
- No thanks, I can't stay long.

2565
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:08,280
I just came by to wish you luck

2566
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:09,720
when Elias' trial starts.

2567
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:13,440
If you need anything, I'll
be in the courtroom everyday.

2568
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:15,360
- You're a good friend, Gus.

2569
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:16,240
- So are you.

2570
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:23,720
- [Ruby] Anything new with
Lefty or his girlfriend?

2571
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:24,640
- No, nothing new.

2572
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:26,480
Still behind bars.

2573
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:30,600
Take care.

2574
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:39,280
[crowd commotion]

2575
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,520
- I've realized I've committed
a very serious crime.

2576
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:42,800
- Don't say too much.

2577
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,880
- I can only hope that by
accepting responsibility

2578
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,280
for what I've done,

2579
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:49,880
I can easy the anguish that
I have cause my friends,

2580
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,400
my colleagues and most of all,
my wife.

2581
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:54,080
- How much are you worth
at present, Mr. Renthall?

2582
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,360
- [Male Reporter] Any
comment from Mrs. Renthall?

2583
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:56,640
- [Lawyer] No comment!

2584
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,720
- It's impossible for any
observer not to notice

2585
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:00,040
the courage of Mrs. Renthall.

2586
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,800
She is a model of rectitude
at her husband's side

2587
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:04,560
every time he's
appeared in court.

2588
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:07,880
Silent, supportive, her eyes
hidden behind dark glasses.

2589
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:10,680
Betraying little emotion
but admirable strength,

2590
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:13,480
Ruby Renthall must be anxiously
awaiting the court's ruling

2591
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:16,120
as the case against her
husband, Elias Renthall,

2592
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:17,960
draws to its final conclusion.

2593
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
That wraps up this
evening's edition of Focus.

2594
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:20,960
I'm Bernard Slatkin.

2595
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,320
Goodnight.

2596
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:25,040
[knocking]

2597
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:25,920
- [Ruby] Come in.

2598
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:35,320
- I just wanted to say
goodnight and thanks.

2599
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:37,120
Whatever happens tomorrow,
happens.

2600
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:41,920
- Why don't you stay in
here tonight?

2601
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,080
- Really?

2602
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,680
- Really.

2603
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:53,240
[dramatic music]

2604
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,560
- [Woman] Step back, please,
excuse me.

2605
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:21,080
[crowd commotion]

2606
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,360
- Your crime, Mr. Renthall,
is too serious

2607
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:26,360
to forgive and forget.

2608
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,960
It would be a terrible
precedent for this court

2609
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,480
to allow you to go unpunished.

2610
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:34,360
Breaking the law is
breaking the law.

2611
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:37,080
I have taken into consideration

2612
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:39,040
the work you have done
for the homeless

2613
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:41,000
for the last few months.

2614
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:44,560
Never the less, I feel it
is my duty to sentence you

2615
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:47,200
to five years in
Allenwood Prison.

2616
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:50,080
[crowd commotion]

2617
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:02,280
- I'm not gonna keep the
apartment, Elias.

2618
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:04,320
- Why don't you move back out
to Rhinelander for awhile?

2619
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:06,800
- Well I was thinking of moving
out to the country house.

2620
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:10,160
- You'll miss your friends
stuck way out there.

2621
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:11,800
- Gus is the only friend I have.

2622
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:13,560
I will miss him.

2623
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:16,720
Maybe he'll come out for
a weekend now and then.

2624
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:21,120
- Maybe you'll come and see
me for a weekend now and then.

2625
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:25,880
- You know I will.

2626
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:28,360
[crowd commotion]

2627
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:30,120
- [Reporter] Right now!
Right now!

2628

[crowd commotion]

2629
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:43,640
- I'm not gonna get out.

2630
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:45,360
- No, of course not.

2631
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,080
I can't find the words to
tell you how sorry I am

2632
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:53,040
that I put you through all this.

2633
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:54,640
- I know you are.

2634
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:57,200
- And you know that I love you,
don't you?

2635
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:58,760
- I know that too.

2636
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,760
[report smooching]

2637
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:06,880
Elias,

2638
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:12,320
you've been great to me,
I will never forget that.

2639
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:15,840
- [Female Reporter]
Here he comes.

2640
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:18,680

[somber music]

2643
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,840
- [PA Announcer] Dr.
Barron to radiology.

2644
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:56,000
Dr. Barron to radiology.

2645
02:39:58,640 --> 02:39:59,840
- [Man] Hi, Justine.

2646
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:00,880
- Hi, Billy.

2647
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:05,440
Would anyone like me
to write them a letter

2648
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,280
or call someone?

2649
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:10,640
- Justine?

2650
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:11,520
Justine?

2651
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:15,680
Don't you recognize me?

2652
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:18,520
Do I look that bad?

2653
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:23,160
- Oh, Juanito.

2654
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:24,080
I didn't know.

2655
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:26,800
- How're you doing, Justine?

2656
02:40:29,080 --> 02:40:32,360
- Well, I'm counting the
days till my baby arrives

2657
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:34,800
and I'm inviting you to
the christening right now.

2658
02:40:34,840 --> 02:40:37,160
[chuckling]

2659
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:40,800
- You know those Charles
the Tenth chairs

2660
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:42,200
your mother wanted back?

2661
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:47,680
Well I left them out on
the sidewalk one at a time

2662
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:52,360
for people who take junk
to furnish their places.

2663
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:55,320
[laughing]

2664
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:58,280
Eleven poor people have
some priceless chairs

2665
02:40:58,320 --> 02:40:59,680
if they only knew of it.

2666
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:02,680
- Well Hubey would like that.

2667
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,680
- Justine, about the
money he left me.

2668
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,200
- Juanito, I don't
care about that.

2669
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:12,600
That was Hubey's money and
he wanted you to have it.

2670
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:16,440
- I had Hubey's lawyer
come down to the loft

2671
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:18,080
before I got so sick.

2672
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:23,800
Hubey's money is going
to a hospice.

2673
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:27,240
Some place for people who have
nobody to take care of them.

2674
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:28,920
- Juanito.

2675
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:35,520
- Your brother was the only one

2676
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:37,360
who ever loved me in
my whole life.

2677
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,080
- Don't you have any family

2678
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:42,000
that you want me to get
in touch with?

2679
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,320
- There's only my aunt

2680
02:41:45,440 --> 02:41:47,240
but she doesn't want to
hear from me.

2681
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:50,200
- I'm so sorry, Juanito.

2682
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:52,680
- I'm afraid to die, Justine.

2683
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:54,840
Hubey wasn't.

2684
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:59,440
- That's because he had you.

2685
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:02,160
And now you have me.

2686
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:06,320
[dramatic music]

2687
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:07,840
- I want you to have this.

2688
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:12,320
Your father gave it
to your mother

2689
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,000
and Hubey gave it to me.

2690
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,040
I want you to give it
to your child

2691
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:26,080
so he can give it to
someone who he loves.

2692
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:35,320
- Thank you for loving
my brother, Juanito.

2693
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:38,120
[dramatic music]

2694
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:46,120

[ominous music]

2698
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:04,400
- I can't bear that he's out.

2699
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:08,520
I can't bear that he
should be happy.

2700
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:10,080
- Sometimes I wonder why
they ever searched us

2701
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,640
when we entered that courtroom.

2702
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,760
Would've been so easy.

2703
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:17,200
- What would've been so easy?

2704
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,080
- Pow.

2705
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:26,960
- I'm gonna call
Detective Jackson.

2706
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,880
Ever since that letter, I know
that bastard's coming here.

2707
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:33,280
I want a guard put
on this house.

2708
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:38,480
- I don't want you to worry,
Peach.

2709
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:40,840
He'll never come here.

2710
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:44,720
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

2711
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:50,680
- The geraniums are dying.

2712
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:53,440
You can hardly kill a geranium.

2713
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:57,840
Not enough tender loving care,
I suppose.

2714
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:01,320
Not enough TLC.

2715
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:06,560
- So long.

2716
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:12,440
- You sound like you're
going on a trip.

2717
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:15,040
- No.

2718
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:17,560
- Gus,

2719
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:18,600
are you all right?

2720
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:21,120
- Goodbye, Peach.

2721
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:25,040
[ominous music]

2722
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:46,200
[knocking]

2723
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:47,400
- [Marguerite] Who is it?

2724
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:48,520
- Gus Bailey.

2725
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,200
- Just go away, Mr. Bailey.

2726
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:56,640
- Not until I see Lefty.

2727
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:00,760
[ominous music]

2728
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:17,480
- I should've listened to you,
Mr. Bailey.

2729
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,720
You were just trying to help me.

2730
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:26,000
But I didn't want to hear.

2731
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:26,840
- Oh my God.

2732
02:46:27,960 --> 02:46:29,520
I've gotta get you to an
emergency room.

2733
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:30,400
- I'll be okay.

2734
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,000
He used me, you know,

2735
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:38,440
just to have a place to
crash for awhile

2736
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:39,800
when he got out of prison.

2737
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:43,080
I guess I got off easy.

2738
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:43,960
- Where is he?

2739
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:49,440
- He left about half
an hour ago.

2740
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:52,200
- You don't know where he went?

2741
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:54,640
- Wherever Ruby Renthall is,
I guess.

2742
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:56,160
Ever since she
testified against him,

2743
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:57,880
she's all he ever talks about.

2744
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,200
- I've gotta use your phone.

2745
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:00,080
- Sure.

2746
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,880
- Hello?

2747
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,880
- Hello, Candalaria, this
is Gus Bailey.

2748
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:10,920
- Mrs. Renthall is not at home.

2749
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:11,960
She went to the city

2750
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,800
and I don't think she'll
be back tonight.

2751
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:15,480
- Is she at the Rhinelander?

2752
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:16,880
- I don't know, Mr. Bailey.

2753
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:18,240
- Well if you talk to her,

2754
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:20,400
tell her Mr. Flint has left town

2755
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,760
and may be coming to see her.

2756
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:23,320
Tell her to be careful.

2757
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:24,880
Very careful!

2758
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:25,720
- [Candalaria] Yes, sir.

2759
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:26,760
I'll tell her.

2760
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,640
Goodbye.

2761
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:32,320
[crowd commotion]

2762
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:38,240
- The fabulous paintings
the Renthall's collected

2763
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:39,560
in record time

2764
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:42,360
are now being disposed
of in even less time

2765
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:46,480
inside the prestigious Charles
and Charles Auction House.

2766
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:48,880
And the vast Renthall
apartment has been bought by

2767
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:51,200
an anonymous speculator
who plans to divide it

2768
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,800
into three smaller dwellings.

[ominous music]

2776
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:51,560
- Nice to see you again, Mrs.
Renthall.

2777
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,560
- It's nice to see you
again too, Mike.

2778
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,600
I have a favor to ask of you.

2779
02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:02,560
Think maybe I could take one
last look at our old apartment?

2780
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:05,120
I know it's late and it's
probably not allowed but

2781
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:07,200
do you think, maybe?

2782
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:12,960
- Well, I'm not supposed
to but sure, why not?

2783
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,320
The electricity's still on

2784
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:16,760
and you can take a good
long look around the place.

2785
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:19,400
Though you may not
recognize it much anymore.

2786
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:20,440
- [Ruby] Thank you, Mike.

2787
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:21,400
- Now come with me.

2788
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,400
I'll have to let you
in upstairs.

2789
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:34,520
[ominous music]

2790
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,200
- Here , let me give you a
hand with that.

2791
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:37,360
Looks like you could use a hand.

2792
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:39,040
- Oh, thank you very much.

2793
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:43,320
[keys jingling]

2794
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:45,120
Thank you again, young man.

2795
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:46,920
- I'd be happy to carry them
to the elevator for you,

2796
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:47,680
if you want.

2797
02:51:47,720 --> 02:51:48,600
- Oh, no, there's no need.

2798
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:49,800
- Whatever you say.

2799
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:51,240
- Oh.

2800
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:53,920
Well, if you wouldn't
mind, just to the elevator.

2801
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:54,800
- Sure.
- Thank you.

2802
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:58,960

[thudding]

2805
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:15,800
- Mike?

2806
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:21,800
[eerie music]

2807
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:56,720
[pleasant instrumental music]

2808
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:26,000
[ominous music]

2809
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:29,640
- Imagine having your
own ballroom.

2810
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,120
You did good, Ruby,

2811
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:33,080
for a stewardess.

2812
02:53:34,560 --> 02:53:35,400
- Lefty.

2813
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:39,000
What do you want?

2814
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:42,280
- Your forgiveness, of course.

2815
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:46,440
I forgave you for testifying
at my parol hearing

2816
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:48,960
and now it's your
turn to forgive.

2817
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,680
[ominous music]

2818
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:58,320
I want to hear you say it, Ruby.

2819
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:03,880
And if you don't,

2820
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,800
I'll make you scream it!

2821
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:10,160
[ominous music]

2822
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:13,760
- I laughed at my husband
when he gave me this.

2823
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:16,720
He said to me over
and over again,

2824
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:18,000
"There are crazy
people in the world

2825
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:19,840
"who are out to get
people like us."

2826
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,080
A smart man, my husband.

2827
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:25,760
[chuckling]

2828
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:29,200
- Not so smart, he went and
wound up in jail just like me.

2829
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:31,960
- There's one big difference.

2830
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,160
He can pay back the money.

2831
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:39,600
You can never give back
the life you took.

2832
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:44,560
Don't you come another step
near me, you son of a bitch.

2833
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:46,000
- Hold it, Lefty.

2834
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:54,400
You can't imagine how
long I've waited for this.

2835
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:00,040
- I paid my dept, Bailey.

2836
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:01,440
- You haven't begun to pay.

2837
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:04,240
An eye for an eye.

2838
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:06,240
Isn't that what the Bible says?

2839
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:08,480
- It also preaches forgiveness.

2840
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:09,880
- I never got to that part.

2841
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:14,960
- Killing me will not
bring Becky back.

2842
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:18,280
- I never thought it would.

2843
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:19,920
[ominous music]

2844
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:20,760
[gun clicking]

2845
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:21,600
- Gus!

[booming]

[dramatic music]

2848
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:44,760
- You're right.

2849
02:55:44,800 --> 02:55:45,800
You bastard.

2850
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:49,400
Killing you would never
bring her back.

2851
02:56:07,240 --> 02:56:09,040
- [Gus Voiceover] Dear Peach.

2852
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:11,840
It's rather ironic I should
be sent to Vacaville Prison

2853
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:14,280
where Lefty Flint, I am
pleased to say,

2854
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:15,920
is remembered without affection.

2855
02:56:17,440 --> 02:56:20,200
For the first time in
years I feel calm.

2856
02:56:21,280 --> 02:56:23,120
Lefty is no longer in
my thoughts.

2857
02:56:24,440 --> 02:56:25,640
All those nights in New York

2858
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,960
when I was talking
about one thing

2859
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,040
and thinking another.

2860
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:31,920
How strange life is.

2861
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:35,720
The way I planned it, I'd
probably be here 20 years

2862
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:37,080
for murdering Lefty Flint.

2863
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:40,360
Instead, I'm here for
wanting to kill him.

2864
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:43,000
"Intent to kill,"
they called it.

2865
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:46,160
But you know something, Peach,

2866
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:50,160
at the very end, when
he came at me,

2867
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:54,160
even then I knew I
couldn't kill him.

2868
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:58,720
Life never is the way
you imagined it to be.

2869
02:56:59,640 --> 02:57:00,680
The good and the bad.

2870
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:03,200
You know what I think?

2871
02:57:04,320 --> 02:57:06,440
I think it's possible to
be happy again.

2872
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:09,080
Even here.

2873
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:12,080
With love, Gus.

2874
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:16,960
- I told you, you don't need
to keep coming back here, Ruby.

2875
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,480
- You're always telling
me that and I come anyway.

2876
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:22,080
Do you need anything?

2877
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:22,720
- No.

2878
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:26,920
This place isn't the
Rhinelander but I'm okay.

2879
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:27,800
Now how about you?

2880
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:29,040
I told Max to look out for you.

2881
02:57:29,080 --> 02:57:30,520
If you need anything,
anything at all.

2882
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:31,480
- I'm fine, Elias.

2883
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:34,960
I told you, I can take
care of myself.

2884
02:57:35,960 --> 02:57:37,200
- You always could, Ruby.

2885
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:43,440
Well,

2886
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:46,360
I gotta go back inside.

2887
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:51,440
I love you, Ruby.

2888
02:57:55,640 --> 02:57:56,480
- I love you too.

2889
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:00,280
- [Max] How's he doing?

2890
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:01,440
- [Ruby] He seems fine.

2891
02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:05,040
- [Max] Elias wants you to
be happy, Ruby.

2892
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:06,800
It's all he's ever wanted.

2893
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:07,800
- I know, Max.

2894
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,040
I want that for him too.

2895
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:12,680
I just don't need
the same things

2896
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:14,480
Elias needs to be happy anymore.

2897
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:18,640
But I won't get a divorce.

2898
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,720
Not until he's released.

2899
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:21,720
He's been too good to me.

2900
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:23,720
I owe him at least that.

2901
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:24,560
- I understand.

2902
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,400
- Paris is over, my dear.

2903
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:40,080
Hundreds and hundreds of
dollars for one room at the Ritz

2904
02:58:40,120 --> 02:58:41,720
and not even suite.

2905
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:43,600
And those ghastly common women

2906
02:58:43,640 --> 02:58:45,520
with those horrid little dogs

2907
02:58:45,560 --> 02:58:47,840
having lunch at the Rally Plaza.

2908
02:58:47,880 --> 02:58:50,400
And Arabs everywhere.

2909
02:58:50,440 --> 02:58:51,840
And the clothes are a disaster.

2910
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:53,080
Skirts up to here.

2911
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:54,120
It's just ridiculous.

2912
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:56,720
- Well I have some news for you,
mother.

2913
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:57,880
- Getting married again?

2914
02:58:57,920 --> 02:58:59,360
If you want to make your
mother really happy,

2915
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:00,880
that's what she wants to hear.

2916
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:04,200
- No, I'm not.

2917
02:59:05,800 --> 02:59:07,480
I've been asked to be the
executive head

2918
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:10,040
at the Hubert Altemus
Junior Hospice.

2919
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:12,560
- Well I believe that money

2920
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:14,160
should've been given
anonymously,

2921
02:59:14,200 --> 02:59:16,360
without anyone's name
being exploited.

2922
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:18,800
Is that your news?

2923
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:21,560
- Yes it is.

2924
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,680
- Well how long will
this Florence Nightingale

2925
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:26,720
performance of yours go on?

2926
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:28,600
- As long as I'm needed.

2927
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:30,560
- Well what about your baby?

2928
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:31,440
Your child?

2929
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:35,080
- My child has a name, Mother.

2930
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:36,640
He's six month old and
you've never called him

2931
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:38,400
anything but "your child,"
never Hubey.

2932
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:42,720
- That's not a very attractive
tone of voice, Justine!

2933
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:49,000
Parker, I think we'll just
have coffee in the living room

2934
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:51,880
and tell Gertie the
eggplant souffle was yummy.

2935
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:05,560
- Mother, I just wish you
would try to understand.

2936
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:07,480
All my life I've been identified

2937
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:09,360
as Laurance Van Degan's niece

2938
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:11,920
or Mrs. Van Degan Altemus'
daughter.

2939
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:14,240
Oh, or even worse, the
Van Degan heiress,

2940
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:16,320
as Dolly always refers
to me in her column.

2941
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:18,880
- And now you're just
Justine Slatkin.

2942
03:00:18,920 --> 03:00:20,640
- Yes, Mother, yes.

2943
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:24,080
Without even that terrible word
"socialite" in front of it.

2944
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:25,280
- Why can't they call it

2945
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:28,440
the "Juanito whatever
his name was Hospice?"

2946
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,080
- Goodbye, Mother.

2947
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:42,760
- You're not staying for coffee?

2948
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:44,080
- No, I'm not
staying for coffee.

2949
03:00:44,120 --> 03:00:46,360
I'm going home to my son.

2950
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:47,240
To Hubey.

2951
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:55,440
[somber music]

2952
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:02,200
- You love me, don't you?

2953
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:03,240
You love me.

2954
03:01:04,320 --> 03:01:06,080
You love me.

03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:30,600
[crying]

2957
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:35,680
[knocking]

2958
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:37,720
- Come on in, it's open.

2959
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:41,680
- Why didn't you tell
me you were out?

2960
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:43,080
I had to read about your release

2961
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:45,640
in Dolly Dulongpre's column,
thanks a lot.

2962
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:47,200
- Good to see you again, Ruby.

2963
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:48,920
- Same here.

2964
03:01:52,480 --> 03:01:53,320
What's all this?

2965
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:57,000
- I'm selling the
apartment, I'm moving on.

2966
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:58,400
- Where are you going?

2967
03:01:58,440 --> 03:01:59,720
- Oh, I don't know.

2968
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:01,040
A block or two away.

2969
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:01,920
Maybe.

2970
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:03,320
Maybe out of New York.

2971
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:04,840
I haven't decided.

2972
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:13,880
Why don't you and I
talk outside?

2973
03:02:15,400 --> 03:02:18,320
I can't tell you how good it
feels to be alive and free.

2974
03:02:19,440 --> 03:02:21,000
I was lucky to get out
in nine months.

2975
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:22,560
Good behavior.

2976
03:02:22,600 --> 03:02:23,520
How is Elias doing?

2977
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,880
- As well as can be expected.

2978
03:02:27,400 --> 03:02:29,480
Why didn't you answer any
of my letters?

2979
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:30,960
- Well, you had enough
on your mind.

2980
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,240
Didn't want you to
worry about me.

2981
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:34,320
- You saved my life, Gus.

2982
03:02:34,360 --> 03:02:36,280
- Yeah and my own too, I guess.

2983
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:40,040
- That's what Becky
would have wanted.

2984
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:42,560
- I know.

2985
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:44,480
I'm glad it's over.

2986
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:45,880
- So am I.

2987
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:49,240
Have you seen or heard
from any of the old crowd?

2988
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:50,360
[chuckling]
- Hardly.

2989
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:51,160
What about you?

2990
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:52,040
- Oh heavens, no.

2991
03:02:53,360 --> 03:02:54,680
- I tell you what,

2992
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:56,920
why don't we go over
to Clarence's

2993
03:02:56,960 --> 03:02:58,000
and see what happens?

2994
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:01,600
[laughing]

2995
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,240
- But I thought Elias as
bared from trading for life.

2996
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:06,440
- That's not to say

2997
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:08,840
he can't get somebody
else to trade for him.

2998
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:10,400
Max Luby, for instance,

2999
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:12,040
with Elias calling the shots.

3000
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:12,880
- I understand.

3001
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:14,240
- But let's talk about you.

3002
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:15,720
I hear you been keeping diaries.

3003
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:20,040
You know, the public loves to
read about people like you.

3004
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:22,400
- Ever since the dreadful
Stock Market crash,

3005
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:24,880
no one is buying odd.

3006
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:26,280
Which, of course, my dears,

3007
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:29,960
everyone knows is the
most sensible investment.

3008
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,840
- I heard Laurance Van
Degan knew the Stock Market

3009
03:03:32,880 --> 03:03:35,200
was going to crash
because Elias Renthall

3010
03:03:35,240 --> 03:03:37,920
called him from
prison and told him

3011
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:40,760
to get out of the
market a week ago.

3012
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,560
- Wish he called me.

3013
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:43,520
- Oh my dear word.

3014
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:46,880
Can you believe who just
walked into this restaurant?

3015
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:48,680
[people chattering]

3016
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:50,920
- Oh, I love all this drama.

3017
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:52,520
So much better than television.

3018
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:55,280
- [Ruby] So tell me, Gus,

3019
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:57,120
did you make any new
friends in jail?

3020
03:03:57,160 --> 03:03:58,600
Elias has.

3021
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:00,760
- No friends but I wrote a book.

3022
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:02,680
- [Ruby] I always
said you would.

3023
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:03,520
- Oh, Maisie.

3024
03:04:03,560 --> 03:04:04,800
- Gus Bailey.

3025
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,160
- You know Ruby.

3026
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:08,000
- Hello, how are you?

3027
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:09,640
- How are you?

3028
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:11,480
Oh, it's been ages.

3029
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:13,440
- Nine months, two days,

3030
03:04:13,480 --> 03:04:16,120
14 hours and 10 seconds.

3031
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:17,760
Prison life teaches you
to keep track of time.

3032
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:20,080
[laughing]

3033
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:22,400
- Gus,

3034
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:24,680
I'm having a small
dinner party on Thursday.

3035
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,240
I'd love you to come.

3036
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:28,120
- I can't on Thursday.

3037
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:30,000
- Well then come to the
country for the weekend.

3038
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:31,200
- I can't this weekend.

3039
03:04:33,240 --> 03:04:37,400
- I suppose it must be difficult
to meld back into society

3040
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:38,400
after being in,

3041
03:04:39,560 --> 03:04:40,680
after being away.

3042
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:42,880
See you.

3043
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:48,880
- You did that well.

3044
03:04:50,680 --> 03:04:52,320
- I thought a lot
about these people

3045
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,720
and I realized all the
money in the world

3046
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:58,760
can't protect anyone from
tragedy and heartbreak.

3047
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:02,280
And yet, you look at them,

3048
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:04,000
you think they didn't
have a care.

3049
03:05:05,400 --> 03:05:07,120
They cover their
feelings so well.

3050
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:12,080
But I can't hide in their
world anymore.

3051
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:15,040
I have to start living
my life again.

3052
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:17,520
- Me too.

3053
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:20,840
- Welcome back, Gus.

3054
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:21,840
- Hello, Jake.

3055
03:05:21,880 --> 03:05:23,080
- It's wonderful to see you,
Ruby.

3056
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:23,960
- Thanks, Jake.

3057
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:27,440
Listen, Jake, we're not staying.

3058
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:30,880
- That's just what I
was gonna say.

3059
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:35,040
[pleasant music]

3060
03:05:35,080 --> 03:05:36,520
- [Woman] Of all the nerve.

3061
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:38,400
Who do they think they are?

3062
03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:44,920
[dramatic music]

3063
03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:47,560
- Taxi!

3064
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:53,200
Can I drop you somewhere?

3065
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:57,320
So long, Ruby.

3066
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:58,600
- Goodbye, Gus.

3067
03:06:02,800 --> 03:06:03,800
- You gonna be okay?

3068
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:06,840
- Sure.

3069
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:07,720
And you?

3070
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:09,640
- Sure.

3071
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:13,080
- You know what they say
about people like us?

3072
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:14,200
- [Gus] What?

3073
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:17,520
- That we're survivors.

3074
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:26,760
- Luck.

3075
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:29,120
- Same.

3076
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,760
[dramatic music]

3077
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:04,240
