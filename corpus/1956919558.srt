1
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:32,081
Wake up the Americans.

2
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:34,683
Hey.

3
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,023
We live in a twilight world.

4
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,692
We live in a twilight world.

5
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,861
And there are no
friends at dusk.

6
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:29,932
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

7
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,071
But I established contact...

8
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,440
Bring you in or kill you.

9
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,076
I have two minutes, make up your mind.

10
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,016
- Where's the package?
- Coat check.

11
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:13,807
Stay.

12
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,256
Grab his!

13
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:34,730
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

14
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,066
Who are you?

15
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,571
- "No friends at dusk", huh?
- You'll do. Get him to the rally point.

16
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:18,974
Swap clothes.
The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.

17
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:22,978
- I've never seen encapsulation like this.
- We don't know how old it is but it's the real deal.

18
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,981
- Did you have an out?
- Service tunnel to the sewer.

19
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,417
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

20
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,418
Can you defuse that?

21
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,153
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

22
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:33,254
Covering their tracks.

23
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,323
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

24
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,425
- It's not our mission!
- It's mine now.

25
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,184
Walk away.

26
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,424
You don't have to kill these people.

27
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,706
- That wasn't one of us.
- I'll take the help.

28
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,677
Go go go go go!

29
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:43,657
It's not the guy!

30
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,144
A man can be trained to hold out
for about eighteen hours.

31
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:05,214
So your colleagues will be clear by seven.

32
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:15,590
He didn't last eighteen minutes.
He didn't have anything to hide.

33
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,692
You're smuggling a nobody.

34
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:22,530
It's risky.

35
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:28,102
Or were out counting on this?

36
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:31,339
Death, CIA issue.

37
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,917
Spare yourself once they're clear.

38
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:59,534
Almost seven. Uh-oh.

39
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,274
It's running fast.

40
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:12,414
We have to put it back one hour.

41
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,467
Get it out!

42
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,294
Welcome to the afterlife.

43
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:04,499
You've been in a medically induced coma
while we got you out of Ukraine

44
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,201
and rebuilt your mouth.

45
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:10,638
Suicide pills were fake.

46
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,774
Why?

47
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,910
- A test.
- Test?

48
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:21,115
They pulled my teeth out.

49
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,685
Did my team get clear?

50
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:28,923
No. Probably Russians, we think.

51
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:32,026
Somebody talked.

52
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,328
Not you.

53
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,865
You chose to die instead
of giving up your colleagues.

54
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,744
We all believe we'd run into
the burning building.

55
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:54,949
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

56
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:56,350
You do.

57
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,658
I resign.

58
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,093
You don't work for us. You're dead.

59
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:12,466
Your duty transcends national interests.
This is about survival.

60
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,102
Whose?

61
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:19,974
Everyone's.

62
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:25,179
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

63
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,517
To even know its true nature is to lose.

64
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,319
This is knowledge divided.

65
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:35,122
All I have for you... is a gesture,

66
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,327
in combination with a word. "Tenet".

67
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,695
Use it carefully.

68
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:46,334
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones too.

69
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,369
That's all they've told you?

70
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,205
That test you passed?

71
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,342
Not everybody does.

72
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,811
With a hi-vis vest and a clipboard
you can get almost anywhere.

73
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:13,347
Almost.

74
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,549
An obscure tenet.

75
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:27,695
No small talk. Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

76
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:30,297
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

77
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:33,535
You're not here for "what",
you're here for "how".

78
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,571
"What" is your department.
And not my business.

79
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:41,776
Well, to do what I do, I need some
idea of the threat we face.

80
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,115
As I understand it, we're trying
to prevent World War Three.

81
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,784
Nuclear holocaust?

82
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:51,419
No.

83
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:54,321
Something worse.

84
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,332
Aim it and pull the trigger.

85
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,303
- It's empty.
- Aim it.

86
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,343
Check the magazine.

87
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:21,916
How?

88
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:31,559
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

89
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,594
The other one's going backwards.

90
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,263
Can you tell which is which?

91
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:41,969
How about now? It's inverted.

92
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,771
Its entropy runs backwards.

93
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:46,340
So to our eyes, its movement is reversed.

94
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:50,077
We think it's a type of inverse radiation
triggered by nuclear fission.

95
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,480
- You didn't make it?
- No, we don't know how yet.

96
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:56,150
- So where'd it come from?
- Someone's manufacturing them in the future.

97
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,052
They're streaming back at us.

98
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,487
Try it.

99
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,796
You have to have dropped it.

100
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:24,612
- How can it move before I touch it?
- From your point of view, you caught it.

101
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,748
But from the bullet's point of view,
you dropped it.

102
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:29,617
But cause comes before effect.

103
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:32,319
No. That's just the way we see time.

104
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:34,054
Well, what about free will?

105
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:36,457
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

106
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:39,894
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

107
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,863
Don't try to understand it.

108
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,299
Feel it.

109
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:57,111
Instinct.

110
00:15:58,846 --> 00:15:59,914
Got it.

111
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,720
Why does it feel so strange?

112
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:11,559
You're not shooting the bullet.
You're catching it.

113
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,328


114
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:20,501
- I've seen this type of ammunition before.
- In the field?

115
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:23,604
- I was almost hit.
- Then you were exceedingly lucky.

116
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:28,576
An inverted bullet passing through your body
would be devastating. Not pretty.

117
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,579
These look like today's.

118
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,181
They might have been made today
and inverted years from now.

119
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,150
- Where did you get them?
- They came with the wall.

120
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,019
I was assigned it, like all
the material I'm studying here.

121
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,721
Do you have an analysis on the metals?

122
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,790
Sure. Why?

123
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,093
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made. Look...

124
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,663
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

125
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,935
A bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.

126
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:57,872
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

127
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:02,076
If they can invert that, we see no reason
they couldn't invert pretty much anything.

128
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:04,879
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

129
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:08,883
An inverted weapon might be able
to affect our past as well.

130
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,457
Now that we know what to look for,
we're finding more and more inverted material.

131
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,927
Remnants of complex objects.

132
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,932
What do you think we're seeing?

133
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,903
The detritus of a coming war.

134
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,557
- Yep?
- We live in a twilight world.

135
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,726
No friends at dusk.
Thought you left the building.

136
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:55,562
- Even the dead need allies.
- Specifically?

137
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,933
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjai Singh.

138
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:03,270
Singh? He never leaves his house,
and his house is... his house...

139
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:06,674
- Yes it is. I'm looking right at it.
- I'll see who's on deck.

140
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,942
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

141
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,793
It seems you need an introduction
to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.

142
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:30,531
- I'm Neil.
- I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

143
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:36,170
- That's not possible.
- Ten minutes, tops.

144
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:39,173
Time isn't the problem. It's...

145
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,042
getting out alive that's the problem.

146
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,215
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

147
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:51,218
If I had to.
I'm not looking to make much noise here.

148
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,956
- Yes?
- Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

149
00:18:58,258 --> 00:18:59,126
What?

150
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,930
- You never drink on the job.
- You're well informed.

151
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:08,669
- It pays to be in our profession.
- Well, I prefer soda water.

152
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:12,339
No, you don't.

153
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,509
How's your parachuting?

154
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,511
I broke an ankle during basic training.

155
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:20,280
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

156
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:24,585
- It's bungee jumpable.
-  I don't think "bungee jumpable" is a word.

157
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:27,454
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

158
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,491
Or into it, for that matter.

159
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,067
I know you're tired.
I am also very tired.

160
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:16,897
Stay back.

161
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:21,068
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

162
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:22,870
I want to know who supplied it.

163
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:26,507
My name is Sanjay. And you are?

164
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:28,842
No chitchat?

165
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,080
There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you anyway.

166
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,949
Don't let it get cold.

167
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,354
Why should I know who supplied it?

168
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:44,725
Combination of metals is unique to India.
If it's from India, it's from you.

169
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,426
-  Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

170
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:49,530
Deduction then. Look, my friend...

171
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,833
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

172
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,102
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

173
00:21:57,104 --> 00:22:01,408
Or the man they send to make deals.
But I am the man people talk to.

174
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:06,380
I can't. I can't tell you.

175
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:09,616
You're an arms dealer, friend. This may be
the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.

176
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:14,755
To say anything about a client would
violate the tenets he lives by.

177
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:20,594
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me. Everything.

178
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,196
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

179
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:27,000
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please.

180
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:30,137
Cheers. Priya.

181
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:33,340
This is your operation.

182
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:36,677
A masculine front in a man's
world has its uses.

183
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:39,079
The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.

184
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:40,447
The Russian oligarch.

185
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:44,351
- You know him?
- Not personally. Made his billions in gas.

186
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:47,955
Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

187
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:49,723
Very good.

188
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:53,126
Except the gas he made his
billions from was actually plutonium.

189
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:57,297
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

190
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:59,666
When I sold him the rounds
they were perfectly ordinary.

191
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,402
So how did he get them inverted?

192
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,105
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker,

193
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,873
between our time and the future.

194
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,845
- He can communicate with the future?
- We all do, don't we?

195
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,014
Emails, credit cards, texts.

196
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:17,314
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

197
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:21,121
The question is, can the future speak back?

198
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:23,690
And I'm supposed to find out.

199
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,828
To get anywhere near Sator will take
a fresh-faced protagonist.

200
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,864
And you are fresh as a daisy.

201
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:34,701
Get close. Find out what he's receiving and how.

202
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:39,773
- Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?
- I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach.

203
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,681
You must have had a plan for getting out.

204
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:50,217
Not one I loved.

205
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,274
May I help you, sir?

206
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:17,010
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

207
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,780
I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

208
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:20,914
Presume away.

209
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:22,282
If you'll follow me.

210
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,890
Started without you. Hope you don't mind.

211
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,391
I'll catch up.

212
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:34,661
- Same for me, please.
- I'll send the waiter.

213
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:36,363
No, just pass on the order.

214
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:40,600
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

215
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,903
Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step.

216
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:46,173
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

217
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:48,308
I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish, but...

218
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,912
- they don't seem to care.
- Tell me about him.

219
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:55,916
I assume you're familiar
with the Soviet-era secret cities.

220
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,920
Closed cities not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

221
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,390
Most of them have been opened up
and renamed as regular towns.

222
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,225
Not the one Sator grew up in.

223
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:09,930
Stalsk-12. In the '70s it had
a population of about 200,000.

224
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,932
- Thought to be abandoned.
- Abandoned?

225
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:16,336
Some kind of accident.
After which it was used for underground tests.

226
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:19,906
Two weeks ago, same date as The Kiev Opera siege,

227
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:24,778
we spotted a detonation in Northern Siberia.
Just where Stalsk-12 was.

228
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:28,148
Sator emerged from this black spot on the map,

229
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:33,787
with ambition, and enough money to buy
his way into the British establishment.

230
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:37,624
- Through his wife.
- Katherine Barton. Eldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.

231
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,327
She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.

232
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,729
- A happy marriage?
- Practically estranged.

233
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,099
- Well, how do I get to Sator?
- Through her, of course.

234
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,702
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

235
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:50,436
Hardly.

236
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:53,240
We have an ace in the hole.

237
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:58,779
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

238
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:01,381
It's a fake by a Spaniard, named Arepo.

239
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:04,684
One of two we confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

240
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,051
What happened to the other one?

241
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:10,657
Turned up at Shipley's, authenticated
by Katherine Barton. Put on auction.

242
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:13,726
- And who do you think bought it?
- Her husband?

243
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:19,399
- Does she know it's a forgery?
- Well, it's hard to say.

244
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:23,570
Rumor has it that she
and Arepo were close.

245
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,707
Look, no offense.

246
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:31,344
But in this world where someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

247
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:35,048
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

248
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:36,917
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

249
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,619
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

250
00:26:40,554 --> 00:26:43,089
- Can I recommend a tailor?
- I'll manage.

251
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,658
You British don't have a monopoly
on snobbery, you know.

252
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:49,529
Well, not a monopoly.
More of a controlling interest.

253
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:51,932
Can you box that up for me?

254
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:53,700
Certainly not.

255
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:55,869
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

256
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:30,370
How can I help, sir?

257
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:36,743
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any
appointments. Mr...?

258
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:38,411
Goya.

259
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:43,183
- Mr. Goya?
- No. I'm told you're the person to see about Goya.

260
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:47,020
That's extraordinary.

261
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:53,527
What's it worth?

262
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:56,530
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

263
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,898
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.

264
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,906
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays.

265
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,941
But what does your heart tell you?

266
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,581
So where did you say you acquired this drawing?

267
00:28:15,382 --> 00:28:16,483
Tomas Arepo.

268
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,423
I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar
from an irate Swiss banker.

269
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:26,493
I traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

270
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:29,262
when he told me who paid
top dollar for another one of his pictures.

271
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:30,997
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

272
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:34,768
- Your drawing's an obvious fake.
- My drawing's a very good fake.

273
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,737
You know that better than anyone.
The information is the bargain.

274
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,808
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband.

275
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,811
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

276
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,814
- If you and I were to make an arrangement...
- Arrangement.

277
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:50,917
You mean blackmail.
Don't be afraid of the word.

278
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,821
My husband isn't. I'm sorry
to tell you he got there first.

279
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:57,123
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

280
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:59,826
- Why would he?
- He paid nine million dollars for it.

281
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:02,262
Barely covered the cost
of the holiday he just forced us on.

282
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,530
Where'd you go, Mars?

283
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:07,900
Vietnam on our yacht. His yacht.

284
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:11,471
You've got the suit, the shoes, the watch.

285
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,940
I think you're a little out of your depth.

286
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,078
People who've amassed fortunes like your husband's

287
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:21,481
generally aren't okay with being
cheated out of any of it.

288
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,756
The drawing is his hold over me.

289
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:38,732
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

290
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:42,836
He controls me.

291
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:45,505
My contact with my son. Everything.

292
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:48,875
Leaving would never have been easy,
but now it's impossible.

293
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,945
You can't fight.

294
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,648
Just beg.

295
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,352
In Vietnam I tried to love him again.

296
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,489
I thought if there was love there
he might give me my son back.

297
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:06,826
We sat, on that bloody boat, watching the sunsets,

298
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:09,562
imitating some earlier time in our lives.

299
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:11,931
He seemed happy, so I asked him.

300
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,267
And he made me an offer.

301
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,537
He'd let me go if I agreed never
to see my son again.

302
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:24,577
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.

303
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:26,513
He called us, contrite.

304
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:31,551
Then, when we got back, I glimpsed some other
woman diving off the boat, and he'd vanished.

305
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:38,491
- I've never felt such envy.
- You don't seem the jealous type.

306
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:39,959
Of her freedom.

307
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:46,132
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?

308
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:47,867
But you share a son.

309
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:50,370
That's my life now.

310
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:53,540
- Did you know that the drawing was a fake?
- No.

311
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,477
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close. I failed.

312
00:30:57,977 --> 00:31:02,615
Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal.
But I didn't betray my husband.

313
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:06,886
- In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.
- And he let Arepo walk free.

314
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,089
If you'd actually met Arepo, as you claimed,

315
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:11,891
you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.

316
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,394
- We spoke on the phone.
- He can't do that either.

317
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:16,996
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

318
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:20,733
Give me an introduction.
I'll take the drawing out of the equation.

319
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,336
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

320
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,740
- I might just be your second chance.
- I don't need redemption.

321
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,609
At betrayal.

322
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:37,016
Friends of your husband's?

323
00:31:38,118 --> 00:31:41,254
- You knew this was going to happen.
- Don't worry. They won't kill you.

324
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:44,924
Andrei dislikes tangling
with local law enforcement on that level.

325
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:48,394
- You must have not really liked the look of me.
- The look was fine.

326
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:51,731
It's best to get to the nasty part before
I care one way or the other.

327
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,502
There's a number in your left coat pocket.
Don't call from home.

328
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:59,038
You won't be taking my call.

329
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:02,142
I might surprise you.

330
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:35,675
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

331
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,046
Can we get going?

332
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:54,761
Please.

333
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:56,896
He wants you to see.

334
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,524
And he gets what he wants.

335
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,333
Not always, apparently.

336
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:42,542
Anna says we're going to Pompeii and see lava.

337
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:46,079
We will. We'll go together. I can come too.

338
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,101
Told you I'd surprise you.

339
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:11,971
- He's a cute kid.
- He's everything.

340
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,742
Where's the drawing?

341
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,012
- Oslo. At the airport.
- The airport?

342
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,214
Do you know what a freeport is?

343
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:25,985
- A storage facility for art that was acquired...
- But not yet taxed.

344
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:28,488
We started a network.

345
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:32,358
Rotas, his construction company, built them,
I brought in the clients.

346
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,294
The facilities are tax havens.

347
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:37,463
The clients can view their
investments without importing them,

348
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,287
so they avoid paying tax.

349
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,868
So it's sort of like a transit lounge for art?

350
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:45,338
Art, antiquities, anything of value really.

351
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,073
- Anything?
- Anything legal.

352
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,475
But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.

353
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:50,710
Opaque.

354
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:56,273
As I'm sure you are aware,
most freeports are just warehouses,

355
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:58,751
but here we ensure that you can enjoy...

356
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:01,283
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

357
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,323
And this way to the vaults.

358
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:05,211
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

359
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,593
Well, we make trips there four, five times a year.

360
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,529
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

361
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,200
- Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei.
- But the freeports are.

362
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,638
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

363
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:21,207
Each vault a separate structure within the others.

364
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:23,876
Damage to one structure won't
compromise the others.

365
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:39,348
Some clients opt for biometric access.
Straight in...

366
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:42,350
Off the tarmac.

367
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:43,896
From the terminal?

368
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:47,900
- From their private planes.
- Of course.

369
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:50,737
Our logistics department ships

370
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,774
to and from any other freeport in the world
without customs inspection.

371
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:56,642
What are you hoping to find in there?

372
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,044
You really want to know?

373
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:01,881
- I'm not sure.
- Bring some lead-lined gloves.

374
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:05,084
Jesus, it's nuclear.

375
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,055
When you're on the tour,
pay attention to the fire precautions.

376
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,960
- Documents are vulnerable to...
- Fire, absolutely.

377
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:16,350
I was going to say, water damage
from the sprinkler systems.

378
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,357
We don't use sprinklers.

379
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:23,269
The facility is flooded with halide gas,
displacing all the air within seconds.

380
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:27,573
- Can you show me?
- Well if I did, we'd suffocate.

381
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:31,712
- What about the staff?
- Halide only fills the vaults,

382
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:35,748
they just have to get into either corridor,
and there is a ten second warning.

383
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,583
At least you give them ten seconds.

384
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,522
Well, sir, our clients use us...
because we have no priorities

385
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:43,856
above their property.

386
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,081
Blimey.

387
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:48,101
Vault doors are fireproof. Hydraulic closers,

388
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:49,695
simple key and electronic triggers.

389
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:51,631
Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.

390
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:53,032
Why a lockdown?

391
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:56,135
The power switches to failsafe,
sealing the outer doors,

392
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,604
but the inner doors revert to factory settings.

393
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:02,360
And pickable locks. It's child's play really.

394
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:05,044
Child's play? You're inside airport security.

395
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,814
They have to worry about
climate control, not armed raids.

396
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:12,785
So how do we get enough firepower through
the perimeter to trigger their lockdown procedure?

397
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,089
- Back wall of the freeport.
- You've got something?

398
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,325
You're not gonna like it.

399
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:22,028
You want to crash a plane?

400
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,464
Well, not from the air, don't be so dramatic.

401
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:29,635
I want to run a jet off the taxiway,
and breach through the wall and start a fire.

402
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:33,172
Well, how big a plane?

403
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,710
Well... that part is a little dramatic.

404
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:41,848
This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

405
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,517
- There can't be passengers.
- Norskfreight.

406
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:47,538
They use the hangar
on the west side of the freeport.

407
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,789
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

408
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:52,358
- We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.
- On the move?

409
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:54,627
What's the problem? They'll be fine.

410
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:57,096
Well, it seems bold.

411
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:59,799
"Bold" I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say "nuts".

412
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:02,386
- And if you get caught?
- We won't.

413
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,636
And if you do?

414
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:07,240
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died, so...

415
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,244
a swift extradition and lost in the system.
It'll barely make the news.

416
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:13,779
That all depends on the size of your explosion.

417
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:16,516
Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play.

418
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:17,550
Gold bars?

419
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:20,004
Norskfreight ships treasury gold once a month.

420
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:22,355
Blow the back, drop it out on the runway.

421
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:26,893
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

422
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:33,499
The space in the center of the pentagon
is too big. There's something there.

423
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,335
I can't figure it out, It's just not marked.

424
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:40,806
- It's 45 seconds.
- Ample.

425
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:42,208
Won't you be running?

426
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,679
Alright, it's your turn. Start packing.

427
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:05,731
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector please.

428
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:11,137
Sir.

429
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:13,639
And sir.

430
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:26,285
- Can I offer you perhaps a coffee? A water?
- I'll take an espresso.

431
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,221
- Sir?
- No, thanks. Thanks.

432
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,768
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian?
Cause all I got here is vegetarian.

433
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:47,425
So that one looks like meat, but...

434
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:50,876
I think that looks vegetarian, I think they both
look vegetarian, I don't really know,

435
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:52,144
it's confusing, you know...

436
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:53,813
Okay.

437
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:02,321
This way, gentlemen.

438
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,940
Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.

439
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,519
Carry on. Not the radio.

440
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:41,527
Let's go.

441
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:12,892
Yoga.

442
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,899
Let's go! Now!

443
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:51,430
Go, go.

444
00:42:26,932 --> 00:42:28,134
Alright, uh...

445
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:44,884
You said ten seconds, right?

446
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:07,600
There's someone in here with us.

447
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:24,817
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

448
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:56,248
- Don't touch them!
- What the hell happened here?

449
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,289
It hasn't happened yet.

450
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:23,762
Don't kill him!

451
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:26,532
We need to know if we've been compromised.

452
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:32,638
Why are you here? Who are you?

453
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:35,441
How'd you know we'd be here?

454
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:52,357
We need to go.

455
00:47:57,798 --> 00:47:59,131
What happened to the other guy?

456
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,767
I took care of him.

457
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:21,286
Well, I've seen too much. I'm still alive,
which must mean you've decided to trust me.

458
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:24,756
- Or maybe I lost my edge?
- Your edge is still intact.

459
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:29,828
- There's a cold war.
- Nuclear?

460
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:31,463
Temporal.

461
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:34,833
- Time travel?
- No.

462
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:38,203
Technology that can invert an object's entropy.

463
00:48:39,705 --> 00:48:41,024
You mean reverse chronology,

464
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:44,995
like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a
positron is an electron moving backwards in time?

465
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,232
- Sure, thats exactly what I mean.
- I have a master's in physics.

466
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:51,383
- Well, try and keep up.
- I mean the implications of this are...

467
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:53,837
- Beyond secret.
- Then why'd you bring me in?

468
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:56,622
I thought we'd find a drawing
and couple boxes of bullets.

469
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:58,609
You were as surprised as I was.

470
00:48:58,693 --> 00:49:01,093
I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.

471
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:05,531
I'll set you up as a go-between,
but remember, to you...

472
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:10,836
it's all about plutonium.
Or when we're done, they'll kill you.

473
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,938
Won't you have to do that anyway?

474
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,374
I rather it be my decision.

475
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:18,377
So would I... I think.

476
00:49:30,756 --> 00:49:31,757
Your work?

477
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:35,527
What did you find in the vaults?

478
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:38,630
Two antagonists. One inverted.

479
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:41,934
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

480
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:45,170
- Both emerged at the same moment?
- Yeah.

481
00:49:46,138 --> 00:49:47,706
They were the same person.

482
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:51,810
- Sator's built a turnstyle in that vault.
- A turnstyle?

483
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:54,079
A machine... for inverting.

484
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:57,216
You told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

485
00:49:57,649 --> 00:50:00,853
- It hasn't, he's been given it by the future.
- For what?

486
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,789
You have the best chance of finding out.

487
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:06,758
- Have you met him?
- I was close.

488
00:50:07,428 --> 00:50:10,762
- What if you have something he needs?
- Such as?

489
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:12,731
Plutonium-241.

490
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:18,437
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under
a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev.

491
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,940
He got the team. Not the 241.

492
00:50:22,243 --> 00:50:24,876
- Who did?
- Ukrainian security services.

493
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:27,145
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

494
00:50:27,848 --> 00:50:32,284
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.

495
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:36,822
- I'm just gonna take him out.
- No, no, no, no. No, Sator has to stay alive.

496
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:39,591
He has to stay alive
until we know his part in things.

497
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:43,695
Leverage the situation
without losing control of the 241.

498
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:45,215
It's too dangerous.

499
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,799
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

500
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,235
is nothing compared with
what could happen if you don't stop Sator.

501
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,004
From doing what?

502
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:55,540
We are being attacked by the future.

503
00:50:57,175 --> 00:51:00,247
And Sator's helping. We have to find out how.

504
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:18,597
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

505
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,733
- You don't have to worry about it anymore.
- You destroyed it?

506
00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:25,504
- I didn't think you'd want it back.
- Does he know?

507
00:51:25,804 --> 00:51:28,240
- Not yet. So sit tight.
- Sit tight?

508
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,328
Every day my son spends with that monster,
he thinks a little less of me.

509
00:51:31,412 --> 00:51:34,946
It won't be long.
In the meantime, introduce me.

510
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:36,682
As what?

511
00:51:36,882 --> 00:51:39,803
I'm a former First Secretary
from the American Embassy in Riyadh,

512
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:41,386
We met at a party last June.

513
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,388
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June...

514
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:45,709
June 29th, 19:00 to 19:30.

515
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:48,527
Salmon was on the printed menu,
swapped for sea bass on the night.

516
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,064
Sator left early, that's when we met.
I came into Shipley's in London,

517
00:51:52,097 --> 00:51:55,200
you ran into me here,
and want to show me your yacht.

518
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:58,989
- He'll think we're having an affair.
- And he'll want to meet me.

519
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:01,707
- Or have you killed.
- Let me worry about that.

520
00:52:02,574 --> 00:52:03,875
Did I look worried?

521
00:52:05,444 --> 00:52:09,599
Sleeps 70 with crew.
Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

522
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:13,485
- Afraid of pirates?
- Andrei lives playing one government off the other.

523
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:15,687
The day they turn, that's his refuge.

524
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,324
- May I join you?
- Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.

525
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,126
Then we'll take mine.

526
00:52:55,394 --> 00:52:56,194
Max!

527
00:52:57,932 --> 00:52:59,564
Who's the American?

528
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:04,536
- He's a friend.
- The man from Shipley's.

529
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:07,305
That you tried to have beaten up.

530
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:11,143
I ask again. Who is he?

531
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:16,815
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

532
00:53:17,082 --> 00:53:21,386
- Good with fists for a diplomat.
- Paranoia is your department, Andrei.

533
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,089
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

534
00:53:25,023 --> 00:53:25,924
Max?

535
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:28,827
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

536
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:33,098
You just sent him off?
I promised him I'd go with him.

537
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:35,667
I explained you were busy.

538
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:38,703
With your friend.

539
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:04,930
Hey, easy, fella. Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

540
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,476
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

541
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:22,113
Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.

542
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:24,082
Uh, no.

543
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:26,384
Not yet.

544
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:29,187
How would you like to die?

545
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:33,425
- Old.
- You chose the wrong profession.

546
00:54:35,462 --> 00:54:39,850
There's a walled garden up the road.
We're going to take you there, cut your throat.

547
00:54:39,934 --> 00:54:42,701
Not across, in the middle, like a hole.

548
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:47,372
Then we take your balls and we
stuff them in the cut to block the windpipe.

549
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:48,840
Complex!

550
00:54:48,874 --> 00:54:51,710
It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like

551
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:55,947
try to pull his own balls out of
his throat before he chokes.

552
00:54:56,314 --> 00:54:58,850
- Is this how you treat all your guests?
- We're finished.

553
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:04,422
Do you like opera?

554
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:13,498
- What?
- Not here.

555
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:19,337
- You sail?
- I've messed around on boats.

556
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,340
Be on the dock at 08:00 ready to talk
more than mess around.

557
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,842
08:00.

558
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:42,178
Max missed too much school this year.
I'm taking him back to England.

559
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:44,863
- School won't be okay with him missing so much.
- Yes, they will.

560
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:45,897
Can I finish?

561
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:48,767
You want the trappings of a king.

562
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:51,636
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

563
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:53,538
with a wife who doesn't love you anymore.

564
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:55,941
You seem...

565
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:58,877
spirited today.

566
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:02,814
- Do I?
- Yes you do.

567
00:56:09,521 --> 00:56:11,523
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

568
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:14,960
Rest assured, instict told me
to remove it from the vault.

569
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:18,597
I've always had instincts about the future.

570
00:56:20,332 --> 00:56:23,335
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

571
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:40,151
Sailing or diving?

572
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:58,739
Rising!

573
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:24,996
What do you know about opera?

574
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,399
In 2008,

575
00:57:27,832 --> 00:57:31,102
a remote Russian missile station
was overwhelmed and held for a week.

576
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:33,304
When the station was retaken,

577
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:37,409
the 241 on one warhead
was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

578
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:43,348
The missing 241...

579
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:46,703
surfaced at the Opera House siege
in Kiev on the 14th.

580
00:57:47,018 --> 00:57:48,453
Coming about!

581
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,239
What do you propose?

582
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:12,510
- A partnership.
-  I wouldn't partner with you.

583
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:15,513
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

584
00:58:17,315 --> 00:58:20,885
Someone in the arms trade with training.
Knows how to cover his tracks.

585
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:24,522
- Not that shocking.
- Or an intelligence agent.

586
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:26,091
Right!

587
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:31,029
Burn in hell, Andrei!

588
00:58:38,236 --> 00:58:41,372
- You can't drive a boat like this!
- You can if you have to!

589
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:11,970
- Why didn't you let him drown?
- I need him.

590
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:15,240
- To sell guns?
- I'm not who you think I am.

591
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:17,976
That I know. He showed me the drawing.

592
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:21,813
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.

593
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:23,748
I don't know what you think your husband does...

594
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,917
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

595
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:28,853
- He's so much more.
- What then?

596
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:32,891
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives
in his hands, not just yours.

597
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,434
- Mr. Sator wants to see you.
- Okay.

598
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:45,069
Now.

599
00:59:46,404 --> 00:59:48,373
He wants to see me without pants?

600
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:57,849
- Trust me.
- Save it. I'm not falling for it twice.

601
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:01,953
You have a better option?

602
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:09,394
Whatever it takes to get what you want.
Not a second thought for me or my son.

603
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:16,067
What do you think he's going to do to me now?

604
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:29,047
Try not to use it.

605
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:32,584
On anyone.

606
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:39,490
Enough.

607
01:00:43,397 --> 01:00:45,997
See? Pulse of a man half my age.

608
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:50,535
Drink with me.

609
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:54,973
It seems I now owe you my life.

610
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:56,341
It's nothing.

611
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,076
My life is not nothing.

612
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:00,845
And I don't like to be in debt.

613
01:01:01,513 --> 01:01:05,283
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

614
01:01:08,853 --> 01:01:11,089
You think she released my harness?

615
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:16,127
It was my own mistake.

616
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:18,696
Then help me steal the 241.

617
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,734
I need resources, it's weapons-grade plutionium,
that means special handling,

618
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:25,103
- containment facilities...
- I know what it means.

619
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:29,641
You lecture me about radiation?

620
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,810
Andrei Sator,

621
01:01:33,278 --> 01:01:37,448
digging plutonium from
the rubble of my city as a teenager.

622
01:01:38,016 --> 01:01:38,616
Where?

623
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:43,288
Stalsk-12.

624
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,457
My home.

625
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:53,865
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level,
scattering the others.

626
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,435
They needed people to find the plutonium.

627
01:01:59,804 --> 01:02:03,341
It became my first contract. Nobody else even bid.

628
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:05,243
They thought it was a death sentence.

629
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:08,947
But...

630
01:02:10,915 --> 01:02:13,384
one man's probability of death...

631
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:19,924
is another man's possibility for a life.

632
01:02:22,193 --> 01:02:24,529
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

633
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:29,367
Even now my company is the only one
to operate in the ruins.

634
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,338
The 241 is being transported
through Northern Europe,

635
01:02:33,738 --> 01:02:37,876
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

636
01:02:38,945 --> 01:02:41,079
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

637
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:49,654
Stay with us tonight. I insist.

638
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:20,552
- What do you want?
- We're going to talk about today.

639
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:23,623
- No, we're not.
- No?

640
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:26,925
We'll see.

641
01:03:27,692 --> 01:03:30,462
Don't think for a second you can treat me
like you treat your other women.

642
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:34,399
And...

643
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:37,302
how do you imagine...

644
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:40,739
I treat these other women?

645
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:42,974
You think I force them into conversation?

646
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:46,344
You want to be quiet? Fine.
You can bite down on that.

647
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:52,817
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

648
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:58,156
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?
It's all I have to offer you.

649
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:02,127
- Well, that will have to do, then.
- Why didn't you just let me go?

650
01:04:02,694 --> 01:04:04,195
Because...

651
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:11,269
if I can't have you...

652
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,939
no one else can.

653
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:19,511
If you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.

654
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:23,648
- You think I'll let him interfere?
- If he tried, you'd have to kill him.

655
01:04:24,217 --> 01:04:25,483
End of deal.

656
01:04:27,185 --> 01:04:28,787
So you leave me alone.

657
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:32,591
Not now!

658
01:06:52,365 --> 01:06:56,068
98. Not bad for such exertion.

659
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,247
He was at the window.

660
01:07:11,149 --> 01:07:12,117
I was curious.

661
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:15,721
My property shouldn't concern you.

662
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:20,425
Who are you? How do you come by your
information about the opera?

663
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:24,229
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

664
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,100
Hell, the CIA provides two-thirds
of the market for fissile material.

665
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:30,702
They're usually buying, not selling.

666
01:07:32,104 --> 01:07:34,273
But we do live in a twilight world.

667
01:07:34,706 --> 01:07:36,341
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

668
01:07:36,543 --> 01:07:38,343
Next one, it's a bullet in the brain.

669
01:07:40,846 --> 01:07:41,914
No balls in my throat?

670
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:44,917
There will be no time for such things...

671
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:46,752
in Tallinn.

672
01:07:47,586 --> 01:07:50,222
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

673
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:51,990
No.

674
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:58,497
I spring the material. You pay me off.

675
01:07:59,198 --> 01:08:00,650
And your wife does the exchange.

676
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:03,635
- I never involve her in my business.
- Yeah, that's why I trust her.

677
01:08:04,404 --> 01:08:06,322
Put him ashore.

678
01:08:06,672 --> 01:08:08,607
- How do I contact you?
- You don't.

679
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:10,175
How do you advance me the funds?

680
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:16,849
Handle the plutonium better than that.

681
01:08:27,626 --> 01:08:30,763
- What did you find on the gold?
- No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.

682
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,965
- How?
- Dead drops.

683
01:08:33,398 --> 01:08:36,168
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

684
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:39,538
then digs it up to collect
the inverted materials they send.

685
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,808
Seemingly instantanious. Where does he bury it?

686
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:45,544
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.

687
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:47,579
What did the soil samples show?

688
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,650
Northern Europe, Asia. Radioactive.

689
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,386
Everything salvaged from Oslo's been shipped here.

690
01:08:55,888 --> 01:08:59,558
- Why am I here?
- I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.

691
01:09:01,026 --> 01:09:02,895
Light convoy through downtown.
What's the thinking?

692
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:06,231
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

693
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:08,367
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.

694
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,935
You have a point.

695
01:09:10,904 --> 01:09:12,538
Is the convoy monitored from the air?

696
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:16,158
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
and in come the cavalry.

697
01:09:16,341 --> 01:09:19,478
We need big guns. Guns that
make the point without being fired.

698
01:09:20,046 --> 01:09:24,450
We need a fast car that doesn't look fast.
Four heavy vehicles. All different.

699
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,253
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

700
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,590
Most of all, we have to set this up
with nothing in the record.

701
01:09:31,657 --> 01:09:33,625
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

702
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:36,929
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

703
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:40,733
His ignorance is our only protection.

704
01:10:18,237 --> 01:10:19,271
You see, Kat?

705
01:10:20,573 --> 01:10:22,107
Some of my favorites.

706
01:10:24,177 --> 01:10:29,081
Singed, but ah, salvageable, wouldn't you say?

707
01:10:29,148 --> 01:10:31,917
- It's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right,

708
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:34,954
you would never have
anything to do with such things.

709
01:10:36,322 --> 01:10:38,490
But this is where our worlds collide.

710
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:43,162
- What is this, Andrei?
- You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

711
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:47,733
The filthy business...

712
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,570
that put those clothes on your back,
and our boy in his school.

713
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:54,173
That you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

714
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:57,243
The convoy's due downton in ten.

715
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:06,819
- Time to go.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

716
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:08,487
Look at me!

717
01:11:09,922 --> 01:11:11,357
And understand...

718
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:13,993
You don't negotiate with a tiger.

719
01:11:14,827 --> 01:11:18,297
You admire a tiger until it turns on you,

720
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:19,832
and you feel

721
01:11:20,099 --> 01:11:23,302
its true fucking nature!

722
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:24,537
Don't.

723
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:27,373
You stay right there.

724
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:33,112
Green, two minutes.

725
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,306
- You're not going to kill me.
- I already tried.

726
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:03,809
You pushed me off a boat,
you're not going to shoot me in cold blood.

727
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,312
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

728
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:09,415
No, but you're not angry enough.

729
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:15,018
Because anger scars over into despair.

730
01:12:17,156 --> 01:12:18,691
I look in your eyes...

731
01:12:20,826 --> 01:12:22,261
I see despair.

732
01:12:26,165 --> 01:12:29,301
Vengeful bitch! Living off me...

733
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:32,371
thinking that you're better! Enough!

734
01:12:56,862 --> 01:12:59,165
Tell me everything as it happens.

735
01:13:01,934 --> 01:13:03,336
See you on the other side.

736
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:23,305
Yellow, 60 seconds.

737
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:24,824
60. Check.

738
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:42,008
Blue, 45 seconds.

739
01:13:42,508 --> 01:13:43,943
Blue, 45, check.

740
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,029
Okay, Red. We're coming to you.

741
01:14:12,605 --> 01:14:14,841
Three trucks in place.

742
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:20,713
Watch everything. Give me all the details.

743
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:07,438
Alright, all set?

744
01:15:13,444 --> 01:15:15,212
In five...

745
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,514
four...

746
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:19,450
three...

747
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:21,552
two...

748
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:24,755
One.

749
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,601
Go, Yellow!

750
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:55,441
- We've got a problem!
- We need backup! Shit!

751
01:16:07,898 --> 01:16:11,535
- Radio's down.
- Are they still moving?

752
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:04,414
Check the radio chatter.

753
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:25,269
I've seen samples of encapsulation
in every weapons class. This is not one of them.

754
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:27,171
That's what he's after.

755
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:33,877
- I can't understand this.
- You said you spoke Estonian.

756
01:18:34,033 --> 01:18:36,847
It's not Estonian. It's backwards.

757
01:18:42,019 --> 01:18:43,120
What the hell is that?

758
01:18:58,869 --> 01:18:59,836
Go, go, go, go!

759
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,718
Don't give it to him.

760
01:19:48,607 --> 01:19:51,488
- This isn't plutonium.
- It's worse than that, goddammit!

761
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,025
He's getting away.

762
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,463
He left her in the car!
Go after her! Go, go, go, go, go!

763
01:20:47,144 --> 01:20:48,178
Pull up alongside.

764
01:21:04,161 --> 01:21:06,196
Come on, come on. Closer!

765
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,601
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

766
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:14,871
Hurry up!

767
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,941
Please!

768
01:21:54,311 --> 01:21:56,780
Sit tight. Sit tight, I'm calling in the cavalry.

769
01:21:57,848 --> 01:21:58,849
What cavalry?

770
01:23:03,413 --> 01:23:05,682
If you're not telling the truth, she dies.

771
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,855
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

772
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:16,892
- Who told you that?
- Tell me, now. Is it really in the BMW?

773
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,730
- I don't know.
- Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

774
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:25,468
- Leave her alone!
- Tell him!

775
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:27,170
‎I don't have time to negotiate.‎

776
01:23:32,943 --> 01:23:33,944
- Listen to me.
- Three.

777
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:35,178
I can help you.

778
01:23:35,212 --> 01:23:36,713
- Help me!
- Two.

779
01:23:37,714 --> 01:23:38,815
- Don't!
- One.

780
01:23:43,253 --> 01:23:45,088
Next one's a bullet to the head.

781
01:23:46,514 --> 01:23:47,591
- No.
- One.

782
01:23:47,991 --> 01:23:49,526
Two, three.

783
01:23:49,726 --> 01:23:50,861
Okay! Okay.

784
01:23:51,919 --> 01:23:56,399
- The car. The BMW, I left it in the BMW.
- We're going to check this is real.

785
01:23:59,236 --> 01:24:00,470
It's in the glove box!

786
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:02,606
Where did you leave it?

787
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:06,042
Car or fire truck, which one?

788
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:09,079
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

789
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:10,347
I already told you.

790
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:12,515
I believe you.

791
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:15,249
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy togeth...

792
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:28,365
Clear!

793
01:24:28,965 --> 01:24:30,367
Wheeler, go check the other side.

794
01:24:30,758 --> 01:24:31,668
You too!

795
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:34,271
- Where did he go?
- The past.

796
01:24:57,694 --> 01:25:01,097
- It's in the glove box!
- We're going to check this is real.

797
01:25:04,492 --> 01:25:07,037
- Three, two, one.
- Okay! Okay.

798
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,139
Next one's a bullet to the head.

799
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:12,142
No. No!
- One.

800
01:25:12,575 --> 01:25:13,877
- Listen to me.
- Two.

801
01:25:14,344 --> 01:25:15,178
Three.

802
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,448
- I can help you.
- I don't have time to negotiate.

803
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:20,684
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

804
01:25:22,018 --> 01:25:25,028
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me, now. Is it really in the BMW?

805
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:27,857
- I don't know.
- You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

806
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,160
Who told you that?

807
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,394
- If you're not telling the truth, she dies.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

808
01:25:47,177 --> 01:25:48,178
- Medic!
- Check in.

809
01:25:49,837 --> 01:25:51,247
She's been shot?

810
01:25:51,748 --> 01:25:52,916
Bring her back this side.

811
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:56,519
Was she shot with an inverted round?

812
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,994
This is Ives. He's one of us.

813
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:09,366
- Us! Who are these guys?
- Priya's, ours.

814
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:12,602
How did Sator know about the ambush?
- It's posterity.

815
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:15,038
An ambush in the middle of the street
can't stay out of the record...

816
01:26:15,071 --> 01:26:17,507
Bullshit! He knew every move we made!

817
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,776
Every one of them! Somebody talked! Who was it?

818
01:26:19,809 --> 01:26:21,778
- Was it you?
- No. No.

819
01:26:22,212 --> 01:26:26,783
At every stage, you've known too much.
I'm going to ask you again.

820
01:26:28,018 --> 01:26:29,219
Did you talk?

821
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:35,291
Nobody talked. They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

822
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,093
A what?

823
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,064
A pincer movement. But not in space, in time.

824
01:26:42,165 --> 01:26:44,100
Half his team moves forwards through the event,

825
01:26:44,225 --> 01:26:46,870
he monitors them, and then attacks
at the end, moving backwards.

826
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:50,306
- Knowing everything.
- Except for where I stashed the plutonium.

827
01:26:51,107 --> 01:26:54,544
- Which isn't really plutonium, is it?
- I told you it was what he was after.

828
01:26:54,577 --> 01:26:56,112
And you just told him where it was.

829
01:26:57,681 --> 01:26:58,615
I lied.

830
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,786
Jesus, you lied about it?

831
01:27:02,986 --> 01:27:06,222
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

832
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:09,559
Lying is standard operating procedure.

833
01:27:10,026 --> 01:27:10,994
It spread too far.

834
01:27:11,194 --> 01:27:13,129
- Meaning what?
- She's gonna die.

835
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:15,198
Standard operating procedure.

836
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:17,267
Can't, can't you help her,
can we, can you do something?

837
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,070
Can't you stabilize the inverse radiation
by inverting the patient?

838
01:27:20,537 --> 01:27:22,038
- It takes days.
- Let's go!

839
01:27:22,272 --> 01:27:25,508
We took control of this machine minutes ago,
before that it was Sator's.

840
01:27:25,766 --> 01:27:28,912
- How long is she gonna live on this side?
- Three hours tops.

841
01:27:29,712 --> 01:27:33,450
I'm taking her through. I'm not gonna
let her die. I'll take my chances.

842
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,218
There's no way of bringing you back.

843
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:38,655
- We find another machine.
- A week ago? Where?

844
01:27:40,981 --> 01:27:41,858
Oslo.

845
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:46,162
That facility is inside an airport
security perimeter. It's impregnable.

846
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:48,665
It wasn't last week.

847
01:27:49,232 --> 01:27:51,835
We're going in. You might as well help us.

848
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:55,872
This is a proving window.
As you approach the Turnstile,

849
01:27:55,905 --> 01:27:58,975
if you don't see yourself in the proving window,
do not enter the machine.

850
01:27:58,975 --> 01:27:59,742
Why not?

851
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:02,619
If you don't see yourself reverse-exit
the machine, then you ain't getting out.

852
01:28:02,703 --> 01:28:04,614
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

853
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:09,376
See for yourself. There's your answer. Let's go.

854
01:28:34,043 --> 01:28:36,980
She's stabilizing slowly.
I'll clean and close, but the rest is time.

855
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:40,650
- How long does she need?
- Four, five days. Week for sure.

856
01:28:42,278 --> 01:28:44,854
Neil, find a way to get us to Oslo.
I'm going back out there.

857
01:28:46,956 --> 01:28:47,891
To do what?

858
01:28:48,024 --> 01:28:50,760
To stop Sator from getting away with
whatever it is I just gave him.

859
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:53,863
You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait...

860
01:28:55,031 --> 01:28:56,065
You're going out there for her.

861
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:59,435
He threatened to kill her in the past.
If he does, what happens to her here?

862
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:02,338
It's unknownable.

863
01:29:03,106 --> 01:29:05,108
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

864
01:29:05,275 --> 01:29:08,278
- What do you believe?
- What's happened's happened.

865
01:29:09,212 --> 01:29:11,281
We need to save her here and now.

866
01:29:12,015 --> 01:29:14,817
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

867
01:29:15,878 --> 01:29:17,654
Don't let them take her back through there.

868
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:19,656
- Okay?
- You can't stay here.

869
01:29:21,558 --> 01:29:22,825
We don't have a lot of time.

870
01:29:23,193 --> 01:29:26,129
So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container

871
01:29:26,162 --> 01:29:28,740
that's just come off a ship from Oslo.

872
01:29:28,824 --> 01:29:32,936
This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into if you go through that door.

873
01:29:33,162 --> 01:29:34,837
Well, I'm going. So any tips would be welcome.

874
01:29:35,205 --> 01:29:36,206
Wheeler, brief him.

875
01:29:37,173 --> 01:29:38,208
You'll need your own air.

876
01:29:38,608 --> 01:29:41,544
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

877
01:29:41,945 --> 01:29:45,582
Number-one rule, don't come
into contact with your forward self.

878
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:48,418
That's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

879
01:29:48,418 --> 01:29:49,285
We don't have time.

880
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:52,755
- Well, if your particles come into contact…
- What?

881
01:29:53,223 --> 01:29:55,758
- Annihilation.
- That would be bad, right?

882
01:29:56,559 --> 01:30:00,063
When you exit the airlock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

883
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:02,098
Things will feel strange.

884
01:30:02,966 --> 01:30:04,867
When you run, the wind will be at your back.

885
01:30:05,001 --> 01:30:08,071
If you encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

886
01:30:08,104 --> 01:30:09,706
as the transfer of
heat is reversed.

887
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:13,543
Gravity will feel normal, but you're
reversed for the world around you.

888
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:18,681
You may experience distortions in your vision
and hearing, this is normal.

889
01:30:19,174 --> 01:30:20,783
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

890
01:30:20,984 --> 01:30:24,587
I can't vouch for the handling.
Friction and wind resistance are reversed.

891
01:30:25,054 --> 01:30:27,056
You are inverted. The world is not.

892
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:30,226
- Was there a transponder on the case?
- We've tossed that case.

893
01:30:30,886 --> 01:30:34,163
I'm moving backwards. It's the ball
I have to follow. Give me the reader.

894
01:30:39,335 --> 01:30:40,272
Okay.

895
01:30:41,471 --> 01:30:42,405
You ready?

896
01:33:34,477 --> 01:33:36,145
The material's not in the case.

897
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:40,416
Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.

898
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,218
He was lying.

899
01:33:42,919 --> 01:33:45,755
- It wasn't in the BMW.
- So where is it?

900
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:35,538
I saw the hand-off.
You made me shoot her for nothing.

901
01:34:37,473 --> 01:34:40,743
You did get my pulse above 130.
No one's done that before.

902
01:34:41,477 --> 01:34:42,645
Not even my wife.

903
01:35:12,475 --> 01:35:14,544
You left Ives and his team a hell of a clean-up.

904
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:17,914
Heat transfer was reversed.

905
01:35:19,015 --> 01:35:22,985
You might be the first case of hypothermia
from a gasoline explosion in history.

906
01:35:24,153 --> 01:35:25,821
At this point nothing surprises.

907
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:30,593
- We're headed back to Oslo?
- In a Rotas shipping container.

908
01:35:31,053 --> 01:35:32,461
He's got the material, Neil.

909
01:35:32,995 --> 01:35:34,430
I handed it to him on a plate.

910
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:39,135
- I warned you.
- What's happened's happened. I get it now.

911
01:35:39,728 --> 01:35:43,139
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

912
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:46,542
- That's not fair.
- You were a part of this before we met.

913
01:35:47,543 --> 01:35:49,312
- Were you working for Priya?
- No.

914
01:35:49,445 --> 01:35:50,646
Who recruited you, Neil?

915
01:35:51,581 --> 01:35:54,183
It can't possibly do any good to know that right now.

916
01:35:54,717 --> 01:35:59,255
When this is over, if we're still standing,
and you still care...

917
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:01,657
then you can hear my life story, okay?

918
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:08,130
- I'm sorry I involved you.
- You need to tell me what's going on.

919
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:12,268
Apparently Neil here knows more about
it than I do. Good luck, pal.

920
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:15,404
By telling Kat anything, we're compromising
her in Priya's eyes.

921
01:36:15,438 --> 01:36:20,009
In Priya's eyes she's already compromised.
She has the right to know why she might die.

922
01:36:20,502 --> 01:36:23,045
- Am I going to die?
- Not if we have something to say about it.

923
01:36:23,212 --> 01:36:24,046
And we do.

924
01:36:24,647 --> 01:36:25,581
Who are you?

925
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:30,553
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

926
01:36:37,026 --> 01:36:38,761
The material's not in the case.

927
01:36:39,128 --> 01:36:42,131
Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.

928
01:36:51,474 --> 01:36:52,308
Are you injured?

929
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,615
What's the algorithm, Neil?

930
01:37:02,018 --> 01:37:05,187
The 241 is one section of it. One out of nine.

931
01:37:06,656 --> 01:37:10,893
It's a formula, rendered into physical form
so it can't be copied or communicated.

932
01:37:11,861 --> 01:37:13,529
It's a black box with one function.

933
01:37:14,196 --> 01:37:15,064
Which is?

934
01:37:16,725 --> 01:37:19,168
Inversion. But not objects or people.

935
01:37:19,502 --> 01:37:20,536
The world around us.

936
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:21,804
I don't understand.

937
01:37:21,937 --> 01:37:24,940
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

938
01:37:24,974 --> 01:37:28,277
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

939
01:37:28,978 --> 01:37:31,414
But because the environment's
entropy flows in our direction...

940
01:37:32,682 --> 01:37:36,285
we dominate. They're always swimming upstream.
It's what saved your life.

941
01:37:36,652 --> 01:37:39,155
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

942
01:37:39,522 --> 01:37:40,489
Pissing in the wind.

943
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,592
And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.

944
01:37:43,752 --> 01:37:46,295
It can invert the entropy of the world.

945
01:37:46,762 --> 01:37:47,763
And if that happens?

946
01:37:50,099 --> 01:37:50,966
End of play.

947
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:53,569
"End of play." Can you be a little more precise?

948
01:37:54,036 --> 01:37:56,072
Everyone and everything
that's ever lived

949
01:37:56,096 --> 01:37:58,307
destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

950
01:37:58,674 --> 01:38:00,109
Including my son.

951
01:38:03,605 --> 01:38:06,382
The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal.

952
01:38:22,331 --> 01:38:23,232
On a truck.

953
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:27,069
Shouldn't be long now.

954
01:38:28,697 --> 01:38:32,274
I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.

955
01:38:32,901 --> 01:38:35,111
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?

956
01:38:35,778 --> 01:38:38,848
- Which brings us to the grandfather paradox.
- The what?

957
01:38:39,982 --> 01:38:43,052
If you went back in time
and killed your own grandfather,

958
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,054
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

959
01:38:45,287 --> 01:38:47,954
- What's the answer?
- There's no answer. It's a paradox.

960
01:38:48,491 --> 01:38:51,427
But in the future, those in power
clearly believe that you can

961
01:38:51,527 --> 01:38:54,263
kick Grandpa down the stairs,
gouge his eyes out

962
01:38:54,697 --> 01:38:57,333
and and slit his throat without consequence.

963
01:38:57,967 --> 01:38:58,968
Could they be right?

964
01:38:59,702 --> 01:39:02,304
Doesn't matter. They believe it.

965
01:39:03,506 --> 01:39:04,807
So they're willing to destroy us.

966
01:39:07,235 --> 01:39:08,410
Can I go back to sleep now?

967
01:39:08,744 --> 01:39:10,913
- No, I thought of something else.
- Great.

968
01:39:11,347 --> 01:39:13,048
This reversing the flow of time,

969
01:39:13,516 --> 01:39:15,785
doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?

970
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,386
That we stop them?

971
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:20,289
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.

972
01:39:21,023 --> 01:39:22,057
Pessimistically?

973
01:39:22,424 --> 01:39:25,694
In a parallel-worlds theory we can't
know the relationship between

974
01:39:25,728 --> 01:39:29,465
consciousness and multiple realities.
Does your head hurt yet?

975
01:39:29,832 --> 01:39:30,666
Yes.

976
01:39:34,837 --> 01:39:35,838
Try sleep.

977
01:39:51,387 --> 01:39:52,321
Shit.

978
01:39:53,923 --> 01:39:55,157
They didn't take us inside.

979
01:39:57,259 --> 01:39:58,027
What do we do?

980
01:40:02,198 --> 01:40:05,334
We use the breach.
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

981
01:40:08,437 --> 01:40:09,572
Is she healed enough?

982
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:14,009
I don't know. I've never done this before.

983
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:16,111
The fire crew's there.

984
01:40:17,046 --> 01:40:18,047
We take Kat through the breach,

985
01:40:18,347 --> 01:40:20,349
I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault.

986
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:21,450
Then you bring her in.

987
01:40:23,712 --> 01:40:25,688
- How's the arm?
- Not good.

988
01:40:30,993 --> 01:40:32,528
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

989
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,267
- Hold on.
- What?

990
01:40:38,667 --> 01:40:41,203
You're bleeding. Let me look at you.

991
01:40:48,436 --> 01:40:49,311
Ready?

992
01:41:22,311 --> 01:41:23,712
Wait here. I'm going in.

993
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:21,930
Come on!

994
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:23,399
Go, go, go!

995
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:39,568
You knew it was me coming out
of that vault. Why didn't you say?

996
01:45:40,102 --> 01:45:42,971
That's a lot of explaining when someone's
about to put a bullet in their own brain.

997
01:45:43,364 --> 01:45:47,009
- But afterwards?
- With things the same, I knew you'd be okay.

998
01:45:47,843 --> 01:45:52,314
What's happened's happened. If told you
and you acted differently, who knows?

999
01:45:54,249 --> 01:45:55,784
The policy is to suppress.

1000
01:45:56,919 --> 01:45:57,920
Whose policy?

1001
01:45:59,054 --> 01:46:00,189
Ours, my friend.

1002
01:46:03,751 --> 01:46:06,295
We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

1003
01:46:16,405 --> 01:46:17,239
Kat?

1004
01:46:18,466 --> 01:46:19,441
I'm here.

1005
01:46:20,668 --> 01:46:23,212
There'll be quite a scar, but you'll be okay.

1006
01:46:25,781 --> 01:46:26,782
You did it.

1007
01:46:27,316 --> 01:46:28,383
He did what?

1008
01:46:29,351 --> 01:46:30,719
Andrei has the algorithm.

1009
01:46:32,187 --> 01:46:33,655
You don't know where he is.

1010
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:36,959
Or when.

1011
01:46:38,627 --> 01:46:40,796
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1012
01:46:41,196 --> 01:46:43,665
If I don't do something,
in two days she tells me about the 241.

1013
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:44,866
Nothing can change that.

1014
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,468
We'll see.

1015
01:46:47,362 --> 01:46:48,330
Just get her here.

1016
01:46:51,173 --> 01:46:52,141
Hello, Priya.

1017
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:55,611
What's going on? Where's Neil?

1018
01:46:56,337 --> 01:46:59,414
Nursing Katherine Barton.
Who almost died because of you.

1019
01:46:59,974 --> 01:47:02,192
- What did I do?
- It's what you're going to do.

1020
01:47:02,276 --> 01:47:05,120
In two days you're gonna have me
dangle plutonium-241

1021
01:47:05,146 --> 01:47:07,522
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1022
01:47:07,522 --> 01:47:08,624
Now, I wanna know why.

1023
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:11,159
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1024
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,362
No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm.

1025
01:47:14,922 --> 01:47:16,265
So tell me about it, Priya.

1026
01:47:17,299 --> 01:47:19,268
It's... It's unique.

1027
01:47:19,968 --> 01:47:23,305
The scientist who built it took her own life,
so she couldn't be forced to make another.

1028
01:47:23,338 --> 01:47:25,707
- A scientist in the future.
- Generations from now.

1029
01:47:25,807 --> 01:47:29,578
- Why did she have to kill herself?
- You're familiar with the Manhattan project?

1030
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:34,082
As they approached the first atomic test,
Oppenheimer became concerned

1031
01:47:34,116 --> 01:47:38,329
that the detonation might produce
a chain reaction engulfing the world.

1032
01:47:38,413 --> 01:47:40,289
They went ahead anyway and got lucky.

1033
01:47:40,355 --> 01:47:43,859
Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.

1034
01:47:44,893 --> 01:47:47,162
She devises a method for inverting the world.

1035
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:51,533
But becomes convinced that by destroying us,
they're destroying themselves.

1036
01:47:51,733 --> 01:47:53,268
The grandfather paradox.

1037
01:47:53,694 --> 01:47:56,672
But unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels.

1038
01:47:57,098 --> 01:48:01,376
Splitting the algorithm into nine sections
and hiding them the best place she can think of.

1039
01:48:02,303 --> 01:48:04,246
The past. Here. Now.

1040
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:08,116
There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs.

1041
01:48:08,643 --> 01:48:11,920
Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials
in the history of the world.

1042
01:48:12,054 --> 01:48:14,022
The best hiding place possible.

1043
01:48:14,256 --> 01:48:16,058
Nuclear containment facilities.

1044
01:48:17,051 --> 01:48:20,162
Sator's lifelong mission,
financed and guided by the future,

1045
01:48:20,195 --> 01:48:23,565
has been to find and reassamble the algorithm.

1046
01:48:23,765 --> 01:48:24,865
Why did the choose him?

1047
01:48:24,966 --> 01:48:26,867
Because he was at the right place
at the right time.

1048
01:48:27,169 --> 01:48:29,137
The collapse of the Soviet Union.

1049
01:48:29,338 --> 01:48:32,207
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

1050
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:33,975
How many sections does he have?

1051
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:36,511
After the 241, all nine.

1052
01:48:36,812 --> 01:48:38,080
Jesus Christ.

1053
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:41,016
And that's why you're going
to do things differently this time.

1054
01:48:42,643 --> 01:48:45,687
To change things?
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1055
01:48:45,721 --> 01:48:47,456
So Sator won't get the algorithm.

1056
01:48:49,891 --> 01:48:51,593
If that universe can exist...

1057
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:53,528
we don't live in it.

1058
01:48:53,628 --> 01:48:54,629
Let's try.

1059
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:58,500
- You're going to warn me.
- No, I'm not.

1060
01:48:59,301 --> 01:49:01,536
- Ignorance is our ammunition.
- Come on.

1061
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:03,839
If you had known what the algorithm was,

1062
01:49:04,439 --> 01:49:06,408
would you have let it fall into Sator's hands?

1063
01:49:08,176 --> 01:49:09,911
You want Sator to get
the last section.

1064
01:49:10,011 --> 01:49:12,447
That is the only way
he'll bring together the other eight.

1065
01:49:12,773 --> 01:49:15,817
I was supposed to steal it... then lose it?

1066
01:49:16,144 --> 01:49:17,252
Mission accomplished.

1067
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,121
You used me.

1068
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:21,723
As you used Katherine.

1069
01:49:22,724 --> 01:49:24,226
Standard operating procedure.

1070
01:49:25,894 --> 01:49:26,994
You've done your part.

1071
01:49:27,896 --> 01:49:28,830
My part?

1072
01:49:29,364 --> 01:49:31,500
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

1073
01:49:31,959 --> 01:49:34,770
You... are a protagonist.

1074
01:49:35,237 --> 01:49:37,739
Did you think you were the only one
capable of saving the world?

1075
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:43,712
No.

1076
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:49,918
But I am. Because I haven't told you where
he's assembling the algorithm or when.

1077
01:49:50,185 --> 01:49:50,986
You're about to.

1078
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:53,755
No. I'm not. So deal us in.

1079
01:49:55,216 --> 01:49:55,957
Us?

1080
01:49:56,758 --> 01:49:58,293
Why would you want to involve her again?

1081
01:49:58,427 --> 01:50:00,996
- Because she can get close to him.
- Does he still trust her?

1082
01:50:01,289 --> 01:50:03,331
He thinks she's dead. But he used to.

1083
01:50:03,524 --> 01:50:06,001
You have started looking
at the world in a new way.

1084
01:50:06,427 --> 01:50:07,694
And now it's your turn.

1085
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:11,473
Assuming she makes it out alive,
whether or not you feel she knows too much...

1086
01:50:11,973 --> 01:50:13,642
- I can't.
- If you don't have the authority,

1087
01:50:13,675 --> 01:50:15,610
then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.

1088
01:50:16,704 --> 01:50:17,946
I need your word

1089
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,947
that she and her son will be safe, Priya.

1090
01:50:21,175 --> 01:50:23,452
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1091
01:50:29,758 --> 01:50:30,626
They'll be safe.

1092
01:50:32,453 --> 01:50:34,463
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim.

1093
01:50:35,063 --> 01:50:36,097
Get yourselves up there.

1094
01:50:36,398 --> 01:50:38,166
Ives has a team ready to invert.

1095
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,367
You have a turnstile.

1096
01:50:39,768 --> 01:50:42,204
The exact technology we're trying to suppress.

1097
01:50:42,463 --> 01:50:44,773
Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business.

1098
01:50:45,173 --> 01:50:47,275
But there are some people in the future

1099
01:50:47,635 --> 01:50:50,378
who want to continue
the algorithm's journey into the past.

1100
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:55,684
You see, Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

1101
01:50:56,577 --> 01:50:59,054
It will be founded in the future.

1102
01:51:25,747 --> 01:51:27,115
I can't get over the birds.

1103
01:51:27,883 --> 01:51:29,017
How are you feeling?

1104
01:51:34,923 --> 01:51:36,057
Tell me you're going to kill him.

1105
01:51:37,459 --> 01:51:39,127
- I can't.
- Why not?

1106
01:51:39,394 --> 01:51:41,129
I think you've probably killed a lot of people.

1107
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:42,898
Not with a dead man's switch.

1108
01:51:43,698 --> 01:51:45,166
The fitness tracker he wears.

1109
01:51:45,767 --> 01:51:48,470
- He's obsessive about his health.
- It'll be linked to a switch.

1110
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:52,416
Probably a simple email burst that
reveals the location of the dead drop.

1111
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,476
Set to fire if his heart stops.

1112
01:51:54,676 --> 01:51:56,878
His death activates the algorithm.

1113
01:51:56,912 --> 01:51:58,413
He dies, the world ends.

1114
01:51:58,647 --> 01:51:59,881
No one dares kill him.

1115
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,119
No, you've missed the point.

1116
01:52:06,981 --> 01:52:08,557
He's intending to end his life.

1117
01:52:10,992 --> 01:52:11,793
Why?

1118
01:52:13,328 --> 01:52:14,262
He's dying.

1119
01:52:15,964 --> 01:52:17,732
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1120
01:52:19,593 --> 01:52:21,202
And he's taking the world with him.

1121
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:23,438
If he can't have her, no one can.

1122
01:52:23,939 --> 01:52:27,676
He gets to choose the time and place
for the end of the world.

1123
01:52:28,276 --> 01:52:30,045
What moment? What does he choose?

1124
01:52:32,573 --> 01:52:34,950
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1125
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,618
Vietnam.

1126
01:52:37,085 --> 01:52:38,553
You said he vanished. What day?

1127
01:52:38,646 --> 01:52:41,623
Well, I went ashore with Max and he flew off.
But I don't know what day it was.

1128
01:52:41,656 --> 01:52:45,193
It was the 14th, ten days ago.
He was in Ukraine.

1129
01:52:45,427 --> 01:52:48,797
At the Kiev Opera siege.
How do you know about that?

1130
01:52:50,725 --> 01:52:52,867
The point is he wasn't on his yacht,
so that's his window.

1131
01:52:52,901 --> 01:52:55,370
To go back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.

1132
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:56,771
Everyone's last.

1133
01:52:57,339 --> 01:53:00,208
We have to lift the algorithm from
the dead drop without Sator knowing.

1134
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:02,477
If he believes it's there, he kills himself.

1135
01:53:02,611 --> 01:53:03,778
And not the rest of us.

1136
01:53:04,412 --> 01:53:05,313
Where's the dead drop?

1137
01:53:05,447 --> 01:53:06,881
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1138
01:53:07,148 --> 01:53:08,116
You're not going to tell me?

1139
01:53:08,183 --> 01:53:09,651
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1140
01:53:10,252 --> 01:53:12,520
- But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.
- Why?

1141
01:53:13,147 --> 01:53:17,325
You have to stop him killing himself until we
know the algorithm is out of the dead drop.

1142
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,061
But if I'm caught, then my son sees.

1143
01:53:20,428 --> 01:53:23,231
I don't want those moments to be full
of anguish, if they're going to be his last.

1144
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:25,900
They're not.

1145
01:53:51,292 --> 01:53:54,095
It's time. We're working our way back to the 14th,

1146
01:53:54,095 --> 01:53:55,672
but without knowing where the dead drop is,

1147
01:53:55,756 --> 01:53:57,899
there's only so much I can do to prepare.

1148
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,902
You know what a hypocenter is?

1149
01:54:02,737 --> 01:54:04,873
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.

1150
01:54:04,906 --> 01:54:09,778
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1151
01:54:10,271 --> 01:54:12,347
The dead drop is at
the bottom of the hypocenter.

1152
01:54:12,547 --> 01:54:15,250
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1153
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:18,720
Well then we better pull it out of that hole
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1154
01:54:26,695 --> 01:54:27,362
Next.

1155
01:54:34,736 --> 01:54:35,637
Where's Neil?

1156
01:54:39,066 --> 01:54:41,509
- He must have gone through already.
- I didn't get to say goodbye.

1157
01:54:42,236 --> 01:54:43,411
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1158
01:54:43,838 --> 01:54:46,848
I'd like to say that
you don't have to do this, Kat.

1159
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:49,751
Worst thing Andrei did to me
was that offer he'd made me.

1160
01:54:50,811 --> 01:54:53,121
Let me go if I agreed never
to see my son again.

1161
01:54:55,115 --> 01:54:58,026
I shouted and... swore.

1162
01:54:59,394 --> 01:55:01,463
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.

1163
01:55:05,092 --> 01:55:06,201
I considered it.

1164
01:55:07,428 --> 01:55:09,471
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1165
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:11,539
or because he knows that about me.

1166
01:55:15,076 --> 01:55:18,113
A chance to help save my child,
you can't know what that means to a mother.

1167
01:55:18,947 --> 01:55:21,683
- No.
- You've killed people you've hated before.

1168
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:23,318
It's not usually personal.

1169
01:55:23,618 --> 01:55:25,587
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1170
01:55:25,653 --> 01:55:27,038
It always counts, Kat.

1171
01:55:27,622 --> 01:55:30,225
You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop.

1172
01:55:31,418 --> 01:55:33,762
If we don't lift that algorithm,
and he kills himself,

1173
01:55:33,962 --> 01:55:35,430
he takes us all with him.

1174
01:55:38,333 --> 01:55:39,968
You just keep up your end, okay?

1175
01:55:44,739 --> 01:55:45,774
Today's the 14th.

1176
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:48,777
Offshore of Siberia. Time for us to go.

1177
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:52,347
You keep going back another day,
give you some time time to get back into Vietnam.

1178
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:54,749
- Who gets me on the yacht?
- I've got somebody good lined up.

1179
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:57,952
When it's over, and you're raising
your boy, carry this.

1180
01:55:58,812 --> 01:56:01,022
There may be a time and
place you feel threatened.

1181
01:56:01,055 --> 01:56:03,591
Hit "talk", state your
location, hang up.

1182
01:56:04,192 --> 01:56:05,360
Who gets the message?

1183
01:56:06,194 --> 01:56:07,228
Posterity.

1184
01:56:47,402 --> 01:56:48,470
Stalsk-12.

1185
01:56:48,837 --> 01:56:52,173
Hidden from the world,
it's a city where anything can happen.

1186
01:56:52,466 --> 01:56:56,311
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1187
01:56:56,744 --> 01:56:59,814
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1188
01:57:00,348 --> 01:57:01,816
We're Red, team moving forward.

1189
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:04,219
In order to distinguish the teams,
you'll wear these.

1190
01:57:04,578 --> 01:57:08,256
Our friends over there, Blue team,
led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.

1191
01:57:08,489 --> 01:57:12,102
- Why don't they let us see them?
- Maybe we won't like what happened.

1192
01:57:12,293 --> 01:57:14,829
One hour from now, they had this briefing.

1193
01:57:16,957 --> 01:57:20,034
Then were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter

1194
01:57:20,301 --> 01:57:22,370
as close in time to the
detonation as possible.

1195
01:57:22,737 --> 01:57:26,374
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.

1196
01:57:26,767 --> 01:57:30,311
This briefing has the benefit of their experience.

1197
01:57:47,262 --> 01:57:49,163
Both teams have countdown watches.

1198
01:57:49,497 --> 01:57:53,434
Our counts down from ten from landing,
to zero to the explosion.

1199
01:57:53,534 --> 01:57:55,336
Blue team is reversed.

1200
01:57:55,529 --> 01:57:59,274
If you are not at the LZ at zero,
you are not leaving.

1201
01:58:00,508 --> 01:58:01,643
Do you understand?

1202
01:58:02,243 --> 01:58:05,747
We drop in, clear LZs for Blue team evacuation.

1203
01:58:05,813 --> 01:58:07,448
Make our way into the city proper.

1204
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:11,419
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned there is a turnstile.

1205
01:58:11,686 --> 01:58:13,897
Expect a bitemporal response.

1206
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,834
- They'll have inverse ordinance?
- Inverse, conventional,

1207
01:58:17,918 --> 01:58:20,561
forward antagonists, inverted antagonists.
They have it all.

1208
01:58:21,095 --> 01:58:25,066
On the other side of the city, the ground
rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.

1209
01:58:25,325 --> 01:58:28,136
A splinter unit will take
this tunnel from the city

1210
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:30,605
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1211
01:58:30,698 --> 01:58:33,174
Blue team located an entrance here.

1212
01:58:33,308 --> 01:58:35,009
The bomb is in this rock.

1213
01:58:35,643 --> 01:58:39,614
High above, to trigger a collapse,
sealing the cavern.

1214
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:41,049
How do we defuse the bomb up there?

1215
01:58:41,215 --> 01:58:43,885
We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.

1216
01:58:44,085 --> 01:58:47,522
Our job is to fail to defuse that bomb,

1217
01:58:48,048 --> 01:58:51,459
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1218
01:58:51,826 --> 01:58:53,895
- Which is...?
- Need-to-know, and you don't.

1219
01:58:54,829 --> 01:58:55,997
Any other stupid questions?

1220
01:58:56,764 --> 01:58:58,565
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.

1221
01:59:02,036 --> 01:59:05,239
- I wanted to be on the first wave.
- There is no first wave.

1222
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:07,575
Red team and Blue team
operate simultaneously.

1223
01:59:07,842 --> 01:59:11,479
Look, don't get on the chopper
if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1224
01:59:11,672 --> 01:59:15,049
Now, you want to be on team
that lifts the contents of the capsule?

1225
01:59:15,383 --> 01:59:16,284
Absolutely.

1226
01:59:17,377 --> 01:59:18,519
Yeah, that's us.

1227
01:59:19,354 --> 01:59:21,856
- We're the splinter unit.
- Just us?

1228
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:25,526
No one who knows the contents
of that capsule can leave the field.

1229
01:59:26,754 --> 01:59:28,429
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1230
01:59:38,966 --> 01:59:41,642
It's 40 feet from the private deck
to the water. Can you jump it?

1231
01:59:42,443 --> 01:59:43,678
I can dive it.

1232
01:59:44,278 --> 01:59:46,280
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.

1233
02:00:22,509 --> 02:00:23,518
30 seconds!

1234
02:01:04,859 --> 02:01:05,660
Move!

1235
02:01:17,731 --> 02:01:20,641
We're coming in on the shock wave.
Hang on, people!

1236
02:01:30,084 --> 02:01:31,085
On your feet!

1237
02:01:59,447 --> 02:02:01,349
Ma'am, we thought you'd gone ashore.

1238
02:02:01,382 --> 02:02:02,892
I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

1239
02:02:02,976 --> 02:02:03,985
The boss left...

1240
02:02:05,445 --> 02:02:06,854
Have Mr. Sator find me here.

1241
02:02:07,655 --> 02:02:09,924
And don't tell the others. I'll get the mess.

1242
02:03:18,092 --> 02:03:20,061
- Mines!
- Mines!

1243
02:03:34,501 --> 02:03:36,010
They told me you'd gone ashore.

1244
02:03:38,138 --> 02:03:39,380
They told me you'd flown off.

1245
02:03:39,447 --> 02:03:41,449
I came back to see you and Max.

1246
02:03:41,708 --> 02:03:43,184
Max is on shore with Anna.

1247
02:03:44,885 --> 02:03:46,721
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1248
02:03:46,754 --> 02:03:49,223
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

1249
02:03:49,824 --> 02:03:51,292
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1250
02:03:51,325 --> 02:03:54,395
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1251
02:04:02,829 --> 02:04:04,605
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1252
02:04:20,788 --> 02:04:21,722
Take cover!

1253
02:04:26,327 --> 02:04:29,330
Get me a goddamn AT4!
Take him out! Now!

1254
02:04:30,192 --> 02:04:35,131
Let's go! Move, move, move!
Let's go! Move, move, move!

1255
02:05:45,206 --> 02:05:45,940
Wheeler!

1256
02:05:47,903 --> 02:05:49,577
- Cover!
- Come on!

1257
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:56,684
Ives!

1258
02:05:58,919 --> 02:06:00,321
Splinter unit here!

1259
02:06:02,351 --> 02:06:04,492
You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset.

1260
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:08,129
I'll get Max brought back,
we should share the moment with him.

1261
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:10,464
I'll make you a drink.

1262
02:06:12,194 --> 02:06:13,868
Bring my son back to the boat.

1263
02:06:20,736 --> 02:06:24,412
- We're running out of time, let's go!
- If they see us, it's all for nothing.

1264
02:06:27,943 --> 02:06:30,451
- We need a distraction.
- Don't worry about that.

1265
02:06:34,488 --> 02:06:35,556
On my mark!

1266
02:06:38,721 --> 02:06:41,273
RPG! Take the base!

1267
02:06:41,357 --> 02:06:42,630
That building, on my mark!

1268
02:06:44,526 --> 02:06:46,033
Three! Two!

1269
02:06:46,462 --> 02:06:47,902
One! Fire!

1270
02:06:49,336 --> 02:06:50,137
Fire!

1271
02:07:05,514 --> 02:07:06,353
Move, move!

1272
02:07:22,403 --> 02:07:24,205
We're committed now. Come on.

1273
02:07:30,845 --> 02:07:31,812
What's that?

1274
02:07:32,513 --> 02:07:34,715
I borrowed it from the CIA.

1275
02:07:36,283 --> 02:07:37,251
What is it?

1276
02:07:37,518 --> 02:07:39,520
The way the world ends.

1277
02:07:39,915 --> 02:07:42,256
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1278
02:07:42,756 --> 02:07:43,891
I don't understand.

1279
02:07:44,792 --> 02:07:46,560
When I take this, it's all over.

1280
02:07:47,461 --> 02:07:48,929
Then don't take it yet.

1281
02:07:52,466 --> 02:07:53,334
Why not?

1282
02:07:55,769 --> 02:07:57,338
Because we have the sunset coming,

1283
02:07:57,972 --> 02:07:59,607
and a little vodka left.

1284
02:08:00,741 --> 02:08:02,343
And Max will be here soon.

1285
02:08:02,705 --> 02:08:06,514
They said they thought it was you,
not Anna, ashore with Max.

1286
02:08:09,517 --> 02:08:12,453
So long as you can tell the difference...

1287
02:08:15,217 --> 02:08:18,554
A moment's business, my love.

1288
02:08:29,998 --> 02:08:34,642
Mahir, do you copy? Not clear.
I repeat: Not clear!

1289
02:08:34,742 --> 02:08:35,643
Copy that.

1290
02:08:35,871 --> 02:08:39,675
I repeat: Not clear!

1291
02:09:05,601 --> 02:09:06,373
Neil!

1292
02:09:07,374 --> 02:09:08,242
Neil!

1293
02:09:21,422 --> 02:09:22,122
Go!

1294
02:09:31,493 --> 02:09:33,667
We don't have anything big enough to blow this.

1295
02:09:40,436 --> 02:09:42,142
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

1296
02:09:46,947 --> 02:09:48,682
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

1297
02:09:49,144 --> 02:09:51,085
You try having a look. Can you pick it?

1298
02:09:51,947 --> 02:09:54,722
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.

1299
02:09:55,356 --> 02:09:57,958
How do you like where
my journey began and yours ends?

1300
02:09:58,092 --> 02:09:59,693
A little radioactive for my taste.

1301
02:09:59,888 --> 02:10:02,396
My fate was always bound up with radiation.

1302
02:10:03,998 --> 02:10:06,000
We'd work where no one else would.

1303
02:10:06,767 --> 02:10:08,569
I made a bargain with the devil.

1304
02:10:09,436 --> 02:10:12,806
Money for time. We sold our futures.

1305
02:10:13,168 --> 02:10:16,176
And now you're about to make the same mistake,
but for the entire world.

1306
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:19,346
It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I got.

1307
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,648
What was yours?

1308
02:10:20,848 --> 02:10:23,784
You fight for a cause you barely understand,

1309
02:10:24,485 --> 02:10:27,488
with people you trust so little
you've told them nothing.

1310
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:30,157
When I die, the world dies with me.

1311
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:31,992
And your knowledge dies with you,

1312
02:10:32,126 --> 02:10:35,596
buried in a tomb,
like an anonymous Egyptian builder

1313
02:10:35,763 --> 02:10:38,298
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.

1314
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:40,968
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

1315
02:11:01,817 --> 02:11:04,024
What's more fanatical than trying
to destroy the world?

1316
02:11:04,224 --> 02:11:06,060
I'm not. I'm creating a new one.

1317
02:11:07,356 --> 02:11:10,931
Somewhere, sometime, a man
in a crystaline tower throws a switch

1318
02:11:11,793 --> 02:11:14,868
and armageddon is both
triggered and avoided.

1319
02:11:15,664 --> 02:11:18,639
Now time itself switches direction.

1320
02:11:19,106 --> 02:11:21,208
The same sunshine we basked in

1321
02:11:21,241 --> 02:11:25,279
will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.

1322
02:11:25,574 --> 02:11:26,814
How can they want to kill us?

1323
02:11:27,581 --> 02:11:30,651
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1324
02:11:31,113 --> 02:11:34,021
Don't you see? They have
no choice but to turn back.

1325
02:11:35,155 --> 02:11:36,423
We're responsible.

1326
02:11:50,804 --> 02:11:52,940
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?

1327
02:11:54,503 --> 02:11:55,242
Yes.

1328
02:11:56,276 --> 02:11:58,245
Each generation looks out for its own survival.

1329
02:11:58,512 --> 02:12:00,114
That's exactly what they're doing.

1330
02:12:00,447 --> 02:12:02,282
But not you. You're a traitor.

1331
02:12:02,616 --> 02:12:05,152
Bringing death to all because
you have no life of your own left.

1332
02:12:05,881 --> 02:12:07,387
When I'm done, life continues.

1333
02:12:07,755 --> 02:12:08,922
Not your son's.

1334
02:12:09,484 --> 02:12:12,793
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1335
02:12:13,393 --> 02:12:15,028
You think God will forgive me?

1336
02:12:20,868 --> 02:12:21,668
Wait!

1337
02:12:23,003 --> 02:12:23,771
Wait!

1338
02:12:37,785 --> 02:12:38,752
Cover me!

1339
02:12:47,222 --> 02:12:49,163
Go! Go! Go!

1340
02:12:51,098 --> 02:12:55,469
You don't believe in God, or a future,
or anything outside of your own experience.

1341
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:58,172
The rest is belief,

1342
02:12:58,772 --> 02:13:00,240
and I don't have it.

1343
02:13:01,269 --> 02:13:04,511
Without it you're not human. You're just a madman.

1344
02:13:05,474 --> 02:13:08,215
Or a God, of sorts.

1345
02:13:08,382 --> 02:13:09,249
Like I said.

1346
02:13:12,853 --> 02:13:14,449
Don't do it! Jesus!

1347
02:13:15,017 --> 02:13:16,089
Our time is up.

1348
02:13:22,858 --> 02:13:24,498
I'll give your love to my wife.

1349
02:13:25,666 --> 02:13:27,501
You're forgetting, I haven't met her yet.

1350
02:13:28,101 --> 02:13:30,537
That's right. After you meet her, she dies.

1351
02:13:31,038 --> 02:13:33,340
I'll just give her my love instead.

1352
02:13:34,875 --> 02:13:35,442
Don't do it!

1353
02:13:37,211 --> 02:13:37,945
Volkov.

1354
02:13:38,378 --> 02:13:40,280
Shoot him in the head.

1355
02:13:51,992 --> 02:13:53,760
Enough business, my love.

1356
02:14:21,049 --> 02:14:23,490
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

1357
02:14:25,887 --> 02:14:28,095
But it sounds terribly important.

1358
02:14:30,531 --> 02:14:33,200
- Where are you going?
- Aren't you hot?

1359
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:52,986
- What are you doing now?
- Oh, I spilled sunscreen.

1360
02:14:53,381 --> 02:14:55,055
- So what?
- It's slippery.

1361
02:14:58,525 --> 02:14:59,693
Just come here.

1362
02:15:03,497 --> 02:15:05,732
Turn over. You'll like it.

1363
02:15:40,495 --> 02:15:41,535
I can't do this.

1364
02:15:42,703 --> 02:15:45,472
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1365
02:15:45,505 --> 02:15:48,075
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1366
02:15:50,711 --> 02:15:52,112
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1367
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:55,682
- Come on, come on!
- Tunne's sealed. The gate is closed.

1368
02:15:56,478 --> 02:15:57,718
Mahir, do you copy?

1369
02:15:58,352 --> 02:15:59,086
Yeah.

1370
02:15:59,386 --> 02:16:00,954
Hold! I repeat, hold!

1371
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,061
Look into my eyes.

1372
02:16:09,229 --> 02:16:10,297
Which do you see?

1373
02:16:11,698 --> 02:16:12,699
Despair...

1374
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:14,801
or anger?

1375
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:19,940
I'm not the woman who can find love for you
even though you scarred her on the inside.

1376
02:16:22,009 --> 02:16:25,278
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1377
02:16:28,882 --> 02:16:29,716
You!

1378
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:52,906
Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.

1379
02:16:53,702 --> 02:16:55,876
She jumped the gun. She killed him.

1380
02:17:14,856 --> 02:17:17,097
- Come on, come on!
- Do you think they made it?

1381
02:17:21,796 --> 02:17:23,164
Ah, screw it.

1382
02:18:33,674 --> 02:18:35,609
Kat, you jumped the gun!

1383
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:39,913
I couldn't do it! I couldn't let
him die thinking he'd won.

1384
02:18:40,442 --> 02:18:41,548
I knew you'd find a way.

1385
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:44,952
Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?

1386
02:18:45,185 --> 02:18:47,087
Yeah, we found a way. Be safe.

1387
02:19:09,109 --> 02:19:10,277
I thought you were inverted.

1388
02:19:10,811 --> 02:19:12,179
I changed gears halfway.

1389
02:19:13,947 --> 02:19:15,416
Looked like you needed help here.

1390
02:19:15,916 --> 02:19:17,685
Here? We needed help down there.

1391
02:19:19,253 --> 02:19:20,387
How'd you get that lock open?

1392
02:19:21,488 --> 02:19:23,490
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?

1393
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:25,759
I'll get them on the next pass.

1394
02:19:27,194 --> 02:19:29,964
- Right, Ives?
- Once I've caught my breath.

1395
02:19:44,678 --> 02:19:46,614
No one who's seen it leaves the field.

1396
02:19:55,889 --> 02:19:56,924
Alright.

1397
02:20:00,894 --> 02:20:01,729
We hide it.

1398
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:04,164
We end our lives.

1399
02:20:05,232 --> 02:20:06,867
It's the only way to be sure.

1400
02:20:09,403 --> 02:20:10,437
As to when...

1401
02:20:11,672 --> 02:20:14,041
Maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

1402
02:20:15,136 --> 02:20:16,143
You're not going to kill us?

1403
02:20:16,577 --> 02:20:18,579
If I ever find you, I will.

1404
02:20:19,113 --> 02:20:20,347
You won't look too hard?

1405
02:20:21,549 --> 02:20:22,449
Yes, I will.

1406
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:28,756
You're not going to go back
to London to check on Kat, are you?

1407
02:20:28,822 --> 02:20:30,858
No. It's far too dangerous.

1408
02:20:32,087 --> 02:20:33,227
Even from afar?

1409
02:20:34,929 --> 02:20:36,096
Even from afar.

1410
02:20:38,632 --> 02:20:39,533
Ives!

1411
02:20:40,768 --> 02:20:41,535
Wait.

1412
02:20:48,309 --> 02:20:49,677
You're really going back in?

1413
02:20:52,746 --> 02:20:55,483
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

1414
02:20:56,050 --> 02:20:57,885
I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.

1415
02:20:59,887 --> 02:21:03,023
See? That's me in there, again.

1416
02:21:04,219 --> 02:21:07,889
Weaving another pass
in the fabric of this mission.

1417
02:21:15,703 --> 02:21:16,437
Neil, wait!

1418
02:21:20,975 --> 02:21:22,176
We just saved the world.

1419
02:21:23,144 --> 02:21:24,578
Can't leave anything to chance.

1420
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,648
But can we change things if we do it differently?

1421
02:21:28,516 --> 02:21:29,750
What's happened happened.

1422
02:21:30,945 --> 02:21:33,554
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1423
02:21:34,588 --> 02:21:36,023
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1424
02:21:37,051 --> 02:21:38,793
- Fate?
- Call it what you want.

1425
02:21:39,654 --> 02:21:40,394
What do you call it?

1426
02:21:41,395 --> 02:21:42,363
Reality.

1427
02:21:45,199 --> 02:21:46,200
Now, let me go.

1428
02:21:52,239 --> 02:21:54,508
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1429
02:21:54,942 --> 02:21:56,310
Haven't you guessed by now?

1430
02:21:57,778 --> 02:21:58,746
You did.

1431
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,915
Only not when you thought.

1432
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:03,751
You have a future in the past.

1433
02:22:04,512 --> 02:22:07,154
Years ago for me. Years from now for you.

1434
02:22:08,689 --> 02:22:09,857
You've known me for years?

1435
02:22:11,786 --> 02:22:15,262
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1436
02:22:15,723 --> 02:22:17,231
But for me, It's just the beginning.

1437
02:22:18,226 --> 02:22:19,600
We get up to some stuff.

1438
02:22:20,534 --> 02:22:22,737
You're gonna love it. You'll see.

1439
02:22:23,838 --> 02:22:26,073
This whole operation
is a temporal pincer.

1440
02:22:26,707 --> 02:22:27,675
Whose?

1441
02:22:29,437 --> 02:22:32,413
Yours! You're only halfway there.

1442
02:22:33,047 --> 02:22:34,448
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

1443
02:22:43,518 --> 02:22:45,693
We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

1444
02:22:46,661 --> 02:22:48,396
The world will never know what could've happened.

1445
02:22:50,558 --> 02:22:53,034
And even if they did, they wouldn't care.

1446
02:22:57,649 --> 02:22:59,949
Because no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.

1447
02:23:00,886 --> 02:23:02,254
Only the one that did.

1448
02:23:05,273 --> 02:23:06,525
Do it before the boy comes out.

1449
02:23:09,328 --> 02:23:12,531
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1450
02:23:12,614 --> 02:23:15,134
And I told you then what it would be worth.

1451
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:18,003
Here. Today.

1452
02:23:19,371 --> 02:23:20,439
How did you know?

1453
02:23:23,024 --> 02:23:25,511
Cannon Place, 15:00. Probably nothing, I...

1454
02:23:25,911 --> 02:23:26,879
Posterity.

1455
02:23:27,095 --> 02:23:30,632
Cannon Place, 15:00. Probably nothing, I...

1456
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:34,119
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1457
02:23:35,203 --> 02:23:38,223
- I had to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1458
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:40,225
- Then whose was it?
- Mine.

1459
02:23:40,826 --> 02:23:43,862
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1460
02:23:44,763 --> 02:23:46,165
I'm the protagonist.

1461
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:51,236
Then you'd better tie up those loose ends.

1462
02:23:54,973 --> 02:23:56,207
Mission accomplished.

1463
02:23:58,544 --> 02:24:00,111
It's the bomb that didn't go off.

1464
02:24:00,846 --> 02:24:02,915
The danger no one knew was real.

1465
02:24:08,921 --> 02:24:11,456
That's the bomb with the real power
to change the world.

1466
02:24:29,708 --> 02:24:31,708
Corrected based on the script. Fuck Nolan for
making people see this in theaters during a pandemic.
