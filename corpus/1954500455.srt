1
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,956
All right. I'm coming,
I'm coming.

2
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,558
You paid him, right?
You paid him?

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,693
- Of course I paid him.
- I'm not a tourist.

4
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,428
Thank you. I could use
a little help here.

5
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,763
I'm coming, I'm coming.

6
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:33,431
Okay. Balloon wrangler.

7
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,599
Thank you.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,101
Watch her head.
Watch her head.

9
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,069
I'm watching her head, Laila.
Ow!

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,704
Congratulations.
That went well.

11
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,056
It's fine, it's fine.
All right, Frannie.

12
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:42,607
You're all right, honey.
Give me your hand.

13
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:43,808
We're going to get you
out of this cab.

14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:44,809
Come on.
We're so close.

15
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,895
I got you.
We're so close.

16
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,314
Oh, hey, look at that.

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,582
Leaning on the door.

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,450
Okay, ready?
Quick.

19
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,452
Here.
Under your pit.

20
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,852
Under the pitter.
There you go!

21
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,905
Just got to get a hold of her.
Okay, like that.

22
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,123
Under your butt.
We're fine.

23
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,525
Okay?
You're not going to fall.

24
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,126
I got you.
Aah!

25
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,129
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,330
And look at that.

27
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,699
Okay.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,734
You should have just
come to live with me.

29
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,719
Why...
We're going to be fine.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,271
Really? In a four-story walk-up.

31
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,378
A four-story walk-up.

32
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:16,541
I don't know how they can let
people just leave on their own

33
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:17,909
without any help.
It's crazy.

34
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,511
What is she supposed to have?
A police escort?

35
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,512
Well.
Come on.

36
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,047
- No.
- Yes, you have to.

37
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,549
Watch this.
I'm going to be right here.

38
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,024
Look, it's me. Hi!
I got you.

39
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,354
Got it?
Okay, Laila, lift her.

40
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,355
Okay.
On three, you guys.

41
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,489
Watch your back!
One, two,

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,627
three.
Whee!

43
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,429
Yay! Attagirl!

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,899
You are... Okay,
okay, okay.

45
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,301
This is really the worst thing
that has ever happened to me.

46
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,804
Let's just take a little break.

47
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,671
Here we go. You're doing great.

48
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,373
Why don't you put down
that frigging plant?

49
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,208
Can't just leave it
in the hallways.

50
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,110
There's no way we can
get her up there.

51
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,244
No way.

52
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,483
You guys, I'm really tired.

53
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,287
Oh, let's ask him for help.

54
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,821
No... Oh.

55
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,807
Is he the one with the...?
Yeah, he's an asshole.

56
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,642
He looks strong.
Oh, my God. I hate him.

57
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:08,492
- You got her?
- Yeah.

58
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,261
Good. Excuse me.

59
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:12,430
Um, I was just wondering if you
could give us a hand for a sec.

60
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,865
What?

61
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,433
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know if you noticed.

62
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,368
Like, we could really
use an extra pair of hands.

63
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,537
I'm sorry, I got to get to work.

64
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,172
She... She got hit by a car.

65
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,774
We just brought her home
from the hospital.

66
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,609
We could really use
an extra pair of hands here.

67
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,610
What do you want me to do?
Well, I don't know.

68
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,346
Uh, okay, what is...?
Hi. By the way,

69
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,080
you're very loud.
Really?

70
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,217
Um, what if... What if you,
like, leaned back?

71
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,485
What if she leaned back,
you know, and then...

72
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:37,422
You know, just like leaned back.

73
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,423
Hey!
No, no, no...

74
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,091
And then we could help her hop.

75
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,925
Really? Just going
to help her hop.

76
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,127
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,702
You know what?
I know what we're going to do.

78
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,270
Okay.

79
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,013
Sorry.

80
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,848
I got it.

81
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,222
Ah!

82
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,959
Yeah. Do it like this.

83
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,461
Please lord Jesus.

84
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:19,367
Oh, God...

85
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,607
Yeah. Got it.

86
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,708
Oh... Aah! Aah!

87
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,077
Easy, easy, easy.

88
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,181
Easy.

89
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,781
Okay.

90
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,983
Focus. Right here.

91
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,451
You're on my ass.

92
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,620
There you go.

93
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,862
Easy, easy.

94
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,663
Ah... Ah...

95
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,097
Easy, easy, easy.

96
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,333
He got you.

97
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,501
All right.

98
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,769
Fuck me.

99
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,936
What a champ.

100
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,638
That was a really great...

101
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,073
Okay. Thanks so much.

102
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,576
He doesn't look so good.

103
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,645
Listen, I filled your whole
fridge full of food.

104
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,947
Really good stuff.

105
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,282
Don't worry about it.
It's on me.

106
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,585
Henry and I moved
everything around,

107
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:16,867
so it's within arm's reach...
Wait, where's my didgeridoo?

108
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,356
That thing went
to Housing Works.

109
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:20,758
Oh, no, thanks.
I got to go.

110
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,160
I totally told you I had to go.

111
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,161
Oh.
I told you that.

112
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,229
I can show you the email.
What... Okay.

113
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,532
- We went through this already.
- Yeah, but that's totally...

114
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,333
Don't fight.
Please don't fight, you guys.

115
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,201
I'll put the ice in the thing.

116
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,604
That needs to be changed
every three hours.

117
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,138
Yeah, we all got the lesson.
We were all there.

118
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,192
It's good.
Wow. Okay.

119
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,208
Well, why don't I just...
Okay.

120
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:39,710
...put the instructions
on the fridge

121
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,016
so we'll have them,
in case anyone forgets.

122
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,683
Hey, when is the, um,

123
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,251
PT nurse person coming?

124
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,922
She's starting tomorrow.
Every other day.

125
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,390
All right.

126
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,359
All right.
Everything's okay.

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,227
I'm going to see you tonight
after 6:00, okay?

128
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,362
Everything's going to be fine.

129
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:00,465
Just in case
you change your mind,

130
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,799
my offer still stands.

131
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,768
Please come and stay with me.
We would love to have you.

132
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,703
Thank you.
All right?

133
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,537
Sweetie?

134
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:09,641
Okay, so you've been really great.
And you too.

135
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,241
Um, call me later.

136
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:12,677
Thank you. Go.
I have so much room.

137
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,078
- We're kind of rich.
- We're good.

138
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,988
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye, you guys.

139
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,291
Shh, shh.

140
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:36,065
She's the worst!
Oh, my God. The worst!

141
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,136
Can you imagine?
What?

142
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,538
Living with your sister.
Oh!

143
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,705
Trapped, defenceless
in New Jersey.

144
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,441
I would shoot myself
in the face.

145
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,876
Oh, my God.

146
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,277
Don't worry.
You don't need her.

147
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,612
We're all going
to take care of you.

148
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,614
Thanks.

149
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,047
Are you hungry?

150
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,048
No.
No?

151
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm not going to eat
for the next three months.

152
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,854
I don't want to get fat.

153
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,855
Smart.
Thank you.

154
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,530
Hey.

155
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,297
Yeah, I'm at Frannie's.
I told you that.

156
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,366
Tell him I said hi.
What's the matter?

157
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,568
Uh, around 5:00.

158
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,569
I can be home at 5:00, right?
Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,245
What do you mean
you want to talk to me?

160
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:22,879
Well, what do you mean?
Why does it have to wait?

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,512
That's so weird and mysterious.

162
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,454
You're freaking me out.
What do you mean?

163
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,059
Well, why can't you just
tell me now?

164
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,460
Okay, so it's bad then.

165
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,227
You're going to tell me
something bad.

166
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:39,965
What, are you going to break up
with me or something?

167
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,732
I can't believe
this is happening!

168
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,602
Four fucking years,
and this is how you end it?!

169
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:49,106
I thought we were going
to get married! I thought...

170
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,943
I thought this was it.

171
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,915
He wants to be with
this girl at his job!

172
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,350
Oh, God!

173
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,457
You stay here.
No! No!

174
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,754
I'm here for you.
I know.

175
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,624
Actually, I kind of can't really
concentrate on anything else.

176
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,627
I'm not going to eat...
I'm just going to take

177
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,761
a couple of these for the road.

178
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,362
Okay.
I'm so sorry!

179
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,843
Okay. You call me.
I love you so much!

180
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,232
I will.

181
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,602
I'm so sorry.
You let me...

182
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,335
I'm sorry, baby.
I'll call you later.

183
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,371
Okay, you call me.

184
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,807
Okay, bye.

185
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,562
Are you kidding me?

186
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,869
Hey, Jason.
It's me again. What's up?

187
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,007
I'm just calling to check in.

188
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,677
Um...

189
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,778
you give me a call?

190
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,513
Okay.

191
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,652
Love you. Bye.

192
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,473
Fallon, come on!

193
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,108
Hurry up!
I got to take a dump,

194
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,177
and there's no way I'm going
in that fucking pan.

195
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,678
Frannie?

196
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,047
Yeah?

197
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,682
It's Rachel.

198
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,985
I... I work with Fallon.

199
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,986
Is it okay if I come...?
Yeah.

200
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,689
Yeah.

201
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,758
Hi.

202
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,927
I'm so sorry.

203
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,595
Fallon had to run home.

204
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,665
A pipe broke in her house.
So she sent you?

205
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,767
I know. This is so weird, right?
I'm so sorry.

206
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,768
Why didn't she call me?
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,942
She had to run out. I know she
felt real bad about it.

208
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,578
Um...

209
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:42,812
can I maybe...

210
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:45,719
help you with something?

211
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,220
Okey-doke.

212
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,522
Okay, um, please...

213
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,724
just don't look down.

214
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,725
Okay?
Oh, yeah.

215
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,593
Just...
No, I'll look up.

216
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,295
I'm going to take my pants down.

217
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,263
Oh, my God.
I'm taking my pants down.

218
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,298
It's okay. I'm not looking...
Please.

219
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,299
I have to give you my crutch.
Okay.

220
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,068
Okay?
Okay.

221
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,072
Okay.
Okay.

222
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,398
You stay with me.
Okay.

223
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:10,809
Stay with me.
You're not staying with me.

224
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,483
I am.
Okay, you stay with me.

225
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,311
You stay with me... Ah!

226
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:15,747
Go. Thank you.
Uh, all right.

227
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,547
Bye-bye. Thank you
very much.

228
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,287
Thank you!
Just shut the door behind you!

229
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,058
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

230
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,233
So, you know
that asshole neighbour?

231
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,736
Mm-hmm.
He's making noise again.

232
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,471
It started, like...
Like, it's like in...

233
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,040
It was in the bathroom...
Okay.

234
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,274
Is there anything else
you need me to do before I go?

235
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,909
Oh, hey, how's your pain?

236
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,815
Totally hurts all the time.

237
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,682
So, uh, be sure
and give me a call

238
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:28,619
after the PT nurse
gets here, okay?

239
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,019
- I got to get off to work.
- What? Wait. You...

240
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,187
You can't stay?

241
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:33,290
Oh, no, sweetie.
I got to go.

242
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,691
Okay.

243
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,696
Okay, bye.

244
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,863
Bye.

245
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,799
I...

246
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,484
How are you going
to buzz her in?

247
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,971
I have no idea.

248
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:50,065
I don't know. I guess I'll just
get up and do it.

249
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,143
I'm going to order you
a wheelchair.

250
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:54,711
Right? Right.

251
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:57,984
Because you could wheel yourself
to the door.

252
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,417
Hey, did I...

253
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,787
Did you hear about the devil?

254
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,989
Yes.

255
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,791
We talked about it.

256
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,792
We did?
Yeah.

257
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,663
Before the accident.

258
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:16,867
Isn't that insane?
It was like $6 million.

259
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,103
Okay.

260
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,338
Frannie,

261
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,840
please do not obsess about him.

262
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,142
I'm...
Please.

263
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,543
Please.

264
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:29,245
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

265
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,815
And good things happen
to bad people.

266
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,850
There's nothing we can do
about it.

267
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:37,521
We just try and act
a little dignified, okay?

268
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,389
Great. I got to go.

269
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,492
I love you.

270
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,663
Bye.

271
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,302
<i>Topped with caramelized pecans.</i>

272
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,704
<i>Then the strawberries
that we cut up</i>

273
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,840
<i>just soaking in that sugar,
that natural sweetness,</i>

274
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,176
<i>just coming out from
the strawberry and the juice.</i>

275
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,978
<i>Oh! I can just taste it.</i>

276
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,080
<i>You can also use this
on pound cakes,</i>

277
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,983
<i>cereal, banana splits and...</i>

278
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,787
I hate you.

279
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,254
I hate you.

280
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,327
Ha!

281
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,964
Ha!

282
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,364
Huh?

283
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,666
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

284
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,667
Ah, ah.

285
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,739
Oh, fuck!

286
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,075
Oh!

287
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,273
I'm going to kill you!

288
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,577
Ow! Okay...

289
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,759
Can you please

290
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,599
lower your fucking music?

291
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,233
Jesus Christ.

292
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,503
Hey! And keep it lower, okay?

293
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,038
So I don't have
to come back here again.

294
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,574
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

295
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,442
It's not like it's 2:00
in the morning.

296
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:13,844
You going to argue with me?

297
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,912
Crippled lady in the hallway?

298
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,181
Huh?

299
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,782
Fine.

300
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,320
And you know what else?
Hey!

301
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,993
You have to come make me
a sandwich.

302
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,862
So, um, what is up with all
the music and the grunting?

303
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,397
Are you, like, exercising?

304
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,132
None of your business.

305
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,033
Well, you don't have
to be rude about it.

306
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,469
How am I rude?

307
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,170
Because I don't want to haul you
up five flights of stairs?

308
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,739
Or, like, talk about what I do
inside my own home?

309
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,142
Yeah. For starters.

310
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,143
Why? So that then you can
call me every day and be like,

311
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,446
"I am so sorry,
I really am so sorry,

312
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,114
but can you buy me
some toilet paper?"

313
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,183
Or, like, "Oh, hey,
do you want to watch TV with me?

314
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm so lonely."

315
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,624
You know what? You're...

316
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,057
You're awful.

317
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,558
You know what?
I have a mom and a crazy sister

318
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,927
I have to worry about,
all right?

319
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,195
I have an old aunt who lives
in Connecticut

320
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:06,997
who I never get to visit,
all right?

321
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:09,233
And, yeah, when I get home I
want to work out like an animal.

322
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,268
So why should I care
about some injured neighbour

323
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,037
who doesn't have anybody
to take care of her?

324
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,507
I have people
to take care of me.

325
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,641
Okay?

326
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,243
Really.
Yeah. Really.

327
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,245
I could be living in New Jersey
right now if I wanted to,

328
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:25,782
with my sister, but I am
choosing to be independent.

329
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,383
Yeah, very independent.
Knock, knock.

330
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,227
"Hey, stranger,
make me a sandwich."

331
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:33,523
I was hit by a car!

332
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,258
Okay?

333
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,726
Jesus Christ, I just...

334
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,062
Forgive me for wanting
to be in my own home.

335
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,665
And my friends said
that they would help me.

336
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,068
But they don't want to help you.
Yes, they...

337
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,802
They're just being nice.
They want to go to the movies,

338
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,503
or they want to go out to eat,

339
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:47,937
or whatever other
fun things they do.

340
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:49,440
Just not sitting here with you.

341
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,608
Because everyone's
just trying to squeeze out

342
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,909
a little happiness from life,

343
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,545
or just get
some boring shit done.

344
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,113
And the last thing they want
is someone getting in their way.

345
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,815
When someone asks me
to do them a favour,

346
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,149
it feels like they're literally
sucking the air out of my lungs.

347
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,987
Like they're trying
to steal my life.

348
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,289
Go.

349
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,624
Goodbye.

350
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,195
At least I'm honest.

351
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,665
Hey.

352
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,300
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

353
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:20,005
Um, you know,
I've been thinking.

354
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,239
<i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,674
Yeah. Um...

356
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,678
you know, maybe it would be
better if I just...

357
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,780
You know, if I just came
to New Jersey.

358
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,050
<i>What, uh... What made you
change your mind?</i>

359
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,954
Just, um...

360
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:40,591
You know, I realized it was
kind of selfish of me

361
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,994
to, you know, want to be here...

362
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,229
inconveniencing everyone.

363
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,998
<i>No, but seriously,</i>

364
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,537
<i>you know that, uh, that pipe
that burst in the den, right?</i>

365
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,903
Yeah.

366
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,536
<i>Right, so that's being torn up.</i>

367
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,608
<i>So, uh, you'd have to s-stay
in the living room.</i>

368
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,410
Okay.

369
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:03,015
<i>But it'll be so fun
either way, right?</i>

370
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:07,084
<i>The kids are going to be
so happy to have you there.</i>

371
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,719
<i>So I'll see you tonight.</i>

372
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,354
Actually, no.
Jason's coming over tonight.

373
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,855
So I'm good to go.

374
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,225
<i>Okay. See you in the morning.</i>

375
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,326
Okay.

376
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,327
Bye.

377
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,537
You cannot stay
with your sister.

378
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,904
You can't do it.

379
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,908
You need to maintain
your own person space.

380
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,242
Really? Is it that terrible
an idea?

381
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,246
Montclair?
In her living room.

382
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,748
Honey, no.

383
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,383
No, I'm going to second him.
No.

384
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,317
There's no fucking way
I'm letting you go to Montclair.

385
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,820
That's like the worst idea
I've heard this entire year.

386
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
Absolutely not.

387
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:44,922
Really?

388
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,656
I'm sorry,
what is your name again?

389
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:47,857
Lawrence.

390
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,058
Hi.
Hi.

391
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,427
Where's your bathroom?

392
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,894
Um, it's right there.

393
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,564
Thanks.
Thank you.

394
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,731
You go, girl.

395
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,733
Oh, my God.

396
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,335
Jase...
Oh, no, no, no.

397
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,337
Okay, I'm sorry.
You knew you were coming.

398
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,039
You're supposed to give me
a sponge bath.

399
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,508
I know. Things happen,
and they changed.

400
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,509
Did you meet him on Grinder?
What?

401
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,444
You met him on Grinder.

402
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:09,746
I was online for two minutes,

403
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:10,948
and his headline
was "cutie with a booty."

404
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,382
It just drew me right in.

405
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,151
Jason!

406
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,187
Look at me. I can't meet
a new gay looking like this.

407
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,691
Look, I'm in a garbage bag!
So what? Whatever, like we care.

408
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,891
Look. Jason, please don't
take your pants off.

409
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:22,692
Okay, I won't. I'm sorry.

410
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,294
Can I say something?
What?

411
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,295
He's really cute though, right?
: And so nice!

412
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,463
He's so fucking nice.
So cute, his little eyes.

413
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,634
He's so cute I'm going to punch
him in the face! I love him.

414
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:32,688
How cute is that?
Hi.

415
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,904
You're supposed
to give me a sponge bath.

416
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,440
What? I'm going to give you
a sponge bath.

417
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,941
I smell like a... I'm so sorry.

418
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,442
I could help.
I had a grandma,

419
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:40,978
she lived to be 102.

420
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,912
You know what? He could help.
He had a grandma, 102.

421
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:44,381
He used to give sponge baths
to his grandmother.

422
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,882
So we'll give you
a sponge bath together.

423
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,734
It's perfect!
You guys, please.

424
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,688
I'm good.
I can do it myself.

425
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:51,822
I'm good.

426
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,156
I love you.
I loved meeting you.

427
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,194
I am... I'm good.
All right. Okay, okay.

428
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,060
Okay, fine. You know what?
Let's go. We'll go.

429
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,496
Oh, my God!

430
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,397
What?
The devil.

431
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,133
Frannie had
this boyfriend, okay?

432
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,135
Took care of him for two years.

433
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,338
Colon cancer.
Oh, my God.

434
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:08,771
Through the whole thing.
And then you know what?

435
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:09,940
He broke up with her.

436
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,607
No.
Yeah. He did.

437
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,410
Yeah, and now he just sold some
kind of like techie thingy.

438
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,710
Well, I mean, obviously...

439
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,212
I mean, who isn't selling
a techie thingy?

440
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,635
He's all over the Internet.

441
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,284
It's literally multi millions
of dollars.

442
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,184
It's not really that big.
My whole point is...

443
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,987
All I'm saying is you're being
a little dramatic right now.

444
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,855
It's not that big of a deal.

445
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:29,061
You are going through it.

446
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,098
Right?

447
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,625
<i>Hello?</i>

448
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,729
Hey, Devon.

449
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,130
<i>Frannie?</i>

450
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,865
Yeah. It's me, Frannie.

451
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,200
<i>Hi.</i>

452
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:18,969
<i>Um, what are you...?</i>

453
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,105
Yeah, I know. I know,
it's kind of late. I'm sorry.

454
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:27,613
I just...
Um, I wanted to talk.

455
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,212
<i>You want to talk now?</i>

456
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:31,647
Uh, no.

457
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,883
Um... no.

458
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:35,951
Uh, can...

459
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:39,525
Well, in person.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?

460
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,825
<i>Um, sure.</i>

461
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:44,460
Okay.
<i>I can do it after work.</i>

462
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,363
Yeah.
<i>Okay.</i>

463
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,198
Okay.

464
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,066
But you're going
to have to come,

465
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,836
um, to my place.

466
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,442
Is... Is that cool?

467
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:59,810
<i>Okay. I'm not sure...</i>
That's okay. You know what?

468
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,379
I can... I'll text you
the address.

469
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
Okay?

470
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,281
<i>Okay.</i>

471
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,650
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

472
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,451
Am I okay? Yeah.

473
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:11,356
I mean, no.
I mean, yeah.

474
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,891
<i>Uh... okay.</i>

475
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,526
<i>Um...</i>

476
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,894
<i>sorry, so I'll see you
around 6:00.</i>

477
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:20,463
Cool.

478
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:21,864
<i>Okay.</i>

479
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,799
Okay. Bye.

480
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,934
<i>Bye.</i>

481
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,104
Good night. Okay.

482
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,317
Fuck. Okay.

483
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,220
Hold on. Go back.

484
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,587
Aah!

485
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,671
I'll be right there!

486
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,573
Hi.

487
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,982
Uh, hi.

488
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:24,396
So, the big sale.

489
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:27,931
Congratulations.

490
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,534
Oh, thanks.

491
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,302
You've been working on that
forever.

492
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:33,303
Yeah.

493
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,540
And you still have
that girlfriend?

494
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,209
Yeah.

495
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,809
What is her name again?

496
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,380
Jodi.
Right. Jodi.

497
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,150
Ow. Sorry.

498
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,150
How long has it been?
Two years.

499
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,557
Wow.

500
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,428
That's awesome.

501
00:24:57,428 --> 00:25:00,639
Hey, how great to know she's not
with you just for your money.

502
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:02,364
Right?

503
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:03,900
Yeah.

504
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,335
Yeah. Um...

505
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,970
listen, I'm really sorry
about all this.

506
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,672
Yeah.

507
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:12,441
I know you must be wondering
why I called you,

508
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:16,579
like, just to come stare
at me in my bed.

509
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,515
No, I mean...
No, I'm glad you told me.

510
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,783
Yeah. I bet.

511
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,116
Uh...

512
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,485
gosh.

513
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:23,653
Uh...

514
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:25,022
That's all it was.

515
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,624
I just wanted you to know
for some reason.

516
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,893
Okay.

517
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,763
Thank you.

518
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:36,269
I'm glad I know.

519
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,072
Well, I should probably
be going.

520
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,306
Of... Yeah.

521
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,141
Yeah.
Get out of here.

522
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,742
I have dinner plans
with Jodi, so...

523
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,944
Of course. Of course.

524
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:50,647
This is not fun.

525
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,651
Where are you going?

526
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:55,818
Uh, where?

527
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,886
Yeah, what restaurant?
Oh, Loy.

528
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:59,290
Loy?

529
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,790
I've never been to Loy.

530
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,125
It's good.

531
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,562
I mean, it's for our
anniversary.

532
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,965
Two years.

533
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,100
Wow.

534
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,702
Don't be late.

535
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:17,574
Um, so I'll see you soon.

536
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,276
Okay.

537
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:23,278
And, you know,
call me if you need anything.

538
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,847
What?

539
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:26,518
What did you say?

540
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:28,485
What?

541
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,153
"Call me if you need
anything."

542
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:32,354
Really?
That's amazing.

543
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,619
What do you mean?
What am I supposed to say?

544
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:37,163
That's it?

545
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:40,596
You want money.

546
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:42,800
I knew it. That's what Jodi said
it probably was.

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,802
Is that what she said?

548
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:49,506
That's great. No, I didn't say
I wanted money, Devon.

549
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,973
No, but what else could it be?

550
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,409
You call me up right after
my deal is announced.

551
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,809
Jesus, Frannie,
if you want money...

552
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,712
You know what?
I want you to take care of me.

553
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,081
What?

554
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,083
That's what I want, okay?

555
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,285
I want you to take care of me

556
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:05,625
the way that I took care of you.

557
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,696
Come on.

558
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,897
Um, I know you have people
in your life

559
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,966
that can do that for you.
Sure, here and there,

560
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,237
if they can fit me in.

561
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,939
But I'm not anyone's priority.

562
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,441
Okay. Well...

563
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,179
some things never change,
I guess.

564
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,178
And what is that
supposed to mean?

565
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,479
You've always been a little...

566
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,014
You know, you get dramatic
sometimes.

567
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,915
Oh, really?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

568
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,720
Was I dramatic ever the entire
time I took care of you? Hmm?

569
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,056
Did I ever feel sorry
for myself?

570
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,624
Did I ever make it about me?

571
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,759
No, but I just don't understand
what you want me to do.

572
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,862
Want me to change my entire life
around and take care of you?

573
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,198
What do I tell Jodi?
What do I tell my partners?

574
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,531
This is pathetic.

575
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,334
I'm not going to beg you
to help me.

576
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:55,704
So, uh, go to Loy
and just forget me

577
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:58,475
losing two years of my life
taking care of you.

578
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,877
At your side, every moment
in the hospital,

579
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,479
at every doctor's visit.

580
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,183
I lost a tooth because I didn't
go to the dentist.

581
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:10,353
Remember?
My bottom second molar?

582
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:11,354
That's gone.
Fine.

583
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,690
That ship has sailed.
Fine!

584
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,525
I owe you everything, okay?
Everything.

585
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:17,790
What do you want me to do?
What do you need?

586
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,201
Hi.
Hey.

587
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,905
Sorry I'm late.

588
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,274
I'm I ordered us
a bottle of wine.

589
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:34,210
It's a Châteauneuf-du-Pape 1984.

590
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,979
That's good, right?

591
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,113
Yeah.
Oh.

592
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,350
It's our anniversary, so...

593
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,299
Yeah, that...
That was a great choice.

594
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,525
Um, just tell me.

595
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,959
What... What did she want?

596
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:52,397
Money, right?

597
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:55,397
I knew it.

598
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
People are so predictable.

599
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,104
Well, uh, she is...
She was in a car accident.

600
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,771
Oh. Bad?

601
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:05,441
Yeah. She broke an arm
and her leg.

602
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:08,877
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jodi.

603
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:10,479
Now I feel so bad.

604
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,281
I was getting so jealous.

605
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:14,282
Oh, oh.
I know, I know.

606
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,219
That is...
That's my issue.

607
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,953
And I promise I will work on it.

608
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:20,824
But knowing
that you were seeing her...

609
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,293
you know, the one who took
care of you.

610
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,294
Oh, that.
Yeah.

611
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:28,230
It's... But I wish I was the one
who took care of you then.

612
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,033
Trust me, you don't.

613
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:34,604
I know, but it must be such
a special bond you share.

614
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,843
I hate it.

615
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,475
Are you going to give her some?

616
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,783
I don't know.

617
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,250
What do you think?

618
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,452
Um...

619
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,255
I think you should.

620
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,324
Poor thing.

621
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,894
Arm and a leg.

622
00:29:56,894 --> 00:30:00,736
I mean, not a lot but,
you know, why not?

623
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:15,210
So tomorrow after work,
we'll come and pick you up

624
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,712
and get you packed.

625
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:19,348
And we'll get you
down the stairs in a wheelchair.

626
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,217
Or the crutches.
Doesn't matter.

627
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,785
Henry's really strong.

628
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:26,355
Actually, I kind of don't need
to do that anymore.

629
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,891
What? Why?

630
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,366
I spoke to Devon,
and he's going to help me.

631
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:37,967
What?

632
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,568
Yeah.

633
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:41,504
He agreed to be my primary
caregiver.

634
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,806
You're off the hook.

635
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,208
Devon?

636
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,375
Yes.

637
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,844
"Devon" Devon?

638
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,048
"Yeah" yeah.

639
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,680
How'd that happen?
I don't know.

640
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,651
I guess he heard what happened.

641
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,251
Called and offered.

642
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:57,463
Isn't that nice of him?

643
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:01,290
So the devil's going
to take care of you.

644
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,458
Mm-hmm.

645
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,459
Like in the mornings?
Yeah.

646
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:06,695
During the day.
Lunchtime.

647
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:07,931
Nighttime?

648
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,731
Six to ten,
Monday through Friday.

649
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:11,001
Won't sleep over.

650
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,636
For how long?
We agreed to a month,

651
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:15,805
but we'll renegotiate
after that.

652
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,807
Oh, he's going to take me to my
doctor's appointment next week,

653
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:21,682
so I'll have a better idea
after that what's up.

654
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,987
You know, I didn't have
a problem taking care of you.

655
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,354
I know, but you don't have to.

656
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,489
Okay.

657
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,793
You know what?
You're not going to be...

658
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,861
He's not going to be able to...
I already gave him a key.

659
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:40,307
...make him a key.

660
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:52,307
Like that?
Mm-hmm.

661
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:57,747
Okay.

662
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,716
Is there anything else?

663
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,218
Can I have a Sprite?

664
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,695
Sure.

665
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,832
In a sippy cup with some ice
would have been nice.

666
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,038
Okay.

667
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,347
Thanks.

668
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:34,951
So, is that it, or...?

669
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:38,488
We agreed that you'd talk to me
for 10 minutes.

670
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,088
Oh.

671
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:41,394
Right.

672
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,368
You could ask me
about my pain level.

673
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,970
Okay. How is your pain level?

674
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,739
Like a 6.

675
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,110
Mm-hmm. Is that in your arm
or you leg?

676
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,278
Both.

677
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,721
Uh-huh.

678
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,425
Did you take a pain medication?

679
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,126
I can't. Not for an hour.

680
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:19,694
Oh, wow.
Someone's disciplined.

681
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,998
Or someone's got a crazy
drunk mother.

682
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,533
Right.

683
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,934
And how is Patty?

684
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:27,737
Oh, useless.

685
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,939
She lives in San Francisco
with some guy.

686
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,414
Well, at least she's someone
else's problem now.

687
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:36,345
Right.

688
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,448
God forbid someone's a burden
on someone.

689
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,781
Yuck.

690
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,049
Nope, that's not
what I meant at all.

691
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,951
No, it's okay.

692
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:47,692
You know, I think I'm pretty
good here, so it's okay.

693
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,492
Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

694
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:52,265
Thanks.

695
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:01,435
Oh, my God. Aah!
How does this feel?

696
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:02,904
It doesn't feel good.

697
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:06,075
Yeah, no, dummy.
Your ex-boyfriend.

698
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:07,477
Forcing him to take care of you.

699
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,312
Oh, that.

700
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,646
That feels pretty good.

701
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,449
What?
Nothing.

702
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,352
What?
It's just...

703
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:17,511
What?
When he was sick,

704
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,721
why did you take care of him?

705
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,624
Because he was my boyfriend,

706
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,362
and... And I...
Because I loved him.

707
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:28,598
Okay, so I know we don't
love each other anymore.

708
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,332
I know that.

709
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,602
But still...

710
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,504
Look, it's the...

711
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,608
It is the right thing to do.

712
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,775
Whatever.

713
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:54,223
I...

714
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:58,093
picked up the, uh,
pills and, uh...

715
00:34:58,094 --> 00:34:59,495
and the prunes.

716
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:00,567
Thank you.

717
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,201
Dinner?

718
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,502
Yeah.

719
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:10,473
Um, I'll have an apple.

720
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:11,908
An apple?

721
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,875
Orange is too complicated.

722
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:17,180
I don't want to get fat,
so I'm not eating.

723
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,389
Okay.

724
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:27,924
Uh, listen,

725
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,424
I have a bunch of interviews
I have to do in a half-hour

726
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:30,827
because of everything
that's going on, so...

727
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:32,595
Yeah, that's cool.
Do what you got to do, man.

728
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,663
Okay. Thank you.
When it's time, I'll just...

729
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:35,664
Yeah.

730
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,938
So...

731
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:44,439
how was, um...
How was last night?

732
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,674
Last night?

733
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,642
Yeah.

734
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:49,145
Dinner with Paul.

735
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,946
Were you guys all celebrating?

736
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:54,683
Like cigars, and cognac,
and girls all around and stuff?

737
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,118
What?

738
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,590
Hmm?

739
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,959
You said that you were at
Soho House with the partners.

740
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,129
There's so many
Eurotrash sluts there.

741
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,666
Listen, um...

742
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,100
Hmm.

743
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:14,971
I didn't tell you the truth.

744
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,540
What? Oh, my God.
My heart is racing. What?

745
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,475
You...

746
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,345
I didn't know how you'd react,
but I realize now it's stupid.

747
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,379
It is not a big deal.

748
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,348
You will see
that it is not a big deal.

749
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,349
What?
Um...

750
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:28,350
you know Frannie.

751
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,351
Yeah.
Yeah.

752
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:31,587
Uh, I didn't tell you the truth.

753
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:34,390
She didn't want money.

754
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:35,725
What... What did she want?

755
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,194
She wants me
to take care of her.

756
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,062
What?

757
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,230
So that's what I did last night.

758
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:43,831
I went over there
and I kept her company.

759
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,739
I don't even know what...

760
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,971
Okay, you lied to me.

761
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,308
So that's devastating.

762
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,812
Let's start with that.
That you're a guy that lies.

763
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,613
No, I couldn't lie. That's why
I'm telling you the truth now.

764
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,814
No, Devon, you could, because
you did and I believed you.

765
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:03,285
So, um, just are you
a serial killer as well?

766
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,154
Because I clearly
would have no idea.

767
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,156
You said you were
getting jealous. I...

768
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,597
Oh, you're going to blame me?
No, no.

769
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,225
Is that...?
And then you tell me...

770
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:12,962
No, no. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have lied.

771
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:14,196
...you're taking care of her?

772
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:15,897
I don't...
Um, for how long?

773
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:17,600
Maybe a month.
Maybe more.

774
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:18,901
A month.

775
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,803
So you will be spending
every moment

776
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:23,638
of your free time with her?

777
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,841
It may be more than a month.

778
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:29,578
She does realize you're not
her boyfriend anymore, right?

779
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,080
Yes.
Huh.

780
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,117
She sounds crazy.
Listen, I don't want to go into

781
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,852
how much she helped me.
I'm sorry, who does this?

782
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,220
Who asks their old boyfriend...
She was there for me...

783
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,386
...to disrupt his...
She sounds crazy.

784
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:41,387
I'm sorry, is she crazy?
No, she's a little needy.

785
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,509
Not crazy.
I hated that it was her

786
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,721
that got you through the cancer.
I hate it.

787
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,665
Come on. This is weird.
I know.

788
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,666
This is really weird.
I know.

789
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,867
I'm freaking out.
No, no, no, no.

790
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,939
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

791
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,343
Wait, does this mean
you won't be able

792
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,681
to see<i> Book of Mormon</i>
on Tuesday?

793
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,552
Oh, goddamn it!

794
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,499
I'm amazing.

795
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,436
I'm amazing, and chicks dig me.

796
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:31,607
You're healing so nicely,
it's bananas.

797
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:34,779
I told you.

798
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:37,212
How's the pain?

799
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:38,714
It's bad.

800
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,316
I warned you, right?

801
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,884
I know you did.

802
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,220
When do you think she'll be able
to, you know, walk again?

803
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,721
That's hard to say.

804
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:48,591
Hard to say?

805
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,725
Got a ballpark?

806
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:50,827
Everyone's different.

807
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,261
Right. That's why I said
a ballpark.

808
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,062
Devon.

809
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:56,131
I think you can rush it

810
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:58,234
and have a setback,

811
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,136
erase the brilliant work
I've done here.

812
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,238
Or you can go one day at a time,
which I believe is the healthier

813
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,239
course of action
and then you're going along

814
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,142
as if nothing has happened,
and suddenly, boom,

815
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,810
the brace is gone
and you're done.

816
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,546
Right. And when approximately
do you think that might be?

817
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,381
Devon, obviously Dr. Leonard

818
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:14,884
doesn't feel
comfortable making...

819
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,352
Well, I'll...
I'll tell you.

820
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,886
Here's what I'm comfortable
saying to you.

821
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:19,654
Anywhere between six weeks
and 27 years.

822
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:21,561
Does that work for you?

823
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,163
Listen, I know this can be tough
on a relationship.

824
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,165
Oh, no, no, no.
We're... We're not...

825
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,272
Yes, this can be tough
on a relationship.

826
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,174
Well, I should probably go now.

827
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,642
We're done.
You're doing great.

828
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,643
Really great.

829
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,379
Thank you,
Dr. Leonard.

830
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
You're a peach.

831
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,457
<i>You're like my personal
hero right now.</i>

832
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,158
<i>Do you realize that? You're the
hero of women everywhere.</i>

833
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,859
<i>I wish I could take
a picture of your face</i>

834
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,595
<i>and put it on a T-shirt
and wear it around everywhere.</i>

835
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:01,897
<i>You're like a superhero.
I mean,</i>

836
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,866
<i>if I could get lying,
cheating dickweeds to help me.</i>

837
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,867
Well, I wouldn't...
<i>If I could make them come here</i>

838
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:08,521
<i>and cook me dinner every night.</i>

839
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,272
<i>Make me breakfast every morning.</i>

840
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:13,273
<i>Crawl on his hands and knees...</i>
Hey, I got to go. Bye.

841
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,386
Hello.

842
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:26,821
Hi.

843
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:28,357
What do you need?
The bathroom?

844
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:29,692
Uh, no.

845
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,660
Carrots and celery?

846
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,304
Sure. Thanks.

847
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:44,576
Hey, you know what?
Um...

848
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:47,743
Forget it.

849
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:48,744
Excuse me?

850
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:50,315
Just, I...

851
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,917
Yeah, you... You don't...

852
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,919
You don't have to, um...

853
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,922
You don't have to take care
of me anymore, okay?

854
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:02,857
Really?

855
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,859
Yeah.

856
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,965
I get it.

857
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:13,368
So I... understand.

858
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:16,272
It's... It's... It's...
It's not appropriate.

859
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,175
Yeah. I knew you'd see
this is crazy.

860
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,579
It was, I mean, I... I...

861
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,482
guess I was crazy

862
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:30,486
to think that you would be able
to be gracious about this.

863
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,120
Okay.

864
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,556
Two years, lost my job
to help keep you alive.

865
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:38,160
You're in my apartment
for two days making phone calls.

866
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:39,681
Whatever.
Really? We're gonna go there?

867
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:42,665
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

868
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,832
Losing that job was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

869
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:47,970
My getting sick was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

870
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,437
What?

871
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,807
Yeah. You were working
as a paralegal. You hated it.

872
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,308
You didn't know
what the hell else

873
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,743
you were going
to do with your life.

874
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:57,513
I believe it was, um,
"I want to open a gym."

875
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,381
Then it was, "I want to write
about spas."

876
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:01,317
And then it was,
"I want to go to law school."

877
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,318
When I got sick...
You're incredible.

878
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:05,654
...it's like this entirely
different woman emerged.

879
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,924
You became organized.
You became focussed.

880
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:11,827
You finally had something
important and worthwhile to do.

881
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:13,596
So I should be thanking you

882
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,492
for giving me
the profound experience

883
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,299
of taking care of you.

884
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,634
Huh!

885
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,404
Okay. Okay.

886
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:24,305
Yeah, I'm curious.

887
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:26,475
How long did it take you
to spin that one, Devon?

888
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:28,476
You know it's true.
Are you kidding me?

889
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:32,948
The thrush, and the infection
in the porch, and the blockage,

890
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,616
and... And...
And that doctor

891
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:37,653
who wouldn't write the script
for two weeks.

892
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:40,756
And... And your fucking
stinky old uncle

893
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:43,192
and his patchouli,
and his fucking crystals,

894
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,892
and me telling him off,

895
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:46,629
and that emergency surgery,

896
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,098
and every day
there was something else.

897
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,265
And then you left.

898
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,768
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Do you know how sick I am

899
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:57,538
of hearing how I'm like Satan
because I did that to you?

900
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,642
Even my friends
are telling me that.

901
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,743
Yes, yes.

902
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:03,814
Yes, you were there for me
every single day.

903
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,314
Every single night
you helped me.

904
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,681
You never complained.

905
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:09,484
And when I would try
to thank you for it,

906
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,220
you would say, "If the situation
was reversed,

907
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,721
you would do the same thing
for me."

908
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,489
And deep down I didn't know
if that was true,

909
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,227
because I didn't know
if I was that good of a person.

910
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,702
Fuck!

911
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:46,625
Please let me help.

912
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,666
Shit.

913
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,936
Okay.

914
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:01,976
Okay.

915
00:44:06,496 --> 00:44:08,812
This whole not-eating thing
is fucking crazy.

916
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:10,546
I'm going to make you dinner.

917
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,021
You don't have to.
I'm going to make you dinner.

918
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,356
Hi.

919
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:55,857
How was your night?

920
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:58,201
Good. Boring.

921
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,075
Seriously, how can you
still watch this?

922
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:15,243
Haven't you seen every episode
like 50 times?

923
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:16,745
Yeah.

924
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:19,080
But now I can see the murder
in the first minute

925
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,649
and remember who did it.

926
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,986
So, like, a guy just got thrown
out of a moving car shot.

927
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:26,159
Let me think.

928
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,826
He is a shock jock.

929
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,426
Everybody hates him.

930
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:34,032
Lots of suspects.

931
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:37,300
Joe Piscopo did it.

932
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,502
Wow, I am so sad for you.

933
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,236
It calms me somehow.

934
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,574
Oh.

935
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:47,810
Hey, are you still good
at recognizing the voices?

936
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,977
Yes.

937
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,145
Go.

938
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:51,312
Lili Taylor.

939
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,313
No, it's...

940
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,716
Oh, my God.
It is.

941
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:57,051
Mm-hmm.

942
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:59,063
Yup. I still got it.

943
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:09,905
Oh.

944
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:18,943
Whoa. Wow.

945
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:35,489
Hi.
Hi.

946
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,535
Ugh.

947
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:49,536
I know. Sorry I'm late.

948
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,750
Chicken pad thai?

949
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,750
So...

950
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,520
what was it like...
Mm-hmm?

951
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:11,660
...when you heard Yahoo
wanted to buy your software?

952
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:12,694
Mmm.

953
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,229
Well, I had just
come out of Barneys.

954
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,230
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

955
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:17,265
Okay.

956
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:18,634
Jodi and I were arguing

957
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,268
about the suit
that she wanted me to buy.

958
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:21,502
I thought it was too expensive.

959
00:47:21,503 --> 00:47:24,473
Well, hello? Barneys.
Yeah, I know.

960
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,808
Um, and then Jodi offered
to buy it for me,

961
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,576
because she's the one
with the...

962
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:30,245
Well, ahem, she has money.

963
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:31,946
And I was like, "No way.

964
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:33,515
Like, let's just go across
the street to Men's Wearhouse."

965
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:34,883
And she was like,
"Really? Men's Wearhouse?"

966
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,053
We were fighting
a little bit about it.

967
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:43,191
And when my phone rang,
it was my partner Lance.

968
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:45,993
And he told me

969
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,889
that Yahoo wanted
to make the deal...

970
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:50,802
for $6 million.

971
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:54,605
Holy shit.

972
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:57,171
Please tell me
that you walked back in

973
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:58,339
and you bought that suit.

974
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,340
Yeah, I did.
Ugh!

975
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:02,778
Did you call your mom?

976
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,513
Yes.

977
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,415
Did she start crying
hysterically?

978
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,049
Yeah.

979
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,084
And did she talk about the
cancer and how far you've come

980
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:13,555
since then, how maybe it was all
meant to be?

981
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:15,056
Wow, you're good.

982
00:48:15,057 --> 00:48:16,959
Oh, well,

983
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,962
Teri and I were
in the trenches together.

984
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,629
Yeah.

985
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,567
Do Teri and Jodi...

986
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:28,569
get along?

987
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,344
They don't really
know each other.

988
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,344
Really.
Yeah.

989
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,711
Why?
I don't know.

990
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:39,281
I just, you know,

991
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:40,781
like to keep my mom separate
from things these days

992
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:42,951
because she gets,
you know, so emotional.

993
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:44,893
Yeah.

994
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:54,261
Listen, people take breaks
in between sets.

995
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:55,696
I've seen<i> Pumping Iron.</i>

996
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:57,265
Oh, you've seen<i> Pumping Iron.</i>
Yes.

997
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,368
Well, then you know in order
to keep a great physique,

998
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,835
you need to keep on going, Fran.

999
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:02,437
You need to continue
to push it. Let's go.

1000
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,573
Come on, keep working, Frannie.
I'm so proud of you.

1001
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,308
I believe in you.
Do it!

1002
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:08,109
Do it, or you're going
to be a quitter like...

1003
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,611
What the fuck?

1004
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:13,681
I hate his face.

1005
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:15,683
All right, um, yeah.

1006
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:17,618
Let's shake it out,
shake it out.

1007
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:20,619
Kiwis, broccoli...
Dude, this is my camp shirt.

1008
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:22,725
...strawberries.
Why do you have my camp shirt?

1009
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:24,593
Brussels sprouts.
Excuse me, miss.

1010
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,594
I've been looking for this.
Red bell peppers.

1011
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:29,163
This was, like, the most
important summer of my life.

1012
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:30,164
What?
This is like,

1013
00:49:30,364 --> 00:49:31,732
I fell in love for the first
time this summer...

1014
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:33,701
What? I can't hear you.

1015
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:35,136
Undoubtedly.
I'm keeping this.

1016
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:36,303
What?

1017
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:37,571
Okay, here we go.

1018
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:39,073
Mother and daughter.

1019
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:40,077
Hit and run.

1020
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:43,111
Oh!

1021
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:45,580
Cash in the car
real estate fraud.

1022
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:47,948
January Jones.

1023
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:49,683
Only one way to find out
if you're right.

1024
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:50,951
Want to make a bet?

1025
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:52,988
Totally, I'd do it.
How much you want?

1026
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,989
Six million dollars.

1027
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,530
Hi.
Hi.

1028
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,933
How was your night?

1029
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:09,303
Good.

1030
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:13,741
Oh, um, I want to meet her.

1031
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,243
Who?

1032
00:50:16,244 --> 00:50:18,346
Really? Meet?

1033
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:19,747
Yeah.

1034
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:22,351
Yeah. I think it makes sense,
doesn't it?

1035
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:24,919
For us to meet.

1036
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,656
Someone who you're spending
so much time with.

1037
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,758
Yeah, that totally makes sense.

1038
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,162
Um, she's in a pretty
vulnerable place right now.

1039
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:36,330
It might be kind of weird.
You know, you standing around,

1040
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:37,800
staring at her in her bed.

1041
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:40,936
It's kind of weird.

1042
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:43,872
Well, I wouldn't
be staring at her.

1043
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:47,341
Um, but it's okay for it
to be weird for me,

1044
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:48,342
but not for her?
No.

1045
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,580
You're all protective
of her weirdness, but not me.

1046
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,581
No. No, no, no.

1047
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,417
You're right.
You guys should totally meet.

1048
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:58,521
It will be good. It'll be good.
Okay. Good.

1049
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,721
Good.
Yeah. Good.

1050
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,591
It'll be fine.
Yeah.

1051
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,225
Don't get nervous.

1052
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:06,727
Why? Why? Why do I have
to meet her?

1053
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,728
I know it's weird, but...
What? Why?

1054
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:10,698
I thought you said she was fine.

1055
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,699
She is, she is.
I mean, what do you mean?

1056
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:14,269
She just wants to...
Like what? Check me out?

1057
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,469
Come on. You have to admit...
Couldn't you just take a photo?

1058
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,418
This situation is kind of weird.
Fine!

1059
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:23,378
Fine.

1060
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,251
When do I have to meet her?

1061
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:32,587
I'm so sorry.

1062
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:34,855
Are you kidding me?
No, no, no, no.

1063
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:36,457
No, it's not funny.
Stop laughing.

1064
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,993
I thought it would be best
just to rip the Band-Aid off.

1065
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:42,296
You know that I am
completely defenceless.

1066
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:43,698
And I look like shit.

1067
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:44,699
What?
Nothing!

1068
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,935
I cannot be... Hey, Devon!

1069
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:48,463
This is not part of the deal.

1070
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,671
We never talked about this.

1071
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:52,473
Okay, the deal...
The deal is fucking crazy.

1072
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:53,810
We're going to make the deal
whatever we want to make it.

1073
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,944
I hate you.
I just want you to know that.

1074
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,945
Shh!
Shut your mouth.

1075
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:01,415
Oh, God... Ow!

1076
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,817
Mother...

1077
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:04,653
Ow. Fucking...

1078
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,291
So stupid.

1079
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,591
Hi.

1080
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:11,859
Okay, it's just
straight back here.

1081
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,262
Okay.

1082
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:15,596
Yeah, yeah.

1083
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:17,198
Hey!

1084
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:19,600
Jodi, this is Frannie.
Frannie, this is Jodi.

1085
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:22,571
This is a great opportunity
for you guys to meet each other.

1086
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,389
I've heard so much.
Yeah, and hey,

1087
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,107
I'm so sorry
that this happened to you.

1088
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,377
Thank you.
It's so horrible.

1089
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,743
I thank you.

1090
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:31,312
I brought cupcakes
and ice cream.

1091
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:32,419
Why did I do this?
Oh!

1092
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:35,317
Um, junk food always
cheers me up.

1093
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,053
That's really nice of you.
Thank you.

1094
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,687
Put it in the kitchen.
I'll put them in the kitchen.

1095
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:41,688
Okay. Wow. Look at him.
Okay.

1096
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:43,826
Mr. Host.

1097
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:47,596
I'm sorry. Please, sit.

1098
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,132
Okay. Sure.

1099
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:52,734
So...

1100
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:54,735
Hi.
Hi.

1101
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,971
I know this might
be a little weird.

1102
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,906
No. My God,
are you kidding?

1103
00:52:58,907 --> 00:53:00,841
It totally makes sense.

1104
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:02,243
Good.
Yeah.

1105
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:04,212
I mean, if my boyfriend
was suddenly like,

1106
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,779
"Hey, by the way,
I'm going to..."

1107
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,749
Right? Oh, I'm so glad
you understand.

1108
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,618
Yeah, I totally get it.

1109
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,724
Really.

1110
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,926
So Devon didn't tell me, um,
what do you do for a living?

1111
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:20,528
Or did do...?

1112
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:21,962
I-I do... what I do do,

1113
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:25,466
um, is I'm a special events
coordinator.

1114
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:27,467
Really?
Yeah, at this PR firm.

1115
00:53:27,468 --> 00:53:29,037
Oh, wow.
So, yeah.

1116
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:30,939
They've been really great
about holding my job for me.

1117
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,707
Oh, good. Oh, wow.
Yeah.

1118
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:35,442
Um, PR sounds great.

1119
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:38,379
Yeah. You know, it...
It is pretty great.

1120
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,147
I've been doing it
for the past couple years,

1121
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:42,889
so it still feels kind of new.

1122
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:50,558
What kind of events do you do?

1123
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,629
Um, fashion shows and benefits
and big corporate meetings.

1124
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,630
Oh, wow.
Yeah, stuff like that.

1125
00:53:56,831 --> 00:54:00,103
Ooh! That's really
impressive. Um...

1126
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:06,375
So, what do you guys
do all night?

1127
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:09,310
Um, well,

1128
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:11,913
just... we watch TV.

1129
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,149
Yeah.
Really?

1130
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,783
Yeah.

1131
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:17,451
Okay. He doesn't...

1132
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:20,388
Well, okay, he doesn't make you
watch the History Channel

1133
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,723
night and day?

1134
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:23,390
Or sports?

1135
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:26,728
Gosh. I think he knows
I'm in enough pain already.

1136
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,297
Here, take some more pills.

1137
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:31,867
Kill myself.

1138
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:37,906
Um, so...

1139
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,741
Should we watch TV?

1140
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:42,042
Yes.
Yes.

1141
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,479
Do you want... Are you sure?
Yeah.

1142
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,679
I mean, I love it. I love TV.
Totally.

1143
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:49,533
Obsessive.
Wow. Ooh.

1144
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:51,319
You know your way around her TV.

1145
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,742
It's a remote. Yeah.
Just like we have at home.

1146
00:54:56,257 --> 00:54:58,792
Uh-oh. Careful, Dev.
It's<i> Law & Order.</i>

1147
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:00,395
You better...

1148
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:01,428
What?

1149
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:02,796
Devon never lets me watch this.

1150
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:03,965
Hates it.

1151
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,167
Hates it.
Really?

1152
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,168
Yeah. Yes.
He does?

1153
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:10,939
Look at you watching it.
I'm very proud.

1154
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,073
Oh, well.

1155
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:15,076
He says just the sound
of their voices

1156
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,879
makes his brain cells
start to die.

1157
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,147
Is that what...
Really?

1158
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:21,717
Mm-hmm.

1159
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:33,498
Oh, sorry. One sec.

1160
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,631
Ugh.

1161
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:38,250
Billy Crudup.

1162
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,118
You know, I'm going to go.

1163
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,119
Really?
Yeah.

1164
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:00,888
Oh, my God.
I know, this is so boring.

1165
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:03,258
No, no, no, no.
I'm so sorry.

1166
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,226
Please, this is my... No.
It's okay.

1167
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:06,928
Yeah, honey, whatever you want.

1168
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,929
Whatever you want.
All right.

1169
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,165
Are you...
Well, it was really...

1170
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,167
It was so nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.

1171
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:15,904
And so nice to meet you.

1172
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,808
Listen, I hope that you
get better really soon.

1173
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,477
Oh!

1174
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:25,747
Oh. I mean, that...
That sounded weird.

1175
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,848
I know what you were thinking.
Stop it. It's fine.

1176
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:29,216
Okay.

1177
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:31,619
Sorry I can't walk you out.

1178
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:35,290
Okay.

1179
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,624
Thanks a lot.

1180
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,526
Okay, thank you.
Bye. It was nice to meet you.

1181
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:40,427
Bye, Frannie.
Ever want to watch<i> Law & Order,</i>

1182
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,962
you know where I am.

1183
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:44,963
Bye!
Bye.

1184
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:49,604
Hey...

1185
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:51,105
That was good, right?

1186
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:52,212
: You did great.
Okay.

1187
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:53,474
Great.
All right.

1188
00:56:55,677 --> 00:56:57,581
Bye.

1189
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:16,699
She's really pretty.

1190
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:19,545
Mm-hmm.

1191
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:32,884
She is nice.

1192
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,084
Good. I'm glad you think so.

1193
00:57:37,085 --> 00:57:39,287
Yeah, that was good to meet her.

1194
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,157
I'm happy you suggested it.

1195
00:57:43,157 --> 00:57:45,359
In sickness and in health.

1196
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,560
Hmm?

1197
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:48,696
You never really think about it,

1198
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:52,500
but I got to see you...
What you would be like.

1199
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,871
It's nice.

1200
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,404
I love you so much.

1201
00:57:57,405 --> 00:57:59,414
I love you too.

1202
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:15,522
But don't you agree that that's
what is happening?

1203
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:17,258
Like, everybody's gluten-free.
What happened?

1204
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:18,759
All of a sudden
there's like some thing

1205
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,529
where all the wheat
in the world has gone bad?

1206
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,215
I'm going to test your reflexes.

1207
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:29,509
You have nothing.
You're dead.

1208
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:36,877
Good. That's really good.
That's progress.

1209
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:38,712
Right? That's good.

1210
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,480
But, um, you...

1211
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:43,350
You don't have a...
A time frame.

1212
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,053
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

1213
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,689
Oh, no, no. I don't have that.

1214
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,457
Day by day.

1215
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:51,058
That's all I can tell you.

1216
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:53,660
That's all you should
concentrate on.

1217
00:58:53,661 --> 00:58:56,661
Right?
I'll race you down the block.

1218
00:58:57,532 --> 00:58:58,700
Dr. Leonard!

1219
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,134
What?

1220
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:03,437
The comedy is free.
I only charge for this.

1221
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:05,707
Okay, well, you guys take
no-fault insurance, right?

1222
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,241
So...

1223
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:08,810
Wait, wait, wait.

1224
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:12,113
When she bought this from you
you took no-fault insurance,

1225
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:15,917
and now, weeks later you just...
What, you just don't anymore?

1226
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:17,718
Okay. Yeah.
Uh, you know what?

1227
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,721
Do you have any idea
if there's anybody near you

1228
00:59:20,722 --> 00:59:23,857
who sells a model like this that
does take no-fault insurance

1229
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:25,660
that I might be able to call...?

1230
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:28,229
Hello? Did you hang up?
Mother...

1231
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,596
Hey, Devon?

1232
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,967
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

1233
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,003
It'll relax you.

1234
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,738
Pull.

1235
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,904
Oh!

1236
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:40,274
Oh, crap. You win.

1237
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:42,275
Okay, let's do it again.
Pull.

1238
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:46,046
Just lower.

1239
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,582
That was lower.

1240
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,884
Oh!

1241
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,486
How many fingers
am I holding up?

1242
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,287
Here, you want to do it?
Come on.

1243
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:54,821
Yeah, I mean,
I think I could do it.

1244
00:59:54,822 --> 00:59:56,624
I'm going to get it...
I really...

1245
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,125
Don't... Isn't this fun?

1246
00:59:58,126 --> 00:59:59,179
Okay, ready?
Come on.

1247
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:02,129
Aah!
So close.

1248
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,332
Okay, do it again.
Yeah.

1249
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:05,866
My God, you know what
I would do? I would...

1250
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:09,706
What?

1251
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:12,874
Oh, my God.
That was so awesome.

1252
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,075
So good.
Pull.

1253
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:16,076
Oh, shit.

1254
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:18,046
I need my hair washed.

1255
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,180
I'll do it.

1256
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:20,181
What?
Yeah, why not?

1257
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,917
Wait, wait, wait.
Really? For real?

1258
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:24,285
Yeah.

1259
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,187
You can't wear
those glasses though.

1260
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,927
You... It's not...
That's...

1261
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:34,162
Can we... Oh, God! Jesus!

1262
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,462
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1263
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:39,067
Okay. Can I...
Can I just have a...

1264
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,068
Yeah.
Thank you.

1265
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:42,870
Are you looking at my boobs?

1266
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,171
No.
Yes, you are!

1267
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,107
Jesus Christ!
No.

1268
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:48,142
Such a perv.

1269
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:49,776
Okay, will you just...

1270
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:51,678
Okay, here's what
I'm requesting.

1271
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,982
Will you just, like,
scrub a little?

1272
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:56,983
Yeah.
And massage, if you will.

1273
01:00:56,984 --> 01:00:58,252
Yeah.

1274
01:00:58,253 --> 01:00:59,953
Can you scrub a little harder?

1275
01:00:59,954 --> 01:01:01,321
Harder? Okay.
Yeah.

1276
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:03,128
Like I'm at the salon.

1277
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:09,534
This is so dumb.

1278
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:15,061
Holy shit.
That feels so good.

1279
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:17,706
Good.

1280
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,300
Hi.

1281
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,300
Hi.

1282
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:25,277
What?

1283
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,143
I need to talk to you.

1284
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:32,454
Oh, my God. What?

1285
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:42,458
I hated being sick.

1286
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,692
Well, yeah. Duh.

1287
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:46,693
No.

1288
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,599
No.

1289
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,067
There was no life lesson,

1290
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:55,102
and I didn't become
like this wise person

1291
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:56,636
who cherishes life.

1292
01:02:56,637 --> 01:02:59,306
It was just this hell
that I had to live through.

1293
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:01,481
And I hated it.

1294
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:09,619
It's kind of why I hate my mom.

1295
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:13,824
Because it's still with her.

1296
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:18,094
But...

1297
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:24,549
...I want her
to know you better.

1298
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:27,869
That would be great.

1299
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,111
We can Skype her this weekend.

1300
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:39,916
Okay. Okay.

1301
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:49,657
Hey, hurry!

1302
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:51,325
Come on, it's on!

1303
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:52,859
No, I'm cleaning up.

1304
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,562
You said you wanted to watch it.

1305
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:56,563
It seems stupid.
You seem stupid.

1306
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:58,534
I...

1307
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:19,352
I got to go.

1308
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:21,221
What?

1309
01:04:21,222 --> 01:04:22,222
Um...

1310
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,991
if it's okay.

1311
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:26,130
What do you mean?

1312
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,497
It's been, uh...
I'm pretty tired.

1313
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:31,498
Oh.
I mean, if it's okay.

1314
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:33,666
It's been a long week.
Sure.

1315
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:36,736
You're all set for the weekend?

1316
01:04:36,737 --> 01:04:38,784
Yeah.

1317
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,756
No, Mom.

1318
01:04:56,757 --> 01:04:58,592
Tilt... Tilt the camera down.

1319
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:01,779
We can't really see you.
She's okay.

1320
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,563
Okay.
If you turn on a light...

1321
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:08,269
Ready? This is a little
present for you. Look at this.

1322
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:55,049
Aah!

1323
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,452
Yes. Yes!

1324
01:06:34,722 --> 01:06:36,390
Hello?

1325
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:41,127
Hey.

1326
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:42,596
How was the weekend?

1327
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:44,098
It was great.

1328
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,170
You know, I got to see
some friends, and...

1329
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,337
How was yours?

1330
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:52,305
It was good. Yeah.

1331
01:06:52,306 --> 01:06:53,409
It was, um...

1332
01:06:55,409 --> 01:06:57,278
It felt long.

1333
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,485
Yeah, it was long.

1334
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:06,319
And how have you been feeling?

1335
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,520
Um, I...

1336
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:08,627
I mean, my... It's...

1337
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:11,225
It's been acting up
a little bit,

1338
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,493
but it's... It's not...

1339
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:13,828
It's not terr...
It's not bad.

1340
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:15,864
Okay.

1341
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:18,799
You hungry?
Can I make you some eggs?

1342
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,011
No, I'm...
I'm going to make you some eggs.

1343
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,942
I want to tell you
something right now.

1344
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,943
Please tell me, what do you got?
Since you've driven in here...

1345
01:07:29,944 --> 01:07:31,078
Yes. Yes.

1346
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:32,212
Yes.

1347
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:34,080
I'm going to start
calling you Estelle.

1348
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:35,716
Estelle!

1349
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:37,717
Estelle Getty?
Listen, it's not...

1350
01:07:37,718 --> 01:07:39,953
It's not my fault that...

1351
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:41,821
Where the fuck
did this come from?

1352
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,256
Fallon.
Fallon.

1353
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:44,725
That was good point.
By the way, I want to thank you,

1354
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:47,328
because that wheelchair
that she first got me

1355
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,562
was a hot mess.

1356
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,464
I was like... I ran over
my own toe.

1357
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:51,571
I'm just...
I'm so bad

1358
01:07:51,771 --> 01:07:53,334
I just don't even
have to look anymore.

1359
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,767
I'm just turning.

1360
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:56,270
I'm just looking at you

1361
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:58,004
and I'm not even looking
at anything else.

1362
01:07:58,005 --> 01:08:00,107
What are you doing?
I'll just cover it back up...

1363
01:08:00,307 --> 01:08:02,042
You refuse to look at it.

1364
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:03,991
I'm not looking,
but I can play piano.

1365
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,921
Shut up!

1366
01:08:14,922 --> 01:08:16,357
Eat.

1367
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,524
It's so pretty.

1368
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:19,193
That's all right.

1369
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,930
Don't eat all the broccoli.
You're going to dinner.

1370
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,430
Oh, my God, that's so good.

1371
01:08:24,431 --> 01:08:25,431
Good, I'm happy.

1372
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:31,671
Yeah.

1373
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:34,672
It's too hard.
It's no good.

1374
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:41,885
You know, um...

1375
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:45,986
you were right.

1376
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:47,693
About what?

1377
01:08:51,693 --> 01:08:56,234
I am a better person
because of you.

1378
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:01,135
I'm never saying that again.

1379
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,005
So lock it up in the old brain.

1380
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:05,738
Doesn't matter.
I heard it once.

1381
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:06,941
Never going to live it down.

1382
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,242
You're never going
to live that down.

1383
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:10,810
Now you just got
to bend the knee.

1384
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:12,587
Slowly.
I'm going to help you.

1385
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:22,188
Oh. Oh, my God.

1386
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:23,624
You're doing it.

1387
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,192
Oh, my God.

1388
01:09:25,193 --> 01:09:27,193
Right?
Oh, my God. I'm going to cry!

1389
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:29,569
That's incredible.

1390
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:35,969
Oh, yeah.

1391
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,670
I just don't understand.
What happened?

1392
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:39,672
I just... Ah.

1393
01:09:39,673 --> 01:09:40,673
I went to the...

1394
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:45,112
The sink for some food.

1395
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:46,448
And I banged it.

1396
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,316
I don't know why
you insist on walking around

1397
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:50,951
when I'm not here.
I've asked you not to.

1398
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:52,685
I was hungry, and I just needed
to get out of the bed.

1399
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:54,688
And I'm just... I'm going crazy.
Okay, okay, all right.

1400
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:57,090
We got to go to the emergency
room and get this checked out.

1401
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:58,459
No, no, no, no.
No, you're in pain.

1402
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:00,227
Oh, my God.
I need to just...

1403
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,429
Just... To just wait
for the...

1404
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,997
The pills to kick in, okay?

1405
01:10:03,998 --> 01:10:05,599
Okay, no, you may have actually
reinjured yourself.

1406
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,835
I would really like for somebody
to take a look at this.

1407
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,435
God, you're like my sister.
Wow.

1408
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:11,404
I'm not going to the emergency room.
Low blow.

1409
01:10:11,405 --> 01:10:13,207
Your sister? Really?
Okay, look, I am sorry.

1410
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,242
I've just...
I've been in this...

1411
01:10:15,243 --> 01:10:18,278
couch... thing... bed

1412
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,281
for six weeks.
I know, I know.

1413
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,049
But please, don't take that
out on me.

1414
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,652
Oh, my God, like you were all
sunshine and lollipops.

1415
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,054
No, I was horrible to you.
I was horrible to you.

1416
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:28,656
I don't know how
you put up with it.

1417
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,992
I want to run screaming
from this building right now.

1418
01:10:31,993 --> 01:10:33,894
You don't even have to worry
that I might die.

1419
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:36,330
No. God know. This is a total
cake walk for me.

1420
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:38,632
And I can't even handle this.

1421
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,520
I was so terrible to you.

1422
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,389
I was so... I was so angry
and I was so scared.

1423
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,692
And I just...

1424
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,160
I didn't doubt for one minute

1425
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,461
that you wouldn't
be there for me.

1426
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:09,862
And I just...

1427
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:11,902
I can't explain.

1428
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:17,341
How do you even begin to thank
someone for doing that for you?

1429
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,386
I'm really sorry.

1430
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:33,324
It wasn't because
I didn't love you.

1431
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:39,430
I just didn't want
anything to remind me.

1432
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,675
And I'm sorry.

1433
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:55,220
Let's take a look at it.

1434
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,319
Oh!

1435
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,889
It's really swollen, isn't it?

1436
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,256
It's swollen.
Hold on.

1437
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:12,208
All right.
Oh, please, no. I can't.

1438
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:13,209
No, no, no. I'm...

1439
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:16,362
Shh. I'm texting.

1440
01:12:16,363 --> 01:12:19,048
I'm going to let her know
that I'm going to be late.

1441
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,568
But are you...?
No.

1442
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:25,707
Hon, you're in pain.
It's the least that I can do.

1443
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,515
Mm-hmm. Yup.
Right there.

1444
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,622
Goddamn it.
This guy, really?

1445
01:12:42,623 --> 01:12:44,258
Yeah.

1446
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,393
Really?!

1447
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,261
He doesn't care.
I've...

1448
01:12:48,262 --> 01:12:49,662
Have you talked to him?

1449
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,063
Well...

1450
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:52,599
Yes.

1451
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,801
You... You hobbled over there
and he hasn't stopped?

1452
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:56,469
I hobbled. I dragged.

1453
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,205
Okay.

1454
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:00,277
Okay, I'm going to go
talk to him.

1455
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:05,045
What do you mean
you're going to go...

1456
01:13:05,046 --> 01:13:07,246
Hey, Devon!

1457
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,149
Devon!

1458
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:23,837
Dev?

1459
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,336
What?
Hey. Hey, man.

1460
01:13:30,337 --> 01:13:31,737
Can you keep it down?
We're trying to sleep.

1461
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:33,809
Who is?

1462
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,577
You know what? If you have
a problem, call the police.

1463
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,111
No, I'm not going
to call the police.

1464
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:39,712
Come on. Just turn down
your music, okay?

1465
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:42,349
What are you doing...
Oh, my God. Is that Zumba?

1466
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,818
No, shut up.
It's the new cross...

1467
01:13:44,018 --> 01:13:45,919
I don't have to ex...
Okay, you know what?

1468
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,854
I don't know who you are, but I
know you don't live next door.

1469
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:50,724
And I know you're not
her boyfriend, so back off.

1470
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:52,559
No, what are you talking about?
Listen, she's in a lot of pain.

1471
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,495
I'm taking care of her.
Turn down your fucking music.

1472
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,263
Like I said, if you have
a problem, call the police.

1473
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:57,630
I'm not going
to call the police.

1474
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:59,099
You're going to turn down
your Zumba.

1475
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,300
Will you step out
of my doorway, please?

1476
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:01,541
No, I'm going to.
Yes, you will!

1477
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,837
You know what...?

1478
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,075
Douche bag!

1479
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,443
You're the douche bag.

1480
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:11,649
Guys!

1481
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:15,816
Devon.

1482
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:16,983
What are you...?

1483
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:18,085
You guys, stop it!

1484
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,286
Stop it, you guys!

1485
01:14:19,287 --> 01:14:20,524
What are you doing?

1486
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:26,993
I don't know.

1487
01:14:26,994 --> 01:14:28,161
What the hell was that?

1488
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:29,496
I don't know.

1489
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:30,630
It was like...

1490
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:33,867
It was like this...
This surge of testosterone.

1491
01:14:33,868 --> 01:14:36,036
It was primal. I...

1492
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:37,437
Oh, my God.

1493
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:39,072
It was insane.

1494
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,439
That's what it was.

1495
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,675
Oh, my God.

1496
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:43,410
It was like this instinct
to protect.

1497
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:44,545
And then, like...

1498
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,313
And then he made it seem
like he knew you,

1499
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:47,815
and not just like
as a neighbour.

1500
01:14:48,015 --> 01:14:49,617
And then I got all like...
What?

1501
01:14:49,817 --> 01:14:53,185
I don't know. Like, jealous.
Did you sleep with that guy?

1502
01:14:53,186 --> 01:14:55,186
No.
Okay, okay.

1503
01:14:55,523 --> 01:14:57,691
All right.
I didn't, you know...

1504
01:14:57,692 --> 01:15:00,394
Oh, my God.

1505
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,194
Jealous.

1506
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:04,163
Yeah, shut up.

1507
01:15:04,164 --> 01:15:06,134
Jelly bag.

1508
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:13,706
Do you hear that?

1509
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:15,944
Yeah.

1510
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:18,911
What is that I hear?

1511
01:15:18,912 --> 01:15:22,916
Nothing.

1512
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:24,353
Wow.

1513
01:15:25,353 --> 01:15:27,187
: Ow!
: Oh, my God.

1514
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:28,554
It's okay. It's...

1515
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:30,323
It's okay.

1516
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:32,962
I didn't. I'm sorry.

1517
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,930
That was amazing.

1518
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,497
Wow.

1519
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:40,099
I just can't... I mean,
I'm like in the mode now.

1520
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,234
I can't stop hitting.
I just have to bash.

1521
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:44,705
And I didn't mean to...
I'm sorry.

1522
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,180
I didn't mean to, like,
kiss and make it better.

1523
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:49,167
Did you kiss it?
I did.

1524
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:50,876
Oh, I didn't...

1525
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:53,246
No, you were in pain. It's okay.
Thank you.

1526
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:55,300
That's why you're not
in pain right now.

1527
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:00,118
Such a spaz.
Yeah.

1528
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:33,655
Sorry.

1529
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:36,056
More, please.

1530
01:16:51,838 --> 01:16:54,838
Ow. No, no, it's okay.
Okay, okay.

1531
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:04,085
It's so annoying.

1532
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:08,119
I only have one hand.
I know. I know.

1533
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:10,756
You're doing great.

1534
01:17:10,757 --> 01:17:11,997
Okay.

1535
01:17:21,935 --> 01:17:23,170
I can't really...

1536
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,603
I think we have to...

1537
01:17:24,604 --> 01:17:26,472
No, that's not good.
It may be caught. Wait.

1538
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:28,075
Just, like...
Does it come down?

1539
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,340
No! That's...
Ow, ow, ow.

1540
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,594
Okay. Shh, shh.
So maybe... It's okay.

1541
01:17:31,595 --> 01:17:33,387
Hold on,
but now my hand's stuck.

1542
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:42,957
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1543
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:46,960
Be really careful.
I will.

1544
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:49,270
It's okay, it's okay.

1545
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:02,974
I'm shy.
I know you are.

1546
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:33,139
Good morning.

1547
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,512
Morning.

1548
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:40,546
Are you okay?
Are you in pain?

1549
01:18:40,547 --> 01:18:43,886
No. Oh, no, no, no.
I'm good.

1550
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:57,997
Good. Um...

1551
01:18:57,998 --> 01:18:59,331
I need to head home.

1552
01:18:59,332 --> 01:19:00,934
I should change clothes
and get ready for work.

1553
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:02,169
Of course, of course.

1554
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,571
Um, can I make you breakfast?

1555
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:05,738
No.

1556
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:07,313
Um...

1557
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:14,313
Um...
You should go home.

1558
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:17,621
Yeah.

1559
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:23,895
Yeah.

1560
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:30,288
Yeah.

1561
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:56,288
So...?

1562
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:04,470
Did you sleep with her?

1563
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:11,939
Jesus Christ.

1564
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:16,276
How is that even possible?

1565
01:20:16,277 --> 01:20:17,544
Oh.

1566
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,578
That's how hot you were for her.

1567
01:20:19,579 --> 01:20:24,050
Only, um, two working limbs,
I think it was.

1568
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:25,518
And she kind of smelled.

1569
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,888
When I was there
she kind of smelled.

1570
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:30,590
That's me... But you had
to have her.

1571
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:32,826
If we could just
stay calm about this.

1572
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,361
No! I get it.

1573
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,729
You... You were sharing.

1574
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,497
She was sharing something.

1575
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:40,666
Some... Some deep
whatever.

1576
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,937
I'm so sorry I'm not sick
and vulnerable,

1577
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:47,273
so you can feel so profoundly
about me too.

1578
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:48,441
Jodi, stop it.

1579
01:20:48,442 --> 01:20:50,042
I can get sick if you want.

1580
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:53,380
Would you like me
to get sick, baby? Hmm?

1581
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,180
Okay. Oh, yeah.

1582
01:20:55,181 --> 01:20:56,181
Oh, okay. One sec.

1583
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,020
Oh!

1584
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,254
I'm just going to get
food poisoning.

1585
01:21:01,255 --> 01:21:02,822
Jodi, come on.

1586
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:03,957
No, no, no. Jodi.

1587
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:06,760
Okay, shh, shh, shh.

1588
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:07,827
Give me.

1589
01:21:07,828 --> 01:21:10,828
Okay.

1590
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,872
Oh...

1591
01:21:17,872 --> 01:21:21,573
I tried to get closer to you,
but you wouldn't let me.

1592
01:21:21,574 --> 01:21:23,317
I know, I know, I know.

1593
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:30,358
Excuse me.

1594
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:42,328
Jodi, no.

1595
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:43,600
Jodi.

1596
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:56,309
Jodi...

1597
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:19,467
Hello?

1598
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,469
Fall?

1599
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:24,103
Hello.

1600
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:25,871
Hi. Yeah.
That's right, it's me.

1601
01:22:25,872 --> 01:22:28,340
Oh, you didn't think
I'd do this, did you?

1602
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:31,176
I could slap your face
right now,

1603
01:22:31,177 --> 01:22:33,984
and you couldn't
do anything about it.

1604
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:39,752
What are you...?
What are you...? Stop it!

1605
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:42,121
What are you...? Cut...
What are you...?

1606
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:43,723
Stop! Where's Devon?

1607
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:45,558
Did you kill him or something?

1608
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:47,093
I was nice to you!

1609
01:22:47,094 --> 01:22:48,361
Stop!

1610
01:22:48,362 --> 01:22:50,233
Oh! I brought you cupcakes.

1611
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,966
Oh!

1612
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:57,303
Devon owes you? Does he owe you?
Don't you owe me something?

1613
01:22:57,304 --> 01:22:59,805
Like, for instance,

1614
01:22:59,806 --> 01:23:03,276
the courtesy not to try and
steal my boyfriend away from me?

1615
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:05,111
Don't you at least owe me that?

1616
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:06,880
Hello? Uh...

1617
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,515
Hey, I'm just checking in.
See if you need anything.

1618
01:23:09,516 --> 01:23:11,317
Hey.
Yeah, it's no big deal.

1619
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:12,618
I am not going to beat her up.

1620
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:15,388
I said what I had to say.

1621
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:17,389
You have done something
bad to me,

1622
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,193
and I will always hate you.

1623
01:23:20,194 --> 01:23:22,062
That's very extreme.

1624
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,328
Um...

1625
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:26,167
I will never think anything
nice about you, ever.

1626
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:29,001
Just know there's a person
in this world

1627
01:23:29,002 --> 01:23:30,969
who thinks you're horrible.

1628
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,971
Okay, it's time to go, yeah?

1629
01:23:32,972 --> 01:23:35,108
Well, I'm sorry, who are you?
Who is this? Who are you?

1630
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:36,975
Someone else
she's sleeping with?

1631
01:23:36,976 --> 01:23:39,946
Jesus Christ. Oh, for a crippled
person, you really get around.

1632
01:23:39,947 --> 01:23:41,581
Okay... Whoa!
Stay!

1633
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:44,319
Hey, hey. Look... All right.
It's time for you to go.

1634
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,587
You just... Okay.
Jodi?

1635
01:23:47,588 --> 01:23:48,787
Just...

1636
01:23:48,788 --> 01:23:50,788
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa! Okay!

1637
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:52,858
Devon! Devon!

1638
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:54,394
Aah!

1639
01:23:54,395 --> 01:23:58,067
You see? This is why I don't...
Because I wasn't even...

1640
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:01,233
Bye now.

1641
01:24:01,234 --> 01:24:02,434
Thank you!

1642
01:24:02,435 --> 01:24:03,538
Whatever!

1643
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,281
Okay.

1644
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:18,282
Okay, let's go.
No. It's fine. It's fine now.

1645
01:24:18,283 --> 01:24:21,725
I just had to say
something to her.

1646
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:26,515
Just, I...
Okay, I'll wait outside.

1647
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:30,365
You guys can talk,
say how crazy I am.

1648
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:33,800
Oh, by the way,

1649
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:35,768
um, it's hard to work
on my jealousy issues

1650
01:24:35,769 --> 01:24:39,380
when you're cheating on me.

1651
01:24:52,118 --> 01:24:55,287
Um... I'm sorry.
I didn't know that she's...

1652
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:56,604
No, no. Hey, she's right.

1653
01:24:57,024 --> 01:24:59,259
Devon, she's right.
This was wrong.

1654
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,296
You're right.

1655
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:03,496
What can I do?

1656
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:06,734
Nothing. We're good.

1657
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:10,271
What does that mean?

1658
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:13,605
We're good.

1659
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:15,613
Really?

1660
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:21,214
Yeah.

1661
01:25:21,215 --> 01:25:23,686
Consider the debt paid in full.

1662
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:28,193
Okay.

1663
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,565
Dev...

1664
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:40,275
You took really good care of me.

1665
01:25:49,275 --> 01:25:51,550
Thanks.

1666
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,121
<i>...Jumped out of the back
of a black Lincoln Town Car.</i>

1667
01:26:03,122 --> 01:26:04,175
<i>A car service?
Maybe.</i>

1668
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,492
<i>But we got no plate number.</i>

1669
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:07,993
<i>Do we at least have a name
on the victim?</i>

1670
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:09,461
<i>You're going to love this:</i>

1671
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:11,096
<i>Crystal.</i>

1672
01:26:11,097 --> 01:26:12,965
<i>Is that the first name
or last name?</i>

1673
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:15,801
So you're not going
to see him again,

1674
01:26:15,802 --> 01:26:17,703
after all that?

1675
01:26:17,704 --> 01:26:19,738
I don't think so.

1676
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,241
And he hasn't called?

1677
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:22,242
No.

1678
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:23,711
And it's been two weeks?
Yes.

1679
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:27,179
And you have no idea
if he's still with her

1680
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,180
or...
No.

1681
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,050
And that doesn't piss you off?

1682
01:26:32,051 --> 01:26:33,220
No.

1683
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,055
No, no, no.

1684
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,758
You guys, you're not going
to get me to be mad at him.

1685
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:40,425
There's nothing to be mad about.

1686
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:41,728
I'm fine.

1687
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,630
But don't you miss him?
I mean...

1688
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,198
Yes, I do.

1689
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:47,300
But it's...

1690
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,102
Can you people shut up?

1691
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:52,407
Clearly she's in
a really good place right now.

1692
01:26:53,168 --> 01:26:55,642
And this is gross.
Can we move into the kitchen?

1693
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:58,077
Like, y'all going to get lint
all up in the asparagus.

1694
01:26:58,078 --> 01:26:59,911
You know what? I'm going to zest
your little head.

1695
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:02,912
This piece is going to go...

1696
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:07,920
Look at you.

1697
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:10,724
You're going to be in
Louboutins in no time, girl.

1698
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,693
No, actually,

1699
01:27:13,694 --> 01:27:15,161
there's this little...

1700
01:27:15,162 --> 01:27:18,297
These little grey boots
with this little heel.

1701
01:27:18,298 --> 01:27:20,434
I miss him so much.

1702
01:27:22,336 --> 01:27:26,272
Sweetie, you're like
a new woman.

1703
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:28,309
I think I am.

1704
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:30,710
Watch this.

1705
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:32,746
Oh, how about that?

1706
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:47,319
Sam Rockwell.

1707
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:13,456
Thank you.

1708
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,456
You're welcome.

1709
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:24,043
Put your leg up.

1710
01:28:37,043 --> 01:28:39,780
So, is that it?

1711
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,383
That's it.

1712
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:44,884
What?

1713
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:47,654
You're walking out of here.

1714
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:50,188
Thank you.
That's so great.

1715
01:28:50,189 --> 01:28:51,525
I knew he was going to save you.
You... And she said it!

1716
01:28:51,725 --> 01:28:54,227
You said it! You said it!
I didn't believe you.

1717
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,362
So great.

1718
01:28:56,363 --> 01:28:57,967
Oh, my God. Ah!

1719
01:29:00,941 --> 01:29:02,468
And thank you.
You're welcome.

1720
01:29:02,469 --> 01:29:03,469
And more.
And more.

1721
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:05,237
And for six months more
you can do that for me...

1722
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:06,774
Six months?
After what I did for you?

1723
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,041
Didn't I scrub
your floors for you?

1724
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:10,309
I didn't make you do that.
Yes.

1725
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,245
What do I have to do?
Um...

1726
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,045
I'm going to have
to scrub your floors?

1727
01:29:14,046 --> 01:29:15,480
I'll see you later.

1728
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:18,192
I thought we were going
to go to...

1729
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:26,661
Hi.

1730
01:29:27,661 --> 01:29:29,362
Hi.

1731
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:31,197
What's up?

1732
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:34,198
Look at you.
I know!

1733
01:29:35,569 --> 01:29:36,640
So excited!

1734
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,374
So...

1735
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,542
how did you...?

1736
01:29:43,543 --> 01:29:44,876
Oh, I called Fallon.

1737
01:29:44,877 --> 01:29:47,580
Yeah. I knew it was
the big day coming up,

1738
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:48,814
so I wanted to...

1739
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:50,049
That was very nice of you.

1740
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,050
Yeah, well...
Thank you.

1741
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:57,579
So, how have you been?
I'm good, I'm good.

1742
01:29:57,858 --> 01:30:00,292
It's been a little hectic.

1743
01:30:00,293 --> 01:30:02,270
I moved.

1744
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:13,341
Would you like to go
to lunch with me?

1745
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:17,542
Yes.

1746
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,946
Good. My treat.

1747
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,147
Come on.

1748
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:23,114
After you.
Oh, thank you.

1749
01:30:23,115 --> 01:30:24,282
Oh, hold on.
Wait, wait.

1750
01:30:24,283 --> 01:30:26,283
Wow! Really?

1751
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:28,538
I saw him!
Hi, how are you?

1752
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:31,172
What, are you saying...?
Are you kidding me?

1753
01:30:31,173 --> 01:30:33,593
You were like this close.
I was not that close.

1754
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:35,394
I'm sorry, it's a joke.
It was a joke. I'm joking.

1755
01:30:35,395 --> 01:30:37,563
I'm joking. I'm joking.

1756
01:30:37,564 --> 01:30:40,832
I look both ways.

1757
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,469
Amazing.
You look amazing.

1758
01:30:43,737 --> 01:30:46,505
I can hear... I know what
you're really thinking.

1759
01:30:46,506 --> 01:30:48,340
You're saying, "Frannie,

1760
