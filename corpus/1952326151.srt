1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,500
Getting to work on a project like this,

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,500
to be a part of a story that's
on the scope that this is on...

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,050
As an actor, it's a dream come true.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,300
I've been making movies
since I was five years old,

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,600
and I've never seen anything like this.

6
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,400
The whole project,

7
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,350
the process from the very beginning
has just imbued all of us, I think,

8
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:45,451
with a sense of respect for what
these guys have gone through.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,050
Get off the beach!

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,550
Keep moving!

11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,700
It became a bigger project
than just making a movie,

12
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,101
and I hope we honor these men
the way they should be honored.

13
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,350
As far as the story of
the second world war goes,

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,900
there's two very
different perspectives.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,650
The European theater which
we've examined before,

16
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,151
with "Band of Brothers,"

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,700
had a different D.N.A. to it
than the war in the Pacific did.

18
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,000
When "Band of Brothers" came out,

19
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,050
many people who
fought in the Pacific said,

20
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,150
"What about us guys?

21
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,651
"We did something too.
We made a major contribution."

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,800
Colonel Puller, where you heading?

23
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,200
Tokyo. Care to join us?

24
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,700
I don't know. It's a ways, sir.

25
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,000
Write us when you get there.

26
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,101
I will.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,300
It was very important for us

28
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,450
to show how this war
affected these men.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,300
During the war, after the war,

30
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:48,100
that really is something that we didn't
get into as much in "Band of Brothers."

31
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,900
But it's really a more personal and
intimate story than "Band of Brothers."

32
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,901
It's much more experiential.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,500
When we began working on "The Pacific,"

34
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,800
We wanted to cover the entire war,

35
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:08,001
but to do it in a way that was
personal and compelling and dramatic.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,900
Stand by the bow ramp.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
Go go go go!

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,900
Our miniseries focuses on three guys:

39
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:21,401
Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie
and John Basilone.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,400
Eugene Sledge wrote arguably the
best memoir of combat anywhere,

41
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:30,900
called "With the Old Breed:
At Peleliu and Okinawa."

42
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,000
He was just a kid
who loved war stories.

43
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,850
And when this war came around,

44
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:41,001
he ended up getting a real taste
of what war is really like.

45
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,700
John Basilone got the
Congressional Medal of Honor

46
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:47,500
and his life and his exploits
were very well documented for us,

47
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,901
and so we could follow them.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
Do you wanna live?

49
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,750
Get off the beach!

50
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,851
Move!

51
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,900
Robert Leckie was a writer
before the war.

52
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,150
He wrote a magnificent piece of prose

53
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,800
called "Helmet For My Pillow,"

54
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:05,951
which was about his experiences
at Guadalcanal and Peleliu.

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,350
It's an honor to
spend time on a character

56
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,950
who was here and who lived it,

57
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,700
and it's an honor to
try to tell this story,

58
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,351
and try to tell this story properly.

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,500
We wanted this to really be based on,

60
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,900
you know, real people
and real situations,

61
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:26,600
because the marines were also fighting
malaria and all kinds of the elements.

62
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:30,301
The natural environment
was just as debilitating.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
One advantage that
we have on "The Pacific"--

64
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,050
we had it on "Band of Brothers"--

65
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,900
is the commitment of the actors.

66
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:40,800
They had a sense that they had a
moral responsibility to get it right.

67
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,600
And part of getting it right is the
research that we prepared for them,

68
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:47,000
but also our military advisors

69
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,951
and the boot camp that they went to.

70
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,200
* We are proud to claim the title *

71
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,601
* of United States Marines. *

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,200
They went through a
brutal period of training.

73
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,200
It was designed to be that way,

74
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,850
just so they would understand what
maybe the people they're portraying,

75
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,900
to some extent, what they endured.

76
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:12,300
Boot camp was probably the
most intense experience of my life.

77
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,250
- One, two, three.
- 9!

78
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,250
- One, two, three.
- 10!

79
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,200
Just stop. Just stop!

80
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,851
What's the matter with you?

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
Captain Dye said it when he goes,

82
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,150
"You're gonna hit walls out there."

83
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,800
We never say the word "movie."

84
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,350
We never say the word "actor."

85
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,701
We use "the mission."

86
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
I just remember saying to myself,

87
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,650
"Am I training for a movie or

88
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:33,500
"am I actually training
'cause we're going to war?"

89
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,501
Fire!

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
I was a college athlete,

91
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,900
and I've been an athlete my whole life,

92
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,350
and I've never had
a stretch of nine days

93
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,901
that was as brutal on my body.

94
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,800
Not too long into it,
you forget about being an actor.

95
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,700
And then you forget who you are.

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,300
And then you just
get into the discipline

97
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,000
of all the different stuff
that you have to do.

98
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,200
They came out of that boot camp
different people.

99
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,551
I was there before they went in--

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,650
You know, Goatees, long hair.

101
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,200
They went in there and
they came out different.

102
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,800
I'm telling you
they came out different.

103
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,350
You feel invincible.

104
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:08,900
You feel like you can
get through anything.

105
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,101
If you can get through that,
you can get through anything.

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,350
Fire!

107
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,700
You can't buy this kind of experience.

108
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,500
You know,
given the nature of this project

109
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,601
and how important
it is to tell the truth...

110
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Oh, sorry.

111
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,600
Vera.

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,250
Bob Leckie.

113
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm your neighbor
from across the street.

114
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,151
I know who you are, Bob.

115
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
The miniseries, "The Pacific,"

116
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,500
starts a few days after
Pearl Harbor in the United States

117
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,801
and spans four years
from from 1941 to 1945.

118
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,000
I joined the marines--

119
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,300
Thought I'd do my bit.

120
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,501
Take care of yourself.

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
We wanted to be able to
incorporate the home front,

122
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:52,001
life at home,
both before and after the war.

123
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Because we had several
characters that allowed us,

124
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,700
we get a chance to see back home.

125
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,650
That had not been possible
with "Band of Brothers,"

126
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,401
because the material didn't address it.

127
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,050
What have we done?

128
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,751
We've gone respectable.

129
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,700
What John Basilone went
through on-- at home--

130
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:12,700
It's a great story.
It's damn good drama.

131
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,900
I've reenlisted.

132
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,200
They can ship me out
whenever they want.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The first battle that
we examine is Guadalcanal.

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,500
Nothing prepares you for
the moment that they say "action,"

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
and the jungle at night lights up.

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,300
The noise is actually thunderous.

137
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,200
And the flashes of light are blinding.

138
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
Here we go. Positions, everyone.

139
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,900
The night battle on Guadalcanal was

140
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:55,400
the night that John Basilone
and just a few hundred marines

141
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,300
were going up against an onslaught
of thousands of Japanese

142
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,651
who are gonna be crossing
into their encampment.

143
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,850
Japs!

144
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,700
Japs! Start falling in!

145
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,700
We do a massive amount of research,

146
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,300
so that we can try
and get at the truth.

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,200
We really went through
every inch of that battle,

148
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,400
and everything that was
written about it or known about it

149
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,500
and tried to make that
as authentic as possible.

150
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,900
And the shooting of it was
rather intense, to say the least.

151
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,101
Action!

152
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,350
And doing fights like this,
you don't wanna do the TV version.

153
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:41,050
You wanna make it--
as every part of this project is--

154
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,401
as authentic as possible.

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,900
J.P., cover me.

156
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,400
John, wait, what are you doing?

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,350
John, what are you doing?

158
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,650
( shouts in Japanese )

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
With all the research
that they had done,

160
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:57,900
they pretty much had it down
to exactly how it happened.

161
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,800
Then to actually be shooting it,
to be in the middle of it,

162
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,851
there are some moments when

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,050
you could almost feel the presence
of these men there with you.

164
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,050
It was pretty, you know,
it was pretty intense.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Peleliu--
The battle that we're filming right here

166
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:38,551
was one of the most brutal and
misunderstood battles of the Pacific War.

167
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Here we go, boys!

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Peleliu is a battle that's so key to
what our vision of "The Pacific" is

169
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:53,601
that it took three episodes
for us in order to tell it.

170
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,400
We're out here today
on the ocean shooting

171
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,200
AMP tracks which would have
troops and guns on them,

172
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,801
coming off to do the
attack on the beach.

173
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,450
Load and lock, gentlemen!

174
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,600
Now the "colossus" that
you're seeing in the background

175
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,300
is actually a working barge.

176
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:29,000
And onto the barge, we've built
the partial back end of an L.S.T.

177
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,600
Because we were able to find this barge
that had the ramp in the back of it,

178
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,000
we can actually have
the AMP tracks driving out,

179
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,300
going into the water--

180
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,800
you get all the natural sounds--

181
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,300
And we're shooting inside them

182
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,100
so you see the troops reacting
the way they really would.

183
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,000
So it's gonna lend a tremendous sense
of reality to what we're doing,

184
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,700
which is really what
we're trying to do here,

185
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,900
is make something that
is real and accurate to

186
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:51,201
what the true war in
the Pacific was as we can.

187
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,600
Go go go. Move out!

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,350
This is our Peleliu beach set,

189
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:14,300
which is up in Far North Queensland
at a location called Rocky Point.

190
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,600
This end of our Peleliu
beach landing is

191
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,950
where Leckie comes ashore
in his AMP track.

192
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:24,550
And Leckie has to land on a very
heavily coraled area of beach,

193
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,501
which is accurate to history.

194
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,400
- We gotta get off the beach!
- I know, I know!

195
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,801
- Leckie, we gotta move!
- I know. We gotta get off!

196
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,350
The other end of the beach

197
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,500
is what we call the
Sledge end of the beach,

198
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,551
which is much much sandier,
much less coral, in fact.

199
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,850
Action!

200
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,350
What I've wanted to
do with Sledge's landing

201
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:56,250
is to give you about three or
four minutes of actual time

202
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,650
that he experiences on that beach,

203
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:02,401
knowing that the battle is
going on before he landed,

204
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,400
and will rage on for hours

205
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,950
after he's passed from the
beach on into the airfield,

206
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:12,551
so that the audience can
identify with his experience

207
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
and to share the fright.

208
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,450
Sledge, god damn it,

209
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,701
you gotta get your ass
out of that hole right now.

210
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Move it!

211
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
- And cut!
- Cut!

212
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,150
We're trying to prepare
this stretch of land for Peleliu,

213
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,300
the beach of Peleliu,

214
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,000
which is one of the worst engagements

215
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,201
which marines had to face
in their Pacific campaign.

216
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,600
The beach that we're actually
filming on is very sandy,

217
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,350
so we have to build all our coral

218
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,801
and dress that into
the location as well.

219
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,000
Also, you can see that

220
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,950
we have a fortified bunker on
the Leckie end of the beach,

221
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,051
which is angled to strafe the beach
as the soldiers come ashore.

222
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,450
The only way to stop this Jap artillery
is to get into those hills,

223
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,700
and the only way into those hills
is across this airfield.

224
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,850
When we move,
do not stop till we get across.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
- You got it?
- Aye, skipper!

226
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,600
This is a recreation
of the airfield at Peleliu

227
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,300
that the Americans came across after

228
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,701
they'd come up through
the scrub from the beach.

229
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,450
These are recreations of
buildings that were actually there.

230
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,101
We have the airstrip.

231
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,000
We have the power station,

232
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,400
the administration block,

233
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:48,000
air raid shelters,

234
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,051
some bombed out timber buildings.

235
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,900
Third platoon, move out!

236
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,200
We've got decorators

237
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,200
who are researching different
ways of making craters,

238
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,800
and how to make them, dress them,

239
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,301
and make them look real.

240
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,600
If you're gonna draw a pencil sketch
of what life in Hades is like,

241
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:23,300
I think you could do it from a
photograph of the battle of Peleliu.

242
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,501
Corpsman! Hey, corpsman!

243
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,800
And action!

244
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,500
Get off the beach.
Keep moving!

245
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,650
Iwo Jima is the site where

246
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,700
John Basilone voluntarily
returned to combat.

247
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,801
Even when he received
the Medal of Honor,

248
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,650
he never looked at himself
as above his men,

249
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
so much so that he demanded
to go back and fight

250
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,150
when he didn't have to.

251
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,200
You tell that tank to follow me.

252
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,350
- Aye, aye!
- Move!

253
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:04,351
Let's go!

254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,900
And cut!

255
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,000
When I was first told that
I'd be shooting the battle of Iwo Jima

256
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:27,351
on the side of a mountain inland at the
You Yangs National Park in Melbourne,

257
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,150
I said to myself,
"How are we gonna do that?"

258
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,100
But they carved off
the side of a mountain.

259
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,500
They brought in, I was told,
$1 million worth of volcanic ash,

260
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:42,700
and basically set up the exact
replication of the mountain

261
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,550
with respect to the various
tiers of the volcanic ash.

262
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,750
And then of course, the larger shots
of ships and so forth was all something

263
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,501
that was done visual effects-wise
in post effects.

264
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,550
But the majority of the shots
worked without having to touch 'em.

265
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,850
The smoke and the
intensity of all the fire

266
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:02,250
and all the things that were going on--

267
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,801
you really felt like you were there.

268
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,450
I'm more proud of the Iwo Jima battle

269
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:09,051
than anything I've
ever been involved in.

270
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,000
Action!

271
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Clear the back line!

272
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,550
Third platoon, get up on the rocks!

273
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, if you were gonna
take the twin campaigns

274
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,601
for the island of Iwo Jima
and the island of Okinawa,

275
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,500
you could probably say those were
the absolute worst of the entire war.

276
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,300
K Company, cease fire!

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Not only the horror of
actually being under fire,

278
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:59,600
but everything else about that island
was just absolutely miserable.

279
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:03,450
The battle of Okinawa presented
a lot of challenges for the production

280
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,551
because of the terrible conditions
that the marines fought under.

281
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,500
Spread out! Spread to the left!

282
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,950
The Okinawa landscape

283
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:14,100
was something that we had to
research very carefully--

284
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:17,450
Everything from the architecture
through the color of the soil,

285
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:21,850
the kind of rock geology that
we see exposed through the earth.

286
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:24,000
We built a Japanese village.

287
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,900
We dressed it all out,
and then we wrecked it.

288
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,900
We burned it, destroyed it
before even the crew got there.

289
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,150
And after that, it was all about mud,

290
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,401
pumping in water and making thick mud.

291
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,700
Every morning we would drench the set

292
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,650
and then drive tractors over the mud

293
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:40,850
just to churn it up and till it.

294
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,000
So it was a mess.

295
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,250
And then at night and
sometimes in the day,

296
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,751
we had rain towers,
so it was always raining.

297
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,350
It was always muddy.

298
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,400
Okinawa was part of Japan.

299
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,400
They were viewing themselves
as defending Japan,

300
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,600
and the only way in order to
get through the battle of Okinawa

301
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:04,500
is to take every day that it requires

302
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,950
and spend every life
that it was going to take.

303
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,001
That was the only way to do it.

304
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Okinawa had a profound
effect on all of us.

305
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,250
It's a very intense episode.

306
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,300
It affected everybody.

307
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,900
And it particular affected the actors,

308
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,801
and their performances reflect that.

309
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,000
Cease fire!

310
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,350
Cease fire, God damn it!

311
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
I told you to cease fire.

312
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,050
You're supposed to be observing.

313
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:27,800
I see you with a goddamn sidearm.

314
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,800
We were all sent here
to kill Japs, weren't we?

315
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,601
So what the hell difference does
it make what weapon we use?

316
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,400
I'd use my goddamn hands if I had to.

317
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,700
We're telling the story the way it was.

318
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,500
I feel we get inside
our marines' heads,

319
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:48,451
and hope that we tell the story that
we would want them to have us tell.

320
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
I want you to meet some of the reason

321
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,301
that we're doing what we're
doing every day out here.

322
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,700
When the veterans come on set,

323
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,000
they bring home the
sense of responsibility.

324
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:01,100
The fact that we're doing this today

325
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,350
and going over all of this again

326
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,350
is really startling to me.

327
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,051
I just can't believe it's happening.

328
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,450
I am so proud and so thrilled

329
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,500
that they have decided
to make this thing.

330
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm-- I can't express how I feel.

331
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:18,251
We'd all given up that this story
would ever be told--

332
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,000
The real true story.

333
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,251
'Cause it was a nasty war, man.

334
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,600
War is a part of the human condition.

335
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
The question we ask in "The Pacific"

336
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:37,200
is, "What did it do to its participants?

337
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,600
"How can you survive?

338
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,700
"How can you see what those guys did

339
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
"and expect to just
move on with things?"

340
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,200
It's not about America versus Japan.

341
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,600
It's about war

342
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:51,401
and how horrific it
can be for everybody.

343
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,350
Every single person that
had to go through that

344
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:55,900
deserves to be remembered,

345
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,751
and their story deserves to be told.

346
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,250
I can't imagine any human being

347
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:03,501
