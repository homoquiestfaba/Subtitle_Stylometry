1
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions.

2
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Are you sure
you want to sell them?

3
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,080
They're no use to Father,
not anymore.

4
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,600
Not since he's been this way.

5
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,200
His library was his whole world,
now it's just

6
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,720
a painful memory.

7
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,520
Unbearably painful.

8
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,520
I understand.

9
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, at a rough,
preliminary estimate,

10
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,760
you have a collection here

11
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
worth around 00,000 dollars.

12
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,360
Yes, or thereabouts.

13
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I've picked out

14
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,160
one or two volumes that
merit special attention.

15
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,880
This "Persiles", for example,
is important.

16
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,840
I'd hang on to that, it'll never
depreciate. It's a good investment.

17
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Valuable?

18
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
Very valuable.

19
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,120
As for this
"Hypnerotomachia di Poliphilo"

20
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,160
by Colonna, Venice, 1545...

21
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,520
I'n sure I could find you a buyer.

22
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,560
But don't let the rest go
for less than 500,000

23
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,400
under any circumstances.

24
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,640
It may take a month
to place them.

25
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
In the meantime, be patient.

26
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,560
A month?

27
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,840
Yes, a month or two. Depends
how much of a hurry you're in.

28
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
More hurry, less money.

29
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,040
That's my advice, anyway.

30
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to rush things.

31
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,920
But feel free to consult another
expert. You know where to reach me.

32
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,280
Incidentally...
This four volume edition

33
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,400
of "Don Quixote" is quite nice
but not particularly valuable.

34
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,920
Now, I could

35
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
take it off your hands...

36
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
right away.

37
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
How much were you thinking of...?

38
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,440
I couldn't go more
than 4,000... 4,200 tops.

39
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
- You here?
- Hello, Witkin.

40
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
You don't waste time.

41
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,360
There's a fortune in there.
Help yourself.

42
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,640
You're a vulture, Corso.
A vulture.

43
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
Who isn't in our business?

44
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
You'd stoop to anything.

45
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,400
For a "Quixote" by Ybarra?
You bet.

46
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Unscrupulous!
Thoroughly unscrupulous!

47
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Happy hunting!

48
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Just got off the phone with Witkin.
He's spitting blood.

49
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Really? What's his problem?

50
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,160
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

51
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
He thought he had that deal sewed
up, he said you queered his pitch.

52
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
He should be quicker
off the mark.

53
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,160
He said your valuation
was way over the top,

54
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,080
got those people
coming out in a rash.

55
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
They're asking twice
what the books are worth.

56
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's face it,

57
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,080
you screwed him.
That's what it's called.

58
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,320
That's what it's called.

59
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,600
He also said
you snatched the "Don..."

60
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,720
Ybarra "Don Quixote", 1780,

61
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,520
all four volumes.

62
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,680
Fantastic, you are the best.

63
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,560
That client of yours, the Swiss.
Would he still be interested?

64
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,600
I'd have Witkin on my ass.
I told him I had no part of this.

65
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Except 10%%% .

66
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,840
20%% %, the Swiss was my client.

67
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
No deal.

68
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,640
- 15. For my children's sake.
- You don't have any children.

69
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm still young, give me time.

70
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Ten.

71
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,680
...and earlier, en 1580, in
"De la DËmonomanie des sorciers"

72
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin.

73
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Bodin was probably
the first to attempt

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,240
to establish a system-
if the term

75
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,360
system may be applied to
the Middle Ages- for classifying

76
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
contemporary perceptions of evil.

77
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
In Bodin we find
one of the first

78
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,920
definitions of the word "witch".

79
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
I quote:

80
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,560
"A witch

81
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,440
is a person who, though cognizant
of the laws of God,

82
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,640
endeavors to act through a medium
of a pact with the Devil."

83
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars,

84
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,360
creatures such as cats or toads,

85
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,640
in which supernatural spirits
or demons were thought to reside.

86
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,000
For those of you who wish
to delve more deeply

87
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,480
into the controversial
subject of witchcraft,

88
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,560
a great deal of information may
be found in the following works:

89
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
Nicolas Remes
"Demonolatria libre",

90
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,320
and "Compendium maleficam"
by Francesco Maria Guazo.

91
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,520
I see you were stimulated
by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

92
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Did I snore?

93
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,080
It's nice of you to ask.
No, not that I noticed.

94
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,120
- Don't you sleep nights?
- Like a baby.

95
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Strange.

96
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,480
I'd have bet a brace of Gutenberg
Bibles you were up all night.

97
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,560
You're one of those hungry, restless
types that put the wind up Caesar,

98
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,640
men who stab their friends
in the back.

99
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,440
Not, I suspect, that you have many
friends. Do you, Mr. Corso?

100
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
Your kind seldom does.

101
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,240
That makes two of us.

102
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,880
You're right, of course.

103
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,520
Your friendships don't concern me
in the least.

104
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Our relations have always been
strictly commercial. I like that.

105
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,320
The professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive.

106
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,560
I came here to do some business,
not shoot the breeze.

107
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,360
If you want to expound your personal
philosophies, write another book.

108
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,680
You don't like me, do you?

109
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,240
I don't have to.
You're a client and you pay well.

110
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,760
You're privileged, Mr. Corso. Very
few people ever set foot in here.

111
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
This is my private collection.

112
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Some bibliophiles specialize
in Gothic novels,

113
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
others in books of hours.

114
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,760
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist:

115
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
The Devil.

116
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,640
- May I take a look?
- Yes, that's why

117
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,080
I brought you here.

118
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
Beautiful, aren't they?

119
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,040
The soft sheen,
the suberb gilding...

120
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,840
Not to mention the centuries
of wisdom they contain.

121
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,560
I know people who'd kill
for a collection like this.

122
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,120
The "Ars Diavoli"!

123
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,600
You'll never see as many books on
the subject anywhere in the world.

124
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,160
They're the rarest,
the choicest editions in existence.

125
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,640
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

126
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
Only the supreme masterpiece
was missing.

127
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,080
"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom
of the Shadows".

128
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,080
- You're familiar with it?
- Yes. Venice, 1.

129
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
The author and printer, A. Torchia,
was burned by the Holy Inquisition,

130
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,720
along with all his works.

131
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
Only three copies survived.

132
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,640
One.

133
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Catalogs list three copies: The
Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.

134
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
You know your business,
but you're mistaken.

135
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,160
According to my research,
only one is authentic.

136
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
Three are known.

137
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,720
That's the trouble.

138
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,680
- Where did you get it?
- I bought it from Telfer.

139
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,640
- Telfer?
- He finally sold it to me.

140
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,800
The day before he killed himself.

141
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,160
It's good timing.

142
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
- "Silence is golden".
- Precisely.

143
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,320
Never heard of the "Delomelanicon"?

144
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,320
I've heard of it.
It's a myth, isn't it?

145
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
A book reputed to have been
written by Satan himself.

146
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
No myth. That book existed.

147
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,080
Torchia actually acquired it.

148
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,760
The engravings you're admiring
were adapted by Torchia

149
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,440
from the "Delomelanicon".

150
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,680
The form a kind
of satanic riddle.

151
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,360
Correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text

152
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,600
and inside information, they
conjure up the Prince of Darkness

153
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,720
in person.

154
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
You don't say.

155
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you a religious man?

156
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,000
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

157
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,200
I believe in my percentage.

158
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Don't you get dizzy
standing there?

159
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,680
What is it you want
from me, Balkan?

160
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
I want you to go to Europe
and investigate.

161
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,640
The other two copies are in
Portugal and France, I want you to

162
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
find some way of comparing
them with mine:

163
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,360
Every page, every engraving, the
binding, everything. I'm convinced

164
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
only one is authentic.
I want to know which.

165
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,040
That could be an expensive trip.

166
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
That's to get you started.
Spend what you need.

167
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,680
- What if I find yours is a forgery?
- It's quite possible.

168
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,160
It doesn't appear to be.

169
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Even the paper sounds kosher.

170
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,000
Even so.
There's something wrong.

171
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
You mean the Devil
won't show up?

172
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,760
If all three copies turn out bogus
or incomplete, your work's done.

173
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,040
If one of them turns out to be
genuine, I'll finance you further.

174
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,760
I want you to get it for me,

175
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,640
at all costs, never mind how.

176
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,760
"Never mind how"
sounds illegal.

177
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,320
Wouldn't be the first time
you've done something illegal.

178
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,440
Not that illegal.

179
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,440
Hence the size of the check.

180
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,160
Do a good job,
I'll double it.

181
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,120
There's something wrong with it if
you're letting it out of your hands.

182
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,440
I have the utmost faith
in you, Mr. Corso.

183
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,040
There's nothing more reliable than
a man who can be bought for cash.

184
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
Good morning. Dean Corso.

185
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm terribly sorry to disturb
you at a time like this.

186
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,000
It would be very helpful, if you
could tell me what you know about

187
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
this book.

188
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,000
Isn't this one
of my husband's books?

189
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,920
It was in his collection until
recently. He sold it to my client.

190
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,240
I'm trying to authenticate it.

191
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
He sold it, you say?

192
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,960
How strange. This was one of
his most treasured possessions.

193
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,040
- He never mentioned the sale?
- No, it's news to me.

194
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,800
- Who bought it?
- A private collector.

195
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,000
May I know his name?

196
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm afraid
that's confidential.

197
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
- I suppose he has a bill of sale.
- No problem there.

198
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Is this your job,
authenticating rare books?

199
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,240
And tracking them down, yes.

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
You're a book detective.

201
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Kind of.

202
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,160
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

203
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,640
In Spain.

204
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,320
We were vacationing in Toledo.
Andrew got very excited.

205
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,400
He paid a great deal
of money for it.

206
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
He was a fanatical collector.

207
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,920
So I gather.

208
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,880
I'll show you.

209
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Impressive...

210
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Andrew used to spend
many hours in here.

211
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,560
Too many.

212
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
Did he ever try it out?

213
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
I don't understand.

214
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,880
The book.

215
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,680
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual intended to...

216
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,120
produce a supernatural effect?

217
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
- Are you serious?
- Yes, absolutely.

218
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,480
Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr. Corso,

219
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
but he wasn't insane.

220
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,480
It's true he'd been
acting strangely

221
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
those last few days.

222
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,960
He shut himself up in here.
He seldom emerged except for meals.

223
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,960
That morning I was woken
by the screams of the maid.

224
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,560
He'd hanged himself.

225
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,800
Whatever he was up to,

226
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,240
I can't see him chanting mumbo-jumbo
or trying to raise the dead.

227
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
The Devil, Mrs. Telfer.

228
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
This book is designed
to raise the Devil.

229
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,760
"Thus let the line shine."

230
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,480
Son of a bitch.
Where did you get this?

231
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
Balkan.

232
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,880
He wants me to research it.

233
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,760
Balkan owns a "Nine Gates"?

234
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,760
Recently acquired from the
late lamented Andrew Telfer.

235
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,000
Trust Balkan.

236
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,320
What does he need you for?
I don't suppose he plans to sell it.

237
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,520
He wants me to compare it with
the copies in Portugal and France.

238
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,440
So I'm off to Europe.

239
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,560
Compare it?

240
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah. Only one of the three
is authentic, he says.

241
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
Well, this looks
genuine enough.

242
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,880
Christ, it's got to be worth
a million. Take care of it.

243
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,080
That's why I'm here.
I need you to stash it for me.

244
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,320
Because I'm starting
to see things.

245
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,840
- Like what?
- Uninvited visitors,

246
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,960
unfamiliar faces.

247
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,760
I don't trust anyone,
not even Balkan.

248
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
Come to think of it,
I'm not even sure I trust you.

249
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,320
I'd only screw you for a good
reason: Money, women, business.

250
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,520
Other than that,
you can relax.

251
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,840
I'll pick it up on my way
to the airport.

252
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,080
These engravings are terrific.

253
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Or horrific, whatever.

254
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,720
Sensational.

255
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,400
May I come in?

256
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
Please sit down.

257
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,040
I've come to talk business.

258
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,080
Yesterday, when you
came to see me

259
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,480
about that book,

260
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,160
I was too surprised to react
as I should have done.

261
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,680
I mean, it really was
one of Andrew's favorites.

262
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
So you said.

263
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,440
I'd like to get it back.

264
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,000
That could be a problem.

265
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,440
Not necessarily.
It all depends.

266
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,320
- On what?
- On you.

267
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,040
I don't understand. That book
is not mine to dispose of.

268
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,040
You work for money,
I take it?

269
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,160
What else?

270
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
- I have a great deal of money.
- I'm very happy for you.

271
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
You could stage a theft.

272
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,720
I imagine your client is
well assured.

273
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,400
- I'm a professional, ma'am.
- You're a professional mercenary.

274
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
- They work for the highest bidder.
- I make a living.

275
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,120
I could throw in a bonus.

276
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,280
- This has happened before someplace.
- I know. In the movies.

277
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,920
And she had an automatic
in her stocking.

278
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,720
No automatic.

279
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,240
- Like a drink?
- Why not?

280
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,360
Okay, where is it?

281
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Where is what?

282
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,720
Don't fuck with me!

283
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,240
I thought I already did.

284
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,840
Bernie's Rare Books, please leave
your message after the beep.

285
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Pick up!

286
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,600
Give me a minute,
I won't be long.

287
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,000
- You can take me on to Kennedy.
- No problem, sir.

288
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
No problem?

289
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,560
Stop at that phone booth,
pull over.

290
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
No problem, sir.

291
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,680
He isn't available at this time.
Who's calling?

292
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,600
- Would you like to leave a message?
- No, I have to talk with him.

293
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm afraid he's in transit.

294
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,200
If you give me your number,
I'll have him call.

295
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,440
No, I'm in a phone booth!
It's an emergency!

296
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,880
I have to speak with him right now.
Right now! You hear me?

297
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,760
One moment.

298
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,200
- Are you there, Mr. Corso?
- Yes.

299
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
I'll patch you through.

300
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Mr. Corso, what have you
got for me?

301
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,280
More than I bargained for.

302
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,760
- What do you mean?
- I mean I quit.

303
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,960
I want to return the book.
Where are you?

304
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso.
You've never let me down before.

305
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,360
Well, this is different.

306
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,600
You remember Bernie Orenstein?

307
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,960
- The dealer?
- I gave him your book to stash,

308
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,120
and now he's dead.
Murdered.

309
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
- Because of the book?
- What else?

310
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,840
I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money...

311
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,480
It isn't the money.
I want out.

312
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,160
This matter means a great deal
to me, Mr. Corso.

313
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

314
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,080
Proceed as arranged, and you can
tack another zero onto your fee.

315
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,920
Hey, where are you?

316
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,560
I would like to get
your opinion on this.

317
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
What a habit for a bookbinder!

318
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,120
"The Nine Gates".
Suberb edition. Very rare.

319
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,920
The Telfer copy.

320
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Yes. You used to own it, right?

321
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,320
- We used to, yes.
- We sold it.

322
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,880
When the opportunity presented
itself. It was too good to...

323
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
...it was too good to miss.
An excellent sale.

324
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,920
An excellent buy,
impeccable condition.

325
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,320
Impeccable.
Are you the present owner?

326
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,080
No, a client of mine.

327
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,800
I never would have believed
she would part with it, never.

328
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,120
- She?
- Mrs. Telfer.

329
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
I understood

330
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
that it was Mr. Telfer...
that bought it.

331
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
He paid for it.

332
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,440
Mrs. Telfer made him buy it.
He didn't seem particularly...

333
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,840
...interested.

334
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,360
An exceptional specimen.

335
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,880
- Do you think it could be a forgery?
- A forgery? You hear that, Pablo?

336
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,560
I took you for a professional.
You speak too lightly of forgeries.

337
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
Far too lightly.

338
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,920
Forging a book is very expensive.

339
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,240
Paper of the period, the right inks.
Too expensive to be profitable.

340
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,200
- Still, it can be done.
- Of course.

341
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Well, it requires great skill,
but yes, it can be done.

342
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,000
Do you think that could be
the case here?

343
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,280
What makes you ask?

344
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,040
My client wishes to satsify himself
on the book's authenticity.

345
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,400
His name is Boris Balkan.
Boris Balkan of New York.

346
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,680
- All books have their own destiny.
- And their own life.

347
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,000
Mr. Balkan is
a celebrated collector.

348
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,040
He's no fool, he must know
this book is authentic.

349
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,120
- We know it.
- We had this book for years.

350
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,160
Many years.

351
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,360
We had ample opportunity to study
it thoroughly. The printing,

352
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,000
the binding are great examples of
17th century Venetian craftsmanship.

353
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,720
Finest rag paper, resistant
to the passage of time!

354
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,440
None of your modern wood pulp!

355
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,520
Watermarks, ink,

356
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,280
type faces...

357
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,160
If this is a forgery,

358
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
or a copy with missing pages
restored, it's the work of a master.

359
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Have you studied the engravings?
They seem to have some underlying

360
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,760
significance.

361
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,080
But of course.

362
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Here, for example.

363
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
This one could be interpreted
as a warning.

364
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,960
"Venture too far," It seems to say,
"and danger will descend on you."

365
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,760
This tye of books
often contain

366
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,680
little puzzles.

367
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,800
Especially in the case of such
an illustrious collaborator.

368
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,320
Collaborator?

369
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,080
You cannot

370
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,520
have proceeded very far
with your research, Seòor.

371
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,560
Here, look close.

372
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,960
Don't you see? Only six of
the nine engravings were signed by

373
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,880
Aristide Torchia.

374
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,200
Yes. And the other three?

375
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,360
But this is one of them.

376
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,600
Who is LCF?

377
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,640
Think.

378
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,840
Lucifer?

379
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,400
Very perceptive of you, seòor.

380
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,080
Torchia was burned alive because
he wrote this book in collaboration.

381
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,320
Come on! You can't
honestly believe...

382
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,680
The man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the Devil

383
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,160
and went to the stake for it.

384
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,920
Even Hell has
its heroes, Seòor.

385
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,600
- I've seen you before.
- Have you?

386
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,800
- Are you traveling in this car?
- The next one.

387
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,000
The sleeper.
I travel on the cheap.

388
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,560
- You're a student?
- Something like that.

389
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,040
I like trains.

390
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,080
- Trains I'm on?
- Just trains.

391
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
What's your name?

392
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,280
Guess.

393
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,440
- Green eyes.
- That'll do.

394
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,000
- What's yours?
- Corso.

395
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,320
Strange name.

396
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,000
Italian. It means "run".

397
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,280
You don't look like a runner
to me. More the quiet type.

398
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,360
Give my regards to Balkan.
Tell him I'm doing my best.

399
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,600
Never mind.

400
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,880
See you around.

401
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,920
Maybe.

402
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
I wouldn't be surprised.

403
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,320
Yes, Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

404
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,120
Corso, oh, yes.
Please come in.

405
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,880
Home, sweet home.

406
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,720
You won't say no to a brandy,
I take it.

407
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,920
What handsome glasses.

408
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,360
They're the only ones
I have left.

409
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,280
- Must have been a beautiful place.
- It was.

410
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,600
But old families are
like ancient civilizations:

411
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,160
They wither and die.

412
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,080
There they are,
834 of them.

413
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,000
A pity you didn't see them
in better times.

414
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,360
I used to have 5,000.

415
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,240
But these are the survivors.

416
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,240
So this is
the Fargas collection.

417
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,160
Not quite as I imagined it,
I must say.

418
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,000
C'est la vie, my friend.

419
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,400
I keep them in perfect condition,
safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

420
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,920
I dust and air them everyday.

421
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,560
These are the occults.

422
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,920
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

423
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,600
Not bad indeed. At least ten
of them are extremely rare.

424
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,920
Here, Plancy's
"Dictionnaire Infernal",

425
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,600
first edition, 1844.

426
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,160
Leonardo Fioravanti's
"Compendi di Secreti", 1571.

427
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,520
And there it is,

428
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,640
in perfect condition.

429
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,520
After three and a half centuries,
it may have been printed yesterday.

430
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,720
Is it in order? You haven't
detected anything unusual?

431
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,920
The text is complete, the
engravings, too. 9 & the title page,

432
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,040
just as the catalogs state. Just
like the Kessler and the Telfer.

433
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,960
It isn't the Telfer anymore.

434
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,640
Telfer killed himself.

435
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,000
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

436
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,400
If he sets his heart on a book,
no price is too high.

437
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,040
Not that I would ever sell
this one, not at any price.

438
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,720
It's strange he should have
sent you here,

439
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,040
if he already had...

440
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,200
You have it here?

441
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,920
May I see it?

442
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,880
Superb.

443
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,240
Beautiful, identical.

444
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,920
Two of the only three
to escape the flames,

445
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,280
reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

446
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,400
Yes.

447
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,760
Look at this slight imperfection,
the damaged "S".

448
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,640
The same type,
the same impression.

449
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,120
And you see?
If it weren't for this

450
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,560
slight discoloration
on the back of your copy,

451
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,320
no one could
tell them apart.

452
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,760
If you don't mind, I'd like
to stay and examine them in detail.

453
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,480
What are you looking for,
Mr. Corso?

454
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,720
I'm not quite sure.

455
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,520
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

456
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,760
It's very true.

457
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,880
Hello again.

458
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,360
- You didn't say you'd be in Sintra.
- Neither did you.

459
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,400
What are you doing here?

460
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,960
Reading.

461
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,440
I can see that.

462
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,920
And bumping into people
unexpectedly.

463
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,880
Yes, unexpectedly is right.

464
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,280
Are you on a business trip?
Is that why you always carry that?

465
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,960
- Is this part of your course?
- My course?

466
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,000
Winning friends and influencing
people. You said you were a student.

467
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,160
Did I?

468
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,000
So I am. In a way.

469
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,320
I like books. Do you?

470
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,440
- You've been traveling long?
- Awhile.

471
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,400
I don't suppose you ever
travel by motorbike?

472
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,440
For me? Are you sure?

473
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
My God! How did you find me?

474
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,960
- Made any progress?
- Progress? You could call it that.

475
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,320
Well?

476
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,200
I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back. Where are you?

477
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,880
Never mind that. Get them to
transfer it to your room. I'll wait.

478
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,880
Could you send this
up to my room, please?

479
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,920
- You still there?
- Yes.

480
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,320
All right, I've examined
the Fargas copy.

481
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,680
It's authentic enough,
at least it looks that way.

482
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,600
It's like yours.
But there are discrepancies.

483
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,000
Discrepancies?

484
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,840
The engravings.
They're not identical.

485
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,640
It's like keys
in different hands,

486
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,400
doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other.

487
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,720
- And there's another thing.
- Yes, yes, go on.

488
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,040
The ones that differ aren't signed
by Torchia. They're signed "LCF".

489
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,080
You still there?

490
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,040
Where are you, anyway?

491
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,320
I must have that copy,

492
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,520
Mr. Corso. Get it for me.

493
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,560
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

494
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,120
Did he?

495
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,720
Just a minute.

496
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,360
- What time is it?
- Early, but you have to go.

497
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,040
Go? Go where?

498
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,440
- The Fargas place.
- I've already seen Fargas.

499
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,480
You should
see him again.

500
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,600
Is this some kind of joke? Who are
you? What do you know about Fargas?

501
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,240
Get dressed, I'll wait
for you outside.

502
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,640
Don't bother. He isn't there.

503
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,200
- Really? Then where is he?
- Over there.

504
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Want to get inside?

505
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,720
I had thought about it, yes.

506
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,560
You wait here.

507
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,520
Well, did you find it?

508
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,560
It's coming to my attention
that you know too goddamn much.

509
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,320
Why do you keep following me around?
Who are you working for?

510
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,280
You're wasting time, asking these
questions. We'd better leave.

511
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,800
There's a flight from Lisbon to
Paris at noon. We can just make it.

512
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,240
- What's with the "we"?
- There are two of us, aren't there?

513
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,040
What happened back there?

514
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,960
The old man caught someone
stealing, I guess.

515
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,360
- What do you guess happened to him?
- He drowned.

516
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,720
- With a little help from who?
- He's dead. Who cares?

517
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,200
I do.

518
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,120
I could easily wind up
the same way.

519
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,760
Not with me around
to look after you.

520
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,040
- I see. You're my guardian angel.
- Lf you say so.

521
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,560
- Someone's playing a game with me.
- Of course. You're part of it.

522
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,160
And you're getting
to like it.

523
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,600
Hello, Mr. Corso,
delighted to see you again.

524
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,360
We don't have
any vacancies, but...

525
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,680
I'm sure I'll be able
to organize something.

526
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,200
- Hello. The Kessler Foundation?
- The second floor.

527
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,040
I'm Dean Corso. I have an
appointment with Baroness Kessler.

528
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,560
You have 30 minutes.

529
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,960
I've heard a great deal
about you.

530
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,240
- Nothing good, I hope.
- You hope right.

531
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,320
Well, I'm reassured, Baroness.

532
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,120
In my trade, to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous.

533
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,200
There it is,
the Kessler Collection.

534
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,440
You know, I know your catalog
almost by heart.

535
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,520
Strange we haven't met. Your name is
byword among dealers and collectors.

536
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,880
But I imagine you know your
own reputation better than I do.

537
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,160
Yes, well, it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

538
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm sorry, were you
in the middle of something?

539
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,400
My latest work:

540
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,400
"The Devil: History and Myth",
a kind of biography.

541
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,520
It will be published
early next year.

542
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,880
- Why the Devil?
- I saw him one day.

543
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,800
I was 15 years old and I saw him
as plain as I see you now.

544
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,680
It was love at first sight.

545
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,880
300 years ago you would have been
burned at the stake for saying that.

546
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,480
300 years ago
I wouldn't have said it.

547
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,920
Nor would I have made
a million by writing about it.

548
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,360
What is it you wish to discuss,
Mr. Corso?

549
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,720
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine, if possible.

550
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,960
"The Book of the Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows".

551
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,840
"The Nine Gates"?
An interesting work.

552
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,960
Everyone's been asking me
about it lately.

553
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,400
Is that so?

554
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,680
Follow me.

555
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,720
You truly believe
in the Devil, Baroness?

556
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,320
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him,

557
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,320
not to mention many years

558
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,800
of work.

559
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,200
Don't you?

560
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,520
Almost.

561
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,880
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

562
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,520
I'm afraid my faith
is in short supply these days.

563
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,800
I know this book extremely well.
I studied it for years.

564
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,600
You have any doubts
about its authenticity?

565
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
None whatsoever.

566
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,600
- You're sure?
- My knowledge

567
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,120
of this book is profound.

568
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,200
I wrote a biography
of its author.

569
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,040
Yes, I read it: "Aristide Torchia,
the Devil's Apprentice".

570
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,360
Excellent work.

571
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,240
A courageous man.

572
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,240
He died for the sake
of this very book in 17.

573
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,840
While studying the black arts
in Prague,

574
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,240
he acquired a copy
of the dread "Delomelanicon".

575
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,640
This is Torchia's adaptation
of that work, written by Lucifer

576
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
himself.

577
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,360
After they burned him
at the stake,

578
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,960
a secret society was founded
to perpetuate its memory

579
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,800
and preserve its secrets.

580
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,280
The Order of the

581
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,760
Silver Serpent.

582
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,240
A sect?

583
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,120
A kind of witches' coven.

584
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,480
For centuries they've met to read
from the book and worship Lucifer.

585
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,160
Today they've degenerated

586
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,720
into a social club for bored
millionaires and celebrities

587
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,120
who use its meetings
as an excuse

588
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,680
to indulge their
jaded sexual appetites.

589
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,400
I myself belonged to the Order

590
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,280
years ago,

591
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,800
but time is too precious
at my age.

592
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,160
Besides, my orgy days
are over.

593
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,560
I told them to go
to the Devil.

594
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,920
You mean that it's
all about sex, or...?

595
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,280
Of course not.

596
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,760
They're under the illusion they
owe their money and success

597
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,200
to membership in the Order.

598
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,400
- Do they still meet?
- Every year,

599
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,440
on the anniversary
of Torchia's death.

600
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,680
They'll be meeting
very soon now.

601
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,280
- And they read from this book?
- Not this one.

602
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,520
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

603
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,680
Victor Fargas is an unbeliever.

604
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,440
He always refused to participate,
so they use the Telfer copy.

605
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,680
Not that it's ever worked.

606
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,240
Did Andrew Telfer take part?

607
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,160
Telfer? No, no.

608
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,160
That creature. Liana married
him for his money.

609
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,520
She comes of an old and
aristocratic French family,

610
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,400
the Saint-Martins,
but they were penniless.

611
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,560
Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau

612
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,840
and buy "The Nine Gates".

613
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,120
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings,

614
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,040
he'll probably kill himself.

615
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,200
Funny you should say that, Baroness.
He hanged himself last week.

616
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,200
Who exactly are you working for,
Mr. Corso?

617
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,320
My client's name is irrelevant,
Baroness.

618
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,600
I'm simply trying
to authenticate his copy,

619
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,080
which is the one Telfer
sold him before he died.

620
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,160
How stupid of me!
I should have guessed!

621
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,880
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr. Corso.

622
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,280
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

623
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,960
Certainly not.

624
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,080
Tell your client,
who can only be Boris Balkan,

625
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,800
to come and examine it
himself, if he dares.

626
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,240
Tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep's clothing.

627
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,360
And now,

628
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,160
kindly leave.

629
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,080
I'm sorry if I troubled you.

630
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,880
Thank you very much
for your time.

631
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,200
You don't know what you're getting
yourself into, Mr. Corso.

632
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,440
Get out before it's too late.

633
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,400
I'm afraid
it already is, Baroness.

634
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,280
They're broken.

635
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,520
You should be more careful.
