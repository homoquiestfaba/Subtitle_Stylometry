That's the problem.

540
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:55,183
I handle it.

541
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,719
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

542
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,189
You sure you wanna
do this shit right now?

543
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,925
[Luis] This is not
going to go good...

544
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:06,893
[Knock, Knock]

545
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:08,462
[Brad] Coming!

546
00:38:08,763 --> 00:38:10,464
Easy on my door.

547
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:12,265
[Luis] What in the flying fuck?

548
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:13,902
Jesus, Yuri!

549
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,668
You know you can't be here.

550
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,737
[Luis] Why are you dressed
like a dreidel, anyway, dude?

551
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,040
Work party, my boss is jewish

552
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,841
Wait, what the fuck?

553
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,977

we don't want any trouble here.

554
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,711
He has no shoes on...

555
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:28,548
- Don't put it that way.
- What way?

556
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,116

557
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,417
- Sounds like you want trouble.
- OK, fine!

559
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,555

560
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:36,925

561

Oh, why don't you guys just go

562
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:41,860

563

567

[Luis] Told you, thank you.

568
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,673
OK, cool, real cool

569
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:56,609
[Brad] Hey, Havana, you sure you
want to get wrapped up in this?

570
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:59,111
I'm calling the cops! I got a
restraining order on your buddy.

571
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:02,048
You know that, right?
I'm serious.

572
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,450
You don't live here anymore.
I am the man of the house.

573
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:05,954
Shut the fuck up, please.

574
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:09,455
Don't make me
take the dreidel off!

575
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,890
What's the big fucking deal
with the shed.

577
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:14,195
[Brad] Does he ever listen?

578
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,899
[Brad] Easy with that stuff.

579
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,100
What's the big deal?

580
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:22,771
Hello?
You're not gonna say nothing.

581
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,106
[everybody] Holy shit!

582
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,810
[Brad] What are you going to...

583
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,579
[Brad] No, please. No, don't. I
don't want it! You can have it!

584
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:43,723
[Luis] Alright, so the
Hammond, right? It's a...

585
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:47,360
half night club, half cassino,
but they're on Indian land

586
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,929
and they do whatever they want.
Run by a guy named Thomas Camp.

587
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,397
I met him.

588
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,499
Here's the thing:
He's only a front.

589
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,434
He comes up squeaky clean,
but when you look deeper,

590
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,536
It goes a lot further.

591
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,075
It's run by a bunch of guys
that have ties to criminal ties

592
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:04,843
I'm talking about like
human trafficking, arms dealing

593
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:07,146
They took Julia.

594
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:09,715
If you stay out of the gym,
and start watching the news

595
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:11,550
Yeah! They probably did
take Julia.

596
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:14,255
Shit happens like this in the
news all the time! I don't know.

597
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:20,960
Look, you've been in that place
right? So, what do you think?

598
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,595
A place where maybe
she might be?

599
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:24,299
[Yuri] I think she is inside.

600
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:27,566
You've been in there, right?
What if you had to pick a spot?

601
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,702
Where do you think she might be?

602
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:33,172
[Yuri] There was a side room
in the back of the club.

603
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,875
[Yuri]Some kind of key log.

604
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:38,944
[Luis] OK, the club was shut
down when they built a new one

605
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:41,914
next door, maybe there's a way
to get from one side to the next

606
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,283
my best guess,
It would be the same way

607
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:46,419
try to go from one side
to the other

608
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:48,621
But listen,
check this shit out:

609
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:53,426
Three years ago, right, a guy
with a manifesto claim, right?

610
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:56,529
He posted a manifesto claim.
Are you paying a-fucking-tention

611
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:58,464
He posted a manifesto claim,
claiming that his daughter got

612
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,066
kidnapped in New York.

613
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:02,234
Wanna hear
the funny part about it?

614
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:03,636
It was financed
by the same group

615
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,073
of fucking Guys.

616
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,473
He filed a fucking petition

617
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:09,775
and fucking,
guess what happened after that?

618
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:11,544
[Yuri] And?

619
00:41:11,547 --> 00:41:14,313
Yeah - and. They found him shot
and killed the next day

620
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:16,315
he filed the petition
with the city

621
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,684
You know the police said?
It was a home burglary.

622
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,089
Bullshit. Two in the chest
and one in the dome?

623
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:23,989
Professionals.

624
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:26,025
Yeah, professionals, I'd know it
you'd know it, but why

625
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,326
didn't the police figure it out?

626
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:29,929
but it goes a lot deeper.

627
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:31,597
These guys are powerful.
Are You listening to me?

628
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,899
They're powerful.

629
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:34,969

00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:33,100
You saw her?

718
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,369
The girl

719
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:37,271
Julia

720
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:41,108
The girl, with the tatoo

721
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:42,909
You know her?

722
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:44,276
Yes.

723
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,544
Where is she?

724
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:47,914
I don't know, I fell asleep.

725
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:48,714
They took her?

726
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:50,117
Yes.

727
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:03,163
[Operator] 911 what
is your emergency?

728
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,266
I just killed 5 people.

729
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:07,068
Maybe 6.

730
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,203
At the Hammond, South Beach

731
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:13,374
[Yuri] There are kidnapped girls
chained up in the basement.

732
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,078
They need medical
attention. Do you understand?

733
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:26,287
Five of our best men
in Miami, killed.

734
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:29,655
Two of our assets, taken.

735
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:32,992
This puts extreme stress
in our enterprise,

736
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:35,294
not to mention the kind of money

737
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:37,665
we have to pay the officials
to bury the investigation.

738
00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:44,572
This is our target.

739
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:47,375
I know this man.

740
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:49,377
What do you know?

741
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:52,113
His name is Yuri Gradenko

742
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,546
He was Sambo champion, Ukraine

743
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:56,815
and he fought in the War.

744
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:59,986
[Olivier] Special Forces,
over 300 confirmed kills.

745
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:02,824
People talked about him
like he was some kind of legend.

746
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:06,291
After, I heard
he was a personal bodyguard

747
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:07,760
for the Secretary of Defense

748
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:10,832
and the top crime boss in Moscow

749
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:14,234
I thought the secretary defense
was the top crime boss in Moscow

750
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:15,636
Chen!

751
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:19,574
What's he want?

752
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,610
We took something
of value from him.

753
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,349
Her name is Julia, his daughter.

754
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:30,752
His daughter?

755
00:48:31,154 --> 00:48:32,952
Yes, why?

756
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:35,122
We're going to need
a lot of bullets.

757
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,764
[Reggae music]

758
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,551
Bro, what the fuck
happened to laying low?

759
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:06,418
What do you mean?

760
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:09,222
The fucking story is out!
It's all over the damn news.

761
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:12,025
Some guy walks in to the Hammond
and shoots all these gangsters!

762
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,193
Great news.

763
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:14,393
Sure it is.

764
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:16,162
Did you tape it?

765
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,766
Of course I fucking taped it.

766
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:20,902
Very cool.

767
00:49:23,705 --> 00:49:25,437
Look, I've been
doing work on these guys

768
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,539
I've been doing research

769
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,741
and the fucking shit I found

770
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:31,844
This goes a little higher
than we both think.

771
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:34,214
I mean,
I'm close to finding a name

772
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,983
but the clients these guys deal
with from senators to governors

773
00:49:36,986 --> 00:49:39,052
20 years
and no fucking prosecution

774
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:40,853
We're going to need
more muscle, bro.

775
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,390
[Yuri] I don't
need extra help...

776
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:44,457
I just need...

777
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,059
Where to find her.

778
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,827
Find her?
Great fucking answer, Tough guy.

779
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,965
Easier said than done.
So, the work I found out,

780
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:53,933
it's the BC Holdings group,
right?

781
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:56,135
They own almost all
the fucking property here.

782
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:58,304
There's 30 different
places she can be at.

783
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:01,874
So the research that I found
is probably port Lot 29,

784
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:04,077
so they own this
whole fucking lot, right?

785
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,246
And there's a shipment
coming in tommorrow.

786
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:08,248
I'm almost certain
from the research I've done

787
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:10,083
that it should probably be there

788
00:50:10,086 --> 00:50:12,253
[Max] Yuri!

789
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,359
Why didn't you tell me?

790
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:21,328
I tried to tell you.

791
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:23,832
You were too busy to care.

792
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,299
So you're saying I don't care.

793
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:28,837
I tried to call you and text you

794
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:35,576
Yuri, where the fuck is she?

795
00:50:37,213 --> 00:50:38,847
I don't know.

796
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,616
I just know.

797
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:44,652
Where we can start.

798
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,594
How's Brett?

799
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:58,264
It's kind of embarrassing.

800
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,968
You really could have hurt him.

801
00:51:01,203 --> 00:51:03,604
Sorry, it was too much.

802
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:07,008
I forget he is a small guy...
But-

803
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,477
He has potential...

804
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,981
If he drinks more milk.

805
00:51:13,748 --> 00:51:15,315
That's not funny, Yuri.

806
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,384
He's a good man.

807
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:22,623
What did you do to yourself?

808
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:27,294
Mister Gradenko!

809
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:29,062
Mister Gradenko!

810
00:51:29,065 --> 00:51:30,498
Come out.

811
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:36,738
I'm waiting for you Mr. Gradenko

812
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,209
Tell me something

813
00:51:43,212 --> 00:51:45,046
Why do you use protection?

814
00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:47,849
Excuse me, Sir. Protection?

815
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:52,418
Well, I guess when
when with a woman, I sometimes-

816
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:55,388
No, not that type of protection.

817
00:51:55,391 --> 00:51:56,956
I'm talking about
real protection.

818
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,627
Men, guns, a place like this

819
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:01,696
Why don't you
use it for yourself?

820
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:03,229
Because I never needed it.

821
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:04,733
That's right.

822
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,066
Because the only people
who want to kill you

823
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:08,435
want to kill me.

824
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:12,205
You don't need protection
because you are the protection.

825
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,475
I'm not sure I follow.

826
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:18,512
I'm trying
to make you comprehend

827
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:20,682
the importance of what you do.

828
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:23,952
If I would be killed,
who's to blame?

829
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:26,285
Well... Me.

830
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,587
Yes

831
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,456
but I also want you
to comprehend

832
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:32,626
the importance of who you are.

833
00:52:32,794 --> 00:52:34,160
If I will get killed,

834
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:35,797
what would you do?

835
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:38,967
I would feel horrible, Sir.

836
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:42,201
I didn't ask you
how you would feel,

837
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:44,371
I said, what do you do?

838
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,609
I just don't want
to imagine that.

839
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:56,718
But you have imagined it,
haven't you?

840
00:52:57,053 --> 00:52:58,920
You take over.

841
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:02,356
Who else
is going to head this empire?

842
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:05,459
All of this: yours.

843
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:09,396
But that's OK, it's OK.

844
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:12,067
I just want you
to be honest with me.

845
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:20,108
You have imagined it,
haven't you?

846
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:23,477
Yes, I have imagined it.

847
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,681
In time my friend, in time.

848
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:32,687
But for now, you protect me.

849
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:46,134
Looks like you made
a lot of enemies lately.

850
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,435
Special forces.

851
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:52,305
Tell me:

852
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:54,743
How do you get out
from situation like this?

853
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:59,546
Rule number 1

854
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:02,684
always bring back up.

855
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:04,786
Back up?

856
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:11,092
[Gun shots]

857
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:23,932
[Goon] Fuck you Gradenko

858
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,768
[Goon] You're dead.

859
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:36,077
[Max] Oh God, my neck hurts.

860
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:46,721
Sleeping in car
is not easy.

861
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:07,175
Are you sure?
You trust your friend?

862
00:56:08,477 --> 00:56:10,845
Yes, we work together.

863
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:13,879
If there's anyone good left
at that Police Department.

864
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:15,616
Trust me, it's him.

865
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:22,057
Let's get out of here.

866
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:34,002
Yawn!

867
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,872
Maybe we should pick up
some mouthwash along the way.

868
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:11,270
[Charles] Mr. Tanaka,
nice meeting you.

869
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:13,975
Very happy
to see you here.

870
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,311
[Tanaka] I'm about
to make you even happier.

871
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:21,049
[Charles] Perfect, let's go
inside and enjoy the show.

872
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,999
[Charles] Pure beauty latinas.

873
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:42,103
Where else you can find it?
But Miami.

874
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:45,006
[Tanaka] My clientele
is going to be very happy.

875
00:57:45,107 --> 00:57:47,006
This is a big trend right now.

876
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,977
That's why you come to me.

877
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:52,213
Because I always
deliver the best.

878
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,092
Hey Max

879
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:10,098
I couldn't believe it when
you told me what happened.

880
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:12,300
How you holding up?

881
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:17,303
We're allright,
we just need to find her.

882
00:58:17,306 --> 00:58:19,572
Were you able to find anything
with the info we gave you?

883
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:20,942
I'm off duty this week,

884
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:22,911
but I did pop in the Department

885
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:24,679
last night after we talked.

886
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,447
What did you find?

887
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:32,287
Max, I checked into the port

888
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:34,322
It's pretty heavy stuff.

889
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,922
If you go after these people,

890
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:39,761
They're going to come gunning
for you. And I mean gunning.

891
00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:42,463
Are you sure you're ready?

892
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:45,133
Yeah, I'm sure.

893
00:58:58,213 --> 00:59:00,846
[Max] Shit, what the fuck!

894
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:03,783
So sorry, I had no idea he would
be in on something like this

895
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:05,050
I had no fucking clue.

896
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:06,487
I can't believe this.

897
00:59:21,136 --> 00:59:23,137
You friend.

898
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:26,140
We got a deal.

899
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,940
[Cop] You can't kill me.
I'm a cop.

900
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:34,542
[Yuri] Dirty Cop.

901
01:00:59,434 --> 01:01:00,902
Sir.

902
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,736
Let me guess.
Both of them dead.

903
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:05,239
Yes, Sir.

904
01:01:07,075 --> 01:01:09,510
That Russian mother fucker
is costing me a lot of money.

905
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:13,414
Well...
What if?

906
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:15,616
What if we release the girl?

907
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:17,585
Give him back the Girl!?

908
01:01:21,123 --> 01:01:22,590
You know who I am?

909
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:24,525
You know what I built?

910
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,693
You think a guy will
take a bunch of our men,

911
01:01:27,696 --> 01:01:29,397
and I'm going to
become his bitch?

912
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:32,233
What the fuck
I'm paying you for?

913
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:34,168
Find him

914
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:36,404
And kill him.

915
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,929
Nice to see you again...

All of them... OK.

920
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:13,941
We're ready.

921
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:04,358
When's the chopper coming?

922
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:06,561

[Olivier] Wait! Wait!

932
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,611
I'm the only one
who knows where she is.

933
01:07:51,914 --> 01:07:53,782
I'm the only one
who can help you.

934
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:13,702
Get that bitch out of here!

935
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:20,672
And you,
get me that Russian's daughter.

936
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:22,778
You mean the Ukrainian girl?

937

[Elevator grinds up]

939
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,086
Your father
didn't make this easy.

940
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:08,422
I won't forget that.

941
01:09:08,723 --> 01:09:10,491
Put her over there.

944
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:18,900
Oh yes, he's done.

945
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:21,635

Oh no,
just a small bump at the port.

950
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,238
I just wanted to inform you

951

Be quiet, lay low.

955

you don't miss this shit,

01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:11,546
Let's negotiate,
I have tons of money, Rubles...

1080
01:21:12,547 --> 01:21:15,182
No agreement, I'm in Ukranian.

1081
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:18,252
What? You're not Russian?

1082
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,319
How much money?

1083
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,056
Are we talking about?

1084
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,225
I knew you were
a reasonable man.

1085
01:21:25,228 --> 01:21:26,527
Put the gun down.

1086
01:21:30,398 --> 01:21:32,899
How about two million dollars?

1087
01:21:32,902 --> 01:21:35,436
Two Million dollars?
Julia what do you think?

1088
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,205
Everybody has a price.

1089
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,174
[Julia] Papa!

1090
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:42,711
Julia!

1091
01:21:49,317 --> 01:21:52,553
Nazdarovya

1092
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:55,256
Merry Christmas Papa.

1093
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:05,834
Well,
that will keep you occupied.

1094
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:13,608
Damn.

1095
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,459
[Luis] So...
whatever happened to Max?

1096
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,795
[Yuri] Well...
