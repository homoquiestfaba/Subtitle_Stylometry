8
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:48,368

9
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,072
<i>All we need now is these bitches</i>

10
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:52,479
<i>to put on their costumes
and show up.</i>

11
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:12,533
That's horrible. Yeah.

12
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,868
Halloween's supposed to be scary.

13
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:17,340
Yeah, but that is, um --

14
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:19,434
Yeah, so you wear
a scary costume,

15
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,013
not some slutty,
man-getting outfit like that.

16
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,409
What -- what is that?

17
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:26,808
Whatever. Can it, biotch.

18
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,250
Fix my whiskers.

19
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,685
- Slut.
- Whore.

20
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,254
- Hussy.
- Jezebel.

21
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:32,085
Tart.

22
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,595
You've got to be kidding me.

23
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,569
What?

24
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,834
You can't be dressed like a cat.

25
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:49,930
Why not?

26
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,669
Because I told you
that I was gonna be a cat.

27
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:55,303
She spent a long time
making those ears.

28
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,846
I don't know why you made them.

29
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,179
I mean, you can buy super-cute ones
at the drugstore.

30
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,310
These were $5 or something.

31
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,045
What? You worried Dex
is gonna be there?

32
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,865
What's wrong with you?

33
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,264
If you must know,

34
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:18,533
I'm having...
a bit of a chafing situation.

35
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,767
My fishnets are not doing
kind things to my Brazilian.

36
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:26,243
I have some aloe vera
in the bathroom, so help yourself.

37
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,905
Wait. Where did you go?

38
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:30,643
- Clean Cheeks.
- What? They're butchers.

39
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,618
Why didn't you just go
to the Honey Pot?

40
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,255
'Cause Clean Cheeks
is the original.

41
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,618
Okay. I'm sorry,
but I don't like the idea

42
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:38,818
of a beautician
snapping on rubber gloves

43
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,656
and putting hot wax
on my pink parts

44
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,592
with a popsicle stick.

45
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,962
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

46
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,228
So you're telling me you don't wax?

47
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,930
No. It's au naturel for me.

48
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,969
But guys like it better.

49
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,040
You know what?

50
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:57,543
Once they're close enough to notice,
they don't care.

51
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,341
All right, so you keep
the hedge trimmers by the bed, then?

52
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:02,574
Oh, no, no, wait.
You help guide them in with flares.

53
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:05,217
You know what?
I'm starting to understand

54
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,844
why you guys went as pussies
for Halloween.

55
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:10,685
Cats! We're pussy cats.

56
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,426
Okay.

57
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,763
Trick or treat!

58
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,803
You are the prettiest
trick-or-treaters!

59
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,466
I have something for you.

60
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,674
Oh, my gosh.

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,872
Now, I have all kinds of sweets.

62
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,019
Just grab a bunch.

63
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,881
Thank you.

64
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:47,520
So what are you talking about?
You were...

65
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:48,458
Yeah.

66
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,463
- Check out the fireman.
- Where?

67
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:52,362
Over by the mummy.

68
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,368
- Oh, that's a good hat.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,801
I like it.

70
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,470
Jesus.

71
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,637
No, there's gonna be
tons of food at Angela's.

72
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,613
Here. Take that.

73
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,220
Hold on, now.

74
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,118
Look at that guy.
He's got to be 15 or 16!

75
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,589
- Oh, easily.
- They're giving him candy?

76
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,557
- Why are they giving him candy?
- Why do you think?

77
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,655
With that mask, he looks like
he's gonna pull a home invasion.

78
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,301
Oh, this is so wrong.

79
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,069
- Hey! That's mine!
- Asshole!

80
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:30,106
Oh, asshole!

81
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,209
He's going down.
That's it, buddy.

82
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:33,071
Going down.

83
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,441
- Whoo! Yes!
- I'm going down there.

84
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,845
We -- we got him, dude.

85
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,712
Wait for me.

86
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,382
No costume, no candy!

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,119
No costume, no candy!

88
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:52,092
No costume, no candy,
motherfucker!

89
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,123
No costume, no candy!

90
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,059
Got that?

91
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,292
Oh, my God.

92
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,497
Angela and I used to sneak out
to the Broussard mansion

93
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,039
all the time
when we were younger.

94
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,008
She used to tell me the wildest
stories about that place.

95
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,578
Are you sure this looks okay?

96
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:11,045
Yes! God, stop worrying.
You look great.

97
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,982
Besides, after a kamikaze or two,
you're not gonna care anyways.

98
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,815
- I think it's an open bar.
- Really? For $10?

99
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:19,652
Yep. Angela's been planning
this party forever.

100
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,348
How long have you known her?

101
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,949
Since high school.

102
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,689
She was a senior.
I was a sophomore.

103
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:28,765
She terrified me, but one summer
we ended up working together

104
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,299
and got to be friends at Taco Bell.

105
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,332
- Yeah.
- You worked at Taco Bell?

106
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,495
That is awesome.

107
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:37,540
No, seriously, one piece
of advice about Angela.

108
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,233
Don't let her around
any guys you like.

109
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,571
She'll go for them right away.

110
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,804
She can't help it, though.

111
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:44,143
She'll go after Dex.

112
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,648
Even Colin.

113
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,213
Really?

114
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:56,319
All right. You can do this.

115
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,124
It's crowded.

116
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,993
Way too many witnesses.

117
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,293
So, just go in there,

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,129
you say, "It's great
doing business with you,"

119
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,567
shake his hand.

120
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,730
Piece of cake.

121
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,307
Fuck.

122
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,206
Shit.

123
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,051
<i>¶ Darkness falls ¶</i>

124
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,857
<i>¶ The nightmare begins ¶</i>

125
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:37,028
<i>¶ I crawl out
from the shadows again ¶</i>

126
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,367
<i>¶ Blood will flow ¶</i>

127
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,806
<i>¶ She'll scream in pain ¶</i>

<i>¶ Let the show begin ¶</i>

129
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,560
Colin.

130
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,956
So nice to see you.

131
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,998
Yeah. Hey.

132
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,726
You too.

133
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,096
How are things?

134
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:13,500
Brave boy
coming into the lion's den.

135
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:15,439
Are you here to see Nigel?

136
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:16,704
Yeah.

137
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,402
Is he in a good mood or not?

138
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,844
I think he is very happy.

139
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,713
Nigel. Colin's here.

140
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:29,647
Go on.

141
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,962
Uh, Nigel?

142
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:46,974
I can, uh, come back
another time if you'd like.

143
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:50,409
No. You sit the fuck down.

144
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,878
Okay.

145
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,222
Are you a liar?

146
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,660
Or are you an idiot?

147
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:11,028
Look, Nige.

148
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,226
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,996
No one's willing to pay
the same price anymore.

150
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,662
That's why your cut was so low.

151
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:18,603
Answer the fucking question.

152
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:21,369
Are you a liar,
or are you an idiot?

153
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,739
I'm an idiot.

154
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:27,581
You're a smart guy.

155
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,616
You went to college, right?

156
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,949
You know anything
about economic theory?

157
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:33,818
The law of supply and demand?

158
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,892
Now...

159
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:41,828
the drug supply around here
hasn't changed,

160
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:43,899
and the demand --

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,297
Well, we're in a city

162
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,097
that was destroyed
by a fucking hurricane.

163
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,001
People are desperate,
people are unhappy,

164
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,539
they want their fucking drugs.

165
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,165
And I can make it up to you.

166
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:57,303
So there is no way
for the prices to go down.

167
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,348
Look, there's a really huge party

168
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,044
that's being thrown tonight
by Angela Feld.

169
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,381
Are you almost done?

170
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:07,182
Not yet.

171
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,659
Here's what I'm gonna supply --

172
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,888
one last chance.

173
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,227
Not a last chance to work for me --

174
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:19,096
a last chance to work,
to eat, to fuck,

175
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:20,760
to do anything else.

176
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,805
And here's what I'm gonna demand.

177
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:26,775
Twice what you usually give me
by tomorrow night.

178
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:29,607
You get arrested,
you get in a car accident,

179
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:32,807
you get into some other
unforeseen fucking tragedy,

180
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,849

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,011
<i>¶ Oh, yeah ¶</i>

355
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,523
Ohh! God damn!

356
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,223
- Are you okay?
- No. No.

357
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:31,694
What the fuck was that, Hans?

358
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:42,734
<i>¶ Out in the graveyard ¶</i>

359
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,843
<i>¶ Late one night ¶</i>

360
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:49,680
<i>¶ One with death ¶</i>

361
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>¶ Little green man

362

<i>¶ Wants to put my balls

363
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,412
- Hey.
- What?

364
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:23,174
Did you let that asshole Colin
in here?

365
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,341
What? No, you crazy?

366
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:35,552
<i>¶ I covered my package
with the both of my hands ¶</i>

367
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:43,804
<i>¶ I ran and I ran

368
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:47,602
God! She is gonna be sick.

369
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,574
Yeah.

370
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:50,508
I think the guy
in the devil costume's

371
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:52,604
counting on her passing out.

372
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,615
<i>¶ Trying to get into my underwear ¶</i>

373
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,890
<i>¶ Nowhere to run to,

374
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:11,762
<i>¶ Wants to put my balls

375
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,273
- Hey!
- Hey!

376
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,806
<i>Down the stairs. Let's go.</i>

377
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,775
<i>Let's go, guys.
Come on.</i>

378
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,969
Let's go.

379
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:28,679
<i>Time to go home.</i>

380
00:23:35,723 --> 00:23:37,748
Police!

381
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,419
Party's over!

382
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:44,065
Everybody out.

383
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:52,338
<i>Party's over,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

384
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,169
<i>Get out of the room!</i>

385
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,937
<i>Let's go!
Come on, let's go!</i>

386
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:59,445
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, lights out.</i>

387
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,139
<i>Time to go!</i>

388
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,376
<i>Everybody, party's done!</i>

389
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,888
<i>Everybody out!</i>

390
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:09,650
Stop it!
You can't do this to me!

391
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:13,858
Everybody, get out right now!

392
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,328
Where is that bitch Diana?!

393
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:35,086
Lily?!

394
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,285
Dex?

395
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,223
- Hold on. Be right there.
- Hold on.

396
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:51,829
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

397
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,460
So, uh, is the party over?

398
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,368
Yeah, there are actually
a bunch of cops down there

399
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:56,997
with guns and, like, pepper spray.

400
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:59,838
- So, let's go.
- Yeah.

401
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,586
Thanks for coming out, guys.
You guys are doing a great job.

402
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,087
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

403
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:14,289
Happy Halloween, Ms. Feld.

404
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,520
I am here legally.
I rented this place.

405
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:18,357
You didn't get a permit.

406
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:19,930
Turn the power back on!

407
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,466
I don't need a permit.
This is a private party.

408
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,101
You were charging admission.

409
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:28,795
Yes, but my business partner stole
all the door fees, so technically --

410
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,340
And I guess that makes it okay?

411
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,342
Don't even bother to answer that.

412
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:34,809
Enjoy the cleanup, my dear.

413
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,693
Oh, Angela.
Thank God.

414
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,290
Why the fuck are you still here?

415
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:57,834
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

416
00:25:58,003 --> 00:26:00,767
Does that heating grate over there
lead down to the basement?

417
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:02,635
How the fuck would I know?

418
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:05,209
Oh, dude.

419
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:07,937
What the fuck's wrong with you?

420
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:13,846
Let's do this
and get out of here.

421
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,113
Suzanne's not here?

422
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:18,115
Thought she was gonna meet us
at the car, but...

423
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,983
Angela?

424
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:23,325
Angela, I can't find the basement.

425
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:25,158
Please help me.

426
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:26,629
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,692
Please? I'll be your best friend.

428
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:29,632
Let's go.

429
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:31,327
Yes! Thank you.

430
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,841
Suzanne!

431
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:39,435
I- I passed out...

432
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:42,571
behind the go-go box.

433
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,735
Tonight's turned out
to be such a disaster.

434
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:05,202
Is this it?

435
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,738
What?

436
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,035
Seems about right.

437
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,410
Jesus, this doesn't make any sense.

438
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:15,607
I mean, aren't these pipes

439
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:18,185
supposed to lead down
to a furnace or something?

440
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,447
Just freaking dead-ends here.

441
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,989
Hell, I don't know.

442
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,116
I mean, they said there were
a bunch of rooms down here

443
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,057
left over from prohibition.

444
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:27,390
Really?

445
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,726
Yeah, in fact, there's a tunnel
to the next estate over.

446
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:31,492
It's pretty cool, huh?

447
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,931
Wait a minute.

448
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:35,831
Hey, Ange.

449
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,165
Check this out.

450
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:39,636
Dude, I think this is a door.

451
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,935
What?

452
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,566
Yeah.

453
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,009
Here, help me
move these shelves.

454
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,171
What?

455
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,078
Let's get this shit off of here.

456
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:53,343
Whoa! I love it.

457
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:56,423
This is officially my dream house.

458
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,859
Oh, whoa.

459
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,432
Those aren't...

460
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:06,262
They are, aren't they?

461
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:14,400
What the fuck?

462
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:17,607
Hey, guys! There are bodies
in the basement!

463
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,347
You guys,
I think we should call the police.

464
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,945
That's not gonna work.
We don't get service out here.

465
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,820
I haven't got a text message
all night.

466
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,415
I think I'm gonna be sick.

467
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,290
Isn't this obvious?

468
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,953
These have got to be
the people that disappeared

469
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:36,395
from Evangeline's party.

470
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,398
Whoa.

471
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,358
Sweet!

472
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:43,569
Oh, my God, Colin.

473
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,607
Don't worry, Maddie.
I'm out of here.

474
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:48,935
Bye, you guys.

475
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,782
Come on, Angela.
Fess up.

476
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,875
You set us up tonight
just like with the mirror.

477
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,750
You guys,
this room was sealed off.

478
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,856
Is that a gold tooth?

479
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,961
Ooh! It bit her!

480
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:17,971
Probably a reflex thing.

481
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,110
Okay, guys.
The fucking gate is locked.

482
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:29,514
Ange, please tell me
you have the goddamn keys.

483
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,053
Um, yeah, they're --
they're upstairs in my bag.

484
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:33,018
Just go grab 'em.

485
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,853
Oh, fuck.

486
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:37,851
Um, let's get out of here.

487
00:29:39,263 --> 00:29:40,958
I'll be right behind.

488
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:42,497
It's the creepiest shit
I've ever seen.

489
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,726
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

490
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,301
We'll go now.
That was weird.

491
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,234
This is just too fucking weird.

492
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,931
Piece of shit, man!

493
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:19,594
Maybe the lock's
on the other side or something.

494
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,035
No, no. I already tried.

495
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,628
Okay, this is no good.

496
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,867
You know, the police probably
closed it when they left,

497
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,740
and it must have locked
automatically.

498
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,472
Know what we need now?
A drink.

499
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,483
Come on. Let's go.

500
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:35,879
What's going on with you?

501
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:37,547
You don't want to know.

502
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,784
I'm fucked.

503
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,065
Stuck here all night.

504
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,365
Is there any alcohol?

505
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:54,940
Drink, drink, yes!

506
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:07,483
Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

507
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:08,885
Fuck...

508
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,919
...this.

509
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,996
Guess we're gonna be
spending the night.

510
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:18,393
Vodka or gin?
What do you want?

511
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,159
Thanks, bro.

512
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,899
Guys...

513
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,436
I got it.
The bodies in the basement...

514
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:28,404
The way they're all arranged...
It's got to be black magic.

515
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,839
Oh, come on.

516
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,876
No, no, no. It fits perfectly
with the full story.

517
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,471
You see, there was one survivor
left that night.

518
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:37,175
Evangeline's maid.

519
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:38,547
When the cops came
in the morning,

520
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,678
they found her up in her room,
and she'd gone crazy.

521
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,313
She wrote all kinds of shit
all over the walls --

522
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:44,619
spells, story, everything.

523
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:54,828
You see, Evangeline Broussard
was in love with Louis Devereaux.

524
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:56,837
But he didn't love her.

525
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:01,306
She was so desperate
that she turned to love spells.

526
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:05,778
She started practicing
all kinds of magic, voodoo,

527
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:07,472
witchcraft, hoodoo.

528
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:10,846
And somehow by accident,
she got in touch with evil spirits.

529
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,384
They tricked her.

530
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:14,512
They told her if she invited Louis
and some friends over

531
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,783
for a Halloween séance
that he'd fall in love with her.

532
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,954
But they had other plans.

533
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:22,319
Everything started fine,

534
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,264
and then something went
very, very wrong.

535
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:31,603
By the end of the night,
six people had vanished,

536
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:34,334
Evangeline was dead,
and the maid had lost her mind.

537
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:36,410
All because of the evil spirits.

538
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,138
That's what the maid said.

539
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,012
But you know what?

540
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,177
Evangeline probably
just butchered them.

541
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:48,513
Or sacrificed them.

542
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:49,953
Let me hit that.

543
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,356
Yeah. Sure.

544
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,894
I don't know what else
we're gonna do all night.

545
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,259
Hey, are you okay?

546
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:04,268
Angela, you don't look so good.

547
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,599
Skeleton bite.

548
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,708
Come on!
It's not a skeleton bite.

549
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:11,809
I'm sorry.

550
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:14,007
I- I think I need to find a bathroom.

551
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:21,417
Hey.

552
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:24,383
Totally weird.

553
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,125
You're all playing games?

554
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:31,863
Good.

555
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,520
- Come on.
- Join us.

556
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,030
Yeah.

557
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:38,668
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

558
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,670
7.

559
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,535
Perfect.

560
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,144
All right.
You're up.

561
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:48,439
- My turn?
- Yep.

562
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:55,811
Yes!

563
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,480
Oh, you're excited
about two girls kissing?

564
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:00,318
That's so predictable.

565
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,450
Yeah, Lily, it's also eternally great.

566
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,160
I wish you didn't look so stupid.

567
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:07,789
Well, at least my boobs
aren't hanging out.

568
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,828
- Slut.
- Come here.

569
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,472
Yeah!

570
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,074
Yeah!

571
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,279
Yuck! You taste all boozy!

572
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:25,349
God, you know
what really sucks, man?

573
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,145
There's fucking dead bodies
downstairs,

574
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,016
and you guys are playing
fucking spin the bottle.

575
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:32,251
Yeah, well, light as a feather,
stiff as a board comes next.

576
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:34,018
And I don't think
the bodies are going anywhere.

577
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:35,456
You know,
they've probably been there

578
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,928
since before our parents
were born, so...

579
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:41,124
Fuck it. I can't get out.

580
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,293
So Nigel can't get in, right?

581
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:46,463
Come on, Colin.

582
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:48,836
- Uh... I'm up?
- Yep.

583
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,878
- Oh, my --
- I want to see some guy-on-guy.

584
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,178
- No way.
- Come on! Fair is fair.

585
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:00,514
Whatever. You're chicks.

586
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,316
You can get away with it.
It's different if you're a guy.

587
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:03,549
That's a good point.

588
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:05,147
Oh, what are you, homophobic?

589
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:06,851
- Oh, shut up.
- Rules are rules.

590
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,860
- Come on. Just do it.
- Your turn. Pucker up.

591
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,760
Like a band aid.
Just do it. Come on.

592
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,389
- Come on.
- Whatever.

593
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,329
Whip it out.

594
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,528
Whatever. Fine. Fine.
On 3.

595
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,006
1...

596
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,675
2...

597
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:26,245
21/2...

598
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:27,581
Oh, come on!

599
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,278
Let's go.

600
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:30,613
Shit.

601
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:32,515
- Come on.
- Go.

602
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:34,519
3.

603
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,388
No tongue?

604
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,928
Congratulations.
You are officially gay.

605
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm gonna dinghy myself.

606
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,081
Oh, shit.

607
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,279
I swear, I didn't --

608
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,958
Yeah!

609
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:18,698
Dex?

610
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,139
You and I need
to go have a talk.

611
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,868
Yeah, sure.

612
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,012
So... you're a good kisser.

613
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:42,152
You have no idea.

614
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,451
Dex, I'm really --

615
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:46,620
I am so sorry.

616
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,222
I don't mean to get jealous.
It's just --

617
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:54,292
Oh. What's wrong?

618
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:55,428
I just got this...

619
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,373
Are you okay?

620
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,445
It's hot.

621
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,824
Come over here.

622
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,492
I can make you feel better.

623
00:38:56,602 --> 00:39:00,060
It sucks that the party
got shut down, Ange.

624
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,234
Drink.

625
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,939
I think that's a little much
for just me.

626
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,247
Drink. I want to get lucky.

627
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,879
Oh, my God.
This fucking blows.

628
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,584
There's got to be another gate
somewhere, right?

629
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,690
Nope.

630
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,592
Looks like you're staying here
tonight.

631
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,254
Oh, yeah.

632
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,128
Yeah, Colin.

633
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:35,206
There probably is
another gate somewhere.

634
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:36,775
Why don't we go look for it?

635
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,901
Yeah, I think you're right.

636
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:40,206
- Okay.
- Would you -- ?

637
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:41,143
Sorry.

638
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:59,161
Hello.

639
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,133
Want some?

640
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,039
Sure.

641
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:26,748
Okay.

642
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,828
Um, you know what?
I'm just -- uh...

643
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:39,734
Uh, wait up, guys.
I'm -- I'm coming with you.

644
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:29,451
Baby?

645
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:32,185
Baby, whoa, if you're gonna
put it in there,

646
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:34,124
you're gonna need to use
one of those --

647
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:37,957
What was that?

648
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,761
I think it was over in those bushes.

649
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:42,029
No. It came from the house.

650
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:45,038
It's just the stereo, guys. Chill.

651
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,267
God.

652
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:07,825
<i>¶ She's in love with herself ¶</i>

653
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:11,322
<i>¶ She likes the dark ¶</i>

654
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:19,901

00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:41,762

I'm -- I'm sorry.

668
00:43:30,048 --> 00:43:33,017
Ange, I think I've had
a little too much to drink.

669
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:35,210
No, you didn't.

670
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:41,355
<i>¶ You can't go out
'cause your roots are showing ¶</i>

671
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,655

00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:48,061
I'm sorry, Ange. I --

<i>¶ Loving you ¶</i>

674
00:43:56,374 --> 00:43:59,832
<i>¶ Loving you ¶</i>

675
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:15,824
I should've stayed, man.
She was all over me.

676
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:16,986
Who -- Angela?

677
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:18,824
Dude, she was all over everyone,
brother.

678
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,900
What was I thinking?
I could've fucked her.

679
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:24,635
Shit.

680
00:44:24,737 --> 00:44:26,432
So, how has everything been?

681
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,031
I don't know, man.
Same old shit, different day.

682
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:31,610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

683
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,008
Are you seeing anyone?

684
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:35,213
Oh, me?

685
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:36,112
No.

686
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:39,979
My life is way too fucked up
for that shit right now, man.

687
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:41,781
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, definitely.

688
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:42,685
Okay.

689
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,281
There's no other gate, guys.

690
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:51,095
Face it. There's no other exit.
We've been around it twice.

691
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:53,028
That doesn't fucking
make any sense, man.

692
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:55,794
Isn't that against, like,
fire codes or some shit?

693
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,029
This place is 150 years old.

694
00:44:58,137 --> 00:45:01,106
I don't think they cared
about fire codes.

695
00:45:01,207 --> 00:45:03,972
People were fucking stupid
150 years ago.

696
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:19,387
I got to take a piss.
I'll be right back.

697
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,180
- Want some help with that?
- Fuck.

698
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,186
Lily! Sorry.

699
00:45:46,354 --> 00:45:49,812
I- I didn't know you were in here.

700
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:54,461
Mm, it's all right.

701
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:05,166
Fix my whiskers?

702
00:46:07,275 --> 00:46:09,266
With this?

703
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:15,679
Lily... you okay?

704
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:17,685
Stoned or something?

705
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:26,018
Fix my whiskers.

706
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:32,597
O- okay.

707
00:46:36,673 --> 00:46:37,833
No.

708
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:40,066
Not there, silly.

709
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

710
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:47,476
W- wait a sec.

711
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:50,245
Uh, what about Dex?

712
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:04,564
What the...

713
00:47:05,836 --> 00:47:08,134
...fuck?

714
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,232
- Well, that took a while.
- Yeah.

715
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,106
Dude, there is some freaky stuff
in this book.

716
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:45,105
Freaky.

717
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,475
Yeah.

718
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,069
Uh, Lily, she, uh...

719
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:53,116
Oh, God. Did Lily and Dex
get into a fight?

720
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,718
Is she into magic?

721
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,479
Or -- or anything?

722
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:01,923
You know, like sleight of hand
and stuff?

723
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:03,552
No.

724
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:05,594
No. Okay.

725
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:07,892
Uh, she...

726
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,864
There might be something wrong
with her, then.

727
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:12,994
What? What do you mean?

728
00:48:13,105 --> 00:48:16,438
Uh, she's acting, um...

729
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:19,099
She -- she sort of took her --
her shirt off.

730
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:21,678
There w-- there was, um --
there was blood.

731
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:23,371
- And, uh...
- What?

732
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:26,313
You know what? You know what?
I- I don't want to talk about it.

733
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:27,715
Well, is she hurt?

734
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,843
I- I don't know.

735
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:30,420
Uh, I-I saw...

736
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:32,284
Um, I-I saw, uh...

737
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,119
What?! What did you see?

738
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:40,262
She stuck a lipstick in her boob,
and it fell out of her pussy!

739
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:41,297
Okay?!

740
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:47,770
She was, uh...

741
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:50,035
I swear she was right here.

742
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,677
Well, where's the blood?

743
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:54,611
It was on the floor.
It was -- it was everywhere.

744
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:55,840
Right.

745
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:58,747
Okay, I'm out of here.

746
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,013
Dude, you're freaking seeing shit.

747
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,486
She was, uh...

748
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:06,358
Lily?

749
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:13,024
Lily?

750
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:22,536
Lily!

751
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:29,977
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

752
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,210
Suzanne?

753
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:34,286
What?

754
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:37,881
Suzanne what?

755
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,468
Shit!

756
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,549
Maddie!

757
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:08,551
Ohh! Get away from me!

758
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:18,593
Go!

759
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,662
Shit!

760
00:50:20,835 --> 00:50:22,166
Fuck!

761
00:50:22,637 --> 00:50:23,763
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

762
00:50:25,073 --> 00:50:26,734
What the fuck was that?!

763
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:28,341
- Shit!
- Go, go, go, go!

764
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:34,572
Go, go! Fuck!

765
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:37,445
Shit!

766
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,154
Holy fucking crap.

767
00:50:41,323 --> 00:50:43,188
What the fuck were they, man?
Ange and Suzanne?

768
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,657
That wasn't Suzanne.
Suzanne has a fucking face!

769
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,625
Angela had fucking horns!

770
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:51,428
Fuck.

771
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:54,366
I stabbed it with a poker
all the way through,

772
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:55,628
and it didn't do anything.

773
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:57,295
- Shh!
- What the fuck were they?

774
00:50:57,405 --> 00:50:58,600
I stabbed it with a poker!

775
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,642
Would you shut the fuck up
about the goddamn poker?

776
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:04,270
Guys, guys, we have to get
the fuck out of here now!

777
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:06,176
There's no way out.
The fucking gate is locked.

778
00:51:06,282 --> 00:51:08,216
No, no, no. Remember
fucking Angela said something

779
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:10,012
about a fucking tunnel
that leads out of here?

780
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:11,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is that?

781
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:13,748
I don't fucking know, man.
Fuck!

782
00:51:13,855 --> 00:51:15,982
Maybe we should try
the fucking basement.

783
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:18,525
Yeah. Okay.

784
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:23,087
Careful. Be fucking careful.

785
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:27,698
Okay, I think it's clear.
I think it's clear.

786
00:51:27,803 --> 00:51:29,430
Okay. You go first.

787
00:51:29,538 --> 00:51:31,403
- What?
- Go.

788
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,899
Just go.

789
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,518
I don't see anything.

790
00:51:49,294 --> 00:51:51,353
Let's go. Let's go.

791
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,860
Think they got Lily, too?

792
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:56,764
It's like they're just playing
with us.

793
00:51:56,869 --> 00:51:57,995
What do they want?
One attacked us.

794
00:51:58,103 --> 00:51:59,263
The other just stood there.

795
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:01,771
Dude, why the hell are you being
so goddamn logical?

796
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:04,502
None of this
makes any fucking sense!

797
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,374
Get something to fight them with.

798
00:52:21,393 --> 00:52:22,621
I'm sorry.

799
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:33,504
Check it out. Check it out.
Check it out.

800
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:35,333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

801
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,066
Do you think it works?

802
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:39,870
You're a drug dealer.

803
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:41,535
Aren't you supposed to know
shit like that?

804
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:44,343
You guys, we have to go.
We have to find the tunnel!

805
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:49,149
Bitch.

806
00:52:49,288 --> 00:52:51,779
- It looks like it's in okay shape.
- How do you know?

807
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,125
Paintball.

808
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:02,223
Go, go, go, go, go!

809
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,731
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

810
00:53:03,901 --> 00:53:05,596
The fucking door! Please.

811
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,528
Hurry. Hurry!

812
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:11,403
Oh, fuck.

813
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:14,034
Oh, man.
What the fuck, man?!

814
00:53:14,145 --> 00:53:16,273
There's no fucking tunnel
down here!

815
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:18,111
You led us
into a fucking deathtrap!

816
00:53:18,283 --> 00:53:20,547
Dude, I'm sorry, okay?
I was reacting on instinct.

817
00:53:20,652 --> 00:53:22,677
Wait, you guys, why are there
only two skeletons?

818
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:23,846
Weren't there six before?

819
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:24,945
What?

820
00:53:25,157 --> 00:53:28,217
Dude, it's a fucking dead end.
Man, we're looking for a tunnel.

821
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:32,196
A way out, as opposed
to this fucking stuck in a closet.

822
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:33,992
It's not a closet!
It's a fucking pantry!

823
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,794
Guys!

824
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:37,300
Maybe if "pantry" is French
for "fucking deathtrap"!

825
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:40,032
Guys, will you shut the fuck up
and look down?!

826
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,669
Yeah.

827
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:49,505
- God!
- Okay.

828
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:01,785
Okay.

829
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:17,642
Okay!

830
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,732
I've got this, okay?

831
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:43,397
You go first.
You've got the gun.

832
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:49,436
Let's do it.

833
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:51,603
Let's go.

834
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:13,233
Can't you see
how far down it goes?

835
00:55:13,368 --> 00:55:16,565
Dude, I can't see a freaking thing.

836
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:40,993
- No. No way.
- What?

837
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:42,324
Oh, shit.

838
00:55:42,499 --> 00:55:44,558
Another fucking dead end.

839
00:55:44,735 --> 00:55:46,565
I thought this was the way out.

840
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:49,263
It's supposed to be, man.

841
00:55:49,438 --> 00:55:51,531
It looks like this just happened.

842
00:55:51,707 --> 00:55:53,470
Please, can we get out of here?

843
00:55:54,277 --> 00:55:56,905
Okay. We got to go back.

844
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:11,258
Bring the light over here.
Come on.

845
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:12,658
Can you see?

846
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:14,194
Yeah.

847
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:23,836
Jason!

848
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:32,281
Shit!

849
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,180
They're on the ceiling!

850
00:56:35,587 --> 00:56:39,523
Out! Get out! Get out!
We have to get out!

851
00:56:51,435 --> 00:56:53,198
Oh, fuck!

852
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:56,505
Coming!

853
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:58,164
Give me that!

854
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,857
What the hell?!

855
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:23,333
Go! Go!

856
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,288
Come on. Come on!

857
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:51,293
Go, go!

858
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:52,763
Go to the ladder!

859
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,062
Shit.

860
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:00,304
Hurry up!

861
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:04,805
- Come on!
- Shut it!

862
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,879
Shut the door!

863
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:09,605
Lock it!

864
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:14,877
Come on, Maddie!

865
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,887
- Please!
- I'm trying!

866
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:27,593
Oh, my God!

867
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:29,030
Oh, did you see those things?!

868
00:58:29,136 --> 00:58:32,866
Yeah, dude! The bullets
didn't do a damn thing, man!

869
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:35,167
Rust, the rust -- it did something.
Did you notice that?

870
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:36,970
Their skin, it was like... ssss!

871
00:58:37,711 --> 00:58:39,702
- Aah!
- Oh, God, no!

872
00:59:10,312 --> 00:59:11,177
Fuck!

873
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,052
Come on!

874
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,685
Come on!

875
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:34,167
Come on!

876
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,705
Come on! Keep going!

877
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,481
Go, go, go, go!

878
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:01,754
Where are they?

879
01:00:02,463 --> 01:00:03,460
Move!

880
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:08,468
Hey, how's your leg?

881
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,162
It fucking hurts!

882
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,034
Hey!
We have to put pressure on it.

883
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,110
Okay.

884
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:22,149
- Ohh, fuck, Maddie!
- Sorry. Sorry.

885
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:25,150
- Ohh, fuck!
- Sorry.

886
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:28,682
Hey, guys.

887
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,421
What is this?

888
01:01:00,693 --> 01:01:01,921
Wow.

889
01:01:03,128 --> 01:01:05,722
That is a lot of text.

890
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:06,991
What's it say?

891
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:09,124
I don't know.

892
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:11,761
I think it starts here.

893
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:14,097
These symbols are spells.

894
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:16,173
We're safe if we stay in this room.

895
01:01:16,274 --> 01:01:18,572
They can't come in here.

896
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:23,970
Apparently, those things
that got Lily and the others...

897
01:01:24,082 --> 01:01:25,777
are demons.

898
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,079
They're "treacherous tricksters,
"imps of the perverse."

899
01:01:29,188 --> 01:01:31,713
"They delight in deception
and revel in lies,

900
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:33,155
spreading depravity" --

901
01:01:33,259 --> 01:01:36,558
Uh, okay.
So, they're demons.

902
01:01:37,596 --> 01:01:40,064
What the hell do they want?

903
01:01:40,232 --> 01:01:42,996
Death, chaos.

904
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:45,935
They want to turn our world
into hell's playground.

905
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:49,472
You know,
sun as dark as sackcloth,

906
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:53,204
lakes of liquid fire, plagues,
the dead walking the earth,

907
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:55,303
that kind of thing.

908
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:57,541
Yeah.

909
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,811
But first, they need to be freed.

910
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:01,944
Okay, you guys.

911
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:03,315
This is gonna sound crazy,

912
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:08,120
but eons ago,
these demons defied divine law

913
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,490
and tried to take the place
of the devil.

914
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,219
As a punishment,

915
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,958
they were bound together
and cast out of hell.

916
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:19,030
But there's always a loophole.

917
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:21,868
If demons could possess
seven people

918
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:24,408
over the course
of one Halloween night,

919
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,035
they'd be free.

920
01:02:27,146 --> 01:02:29,637
And that's where
Evangeline came in.

921
01:02:34,153 --> 01:02:36,122
When she was practicing spells,

922
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:38,315
these were the demons
she contacted.

923
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:42,689
They tricked her into inviting
people over for a séance.

924
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:45,956
The demons just needed
seven bodies,

925
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:48,726
and as soon as the ritual started,

926
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:51,064
they started possessing people.

927
01:02:51,172 --> 01:02:53,333
Once one person had turned,

928
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:55,532
all they had to do
was kiss or bite someone

929
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:58,203
to possess all the rest as well.

930
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:01,177
Soon, six people turned into demons.

931
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:03,181
And they only needed one more.

932
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:06,547
But they can't use a dead body,

933
01:03:06,653 --> 01:03:09,486
only a living one.

934
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:12,888
So when Evangeline realized
she wouldn't make it till dawn...

935
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,227
...she killed herself

936
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:26,238
to keep the demons from getting out.

937
01:03:27,842 --> 01:03:29,833
So...

938
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:32,412
There it is.

939
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:36,506
Um... I don't understand something.

940
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:39,780
What kind of demon
gets cast out of hell?

941
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,218
These ones.

942
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:43,414
They were bad-ass.

943
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:46,254
They couldn't even follow
hell's rules.

944
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:50,162
So... we're the only thing
standing between them

945
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:52,427
and the end of the world.

946
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:54,400
- That's awesome.
- Yep.

947
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,935
And Jason was right.

948
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:58,265
They really don't like
the rusted iron.

949
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,634
Yes.

950
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:01,974
Told you.

951
01:04:02,077 --> 01:04:04,841
Well, come on.
I mean, that's completely random.

952
01:04:04,946 --> 01:04:06,470
No, not really.

953
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,742
Demons are made
from ancient elements.

954
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,978
Iron's an ancient element.
Rust corrupts it.

955
01:04:12,154 --> 01:04:16,921
So, you put the two together,
and demons don't like it.

956
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,427
That makes sense.

957
01:04:19,528 --> 01:04:22,964
Well, whether I want
to believe this or not,

958
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:27,025
I mean, these bastards
want to kill us, right?

959
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:30,105
So, we don't really have any choice.

960
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:31,900
Yeah.

961
01:04:32,008 --> 01:04:34,806
They only have tonight.
Halloween.

962
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:37,607
It gets light at 6:00.

963
01:04:38,816 --> 01:04:41,148
We wait until dawn.

964
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:55,479
Guys! Wake up!

965
01:06:56,022 --> 01:06:57,717
Wake up!

966
01:07:07,968 --> 01:07:11,768
You know, I-I didn't -- I didn't...

967
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:15,206
Holy shit!

968
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:19,606
You can't come in here.

969
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:23,477
The spells on the walls
keep you out.

970
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:28,818
Oh, there are ways.

971
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:32,451
There are always ways.

972
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:44,728
You still have a thing
for him, don't you?

973
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,465
I have a thing for him, too.

974
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:51,745
I'm gonna poke
his pretty brown eyes out

975
01:07:51,912 --> 01:07:52,901
and fuck his brains out

976
01:07:53,014 --> 01:07:55,141
until they're spilling
out of his ears.

977
01:07:55,249 --> 01:07:58,184
And right before
he takes his last gasp,

978
01:07:58,286 --> 01:08:01,187
right before he becomes one of us...

979
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:04,584
...he shall know the place

980
01:08:04,693 --> 01:08:09,858
where ecstasy and suffering
become one.

981
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,465
Shut up, bitch.

982
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:13,992
Oh, shit, I'm awake. I'm awake.

983
01:08:14,003 --> 01:08:16,066
- What was that?
- Angela.

984
01:08:17,507 --> 01:08:19,805
We were right about the spells.
She couldn't get in.

985
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,877
- Oh.
- Angela was here?

986
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:24,003
But it's okay. We're safe.

987
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,081
How's your leg?

988
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:28,742
It's okay.
She was just fucking with us.

989
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,546
I think I'll live.

990
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,745
I don't feel so good, though.

991
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:35,982
Can l... get you water
or something?

992
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:37,649
No, I'm okay.

993
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,851
Guys.

994
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,360
Guys?

995
01:08:41,463 --> 01:08:45,661
Is it my imagination,
or is it getting light out?

996
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:49,129
Yeah.

997
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:52,364
It's gonna be morning soon.

998
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,600
Thank God.

999
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:56,869
Oh, hey.

1000
01:08:56,978 --> 01:09:01,711
So, we just, like,
sit around here one more hour,

1001
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:03,307
and then we're golden.

1002
01:09:03,418 --> 01:09:06,012
Yeah.
I think we're home free.

1003
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:07,520
Yeah.

1004
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:09,350
We rock! We did it!

1005
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:14,195
Yes! We kicked their asses.

1006
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:15,892
Yeah!

1007
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:17,430
Yeah!

1008
01:09:18,134 --> 01:09:19,158
Uh, guys?

1009
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:22,102
The walls.

1010
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:29,410
Shit.

1011
01:09:29,578 --> 01:09:31,671
Is that blood?

1012
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:35,708
But they can't get in, right?

1013
01:09:35,817 --> 01:09:37,307
You said they can't get in.

1014
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:42,152
It's washing away all the symbols.

1015
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:44,791
Oh, my God.

1016
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:48,827
Oh, shit!

1017
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,002
They're coming in here!

1018
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:55,299
We gotta put 'em back!
Put the symbols back up there!

1019
01:09:55,473 --> 01:09:56,838
We have nothing to write with!

1020
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:57,999
A pen! We need a pen!

1021
01:09:58,109 --> 01:10:00,236
I don't have a fucking pen! Fuck!

1022
01:10:03,882 --> 01:10:04,780
Any luck?

1023
01:10:04,949 --> 01:10:05,938
No!

1024
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,713
Ah! Ah! Charcoal! Charcoal!

1025
01:10:29,441 --> 01:10:31,432
We have to keep going!

1026
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:14,047
Oh, my God!

1027
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,177
It worked. It worked!

1028
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:25,662
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

1029
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:27,855
What a nightmare.

1030
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,534
I think it's over.

1031
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,570
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

1032
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,166
I think they're gone.

1033
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:40,574
- Oh.
- I don't know.

1034
01:11:40,746 --> 01:11:42,647
Do you really think so?

1035
01:11:42,816 --> 01:11:44,249
I don't know.

1036
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,415
We made it.

1037
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:53,621
Yeah.

1038
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:58,827
I'm gonna go take a peek.

1039
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:08,266
All right.

1040
01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:10,840
Okay.

1041
01:12:11,778 --> 01:12:14,008
Be careful.

1042
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,140
I don't see anything.

1043
01:12:43,578 --> 01:12:45,239
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1044
01:12:45,413 --> 01:12:47,904
Okay. Okay.

1045
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:50,678
Grab anything with rust on it.

1046
01:12:57,894 --> 01:13:00,624
Ah, this ought to do it.

1047
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:03,864
Let's hurry up.

1048
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:19,774
I think we're okay.

1049
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,041
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:23,117
What about the gate?
You think we can get out?

1051
01:13:23,218 --> 01:13:24,776
No, it's probably open.

1052
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:28,322
I mean, the demons were the ones
that locked us in.

1053
01:13:28,423 --> 01:13:31,222
We'll be okay.

1054
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:33,287
Oh! I'm okay.

1055
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,076
Ow, fuck.

1056
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:56,712
Something's not right.

1057
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:01,520
Hold on.

1058
01:14:07,363 --> 01:14:08,557
What the hell?

1059
01:14:10,366 --> 01:14:11,924
What's going on?

1060
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:14,536
What's happening?

1061
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:16,764
It's -- it's a trick!

1062
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,567
You guys, it's still fucking night.

1063
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:25,105
Fuck.

1064
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,882
