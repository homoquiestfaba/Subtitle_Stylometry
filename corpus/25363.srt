1
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:43,087
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.
Let me see.

2
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,840
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. We were waiting for Zorro.

3
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,083
- Go home, muchachos.
- Do you think he's going to come?

4
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,320
Someone thinks he will.

5
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,323
Joaquin, Alejandro, once
I carved coffins for your parents.

6
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,529
I'd hate to carve ones for you.
Now, go!

7
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,082
Alejandro, Joaquin,
get back to the mission.

8
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,442
Don Montero, why are you still here?

9
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,727
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.

10
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,963
Santa Anna's three miles
from the town. You have to go now.

11
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,203
The government of Spain
would like to thank you.

12
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,123
This land is the property of Spain.

13
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,523
It will be the property of Mexico
unless I hand them over to you.

14
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,925
Santa Anna will respect the claims
of you and the dons.

15
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:28,280
The rest I have divided equally
among the other dons.

16
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,799
Get the children out of the plaza.

17
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,724
The children should not have to see
the things we do.

18
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,162
I want to see!
Put me down.

19
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,926
Zorro?

20
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,760
I saw him.
I saw Zorro. Come on.

21
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,049
- Who are these men?
- Who are they? No idea.

22
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,246
Three peasants.

23
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,680
Where is he?

24
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,806
Come on.

25
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,647
My thanks to you, gentlemen.

26
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,764
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm missing my own party.

27
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,486
Kill him!

28
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,684
You would murder them to capture me?

29
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,162
I would murder 1 00 innocent men
if it meant killing you.

30
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,324
Three men, three cuts.
A memento of Mexico, Rafael.

31
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,721
To remind you not to return.

32
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,447
Tornado, my old friend,
you are getting too old for this.

33
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,845
Yes, me too.

34
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,289
- Is she warm enough?
- I put on an extra blanket, señor.

35
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:31,327
The good prince was not afraid.
He fought off 1 00 guards.

36
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:40,080
And then, looking very handsome,
he leapt onto the balcony.

37
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,404
"Would you kill three innocent men
just to capture me?"

38
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,482
"Yes."

39
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,161
Then lightning flashed
and thunder shocked the land.

40
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,643
The evil king glared
at the good prince and said ...

41
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,080
- Something very forgettable.
- What did the good prince do?

42
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,120
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful Tornado -

43
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,967
- and raced home to his wife,
Esperanza, and his daughter, Elena.

44
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,129
Never to do anything
so foolish again.

45
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,168
She loves to hear your stories.

46
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,726
It's only the sound of my voice.
Soon she will have no time for them.

47
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,525
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

48
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,082
Esperanza ...

49
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,363
She already has your strength.
Today she broke her clay horse.

50
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:02,969
Diego ...
Diego, you promised me.

51
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,884
No more nights waiting up.

52
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,919
The Spaniards are going home.
Today is Zorro's last ride.

53
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,641
From now on we will grow
old together with our five children.

54
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,605
- Five?
- Yeah. Not enough?

55
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,921
I love you.

56
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,884
Doña de la Vega ...
Still as beautiful as ever.

57
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,125
Don Rafael, what an honour.
The governor in my home.

58
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,569
- Stay for dinner.
- I have come to apologise.

59
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,850
I am sorry that I could not protect
this country from the peasants.

60
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,727
I am sorry that I will have
to leave you without a husband.

61
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,882
Arrest him.

62
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,199
Blood never lies ... Zorro.

63
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:30,605
You are a traitor to your country
and your class. Take him away.

64
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,560
Wait.

65
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,485
No!

66
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,004
I would never have let
any harm come to her.

67
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,243
She was never yours to protect.

68
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,450
Elena ...

69
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,485
You'll live with the knowledge
that you have lost everything.

70
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,478
You'll suffer knowing that
your child should have been mine.

71
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,841
Elena!

72
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,124
Let me hold her.
Let me hold her!

73
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,123
Rafael!

74
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,686
She has her mother's eyes.

75
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,087
Rafael!
You'll never be rid of me.

76
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,200
TWENTY YEARS LATER

77
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,358
Stayed on their track
bringing them back

78
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,445
so pay the bounty now to me,
'cause ...

79
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,963
'cause .. ?

80
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,885
nobody's tough as Jack
nobody's tough as Jack

81
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,440
Now you're getting there.
Singing can lighten your load.

82
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,124
Come one, come all,
for the fright of your life.

83
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:46,126
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.
Robbers, horse thieves, -

84
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,160
- bandits, people of the worst sort.
Hey! Get out here.

85
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:59,203
Garcia.
The Murrieta brothers.

86
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,164
Get over here.

87
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,280
May l, friend?

88
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,889
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia.

89
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,885
- Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.
- When bulls start wearing bloomers.

90
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:34,400
- How much are we worth?
- All figured ... about 200 pesos.

91
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,046
200 pesos? That's it?
A lousy 200 pesos apiece?

92
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,283
- We are wasting time.
- That's 200 for the both of you.

93
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,999
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack.

94
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,204
Touch my brother again,
and I'll kill you.

95
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes, he will.

96
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:04,005
- I thought you were tied up.
- That's because you're stupid.

97
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,358
Drop it.

98
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,400
- They've got a box on the wagon.
- We know. That's why we came.

99
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:35,126
I, the legendary Three-Fingered
Jack, ain't even mentioned.

100
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:40,523
Ain't I the one
that figured to kidnap the mayor?

101
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:47,880
I am the backbone of this gang.
Without me, it would fall apart.

102
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,884
Amigos, adiós.

103
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,606
Go.

104
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,408
Get up.

105
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,687
Go.

106
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,320
Go.

107
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,323
I want you to know
I consider this an honour.

108
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,522
Bury the body. Bag the head.

109
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,246
Of course I have feelings for you.

110
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,201
Yes, yes, but quick.
Hide in the barn.

111
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,680
He's coming.

112
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:07,760
What do you want?
Please don't touch me. Who are you?

113
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,599
Don Rafael!

114
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,562
Listen to me.

115
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:17,329
If any of you is, or ever was,
that masked man known as Zorro, -

116
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,846
- reveal yourself now.

117
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,524
I'm Zorro!

118
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,884
- They took my mask ...
- Silence, you old fool!

119
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,760
I am Zorro!
I am the man you want.

120
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,203
Liar!
Anyone can see you are too tall.

121
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,039
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.

122
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,640
Did you find him?

123
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,169
He's dead.

124
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,367
Back to the boat. I need some sleep.

125
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,810
The governor has returned!

126
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,284
- Luiz ...
- Rafael, it has been too long.

127
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,525
- Too long.
- You used to favour me above all.

128
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,810
Consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

129
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,481
Come.
A crowd has gathered to greet you.

130
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,359
- Don Pedro.
- Don Rafael, welcome.

131
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,523
Don Hector.
Don Julio.

132
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,602
Gentlemen.

133
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,279
Please, please.

134
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,559
You are not happy to see me,
so let us all stop pretending.

135
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:52,169
I know that you have been paid,
even threatened, to greet me.

136
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,648
I understand exactly how you feel.

137
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,600
Why should you care
about any of your leaders?

138
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:08,079
The Spaniards oppressed you,
the Mexicans ignored you.

139
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,845
And the dons ..?

140
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,170
The dons seem content
to cheat and lie to you.

141
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,366
Who, in your entire history,
has ever helped you?

142
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,802
Zorro!
Zorro fought for the people.

143
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,201
Yes, Zorro ...

144
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,483
Where is he now, Padre,
your masked friend?

145
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,919
He hasn't shown himself in 20 years.
20 years!

146
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,325
The time has come to take
our destiny into our own hands.

147
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,923
Not as Spaniards or Mexicans,
but as Californians.

148
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,687
I stand here before you today
with no mask.

149
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,641
Only a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.

150
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,519
And you have my word -

151
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:25,482
- that I will help you fight
for an independent California.

152
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,008
Father ...

153
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,322
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

154
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,519
Thank you.

155
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,721
- I know the scent of this flower.
- It's called romneya.

156
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:09,119
But it only grows in California,
and this is your first visit here.

157
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,403
More whiskey.

158
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,400
- Or whatever you call this.
- Money first.

159
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,607
Money first.

160
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,802
Wait!

161
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,283
- What about this?
- Silver!

162
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,238
Of course, silver.
The finest.

163
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,167
- Where did you get that?
- It's none of your business.

164
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,527
Where did you get it?

165
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,766
It was my brother's.
He is dead.

166
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,922
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be sorry?

167
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,682
Don't trade it
for a mere glass of whiskey.

168
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,485
You think I could get two?

169
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,242
Who is that?

170
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,287
- The man who killed my brother.
- You're in no condition to fight.

171
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,800
Get out of my way, old man.

172
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,161
Would you care to try again ..?
You're welcome.

173
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,487
- For what?
- For saving your life.

174
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,961
- I would have killed him.
- No, he's trained to kill.

175
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:53,124
You seem trained to drink.
You would have died quickly.

176
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,839
Who then would avenge your brother?

177
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:02,880
- I have never lost a fight.
- Except to a crippled old man.

178
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,084
- What is your name?
- Alejandro.

179
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,965
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."

180
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,443
If you want to kill this man
I can teach you how to take revenge.

181
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:29,402
- And live to celebrate it.
- Why are you so eager to help me?

182
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,404
Because once, a long time ago ...

183
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,648
... you did the same for me.

184
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:56,320
I can't believe it. I never thought
that I would be standing here.

185
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:04,044
- In the lair of Zorro.
- It was devoted to his training.

186
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,682
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.

187
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:15,243
I was dead.
And we will leave it at that.

188
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,839
I remember the last time I saw you.
You were fighting 1 00 men.

189
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,885
You were the greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

190
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:39,125
Montero was the governor then.
Do you remember him?

191
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,685
Rafael Montero.
Do you remember him?

192
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,128
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

193
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,408
And he was
the sworn enemy of Zorro ... You.

194
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,086
- Montero has come back.
- Then you can kill him.

195
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,482
No, there are too many complications
for me to ignore.

196
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,683
What complications?

197
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,965
I can see we are not going
to spend much time talking.

198
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,163
Montero has some design
for California, -

199
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,039
- otherwise he would not have
hired Captain Love.

200
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,408
- We must find out what that is.
- And then what?

201
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,200
If you are ready,
we will both tempt our fates.

202
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,167
Let's go, then.

203
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,608
- Do you know how to use that?
- It goes into the other man.

204
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,286
This is going to take a lot of work.

205
00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:02,129
This is called a training circle.
It will be your world, your life.

206
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:09,560
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

207
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,564
Captain Love does not exist
until I say he exists.

208
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,007
As your skill improves you will
progress to a smaller circle.

209
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,603
Each new circle brings you
closer to retribution.

210
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,243
- I like that part.
- Shall we?

211
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,081
Slow. Attack slow.
Attack.

212
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,367
Slow. Again. Slow.

213
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,808
Slowly ... Good.

214
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,167
- Good. That is good.
- Thank you.

215
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,480
Attack.

216
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,406
Good.

217
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,084
Time for a drink.

218
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,204
Perfect. Do it again.

219
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,563
One, five, three!

220
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,605
Six, four, two!

221
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,370
And lunge.

222
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,921
Lesson number one ...
Never attack in anger.

223
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,241
Lesson number two ...

224
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,888
- Come with me.
- What?

225
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:46,648
- So what is lesson number three?
- To get to lesson number four.

226
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,967
Again?

227
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,364
- Black Andalusian. Magnificent.
- It looks like your old horse.

228
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,759
Quiet, quiet.

229
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,889
Damned horse. What are you doing?

230
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,122
I'll see you tonight.

231
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,767
Zorro, you look better than ever.

232
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,840
Be careful, señorita,
there are dangerous men about.

233
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,640
If you see any,
be sure to point them out.

234
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:52,086
Listen. I'm going to give you
the great honour of being my horse.

235
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,445
Quiet, please!

236
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,840
We are like one spirit.

237
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,600
Stop!

238
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,324
Go, go, go!

239
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,483
Get him!

240
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:45,127
Kill him.

241
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:23,001
Zorro!
The legend has returned!

242
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:10,450
- You don't know me, Father ...
- Zorro! Of course I know you.

243
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:14,683
Is it really you?
The years have been kind to you.

244
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:20,607
I have no time to talk now.
Father, please, hide me.

245
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,560
It's just like the old days.

246
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:42,718
Padre, is that you?
ls everything all right?

247
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:49,204
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe
in the house of the Lord.

248
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,838
Of course, Padre.

249
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,360
It has been three days
since my last confession.

250
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:01,560
Three days? Come back
when you've had more time.

251
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,406
- Excuse me?
- Listen, señorita ...

252
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,326
Please, go on.

253
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,564
- I broke the fourth commandment.
- Did you kill somebody?

254
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:22,963
- That's not the fourth commandment.
- Of course not.

255
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:29,729
In what way did you break
the most sacred of commandments?

256
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:36,238
- I dishonoured my father.
- Maybe your father deserved it.

257
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:42,565
- What did you say?
- I said, tell me more, my child.

258
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,679
I try to behave
the way my father would like me to.

259
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,042
- But my heart is too wild.
- Too wild?

260
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:56,726
- Yes.
- Could you be more specific?

261
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:03,602
I had impure thoughts about a man.
He wore a black mask.

262
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,204
- He had a deep voice?
- Yes.

263
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:17,929
- Ruggedly handsome?
- His face was half-covered.

264
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:22,681
But something in his eyes
captured me.

265
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:27,844
I felt warm and feverish.

266
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,683
Lustful?

267
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,686
Yes, lustful.

268
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,722
Forgive me.

269
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,846
I forgive you.

270
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,639
Look by the altar.

271
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:59,289
Search everything.
The chapel, the rectory, all of it.

272
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:05,480
- This is a house of God.
- We'll be gone when he gets back.

273
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,519
Señorita,
you have done nothing wrong.

274
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,127
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

275
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,884
Now, go.

276
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,684
Elena.

277
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:34,407
- What are you doing here?
- I was confessing.

278
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:38,324
To whom?
The priest is here.

279
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,725
Stand back, Elena. Please.

280
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,650
Out of respect for Miss Montero,
I'll deal with you later.

281
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,924
Horse! Come here.

282
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,648
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!

283
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,246
Stupido! Get over here now!

284
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:36,803
I warn you.
I'll get another horse.

285
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,119
So?

286
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,282
What do you think?

287
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:56,005
Sir, I got the black stallion,
I carved a "Z" ...

288
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,323
People know Zorro is back.

289
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:06,719
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?

290
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,482
Be careful.

291
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,166
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.

292
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,766
Zorro was a servant of the people,
not a seeker of fame like you.

293
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,444
A buffoon.

294
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,960
- Zorro did what was needed.
- Now he is needed again.

295
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:39,684
I didn't ask for your help, but I
came here to learn how to fight.

296
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,200
To have your strength, your courage.

297
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,403
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

298
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:52,928
Let me tell you something.
I am tired of your lecturing.

299
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,606
I am tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

300
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:03,800
I have my own scores to settle,
a new life to find.

301
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,805
I thought I could do it here,
but I was wrong.

302
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,164
Alejandro!

303
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,203
En garde!

304
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,087
Choose your weapon.

305
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:43,724
Montero has invited every don
in California to a banquet.

306
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:48,168
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.

307
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:56,326
- I think I do not understand, sir.
- Your skill is growing, Alejandro.

308
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:00,324
But I must give you something
which is beyond your reach.

309
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:05,524
- What is that?
- Charm.

310
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,842
And what is that?

311
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:15,367
Convince Montero
that you are a gentleman -

312
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:19,529
- and he will let you
into his circle.

313
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,083
Me?

314
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,208
A gentleman?

315
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:33,639
- This will take a lot of work.
- Yes ...

316
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:56,808
Look at me. This is the most
stupid thing I have ever done.

317
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:00,485
- I doubt that.
- We will never get away with this.

318
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:06,401
Yes, we will. A nobleman just
says one thing and thinks another.

319
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:11,365
- What if Montero recognises you?
- Montero is a true nobleman.

320
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,041
He will never look a servant
in the eye. Listen to me.

321
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:19,282
Listen to me!

322
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:26,526
Most important thing of all, do not
let the dons leave without you.

323
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:32,363
- Good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

324
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:36,842
Stand up straight.
Charm.

325
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:40,559
Charm.

326
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:01,919
Don Rafael Montero?
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

327
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:06,999
The formal Spanish greeting.
I have not seen that in years.

328
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:11,482
- My father was very strict.
- Who is your father?

329
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:17,566
- Don Bartolo del Castillo.
- Unfortunately, I've never met him.

330
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,605
I arrived last week from Spain.

331
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:27,763
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.

332
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:37,122
Queen lsabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.

333
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,441
Very impressive.
What brings you here?

334
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:47,448
I heard you were back in California,
and the Queen speaks highly of you.

335
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:56,808
I thought I fell out of favour with
the court when California was lost.

336
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,598
Only in certain circles.

337
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:11,203
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were no fault of yours.

338
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:16,404
She told me this is still a land
of opportunity for a man of vision.

339
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:22,202
- And you are a man of vision?
- I am a man in search of a vision.

340
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:30,960
But my timing is unfortunate.
Perhaps I could call again?

341
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,205
No, it would honour me
for you to join us.

342
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:39,203
No, it would honour me.

343
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:44,165
Please allow me to introduce
my daughter, Elena.

344
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,404
Charmed.

345
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:58,569
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess, but wait a moment.

346
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,887
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

347
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:22,082
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Señorita. Caballero.

348
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,803
Don Alejandro.

349
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:55,569
- We would like you to join us.
- I would be delighted, señorita.

350
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,727
Ah, Don Alejandro.

351
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:16,721
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

352
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:22,999
This is Captain Harrison Love.
Not a don, but a kindred spirit.

353
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:29,126
Are you not the man
who was chasing a legendary bandit?

354
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,640
- He was hardly legendary.
- Was he caught?

355
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:38,686
- It's only a matter of time.
- The bandit may have escaped.

356
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:43,480
But the rest of us will think twice
before going to confession.

357
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,767
Thank you.

358
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:15,322
Don Hector, I disagree.
Until these people are free -

359
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,006
- I think we will see
many more Z's carved into walls.

360
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,563
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

361
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:30,326
I think ...
Sheep will always need a shepherd.

362
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:35,723
But not this Zorro creature.

363
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:41,123
He probably wears the mask
to hide his bald head.

364
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:48,566
- Some would call him heroic.
- Heroism, a romantic illusion.

365
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,279
- Much like nobility.
- Elena, that is enough.

366
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,681
Heroism is something to aspire to,
not sneer at.

367
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:00,645
All that shooting guns,
racing around on horses -

368
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:06,083
- gives me a frightful headache.
It's hardly the work of a gentleman.

369
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,123
What is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?

370
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:16,805
No, but increasing one's holdings
so as to provide comfort to ladies.

371
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,966
Such as yourself.

372
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:30,084
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

373
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:36,962
We are at a party, aren't we?
May I have the honour of this dance?

374
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:43,127
I would be glad to.

375
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:33,920
- Were you looking for something?
- The miraculous in everyday life.

376
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:40,126
Oh, really? Look someplace else.
We were trying to dance.

377
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:45,284
You were trying.
She was succeeding.

378
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,728
Forgive me, Captain.
A shameless joke.

379
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:55,522
I hope it will not be the last.
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.

380
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,810
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?

381
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,086
No, on the contrary.

382
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:51,766
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

383
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:23,008
That is the way they are dancing
in Madrid these days.

384
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,128
Your daughter is a spirited dancer.

385
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:32,206
"Spirited". Thank you
for putting it so delicately.

386
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:40,602
- I apologise if you're offended.
- No, no, no ...

387
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,888
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.

388
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,521
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

389
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:53,720
Don Rafael ..!

390
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,928
As an advisor to the Queen
in matters of finance, -

391
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:05,642
- it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

392
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:18,166
Join us in the courtyard. There is
something I want to share with you.

393
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:21,527
A vision.

394
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,488
Fellow dons ...

395
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:38,087
All of us can recall the years
when we ruled this country.

396
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,766
We commanded respect
and amassed a great deal of wealth.

397
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:48,562
But we never determined
our own destiny.

398
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:55,966
The time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.

399
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,883
My friends ...

400
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:05,120
I give you the independent
Republic of California.

401
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:25,564
Every man here owes you something.
The land we got made us wealthy.

402
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:30,087
But we must question your motives.

403
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:33,282
The day you arrived,
you made us look like fools.

404
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:40,407
- I was merely playing to the crowd.
- And what are you doing now?

405
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:44,324
You want us to raise arms
against Santa Anna.

406
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:51,089
- You know we couldn't defeat him.
- I wasn't suggesting a fight.

407
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,048
I was suggesting that we buy it.

408
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:59,523
Santa Anna is waging an expensive
war with the United States.

409
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:06,163
Even if we combined our fortunes
we could not buy this country.

410
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:12,405
- I already have a deal with him.
- You are living in a dream.

411
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:18,209
And why don't we all
live in the same dream together?

412
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:38,643
Meet me here tomorrow for a journey
that will lay your doubts to rest.

413
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:34,401
My friends, I give you ...
EI Dorado!

414
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:51,965
Fortunately, Santa Anna is unaware
of the existence of all his gold.

415
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:57,602
These bars have been marked
with the Spanish seal.

416
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,048
Is it becoming clearer to you?

417
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:06,726
Two days from now we will buy
this country from Santa Anna.

418
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,763
With gold dug from his own land.

419
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:25,961
- Where did you find these people?
- Anywhere we wanted.

420
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,327
Brilliant.

421
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:39,607
It's part of the mining process.
First we picked it up, now we blast.

422
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:58,890
So,
this is the future of California?

423
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,725
This is my vision, yes.

424
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:10,245
Up here.
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

425
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:15,438
Full-grown vultures
walking around like real folks.

426
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,205
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

427
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:25,605
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.

428
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:30,969
- We're just hard to find.
- Wait! You. I know you.

429
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:35,487
You bet you do, peckerwood.
I'm Three-Fingered Jack.

430
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:39,006
And you're a bunch of murderers -

431
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:43,368
- dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling doodads.

432
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,363
Ignore him. He's a common thief.

433
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:52,207
As common as they come.
But nothing compared to you.

434
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:59,526
I steal gold and money.
But you steal people's lives.

435
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:05,606
So damn you!
And damn the horse that brung you.

436
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,721
Peckerwood?

437
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,209
Is there something amusing, Captain?

438
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:12,043
Strange, I'd say.

439
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:16,920
I have twice shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

440
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:28,485
Don Alejandro!
I need to speak to you alone.

441
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:34,680
- Some other time, perhaps.
- Today. Alone.

442
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:00,167
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

443
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:03,049
Good afternoon, señorita.

444
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:08,324
- Your voice is so calming.
- He's high-spirited.

445
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:12,000
Yes, I understand.

446
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,719
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

447
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:19,360
Sometimes it seems interminable.
Sorry.

448
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:23,443
Do not worry, Bernardo.
He will not hear it from me.

449
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:28,445
Don Alejandro confuses me.

450
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:34,207
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant, so superior.

451
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:39,649
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me ...

452
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:44,167
As if he were
two completely different men.

453
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:57,686
- You look so much like your mother.
- How would you know that?

454
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:03,527
Well ... I don't see
much of Don Rafael in you.

455
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,247
My father wishes
I acted more like her.

456
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:14,689
- She was very proper.
- Is that how he describes her?

457
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:19,685
- Yes. But I don't believe it.
- She was more like you.

458
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:27,447
Perhaps.
It would be a way of knowing her.

459
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:35,123
My niñera told me that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

460
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:41,365
When I was young I sneaked out
at night and rode across Andalusia.

461
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:46,160
I would wave at the skies
so she would know it was me.

462
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,919
- How did she die?
- Giving birth to me.

463
01:19:55,890 --> 01:20:01,283
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

464
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:05,079
Yes ...

465
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:13,366
I know what it is like
to lose a loved one.

466
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,719
A daughter. Long ago.

467
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:27,205
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.

468
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:34,968
- Your mother would be proud of you.
- Thank you.

469
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:42,126
I have to ask you ...
Have we ever met before?

470
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:44,884
No, why would you think that?

471
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:51,126
It's strange ...
Your voice seems so familiar.

472
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:56,728
I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

473
01:20:56,890 --> 01:21:02,886
Of course.
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

474
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:06,759
Thank you.

475
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,922
- Good day, Bernardo.
- Good day ...

476
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,567
... Elena.

477
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:39,728
Did you know that the Compa lndians
used to cannibalise their enemies?

478
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:44,600
The eyes were most sought after.

479
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:52,000
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy is a valuable thing.

480
01:21:56,450 --> 01:22:00,523
Where are my manners? Would you
care for something to drink?

481
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:12,482
No?
A different vintage perhaps?

482
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:24,569
You're a very sick person.

483
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:31,169
Heads and hands in jars
must strike you as odd, I suppose.

484
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:35,924
You ought to fire your housekeeper.

485
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:45,759
- Who is he?
- An enemy.

486
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:52,000
He has a brother
who will share the same fate.

487
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,528
I wish you luck.

488
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:03,845
- To your health.
- Murrieta's brother or not ...

489
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:07,247
You are more than you pretend to be.

490
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:14,088
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes.

491
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:01,566
It is beautiful.

492
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:18,726
How much does it cost?

493
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:27,486
It is a gift, she says,
in honour of your mother.

494
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:36,321
- She loved your mother.
- She must be mistaken.

495
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,522
My mother died long ago in Spain.

496
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:55,205
She says you are the daughter
of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.

497
01:24:55,370 --> 01:25:01,479
She was your nanny.
She hung flowers on your crib.

498
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,439
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

499
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,523
Alejandro ...

500
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:32,963
Listen to me. Can you find
your way back to the mine?

501
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:37,123
No.

502
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,118
The windows were all covered.

503
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:45,084
- He didn't trust his own dons.
- Nor would l.

504
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:49,448
You must break into the chest
in Montero's study.

505
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:54,440
- Find out what his plans are.
- People in the mine are dying.

506
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:59,889
And all I can think of is ...
Captain Love.

507
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:04,123
He will come into your circle
soon enough.

508
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:11,681
- I miss my brother.
- Your brother's dead. Put it aside.

509
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,922
How?

510
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:23,208
How can I do what is needed
when all I feel is ... hate?

511
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:27,324
You hide it.

512
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,970
With this.

513
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:44,320
Santa Anna has agreed to
the transfer the day after tomorrow.

514
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:48,085
He insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

515
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:57,364
It's a safe distance from the mine.
I don't foresee a problem.

516
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:02,650
Tell him we agree.
You have done well, Luiz.

517
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:09,326
To the independent
Republic of California.

518
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,365
Don Rafael!

519
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:43,288
You sent men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?

520
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:55,486
- After all, it's only one man.
- It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.

521
01:27:55,650 --> 01:28:00,405
And he knows about the mine.
Otherwise he wouldn't be here.

522
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:03,642
- How could he possibly ...
- It doesn't matter how.

523
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:10,079
If Santa Anna finds out about this
he will have us butchered.

524
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:14,084
Do you understand?

525
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:21,883
Then we should destroy the evidence.
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

526
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:26,646
- And the workers?
- We destroy all the evidence.

527
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:37,566
Make sure
those papers are locked up.

528
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:55,208
Guards!

529
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:09,088
- The much-debated Zorro.
- No. The legendary Zorro.

530
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:15,803
Put down your weapons!
Tell them.

531
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:19,121
Do as he says.

532
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,209
Allow me.

533
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:35,362
Come. Stop.

534
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:38,044
Face the window.

535
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:43,041
Now, bend down and touch your toes.

536
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:46,889
Bend over!

537
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:52,964
Excuse me, Captain Love.
Thank you.

538
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,247
Kill him!

539
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,401
Good morning, señor.

540
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:49,205
- Good morning, señorita.
- Give it back.

541
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:54,763
Whatever it is you have stolen
from my father, give it to me.

542
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,080
No.

543
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,366
Come on now.

544
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:22,726
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.

545
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:27,526
I have had the proper instruction
since I was four.

546
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:20,800
Not bad.

547
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,482
Not bad at all.

548
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:50,368
This will make it more difficult.
Señorita ...

549
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:17,441
Don't move.

550
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:40,649
- Do you surrender?
- Never.

551
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:46,043
- But I may scream.
- I understand.

552
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,646
Sometimes I have that effect.

553
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:19,049
Excuse me.

554
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:23,478
Goodbye, señorita.

555
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:41,208
- What happened?
- I fought Zorro and he left.

556
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:48,003
- Did you recognise him?
- No, but he was young and vigorous.

557
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,362
- He was very vigorous, Father.
- Vigorous?

558
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:54,964
Yes.

559
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,244
Let's go!

560
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:48,408
Go!

561
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:04,319
Here. This is the canyon.
That is where the mine is.

562
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:09,484
They have 25-30 guards at most.

563
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:14,280
- Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
- I'm not going with you.

564
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:18,682
I'm not going with you.

565
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:22,968
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.

566
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:27,604
- And the prisoners?
- There's nothing more I can do.

567
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:33,242
- Nothing you will do?
- I gave my life to them.

568
01:40:33,410 --> 01:40:40,168
My wife was murdered before my eyes,
and my child was raised by my enemy.

569
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,765
Montero?

570
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:49,600
Elena ...

571
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:54,969
- She's your daughter.
- She was.

572
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:03,446
So,
you will simply take your revenge.

573
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:07,808
No, my daughter. And don't pretend
she means nothing to you.

574
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:12,964
She does. But you taught me
to see beyond personal feelings.

575
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:17,442
- Was that all a lie?
- You are too young to understand.

576
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:21,569
To understand what? Betrayal?

577
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:25,564
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?

578
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:30,804
To smile in the face of a killer
while you make your own plans?

579
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:37,329
I taught you
everything you need to survive.

580
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:41,119
Now I must look to my own heart.

581
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:46,279
Elena is all I have left.
I am not going to lose her again.

582
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:52,807
What about California?
What about the people?

583
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:56,724
They still have Zorro.

584
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:28,128
Every inch of the countryside
is covered. If he shows himself ...

585
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:34,843
- Are you all right?
- Is your army ready to fight?

586
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:38,002
- No, sir.
- Then I'm not all right.

587
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:42,800
I'm beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all.

588
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:48,567
I think my horse could run this army
better than you.

589
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:57,843
I said I'll find him.
That means I will.

590
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:04,959
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.
Go on, reach for it, Captain.

591
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:11,484
- Who are you?
- I warned you long ago, Rafael.

592
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,401
- You would never be rid of me.
- De la Vega.

593
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:25,280
- Rafael ...
- It wasn't you I saw last night.

594
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:29,204
- That was Don Alejandro.
- Yes.

595
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,282
But many
would proudly wear the mask.

596
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:37,922
Either way, events have been set
in motion that you cannot stop.

597
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:42,999
I'm not here to stop you.
Call for Elena.

598
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:50,288
Call her.

599
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:54,640
Captain ... Bring my daughter to me.

600
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:58,840
Bring her to me!

601
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:11,680
You cannot imagine
how I have dreamed of this moment.

602
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:15,729
Night and day, 20 long years.

603
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:20,168
Really?
I didn't give you a second thought.

604
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:27,520
- If I die, the truth dies with me.
- We shall see.

605
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:33,519
- Bernardo, what are you doing?
- Tell her, Rafael.

606
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:39,442
- Tell me what?
- Tell her who her real father is.

607
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:44,649
What is he saying?

608
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:52,646
This man lost a daughter once
and now he seeks to claim you ...

609
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:58,562
Tell her how her mother died.

610
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:08,046
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega.
You cannot have mine.

611
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:11,327
De la Vega ..?

612
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:15,085
A woman in town, she told me ...

613
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:19,448
Diego de la Vega?

614
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:23,398
Father?

615
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:27,688
His name is of no consequence.

616
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:34,239
I was told my niñera used
to hang something on my crib.

617
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:37,766
Yes,
she had her hang fresh flowers.

618
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:41,360
No!

619
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:53,881
Let us finish what we started
the night Esperanza died.

620
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:59,568
Drop your sword or I will have
no choice but to have you shot.

621
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:03,040
Even in the presence of my daughter.

622
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:07,120
Please.

623
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:25,044
They were flowers. Romneya.

624
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:33,285
Rafael ...

625
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:38,325
She knows.

626
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,518
Water!

627
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:17,605
Lock them up!

628
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:13,282
The fuses are burning.
Hurry it up.

629
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:19,764
Let's go!

630
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:42,963
Wait here!

631
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:54,127
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

632
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:22,367
- De la Vega.
- Rafael.

633
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:36,247
Only one question.

634
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:42,446
Really? What is that?

635
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:49,518
How would you like
your remains displayed?

636
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:19,206
- Now I'm free to kill you.
- No!

637
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:28,443
Drop the sword. Drop it.

638
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:41,766
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

639
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:06,281
Did you miss me?

640
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:31,043
Elena! Get them out!

641
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:43,719
- "M" ... for Murrieta.
- Two men. One dead.

642
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:48,644
You're doing well. Your brother
would have shot himself by now.

643
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,408
Alejandro.

644
02:00:52,930 --> 02:01:00,120
- Is it finished?
- Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.

645
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:07,605
Not for Zorro. There will be
other days, other battles to fight.

646
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:11,365
It is your curse and destiny.

647
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:16,401
My beautiful Elena ...

648
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:22,009
The world is a strange place.

649
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:28,166
- Now I'll lose you again.
- You will never lose me ...

650
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:31,888
Father.

651
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:41,446
You are like your mother.

652
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,845
Same eyes.

653
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:46,285
Same mouth.

654
02:01:46,450 --> 02:01:50,045
Same spirit.

655
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:55,524
Alejandro ...

656
02:01:57,370 --> 02:02:00,567
... Elena.

657
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:23,160
And so it was.
Lightning split the sky.

658
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:29,599
Thunder shook the air.
And then all was quiet.

659
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:36,602
The great warrior
known as Zorro was gone.

660
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:41,286
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.

661
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:47,360
They came from far and wide to
say farewell to the brave champion.

662
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:56,640
But, little Joaquin, whenever
great deeds are remembered, -

663
02:02:56,850 --> 02:03:04,165
- your grandfather will live on.
For there must always be a Zorro.

664
02:03:04,330 --> 02:03:09,404
And someday, when he is needed,
we will see him again.

665
02:03:09,570 --> 02:03:16,282
On Tornado, riding like the wind.
His sword blazing in the sun.

666
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:23,161
Leaping, jumping ...
Fighting like a lion, like a tiger!

667
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:26,003
Fighting ...

668
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:35,040
... as safely as possible.

669
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:40,085
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

670
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:47,922
Sleep tight, my son.

671
02:03:53,650 --> 02:03:59,566
When I sleep,
I will dream of Zorro.

672
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:03,120
But what face shall I give him?

673
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:09,809
He has been many different men,
but he has loved you as all of them.

674
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:17,644
How can I refuse such a man?

675
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:25,444
- Do you know where he might be?
- Zorro could be anywhere.

676
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,242
There, there, my darling.

677
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:58,409
