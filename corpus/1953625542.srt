1
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,069
What's going on? Here we go.

2
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,011
Lookie, there you go.

3
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,183
What do we have here?

4
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,186
-Oh, my goodness.
-Kneel next to Grandpa.

5
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,025
Oh, good.

6
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,691
Hey, boys.

7
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,894
Hey.
Hey, l could use some help here.

8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,801
l'll do it.

9
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,767
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on over here.

10
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,174
Mark, that one's for you.

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,506
All right, you lick and stick,
l'll keep writing.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,084
-This should look good.
-Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,021
Two, fou--

14
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,321
Look at these dishes.

15
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,696
Hey.

16
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,599
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, l could use your help.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,902
l could use your help.

18
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,005
This way-- Oh, my, look at that.

19
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,351
That's spectacular. Well done.

20
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,816
-Want the big wing?
-Yeah.

21
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,684
Get right into this.

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,508
Thank you, Santa Cruz. Good night.

23
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,711
You were really jamming, Grandma.

24
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,288
Well, that's high praise
coming from you.

25
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,084
l was wicked, though, wasn't l?

26
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,950
You were money.

27
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,061
Stephen, you're up next.

28
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,097
l wanna finish grading these papers
so l can work on my novel.

29
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,734
Family tradition, Stephen.

30
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,769
And since it's my birthday
and the Christmas season...

31
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,735
...you can't say no.

32
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,569
Remember when Grandpa
was acting out the word ''jackass''...

33
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,076
-...when we were playing Guesstures--
-Yes, l do.

34
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,407
And to this day,
l don't think it was funny.

35
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,916
But l miss him.

36
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,683
Come on, honey.

37
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,879
You know l love your voice.
You don't sing for me anymore.

38
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,648
Sing ''Up on the Housetop.''

39
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,591
Your dad sang that for you
enough times.

40
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,490
Yeah, every year.

41
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,598
Play it so l can get over to Brittany's
before she gets pissed.

42
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,327
Dude, you've been going out with her
for a couple of weeks. Chill.

43
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,501
Look, D-bag,
at least l have a girl waiting for me...

44
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,665
...not your secret stash
of <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i>

45
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,402
l'll wait till Gramms leaves
before l rip your face off.

46
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,342
Nobody's ripping anyone's face off...

47
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,278
...or going to Brittany's,
or anything else before....

48
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,678
Dad, just play.

49
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,988
Okay, l'll play.

50
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,631
Erna, this is for you.

51
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,505
<i>Erna, how l love you</i>
<i>How l love you</i>

52
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:07,271
<i>My dear young Erna</i>

53
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:12,009
<i>You mean the world to me</i>

54
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,786
That's all l got.

55
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,802
Oh, you don't have to hide it from me.
l've already had five.

56
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,608
Why does my willpower
disappear during the holidays?

57
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,142
l was doing so well.

58
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,112
No mere mortal can resist
your special thumbprint cookies.

59
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,252
l look forward to them all year.

60
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,846
You're right.
l'm giving myself a holiday pass.

61
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,248
Are you sure
l can't help you with this mess?

62
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,916
No. No, no, no, l'm good.

63
00:04:55,094 --> 00:05:00,122
-You look tired. Why don't l just...?
-Mom. Bye-bye.

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,528
l'll be at the shop by 9.

65
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,499
l'm so glad that Bolivian yarn
that you love so much came in.

66
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,936
l didn't think it would be here in time
for the holiday rush.

67
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,438
Hey, did your mom finally--

68
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,772
Oh, you found your coat.

69
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,211
Yes, l did, thank you.

70
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,375
-You're going so soon, Erna?
-Oh, you.

71
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,783
Here, let me help you with that.

72
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,153
Now practice your singing, Stephen.
Christmas is almost here.

73
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,760
-Night, you two.
-Good night.

74
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,896
Happy birthday.

75
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,490
-You are terrible.
-But you can't resist me.

76
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,135
Do you think
she had a good time?

77
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,136
How could she not?
You're the perfect hostess.

78
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,501
Tell me why the perfect hostess
lost her mind...

79
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,578
...and promised her son that he could
have a party here for his band friends?

80
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,473
What's this?

81
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,585
You know, l was gonna
talk to you about that later.

82
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,584
A pipe burst at the Ziffs' house...

83
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,656
...so they asked if we could host
the English Department party.

84
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,849
l was stuck.

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,494
Stephen, you know how swamped l am
down at the shop...

86
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,425
...since our
biggest competitor closed.

87
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,758
You know how happy l am
that it's successful.

88
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,697
Honey, l'm so far behind
with Christmas already...

89
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,962
...and to try to fit in
a department party....

90
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,438
l know it's a hectic time of year
but you always pull it together.

91
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,414
-You think?
-l know.

92
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,384
l can't believe it's our last Christmas
before the boys go off to college.

93
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,320
l want it to be really special.

94
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,894
lt will be.
Nobody does Christmas like you.

95
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,725
Oh, get a room.

96
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,236
-The Niners are up seven-zip, Dad.
-How much time's left in the quarter?

97
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,932
A couple of minutes.
The defense is shutting them down.

98
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,737
Did l tell you l needed cookies
for the football banquet?

99
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,209
No, you didn't.

100
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,072
Niners need this game.

101
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,020
l'm gonna be over at Sharon's.

102
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,063
Don't worry about the mess.
l'll get it later.

103
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,640
-Hey, Joy.
-Hi.

104
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,010
What's Stephen up to?

105
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,845
He and Jeremy
are watching some game.

106
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,886
-Why don't you go join them?
-Yes, please.

107
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,752
Maybe l will.

108
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,218
l'll see you later.

109
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,492
You said you were gonna cut back
this season.

110
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,262
l've catered these Christmas
parties for five years.

111
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,105
You need to learn how to say no.

112
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,638
Thank you for the advice, Mrs. Pot.

113
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,282
Cookies and wine, Mrs. Kettle,
the perfect combination.

114
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,111
l wish you would give me
this recipe.

115
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,150
No way. Family secret.

116
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,616
So you really have
no help with any of this?

117
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,918
From where, exactly?

118
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,660
And l broke a nail.

119
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,993
-Oh, hazard of catering?
-No, l was playing football with Ryan.

120
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,032
Jeremy talked me
into playing basketball.

121
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,601
l couldn't walk the next day.

122
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,106
l guess we should feel lucky
at this age...

123
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,469
...that they're even talking to us,
right?

124
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,837
Yeah.

125
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,942
Hey, what's going on?

126
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,746
lt's that it's the boys'
last Christmas at home...

127
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,944
...before they go to college
and there's still so much to do.

128
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,418
Stephen just sprang on me...

129
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,581
...that we're hosting the faculty
holiday party on Christmas Eve.

130
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,956
l can understand why you're upset.
l mean, that is a lot of people.

131
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,121
lf Keith did that to me
at this time of year, l'd kill him.

132
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,961
Yeah, well, you know me,
l'm usually so on top of things.

133
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,298
But l'm nowhere near
where l usually am at this point.

134
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,996
You love this time of year...

135
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,641
...and you are the most
organized person l know.

136
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,140
Yeah.

137
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,936
l just make my list.

138
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,041
You just get her done.

139
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,331
Yeah, for sure.
My house, on the 23rd.

140
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,164
Sweet. Yeah, this party's gonna rock.
All right. Later.

141
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,239
Mom, you're gonna
talk to the neighbors...

142
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,605
...let them know it might get loud
when we start jamming at my party?

143
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,938
Mark, l just cleaned.

144
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,013
-l know, the house looks great.
-Yeah, it did.

145
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:47,084
Why does no one in this house ever
use that invention called ''the dish''?

146
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,550
You're funny, Mom.

147
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,985
Wait. Wait.

148
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,059
l need you to go get the decorations
from the garage.

149
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,322
Mom, we love Christmas
and all the things you do...

150
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,694
...but don't you think
we're getting old for...?

151
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,262
Or not. Just don't forget
to talk to the neighbors.

152
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,768
Well, you don't forget to be on time.
We're getting the tree at 7:00, sharp.

153
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,574
Dad, haven't you heard
of that wonderful invention, the dish?

154
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,240
Go to school.

155
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,078
Honey, do you have your reminder?

156
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,486
Oh, l had it somewhere.

157
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,422
That's not funny.

158
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,391
There's still a lot to do...

159
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,031
...especially now with your
department party to plan.

160
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,996
Oh, by the way...

161
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,534
...Keith thinks we should invite
the graduate assistants.

162
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,604
How many more people is that?

163
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:45,608
-Well, with significant others, 1 2.
-Twelve more?

164
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,511
With the 40 we already have...

165
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,205
...l'm gonna have to borrow
more glasses and cutlery--

166
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,511
-Where's Jeremy? He's gonna be late.
-He's outside. l'll corral him.

167
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,415
All right, l'll see you later.

168
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,853
And please don't be late. We've
postponed getting the tree three times.

169
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,117
Okay.

170
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,289
lt's just there's not
that much time left.

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,696
Three, 95. Hut, hut!

172
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,902
Nice defense, Mrs. Robertson.

173
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,536
That was solid. But it's better
if you don't scream at the receiver.

174
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,642
Now do one of you two Tim Bradys
wanna help me pick this stuff up?

175
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,753
Oh, yeah.

176
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,980
l thought the season
was over anyway.

177
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,352
-Fortunately, it's never over.
-lt's never over.

178
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,118
And it's also basketball season.

179
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,660
You're gonna be playing
in some college next year.

180
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,991
l know. l can't wait.

181
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,565
Maybe we'll hear from Chapman.

182
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,793
Your dad would love
you to play in state.

183
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,597
Maybe. l'm still waiting
to hear from that Bowdoin coach.

184
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,330
-What's this?
-lt's nothing.

185
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,441
-lt's cute.
-Shut up, dude.

186
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,167
Okay, okay, all right.

187
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,403
Don't forget to buy
the new Christmas lights.

188
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,775
Ours are all worn out.

189
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,576
And be home by 7.

190
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,948
-When are we eating?
-After we get back with the tree.

191
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,181
After? Mom,
l will die of starvation by then.

192
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,723
Okay.
l'll get stuff to make a casserole.

193
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,327
You can heat it up
when you get back from school.

194
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,020
Now go to school.

195
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,393
And don't forget
to tidy up the family room.

196
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,736
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>
<i>no one should be working for.</i>

197
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,311
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>
<i>no one should be working for.</i>

198
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,918
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>
<i>no one should be working for.</i>

199
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,417
-What do we want?
-Fairness!

200
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,524
-When do we want it?
-Now!

201
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,507
--and she'll ring you up.

202
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,881
Honey, we don't have
to finish all this restocking today.

203
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,575
Oh, no, l like doing it.

204
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,584
l'm excited that the shop
is doing well.

205
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,451
l want this all done
for the open house tomorrow.

206
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,889
With all the passion
you've put into this place...

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,153
...you deserve this success.

208
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,324
l have to send Stephen
and the boys a reminder.

209
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
Hi, ladies. Hey, did that bamboo yarn
that l ordered come in?

210
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,703
We've got it right here
behind the counter, Sharon.

211
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:31,036
l have to make it to the grocery store
so l can finish off a job.

212
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,770
Oh, you can't go to the Market Place.
They're on strike.

213
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,847
l was there this morning,
l had to leave and go to The Pantry.

214
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,213
What, you left?
The store's still open, right?

215
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,978
l'm not gonna cross a picket line.

216
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,247
That's a gutsy thing
for these workers to do.

217
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,947
Especially during the holidays.

218
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,252
Well, okay, then, Norma Rae.

219
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,292
Thanks.

220
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,931
Are the ladies still dropping by
tomorrow afternoon?

221
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,431
Well, l hope so.
This place should be jumping.

222
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,035
-Okay. Bye.
-See you then.

223
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,762
Thank you.

224
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,836
Go, go, go.

225
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,882
<i>Fires it over the middle,</i>
<i>it's complete to Mason....</i>

226
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,718
<i>Cuts to the left, and at the 30</i>
<i>he's knocked out of bounds.</i>

227
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,916
What's this?

228
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,687
Oh, yeah. Mom said
she was gonna leave us some bites.

229
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,366
-Smells good.
-We'll eat it later.

230
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,304
-Hey.
-Thanks.

231
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,891
Of all the times
for the server to go down....

232
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,794
You can't get an extension
from your editor?

233
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,164
l already got one. l gotta e-mail
him or l'm gonna miss the deadline.

234
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,974
l just can't stop tweaking.

235
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,700
Where's the lT guy?

236
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,505
l don't know why you write fiction.

237
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,841
You should come back
to the dry academic stuff.

238
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,506
lt's a lot less stressful.

239
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,414
Believe me, l'm tempted.
These deadlines are killing me.

240
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,377
Go home, e-mail it from there.

241
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,552
You know what? That's a good idea.

242
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,855
l think.... Yeah, l should have
just enough time.

243
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,520
Then, come over for a beer.

244
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,690
Oh, can't tonight. We gotta go
get the Christmas tree.

245
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,269
Mark? Jeremy?

246
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,310
How long has this been out?

247
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,919
Thank God you're home. How do you
reset the wireless air port? lt's offline.

248
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,565
l need to e-mail my revisions
before the deadline.

249
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,294
-Why don't you ask one of the boys?
-Mom, l saw you drive up.

250
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,769
l forgot to have you sign the
consent form for the basketball trip.

251
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,204
l won't be able to play
in the tournament.

252
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,606
-Well, you could have asked your dad.
-Mom!

253
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,941
l've got a date with Brittany tonight.
Have you seen my blue shirt?

254
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,049
-lt's in the laundry.
-The wireless?

255
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,276
-Mom! Mom!
-Mom! Mom!

256
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,217
Okay, enough.
Everybody, calm down.

257
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,751
l gotta hurry.

258
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,590
l'll steam your blue shirt,
it should be fine for tonight.

259
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,629
Okay, l'll finish getting ready.

260
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,131
Wireless gets knocked out
if there's a power surge.

261
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,633
Joy.

262
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,271
Just disconnect it for one minute,
it will reset.

263
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,907
Okay.
Oh, l've gotta head back to work...

264
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,838
...to finish grading the finals.

265
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,639
-What about the tree?
-l can't tonight, honey. Sorry.

266
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,440
The decorations?

267
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,816
This mess....

268
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,614
-Thanks.
-Good night.

269
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,056
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

270
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,520
Hey, hey, merry Christmas,
Mrs. Robertson.

271
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,688
Merry Christmas.

272
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,701
-Do you need any help?
-No, not yet, thank you.

273
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,394
Okay.

274
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,164
Where's the family this year?

275
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,970
Yes, that is a very good question,
Mr. Gregory.

276
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,841
Okay, well, if you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

277
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,483
-Okay. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

278
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,725
Market Place is unfair.

279
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,594
-Yeah.
-We want fair pay.

280
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,862
-Where did all the money go?
-Market Place is unfair.

281
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,872
We want our benefits back.

282
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,376
Fair wages and benefits.

283
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,843
Fairness. Fair pay.

284
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,609
-Market Place is unfair.
-Fair wages.

285
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,847
Thanks for helping me.

286
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,113
Oh, l'm glad to.

287
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,486
But l thought you always went
with the whole family to get the tree.

288
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,684
Yeah, well none of them
were available.

289
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,886
Why not?

290
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,794
Oh, girls, basketball,
and publishing deadlines.

291
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,630
You shouldn't have gone
by yourself.

292
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,440
lf l don't do it, it doesn't get done.

293
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,671
What?

294
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,140
No, it's just that tomorrow
is the Knittery's holiday open house...

295
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,011
...and l still have to make muffins.

296
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,812
Well, don't make them.

297
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,147
But it's the holidays...

298
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,313
...and everybody likes having
homemade stuff during the holidays.

299
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,515
Yeah.

300
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,890
l don't know if l can make Christmas
happen if l don't get some help soon.

301
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,242
What was the score
on the Warriors game?

302
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,744
They upset the Celtics 98-9 7.

303
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,312
-Curry hit a three with two seconds left.
-Nice.

304
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,180
What are you doing?

305
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,989
What's the matter?

306
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,886
Don't you dare.

307
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,586
-Chill, Mom.
-You ate almost all of these.

308
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,161
There's still some for you.

309
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,299
Didn't you see the note
that l put on them?

310
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,058
What note?

311
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,104
This note.

312
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,574
-We must've missed it.
-lt's not funny.

313
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,178
l was up all night baking these
for the open house...

314
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,871
...and now l have to go buy them.

315
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,176
l'm still mad at you for blowing me off
getting the tree last night.

316
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,819
l had to do that all by myself.

317
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,080
We'll make it up to you today,
won't we, guys?

318
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,247
-We will?
-l bend over backwards...

319
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,485
...to make Christmas and everything
else for that matter nice for this family.

320
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,926
And none of you seem to care.

321
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,465
l don't think you appreciate how much
work goes into this time of year.

322
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,160
You just take it for granted
that it will all get done.

323
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,465
Haven't you even noticed
how far behind we are?

324
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,310
Okay, look, all l'm asking for
is you guys to help me out a bit, okay?

325
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,972
So Christmas can be nice.

326
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,748
Sure, honey, whatever you need.

327
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,943
You're right, Mom.

328
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,956
-Our bad.
-Thanks.

329
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,719
lf you'll get the Christmas card
address list and staff gift list together....

330
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,918
Absolutely.

331
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,996
And if you'll go get
some new Christmas lights...

332
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,565
...and if you get the decorations
for the outside...

333
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,861
...and the tree ornaments
out of the garage....

334
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,939
-You got it.
-Then we'll decorate it like we used to.

335
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,873
-You can count on us, hon.
-Good, because l need you guys.

336
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,910
Family hug.

337
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,847
Okay.

338
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,177
Okay, l gotta go. l have things to do.

339
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,249
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

340
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,618
-See you, hon.
-Bye.

341
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,155
Don't even think about it.

342
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,403
<i>Market Place is unfair.</i>
<i>All we want is our fair share.</i>

343
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:30,514
<i>Market Place is unfair.</i>
<i>All we want is our fair share.</i>

344
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,622
l knew it would be busy,
but this is crazy.

345
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,661
Yeah.

346
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,091
How late did you guys stay up
decorating last night?

347
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,760
We haven't started.

348
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,736
Oh, look,
some of the girls are here.

349
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,704
Mom, can you watch the register?

350
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,310
-Sure.
-Thanks.

351
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,880
-Hi, girls.
-Hi.

352
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,645
So glad you could make it.

353
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,446
l look forward to coming here
to escape from my brood for a while.

354
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,179
Especially this time of year.

355
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,484
-Oh, but you love Christmas, Debbie.
-Well, well, we all do.

356
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,854
But l'm with her.
After the week l've had...

357
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,588
...l am so ready for a break.

358
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,323
Well, now you can relax.

359
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,024
This is beautiful. Whose is it?

360
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,436
lt's mine. l'm making blankets
for the boys to take to college.

361
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,335
That's right, they're seniors now.

362
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,035
l'm so jealous. You'll finally have
your house to yourself.

363
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,646
-Hi, ladies.
-Hi, Rosemary.

364
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,578
-Hi.
-l just had to get away for a little while.

365
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,843
We've got a reporter out
on maternity leave...

366
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,681
...and l'm running ragged
picking up the slack.

367
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,586
So, Joy, you promised to show me how
to do that beautiful butterfly stitch...

368
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,818
-...you were using the other day.
-lt's easy.

369
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,021
That will add
a lot of flair to your work.

370
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,597
l'm all for flair, honey.

371
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,564
That may be
the understatement of the year.

372
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,362
That's the way we do it in Texas.

373
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,398
Hi, everyone.

374
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,709
Wow, l thought l was tired.

375
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,637
Thanks, Rosemary.

376
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,872
l didn't mean for it
to come out that way.

377
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,572
That's okay.

378
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,878
lt's hard when you have little ones,
but they do grow up eventually.

379
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,214
How about husbands?
Do they grow up too?

380
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,984
l'm serious. l swear Glen truly believes
that l am Santa Claus.

381
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,888
-That's nice.
-Thanks. l'm making eight of them.

382
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,464
Six down, two to go.
Christmas on a budget.

383
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,897
lt's hard to come up
with affordable gift ideas...

384
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,936
...especially when you have
to do your husband's shopping too.

385
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,097
Why do you do that?
Make him shop for himself.

386
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,243
Believe me, l've tried.

387
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,609
Maybe you just
need to try a new tactic.

388
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,975
Sometimes you just have
to take a stand.

389
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,743
Did you read my article
about the grocery store workers?

390
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,011
You wrote an article on the strike?
l missed it.

391
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,814
l'll e-mail you a copy of it.

392
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,685
Well, tactics or not,
Christmas still has to get done.

393
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,224
True.

394
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,020
l'm no Scrooge...

395
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,528
...but how's anyone supposed to get
get all this holiday stuff done?

396
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,327
lf l didn't have these stolen moments
with you guys...

397
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,163
...l'd think l might just crack.

398
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,532
Sometimes
it's just so overwhelming.

399
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,436
-Yeah, it's not easy.
-l know. l hear you.

400
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,737
Maybe you should all
just do a little less this year...

401
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,506
...and don't expect so much.

402
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,310
But l want this Christmas
to be the best Christmas ever.

403
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,792
Mark.

404
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,696
Mark.

405
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,033
-Mark!
-Hey, Mom.

406
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,902
Where are the decoration boxes?

407
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,639
Sorry, Mom. l was super busy
after school today.

408
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,581
l had to finish my thesis outline,
l started writing a song.

409
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,882
l lost track of time. lt's super sick.
l think you're gonna love it.

410
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,025
l'll play it for you later
when l get home.

411
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,161
No, we're doing the tree tonight
and the outside decorations.

412
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,058
About that. l promised Brittany...

413
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,222
...l would take her
to the new Bourne movie.

414
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,732
You also kind of promised me
that we'd do the tree.

415
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,199
Can l do it later?

416
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,133
Heads up.

417
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,103
Are you two trying
to make me insane?

418
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,041
Nope, just heading
to basketball practice.

419
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,644
-Tonight?
-l gotta go, l'm gonna be late.

420
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,837
Peace out.

421
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,676
Coach wants us to learn the new D
for the L.A. tournament.

422
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,080
The girls varsity team
had the court earlier.

423
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,153
The tree kind of looks small, Mom.

424
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,382
lf you'd been there, you could've
chosen whatever tree you wanted.

425
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,458
Right. See you later.

426
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,595
Wait, where's your father?

427
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,959
He's at the university. Didn't you see
the note l left on the fridge?

428
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,577
-Hi, hon.
-<i>Hi, why are you still at work?</i>

429
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,222
We're doing the decorations.

430
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,916
Oh, l just had some finals to grade.

431
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,755
<i>l thought those were due yesterday.</i>

432
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,493
What's all that noise l hear?

433
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,869
Look, Keith
and some of our colleagues came by...

434
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,769
<i>...for a little celebration</i>
<i>for the end of the semester.</i>

435
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,534
Hi, Joy.

436
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,611
<i>Did you at least take care</i>
<i>of the list that l gave you?</i>

437
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,811
Oh, Stephen, how do you expect me
to get everything done...

438
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,918
...especially with your party
coming up?

439
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,611
Look, l'll do it tomorrow, hon.
Seriously, l promise.

440
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,689
Tomorrow is gonna be....

441
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,519
Stephen, you've gotta hear this.

442
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,526
Honey, l'll be home as soon as l can.
l love you.

443
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,894
l love you too.

444
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,893
Joy?

445
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,537
-Joy.
-Yeah, l'm down here.

446
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,506
Oh, what happened?
Are you all right?

447
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,701
Oh, yeah.

448
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,902
Oh, Lordy.

449
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,541
l just fell off the ladder.

450
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,351
This is dangerous.

451
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,753
l'm just trying
to get the decorations up.

452
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,721
You know how l like
to be the first on the block...

453
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,918
...with their lights up? l'm last.

454
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,759
l have told you, you shouldn't
be doing this stuff by yourself.

455
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,599
Yeah.

456
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,330
You're right. This is ridiculous.

457
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,501
What am l doing?

458
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,170
Do you have any paint?

459
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,578
Paint? Yeah, l think so. Why?

460
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:21,258
<i>And in local ClF playoff action:</i>
<i>Boom! Down he goes.</i>

461
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,487
-That was a freaking awesome hit.
-That guy got trucked.

462
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,099
-l'm starved. Where's Mom?
-l don't know.

463
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:34,466
<i>Up next, number 3. Watch this</i>
<i>one-handed grab by the receiver....</i>

464
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,970
What's going on out there?

465
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,441
Way to go, Joy!

466
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,233
Mom, you can't be serious.

467
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,934
l'm definitely serious.
l'm officially on strike for Christmas.

468
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,772
Hon, what's the point?

469
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,347
l tried to make the point yesterday,
and you all ignored me.

470
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,383
You love Christmas but you take
for granted that it gets done.

471
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,679
And it's not fair.

472
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:27,348
Okay, but isn't this strike thing
taking it a little too far?

473
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,017
How else am l to get your attention?
You should want to pitch in...

474
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,790
...and stop making me
the nagging mom and wife.

475
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,626
Can't we have another chance?

476
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,234
Sure. Right after
you meet my strike demands.

477
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,895
-Which are?
-They're very simple.

478
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,008
One, appreciate
all there is to do around here...

479
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,643
...especially at Christmas time.

480
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,042
Two, acknowledge that you each
need to do your fair share.

481
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:56,646
And three, do it, on your own,
without any pestering. Just do it.

482
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,913
Just do what?

483
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,617
Just do Christmas this year.

484
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,319
-Hon, we've all been busy.
-And we're sorry.

485
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,519
Yeah.

486
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,155
That's not enough, l'm afraid.
Actions speak louder than words.

487
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,497
-What about my Christmas party?
-And my holiday department party?

488
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:17,238
l'm sure when you actually put
some effort into it, you'll get it all done.

489
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,376
You don't think we can do this,
do you?

490
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,375
l'm quite certain that you can.

491
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,538
l wouldn't do this otherwise.
Excuse me.

492
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,684
Can't we start
after my football banquet?

493
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,581
lt's the day after tomorrow.
What about my cookies?

494
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,221
Sorry. l'm on strike.

495
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,783
Don't worry,
we'll take care of the cookies.

496
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,358
Have you ever made a cookie?

497
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,930
No. Hey, hon, where's the recipe
for your special thumbprint cookies?

498
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,797
l'm on strike.

499
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,068
Don't worry, guys. This is just
one of your mother's moods.

500
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,674
Everything's gonna be fine.
Put in a little effort...

501
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,276
...and it'll all blow over.

502
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:56,413
Hopefully before my faculty party.

503
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,071
Sure, Dad.

504
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,881
-Should l go buy cookies tomorrow?
-No, you should have a little faith.

505
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,180
We'll find the recipe,
we'll go to the store...

506
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,153
...we'll get the ingredients.
l mean, how hard can it be?

507
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,934
-Where did you find this recipe?
-l found it online.

508
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,476
Why are there five chef hats?

509
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,013
Because it's the best recipe.

510
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,443
lt says
''highest degree of difficulty.''

511
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,713
Okay, well, that doesn't matter.

512
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,292
All right, what's first?

513
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,723
Okay, it says we have
to preheat the oven to 350...

514
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,161
...and line the baking sheet
with parchment paper.

515
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,299
Parchment paper?
l didn't see that at the store.

516
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,436
lt's probably to make sure
that cookies don't stick.

517
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,665
Here we go, wax paper.
lt's the same thing. That's good.

518
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,275
All right. Next.

519
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:04,005
lt says we have to do the wet
ingredients and separate the eggs.

520
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,679
Separate the eggs?
What does that mean?

521
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,315
Separate means keep the ingredients
apart from the other ingredients.

522
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,820
Didn't you guys learn anything
at school?

523
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,552
lt says we're gonna need the whites
for one part and yolk for the other.

524
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,627
Okay, then.

525
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,599
-You've seen Mom do this?
-No.

526
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,347
Just use your fingers. Don't worry.

527
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,750
-Okay.
-All right, so get the....

528
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,184
-This?
-Yeah, use the spoon.

529
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,019
-Just get the yellow out of there.
-Yeah, yeah.

530
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,495
Just take the yolk out.
Just scoop it.

531
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,289
Okay.

532
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,660
Mark, help him.

533
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,031
Pick it up, you've just gotta scoop it,
it's right there. You got it!

534
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,501
You got it! You got it!

535
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,943
Nicely done, all star. l thought
you were good with your hands.

536
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,944
Footballs and basketballs, yes.
Eggs, not so much.

537
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,446
Look, don't worry about it.
Ten-second rule.

538
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,019
Just don't tell Mom.

539
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,091
Okay. All right.

540
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,731
Give me that.

541
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,333
You guys mix the wet ingredients,
the eggs and the butter...

542
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,701
...and l'll take care of the dry,
the sugar, the salt and the flour.

543
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,772
Why are we using fake butter?

544
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,913
Because it's healthier
than real butter.

545
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,310
Let's go, boys. We can do this.

546
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,810
All right, l'm ready to mix.

547
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,039
-You know how to use that thing?
-Of course l know how to use it.

548
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,474
Plug it in.

549
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,680
All right.

550
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,820
l think there's a speed control, Dad.

551
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,908
All right.

552
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,739
Hey, l thought you were on strike.

553
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,714
l am at home...

554
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,649
...but l'm not on strike
against Christmas.

555
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,351
-You think this'll actually work?
-lt has to.

556
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,425
l've been thinking
that Keith and Ryan...

557
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,790
...they just have had it too easy
for too long.

558
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,262
lt's no wonder l get so stressed out
during the holidays.

559
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,560
Why should all of this rest
on my shoulders?

560
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,760
Absolutely.

561
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,268
They should be pitching in...

562
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,236
...not just assume that you're gonna
take care of everything.

563
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,571
And l agree,
which is why l'm joining this strike.

564
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,411
-Well, welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

565
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,846
We just have to get their attention...

566
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,044
...and then things will change
for the better. You'll see.

567
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,792
l didn't say add all the flour at once.

568
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,019
l'm not a mind reader.

569
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,390
Who knew you'd spaz...

570
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,465
...and turn the mixer on too high,
again, l might add?

571
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,727
Your Mom is gonna be
home right after the shop closes...

572
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,837
...and we still haven't
toasted our nuts.

573
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,670
-Dad, don't ever say that again.
-You're so weird.

574
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,369
To roll the cookies in
after we dip them in egg whites...

575
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,569
...you smart asses.

576
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,510
You got the wrong flour.
l don't know what gluten-free is.

577
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,707
lt's healthier.

578
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,977
We're not gonna make
cookies as good as Mom's.

579
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,383
They're gonna be better. All right?

580
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,819
You guys roll and dip,
l'll take care of the nuts.

581
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,118
Then we get these suckers
in the oven.

582
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,192
No.

583
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,427
Mom's gonna be shocked
when she sees what we did.

584
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,693
Yes, she will.

585
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,639
You two are looking
exceptionally perky today.

586
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,881
Yes, and l've been meaning to tell you.
l'm on strike.

587
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,952
Me too.

588
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,722
Strike?

589
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,158
-What kind of strike?
-Christmas strike.

590
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,988
l got tired of doing
all holiday preparations by myself...

591
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,130
...with no support from my family.

592
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,732
So l've left it all
to Stephen, Mark and Jeremy.

593
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,960
The strike is the only way
l could think of to get their attention.

594
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,365
lt's the same at my house.

595
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,871
l thought maybe they would help
if they saw that no one's doing it.

596
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,172
This sounds interesting.
lt's downright ball-- Courageous.

597
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,282
Hey, l just came by for some of that
Alpaca Marled yarn you guys have.

598
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,850
Came at a good time.
Joy and Sharon are on strike.

599
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,146
They are?

600
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,449
So, what are your strike demands?

601
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,285
Well, it's not all that different
from the grocery-store workers.

602
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,587
lt's about fairness.

603
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,823
Appreciate all there is to do,
especially at Christmas time...

604
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,763
...acknowledge that
they need to help, and cooperate.

605
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,335
Doing their part
in the true spirit of Christmas?

606
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,836
Exactly.

607
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,497
Family helping each other.
Amen to that.

608
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,669
Pete must truly believe in Christmas
fairies, because he doesn't lift a finger.

609
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,542
l'm lucky if l can get him
to haul the tree into the house.

610
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,981
The kids are focused on what
they're putting on Christmas gift lists.

611
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,213
Everything you guys are talking about
needs to change in my house.

612
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,254
Glen thinks because
l'm a stay-at-home...

613
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,292
...l must have time
to do all the decorating and cooking...

614
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:54,124
...as if raising two children and taking
care of a house weren't enough.

615
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,629
-l hear you.
-Not to mention...

616
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,734
...taking the kids to see Santa Claus...

617
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,803
...then you have to get their pictures
made with Santa Claus...

618
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,031
...put them on cards, take those cards
and give them to people...

619
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,234
...who don't even open those cards.
Who wants to do that?

620
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,377
l think you ladies
have something here.

621
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,516
Definitely do. Count me in.

622
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,176
Do you think it'll work?

623
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,616
Because l've never been
much of a rabble-rouser.

624
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,551
Sometimes you just need to
let them notice the injustice.

625
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,816
Then things will change.

626
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,391
-This is the time for action.
-l'm on strike too.

627
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,229
Ladies, this is just the beginning.
Our lives are gonna change.

628
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:31,061
We are gonna make Christmas
fun again, instead of a burden.

629
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,669
For all women.
By the time our message gets out...

630
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,204
...this whole town will be on strike
for Christmas.

631
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,433
Yeah, it will.

632
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,248
Dad. Dad.

633
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,516
Dad!

634
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,881
What the...?

635
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,850
-What did you guys do?
-The fire extinguisher's in the closet.

636
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,796
We need to open the door
and get rid of this smoke.

637
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,026
Dad, l think that wax paper
was a bad idea.

638
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,193
-And l think--
-Hey!

639
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,173
lf you two want to live
to see your next birthdays...

640
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,607
...you'll get another cookie sheet,
and start baking another batch now!

641
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,110
Okay.

642
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,406
Whatever you say, Dad.

643
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,230
They don't look bad, actually.

644
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,593
We haven't even added
the jam to the thumbprint.

645
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,632
Well, let's try one first.

646
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,267
Careful, they're hot.

647
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,979
Jeremy, stop,
you're splashing water everywhere.

648
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,449
Dad, those cookies are foul.

649
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,654
l don't know what happened,
l thought it would be so easy.

650
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,052
Clearly we need a plan B.

651
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,117
Yeah?

652
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,092
And we've got 20 minutes to get
this kitchen cleaned up.

653
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,493
This is Mom,
she's on her way home.

654
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,997
Hey.

655
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,992
l've got an idea.

656
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,683
-Hey, no snooping.
-Was the shop busy today, Mom?

657
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,787
How's Gramms?

658
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,890
Yeah, it was busy,
and since when do you two ask...

659
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,548
...about the shop and Grandma?

660
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,786
-Just interested, l guess.
-Yeah.

661
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,821
Why is your hair wet?

662
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,063
Well, we finished with the cookies and
we went out back and shot some hoops.

663
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,532
What happened
to your hand, honey?

664
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,300
Oh, Mark, he hacked me
when l was driving down the lane.

665
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,370
l don't know what that means
but it sure smells good in here.

666
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,845
How did the baking go?
l'd love to try a cookie.

667
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,210
No previews.

668
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,446
You're gonna have to wait to try them
at the banquet just like everyone else.

669
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,924
All right.

670
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,017
Wait, are you still on strike?

671
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,560
We made the cookies.

672
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,530
Nice start.

673
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,743
-She's not budging, Dad.
-Who's gonna help me with my party?

674
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,176
-Gift shopping? The Christmas cards?
-Decorations?

675
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:08,546
Guys, we just have to get through
the football banquet...

676
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,190
...and then we're
gonna negotiate a truce.

677
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,518
So when do you think
they'll get to the decorations?

678
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,165
l hope soon.

679
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,665
-l always like it when they're up.
-Yeah.

680
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,965
Well, l for one am relishing the fact
that l don't have so much to do.

681
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,267
-l'm loving this strike so far.
-Me too.

682
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,414
Oh, what's Rosemary doing here?

683
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,877
She's here to interview me. She wants
to do an article about the strike.

684
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,215
-Hey, you guys.
-Hi.

685
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,620
-l'm just gonna grab my stuff.
-Okay.

686
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,487
This is a good idea.

687
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,221
l pitched it to my boss
as a great human-interest story.

688
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,161
lt'll be good for the women in town
to see what we're doing.

689
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,791
And you can mention my support
for the strike in your article.

690
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,900
Thank you. l'm gonna get quotes
from Debbie and Laura too.

691
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,833
This strike's about to catch fire.

692
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,414
Should be heading out shortly.

693
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,296
So football's done...

694
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,337
...Ryan's already obsessing
about basketball season.

695
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,237
Yeah, Jeremy said he and Ryan
were going to light it up.

696
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,671
So how do you like the cookies?

697
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,779
These are actually delicious.

698
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,507
Yeah, you might not think so
after you hear this.

699
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,447
l've been trying to get you all night.

700
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,383
l overheard Keith and Ryan talking
before we left.

701
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,113
Jeremy found your secret recipe.

702
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,160
That's all right.
l wasn't really hiding it from them.

703
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,558
No, no, he found it
and they gave it to Hansen's Bakery.

704
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,562
-That's who made the cookies.
-Hey, Mom.

705
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,428
-Yeah?
-We've got to get going.

706
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:08,138
Last day of school tomorrow.
l've got a Spanish final.

707
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,865
-Okay, Joy, we'll talk.
-Good luck with that.

708
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,533
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

709
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,781
So did you like the cookies, hon?

710
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,716
Actually, l did. They're amazing.
You guys did a fantastic job.

711
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,913
-l knew you could do it.
-Well.

712
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,150
Yeah. So you found my recipe?

713
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,793
l remembered where you kept it.

714
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,826
And the recipe was followed exactly.

715
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,464
You see what we can do
when we put our minds together?

716
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,294
We're pitching in and trying to meet
your strike demands.

717
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,727
l see that.

718
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,372
Hey! Coats in the coat closet,
or in your room.

719
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,606
l'm just gonna put it
right back on tomorrow.

720
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,841
Jeremy....

721
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,314
Remember....

722
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,822
-l'll be up in a bit.
-Okay, hon.

723
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:18,003
Hello, Rosemary? Hi, it's Joy.
l'm sorry to call you so late.

724
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,109
l was just wondering...

725
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,077
...if there was time to add something
to that article for tomorrow.

726
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,147
Good.

727
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,617
Have you guys seen the newspaper
today? lt's not outside.

728
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,724
Jeremy must've grabbed it.

729
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,287
Hey, so, hon...

730
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,626
...since we made a good-faith gesture
with the cookies...

731
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,134
...l was thinking
that maybe we could...

732
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,330
...you know,
negotiate a truce to this strike?

733
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,068
Yeah, Mom, we're really sorry
and this cereal sucks.

734
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,474
-We worked hard on those cookies.
-You must've.

735
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,672
They certainly were delicious.

736
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,478
Have you guys seen this?

737
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,484
How could we? You took it.

738
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,216
Anything interesting
in the news today?

739
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,327
l haven't finished it yet,
but it's all about us.

740
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,323
Everything in that article
is the truth...

741
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,194
...including your little cookie scam.

742
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,893
How'd you find out?

743
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,560
l know all, and see all.

744
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,228
You're one scary dude, Mom.

745
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,572
So did you even make any cookies?

746
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:26,970
-Yeah. You kidding?
-Yeah.

747
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,272
They just tasted
more like biological weapons.

748
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,007
Will you call off the strike now,
please?

749
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,811
Remember my strike demands?

750
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,211
Yeah, they're in the article,
in bold print.

751
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,516
Yeah, well, taking a family recipe...

752
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,786
...and giving it to a bakery
to make the cookies for you...

753
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,726
...isn't exactly in the spirit
of meeting those demands.

754
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,196
You know, l was so proud
when l thought...

755
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,198
...you had actually made
those cookies.

756
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,429
Now, l know you were just trying
to dupe me into ending the strike.

757
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,234
-Have you actually read this article?
-Of course l have.

758
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,808
''My husband and sons need
to learn that Christmas...

759
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,003
...doesn't just magically appear...

760
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,705
...and their selfish ways
need to change.''

761
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,875
-You said that?
-That's a little out of context.

762
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,952
That article makes
us look bad, Mom.

763
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,181
And you told them about the cookies?
She makes us look like idiots.

764
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,651
And that's my fault how exactly?

765
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,791
ln case you forgot,
you betrayed me.

766
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,363
And now the whole town knows.

767
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,433
And l see you gave them
a great picture to go with the article.

768
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,263
You're very handsome
in that picture.

769
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:31,168
Honey, the way she wrote this article,
we're marked men now.

770
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,866
And you should be
after what you did.

771
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,405
Hey, you ready to head to work?

772
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,277
Or are you busy displaying
the arrogance and laziness...

773
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,475
...of a man who doesn't appreciate
his wife?

774
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,450
You're quite the role model,
Stephen.

775
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:50,020
-Those weren't my exact words, Keith.
-l've had calls from other professors.

776
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,821
l think you're in for quite a bit
of razzing today.

777
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,294
Why are you spared?
lsn't your wife on strike too?

778
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,626
Yes, and l'm not happy about it.

779
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,530
But the article isn't about me.

780
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,464
You know, this isn't what l wanted.
My strike demands are right here.

781
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,608
They're simple.

782
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,877
Well, it may not be what you wanted,
but it's what you got.

783
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,120
So l'm guessing
you're not calling off the strike.

784
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,991
That's the loser from the article.
What a jerk.

785
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,426
Yeah.

786
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,192
-Are you going now?
-Yeah.

787
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,734
Okay, l'll bring the book.

788
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,101
-Yeah, nice article.
-How can he show his face?

789
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,853
-Hey.
-Hey.

790
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,014
Rosemary's article was great.

791
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,093
l loved her clever use
of ''Cookiegate.''

792
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,628
So underhanded by the guys,
and a prize recipe too.

793
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,665
-What are you doing here early?
-l wanted to get some stuff...

794
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,826
...before my day got crazy.
What's going on?

795
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,438
-l don't know. But let's go see.
-l'll grab the door.

796
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,704
Mom, what is going on?

797
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,043
Seems your strike demands...

798
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,119
...have touched a chord in the women
in this town.

799
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,285
The Christmas strike has generated
quite a bit of interest.

800
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,858
l'm sure your article
had something to do with that.

801
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,791
l realized after l read the article...

802
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,932
...that the only way to truly make
a difference is with numbers.

803
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,829
l need to teach my husband
a lesson before it's too late...

804
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:42,529
...and before he infects the kids
with that lazy-ass attitude of his.

805
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,573
And in order to do that,
we need to unite.

806
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,801
She posted a link
to Rosemary's article online.

807
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,038
l did too and we created a page for it.
This strike is going viral.

808
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,183
You mean you are now organizing
the Christmas strike, Laura?

809
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,251
There's a little activist
in me after all.

810
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,184
Look at these comments
of support from women all over town.

811
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:03,952
''l'm with you 1 00 percent.
lt's about time we took a stand.

812
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,095
Way to go, girls.''

813
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,562
lt looks the whole community
is behind your cause now, Joy.

814
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,098
Right, girls?

815
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,237
We're tired of being undervalued
and underappreciated. Right?

816
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,168
We're boycotting until our families
cooperate and pitch in.

817
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,364
Right.

818
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,510
So do you have any comment, Joy?

819
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,737
Yes. Yes, l do. lt really means a lot
that you all are here.

820
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,712
l realize that this strike
isn't just about me.

821
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,475
lt's about all of us.

822
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,449
And now that we are united...

823
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,418
...the days of women
making the holidays happen alone...

824
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,854
...will soon be over
and this strike will succeed.

825
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:40,122
So in the words of Gloria Steinem
or somebody:

826
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,198
''Solidarity now
and solidarity forever.''

827
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,096
-Yeah. Strike.
-Strike. Strike. Strike.

828
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,201
We're so screwed, Dad.

829
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,645
This is gonna be
the worst Christmas ever.

830
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,475
You hear about the rally yesterday?

831
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,480
Mom's got the whole town
behind her now.

832
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,552
-That's a lot of estrogen.
-Jeremy, l get it.

833
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,416
l also get that my holiday party...

834
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,717
...happens to be taking place
in this house...

835
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,258
...in two days
and l have nothing prepared for it.

836
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,192
Not to mention that we have
also done absolutely nothing...

837
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,765
...for Christmas. So yes,
right now, we're screwed.

838
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,066
-You seem stressed.
-You think?

839
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,262
Don't you have school?

840
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,100
We're out for winter break,
remember?

841
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,266
Well, good, because we need
to start getting ready for Christmas.

842
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,210
l thought your Mom was gonna cave,
but that's not gonna happen now.

843
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,975
Maybe that's
because she has a point.

844
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,319
Yes, she's got a point.

845
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,185
The holidays are a full-time job
that she made look easy...

846
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,986
...even when it wasn't. l get it.

847
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,925
She's thrown down the gauntlet
with this newspaper article.

848
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,758
This is war now.

849
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,524
But we can do this.

850
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,532
Here's the list.

851
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,964
-That's a lot of stuff.
-Yes, it is.

852
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,198
We need to get started.
Where's your brother?

853
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,605
Went to beg Brittany
to help him with the party.

854
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:01,971
We need the tree up...

855
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,113
...and the house decorated
before my party.

856
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,182
We need to find a caterer fast.
We need to go gift shopping.

857
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,544
This close to Christmas?

858
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,288
This place is a nightmare.

859
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,084
The women sneering and yelling.

860
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,749
-Jackass.
-And the guys?

861
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,260
All pissed. l thought that guy Ted
was your friend.

862
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,694
-Santa told you to go--
-l heard what Santa said.

863
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,128
Let's go to the car.

864
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,428
l knew that picture of us
was gonna be trouble.

865
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:30,004
lt's all over the lnternet. Someone
posted a video from Mom's shop.

866
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,334
Now we'll have to find
somewhere else to shop.

867
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,842
Hey, Keith, don't go in there.
lt's not safe.

868
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,480
l have to, thanks to you.

869
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,748
-lsn't that Mom's friend, the reporter?
-Yes, it is.

870
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,011
Mr. Robertson?

871
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,283
Hi. Rosemary Channing,
Joy's friend from the <i>Herald.</i>

872
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,857
l know who you are, Rosemary.

873
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,256
That's quite the hatchet job
you did on us.

874
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,024
l'd like to interview you to get the male
perspective on the Christmas strike.

875
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,657
l'm here talking to other men
but l'd really like to talk to you.

876
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,100
How can l trust
you're gonna be objective?

877
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,173
Mr. Robertson, l'm a journalist.

878
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,799
l don't let my personal viewpoints
interfere with my work.

879
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,136
-Okay, l'll do it.
-You will?

880
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,248
Yeah. Meet us at our house at 4:00.

881
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,852
Great. Great, l'll see you then.
Thank you.

882
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,487
Sure you know what you're doing?

883
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,624
Call your brother and tell him
to meet us at the house.

884
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,316
We're gonna get our side
of the story out there.

885
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,962
lt's time to turn the tide
on this strike.

886
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,730
-Looks all right, Dad.
-Thanks, Mark.

887
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,872
Where's Mom's angel ornament...

888
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,702
...and the ornaments we made with her
when we were little?

889
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,642
Well, l couldn't find space for it,
so l went for a simpler theme.

890
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,839
-Did you find that gift-buying website?
-Mission accomplished.

891
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,347
Take care of Christmas cards?

892
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,681
l downloaded the e-mails from the list
and l sent them e-cards.

893
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,788
Good. What did it say?
l'm sure it's fine.

894
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,618
Get this place cleaned up.
That reporter's gonna be here.

895
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,954
Why do the interview?
That reporter was wack.

896
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,256
Because it's time we took a stand
and show that we're committed.

897
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,400
All right? We're not arrogant or lazy.

898
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,728
We can do this. Our way.

899
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,582
So why are we doing another article
on the Christmas strike?

900
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,652
Evenhanded reporting.

901
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,052
That's good then, because l thought
your last article sold us short.

902
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:05,558
l do believe men are capable of doing
more to help out during the holidays.

903
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,321
And they should.

904
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,155
Who knew
you were so enlightened?

905
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,800
Hey, you know l was wondering...

906
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,596
...do you wanna go to a concert
with me on Christmas Eve?

907
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,433
Was everything you said a ploy
to get me to go on a date?

908
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,006
l figured it couldn't hurt.

909
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,506
l should have known.

910
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,577
Yes, but will you go?

911
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,345
-Right on time.
-Hi.

912
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,448
This is my photographer,
Rick Daniels.

913
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,084
-This is Mr. Robertson.
-Nice to meet you.

914
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,345
You ready to give us
your side of this story?

915
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,852
Yes, l am. Come right in.

916
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,785
Very good.

917
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,792
-That's her.
-God.

918
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,994
l can't remember the last time
l went shopping for fun.

919
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,067
-l mean, even after work.
-Me either.

920
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,296
Oh, look, a new striker for the cause.

921
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,030
-Good.
-Yeah.

922
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,442
l don't think l remember
this many men down here, ever.

923
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,342
Yeah, don't look too close,
they don't look too happy.

924
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,376
Good. Maybe they're starting
to appreciate us more.

925
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,746
Look, that dress is beautiful.

926
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,911
Well, let's get in there, girl.

927
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,286
l was thinking l'd like to buy a dress
for Stephen's faculty party.

928
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,893
Well, you should do it then.

929
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:17,128
Oh, you said this strike
was gonna light a fire in town.

930
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,996
-Feel the heat, honey.
-On strike. On strike.

931
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,860
Call off the strike?

932
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,593
No. No, l'm afraid not.

933
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,301
Please, Mom.

934
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,408
We need you.

935
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,204
Did you see
the decorations outside?

936
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,006
Jeremy and l forgot how much fun
it was to put them up.

937
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,206
But we really missed you.

938
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,750
Jeremy tried to tell Dad
to put our old ornaments...

939
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,683
...the angel one you love,
on the tree.

940
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,224
lt still looks nice.

941
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:23,422
Hey, why don't you play me
that song that you're writing?

942
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,433
l'd love to Mom, but l can't.

943
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,532
Why not?

944
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,003
Brittany won't help me
with my Christmas party...

945
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,005
...because she joined your strike.

946
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,406
l gotta go do all the stuff
for the party.

947
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:37,045
l thought about canceling it...

948
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,545
...but l figure it's one
of the last Christmases...

949
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,684
...all of my friends
will be together.

950
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,909
l've played
with those guys a lot of years.

951
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,715
Well, you'll stay in touch
when you're at Oberlin.

952
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,690
Yeah, but it will never be the same.

953
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,225
l'll see you later, Mom.

954
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,435
Well, hello there.

955
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,580
l didn't expect to see you
back here tonight.

956
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,246
What's wrong?

957
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:55,982
Mom, l know that you don't agree
with the strike, but....

958
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,992
l never said that.

959
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,928
You're like me. Or l'm like you.
Whatever.

960
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,659
You don't hide your feelings well
and l can tell.

961
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:11,704
Anyway, l hope you understand
that all the women who are on strike...

962
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,509
...we just want our families
to appreciate how hard we work...

963
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,004
...for everything to be nice
on the holidays.

964
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,547
And sometimes we just need
some help from them.

965
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,344
You can understand that, right?

966
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,948
Yes, l can.

967
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,660
l just want Christmas
to be perfect for the boys...

968
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:35,158
...like it was for us
when Dad was alive.

969
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,494
lt wasn't perfect then, honey.

970
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,693
Sure it was.

971
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,567
We were always so happy.

972
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,573
l can still hear Dad singing
''Up on the Housetop.''

973
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,075
We were happy...

974
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,009
...because we were always together
at that time of year...

975
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,878
...with family members
and friends around.

976
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,385
But it certainly wasn't perfect.

977
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:03,286
Don't you remember the year
that l burned the turkey to a crisp?

978
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:04,858
Actually, l do remember that.

979
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:08,088
And the year that your father
forgot to get me a present...

980
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:13,099
...and wrote that silly poem
on a paper towel to apologize?

981
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,136
You loved that poem. l remember
you cried when you read it.

982
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,871
And it hangs in my kitchen
every Christmas.

983
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,637
Your father was definitely unique...

984
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,778
...and l loved him for that.

985
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,777
Always will.

986
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,453
Remember, Joy, the holidays
are not about the trappings.

987
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:40,994
And families evolve
and change as we get older.

988
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,532
l've never been a big fan of change.

989
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:50,671
And that has been true
ever since you were a little girl.

990
01:01:55,278 --> 01:02:01,683
Don't most strikes end
when they find a middle ground?

991
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,880
Rosemary told me they settled
the grocery strike..

992
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,682
They did?

993
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:09,749
How?

994
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,156
Each side gave a little.

995
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:19,124
Try looking at it
from your family's perspective.

996
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:25,764
And think about what it is
that you really care about.

997
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,211
l love you, Mom.

998
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:34,740
l love you too.

999
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,614
And l am proud of you.

1000
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,636
-Hey, good morning.
-Hi.

1001
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,133
What was that for?

1002
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:03,438
Just thinking about something
my mom said last night.

1003
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,713
What's so interesting
that you're reading?

1004
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,281
Nothing.

1005
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,542
-Wait.
-Where were we?

1006
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,948
-What?
-Hey, what is this?

1007
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,281
Why don't you want me
to see it?

1008
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,883
ls this what l think it is?

1009
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,290
Well, they wanted
another perspective on the strike.

1010
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,856
See? We didn't do such a bad job
decorating the tree there.

1011
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,828
You ordered gifts
off some impersonal website?

1012
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,666
They guarantee delivery by Christmas.
lt's not impersonal.

1013
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,536
Mark said you fill out a checklist
and the online shopper--

1014
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,574
Ordered a prepackaged
Christmas dinner?

1015
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,236
lt's one of those services they offered.
lt's gourmet.

1016
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,245
We ordered those
candied yams you love.

1017
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,180
l love the ones my mother makes.

1018
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,317
You called me ''Yulezilla''?

1019
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,013
Well, that was actually her idea.

1020
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:53,026
All l said was that sometimes
you can be a little intense.

1021
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,629
Somebody has to be intense...

1022
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,924
...with all these parties
that you're throwing.

1023
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:00,034
That you're throwing in my face.
Mark's party, faculty party.

1024
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:04,299
-We got the cookies for the banquet--
-Honey, honey, look, l get it.

1025
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,703
But you asked us to help,
and now we're helping.

1026
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,334
And it may not be exactly the way
you would do it, but it is nice.

1027
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:17,009
l mean, maybe you need to think about
what it is you really want.

1028
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,464
Hey, we just got your
Christmas card.

1029
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,871
We need to get the girls together.

1030
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,011
You got our card? Can l see it?

1031
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,671
Sure. lt's over here on my computer.

1032
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,044
On your computer?

1033
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:02,721
Mark's song.

1034
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,104
lt's kind of fun, huh?

1035
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,482
Can you play that again?

1036
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,850
So why do you wanna get
the girls together?

1037
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,028
Hey, guys. l think this strike
is getting out of hand.

1038
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,430
l could have killed my editor
when l saw that ''Yulezilla'' reference...

1039
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,230
...that he added to my article.

1040
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,498
''Sound bites sell papers,''
he says.

1041
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,266
You know, Stephen never said that.

1042
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,343
lt's chaos at my house,
but that doesn't ruffle my feathers...

1043
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,639
...as long as my husband
gives me respect...

1044
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,078
-...and cooperation in the process.
-Exactly.

1045
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,878
-lsn't that what this strike was about?
-ls it worth it?

1046
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,886
Glen's helping but it seems
all we do is argue anymore.

1047
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,048
l want the strike to succeed,
but l don't wanna ruin Christmas.

1048
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,352
No, no one does. So l was thinking--

1049
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:09,123
All right ladies, look.
There is a galvanized community...

1050
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,266
...of women who are
depending on us now.

1051
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,164
When the going gets tough,
we have to raise the stakes.

1052
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,861
-What if--?
-l completely agree...

1053
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,233
-...but how do we do that?
-l know how.

1054
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,808
We use a different kind of media
that will reach a wider audience.

1055
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,412
Great idea.
Keep the pressure on.

1056
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,445
-Exactly.
-What type of media?

1057
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,048
Bigger.

1058
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,548
-lnternet.
-Open house. l could cater it.

1059
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,554
And l have a friend
at Channel Eight.

1060
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,986
Mom barely said a word
when she got home.

1061
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,028
She's usually so happy
this time of year.

1062
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,894
lt kind of sucks to see her
this way.

1063
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,433
Well, l'm not feeling
so chipper myself.

1064
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,629
The tree doesn't look so bad.
lt's not how Mom would've done it--

1065
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,969
Mark! Please, enough. l get it.

1066
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,243
l'm gonna go down
to the office and work.

1067
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:03,942
Okay, Dad.

1068
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,756
Merry Christmas to you too.

1069
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,892
Not the same night.

1070
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,702
Mom, it's official.

1071
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,366
l just got the notice online.

1072
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,513
l'm in early decision, and the coach
is holding a spot for me.

1073
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,343
l'm gonna play D-3 ball at Bowdoin.
This is so freaking awesome.

1074
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,976
-Oh, gosh, honey, l'm so proud of you.
-l can't wait to tell Dad.

1075
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,647
l'm gonna go tell Ryan now. This is
gonna be the best Christmas ever!

1076
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,016
l had a feeling you'd call.
l just heard.

1077
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,887
l'm so happy for him, l really am.

1078
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,496
lt's just that Bowdoin is so far away.

1079
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,292
l was hoping he would get
a scholarship closer.

1080
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:27,402
With Mark going to Oberlin...

1081
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,934
...l was thinking maybe even
Chapman, so one of them could....

1082
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,868
Oh, baby.

1083
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:39,875
He said this is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

1084
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,211
Jeremy's really happy.

1085
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,809
Yeah, he deserves to be.

1086
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,613
Yes, he does.

1087
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,916
But it's sure gonna be empty
around here...

1088
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,457
...when he and Mark leave.

1089
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,195
l just hope between girls
and music...

1090
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,162
...that Mark actually finds time
to make it to college.

1091
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,763
Yeah, our son, the rocker heartthrob.

1092
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,599
Yeah.

1093
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:46,311
So how are
party preparations going?

1094
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,108
Not bad, actually.

1095
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,252
-Who's cooking? Not you, l hope.
-No. No.

1096
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,620
Yeah, l found a caterer.

1097
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,189
Good.

1098
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,029
Yeah.

1099
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,830
Yeah.

1100
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:21,146
All right, well, good night.

1101
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,755
Good night.

1102
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,932
All right. Well, just please hurry.

1103
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,761
Thank you.

1104
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,596
Dad, did you see
the e-mail l forwarded you?

1105
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:44,796
What?

1106
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,067
Gifts have been delayed
until after Christmas.

1107
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:48,673
What?

1108
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,175
l can't deal with that now.

1109
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:53,941
The caterers are late. l've gotta get
this wine out. Mark, what is that stuff?

1110
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,481
Wow, Mom. You look amazing.

1111
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:58,915
Thank you, honey.

1112
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,318
Mark, whatever that is,
put that stuff away.

1113
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,752
The party's about to start.

1114
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,492
l know it is.

1115
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,399
Oh, the galleys for your new book.

1116
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:19,007
Yeah. l promised the department
they'd get the first copies.

1117
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,041
But after you, of course.

1118
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,179
l'm sure it's wonderful. Always is.

1119
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,880
-Oh, Stephen.
-Oh, there's the caterers.

1120
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,312
-Hi.
-Hi.

1121
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,013
Come in, come in.

1122
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,885
Thank God you're here.

1123
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,220
Oh, it's down the hall on the left.

1124
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,387
You're using these caterers?
They're Sharon's biggest competitor.

1125
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,429
What was l to do?
l had to hire somebody.

1126
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,828
Your chairman's here.

1127
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,764
-Hey, hey, Betty.
-Hi.

1128
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,131
-Welcome. Raymond, good to see you.
-Stephen.

1129
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,364
Come on in.

1130
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,508
Oh, it's so lovely.

1131
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,008
We're still kind of getting set up here,
but....

1132
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,236
Very Christmassy.

1133
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,812
-Hello.
-Hey, Grandma.

1134
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,744
Didn't know you'd be here
for my party.

1135
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,247
You didn't have to dress up.

1136
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,976
Your party?

1137
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,552
l thought that was last night.

1138
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,848
Some guys had a gig,
so we moved it to tonight.

1139
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:11,015
Mind helping me get ready?
They're going to be here any minute.

1140
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:16,427
But your dad's faculty party
is right now.

1141
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,156
l need to speak to you.

1142
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,029
There's food right there.

1143
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,033
There's something
that you need to know.

1144
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,434
-What are they doing here?
-Mrs. Johnson.

1145
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,497
-Hi. Hi, dudes.
-Hey.

1146
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,641
-Who are all these people?
-Mark.

1147
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,108
-Hey, what's going on?
-lt's my party, Dad.

1148
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,644
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

1149
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,013
-What's the team doing here?
-You know them all.

1150
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,087
l figured you had all the food....

1151
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:43,019
You didn't think to ask
if l minded if you crashed my party?

1152
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,921
Cool your jets. lt's not a big deal.

1153
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,461
lt is a big deal. You didn't think
to tell me you're having your party...

1154
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,689
...on the same night
l'm having my party?

1155
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:54,029
l put it on the calendar on the fridge.
All you had to do was check.

1156
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,865
That fridge is so covered up,
l couldn't find my mother...

1157
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,132
-...if she was pinned on it.
-Funny, Dad.

1158
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,970
-lt's not funny.
-l knew when l first heard about it...

1159
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,272
...this Christmas strike
was going to be trouble.

1160
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,881
Trouble?
ls that what you think this is?

1161
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,245
You're lucky l even came with you
to this party.

1162
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,144
You've had it easy so far...

1163
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,482
...l'm about to drop the strike hammer
on you, Raymond.

1164
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,851
Excuse me.

1165
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,856
But sweetie....

1166
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,051
Excuse me.

1167
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,823
Stephen, sorry,
we'll have to be going.

1168
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,263
Honey, honey, let me handle this.
Raymond, Betty. Betty.

1169
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:29,461
lt's so nice to have you here, really.
Come on in here, please.

1170
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,435
We're having an issue
with our sons.

1171
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,098
But you know what it's like
with teenage boys, right?

1172
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,743
-Of course.
-Have a nice drink.

1173
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,071
Hello, everyone.

1174
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,611
You know each other.

1175
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,115
Hey, that's not for you.

1176
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,944
Give me that.

1177
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,453
Just hold on one second.

1178
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,949
-Hey, party's in the other room.
-Excuse me for one moment.

1179
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,895
-Mark, in the family room.
-We're going to the family room.

1180
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,257
-l've got this.
-Thanks, Mom.

1181
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,066
Sorry, bro.
head to the family room, okay.

1182
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,293
Meet you in there.
Donald, family room, okay?

1183
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,960
Right through here.

1184
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,839
Hi. Come on in.

1185
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,841
-Plate, plate, plate!
-Okay, okay.

1186
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,743
Mom, we got it. We got this, okay?

1187
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,316
-Let's go, bro. Yeah.
-Okay.

1188
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,511
-Merry Christmas. Right in there.
-Merry Christmas.

1189
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,783
This isn't our party, we're in here.
Come on. Sorry about that.

1190
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,927
Yeah, you know how kids are.

1191
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,829
And the food's in the dining room.

1192
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:37,165
-Hello.
-Yeah. Thank you so much.

1193
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,372
Okay, you guys have fun...

1194
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,510
...but keep it down to a dull roar,
okay?

1195
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,241
ls that all?

1196
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,351
The galleys of Stephen's new book,
everybody.

1197
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,647
Here you go.

1198
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,380
-Mr. Ziff?
-Thank you.

1199
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,923
-l'm sure you're gonna love it.
-Thank you.

1200
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,621
Hey, baby.

1201
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,424
-You are amazing.
-Love you.

1202
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,896
Oh, look who's here.

1203
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,433
-Hi.
-Hi.

1204
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:11,198
l'm sorry we're late, but l have
something important to tell you.

1205
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,465
Oh, my God.

1206
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,166
-He used them?
-Sharon, l know, it's okay.

1207
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,537
Sharon, what's the important
thing you have to tell me?

1208
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,012
The TV news truck is here.

1209
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,912
They're setting up to interview you.

1210
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:26,179
Channel Eight. Like now.

1211
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,883
<i>Strike, strike, strike!</i>

1212
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,687
-There she is.
-Okay.

1213
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,963
Hi, guys.

1214
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,391
This way.

1215
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,763
We're so happy that you came out.
This is great.

1216
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,734
Hi.

1217
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,105
So tell me, Mrs. Robertson,
what does this strike mean to you...

1218
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,542
...and all these women
gathered here?

1219
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,039
Well...

1220
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,278
...l started my Christmas strike...

1221
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,387
...because l wanted my family
to appreciate...

1222
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,151
...all that there is to do around this
house, especially at Christmas time.

1223
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:07,887
And for them to acknowledge
that l can't do it all myself. l need help.

1224
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,860
And l was amazed to see...

1225
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,967
...how this resonated with
so many women in this community.

1226
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,227
Jeremy,
turn to channel eight real quick.

1227
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,599
Mom's on TV.

1228
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,401
Channel eight. Channel eight.

1229
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,410
<i>And l still believe</i>
<i>in my strike demands...</i>

1230
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,912
<i>...l mean, goals.</i>

1231
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,174
ls that our house?

1232
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:32,309
<i>l still believe in my strike goals,</i>
<i>they just weren't met.</i>

1233
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:36,287
<i>My strike goals weren't met</i>
<i>my way.</i>

1234
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,625
<i>l thought Christmas</i>
<i>had to be perfect...</i>

1235
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:40,887
...especially this year.

1236
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:44,829
So l put a lot of pressure on myself
and my family in the process.

1237
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,126
Why did you do that?

1238
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,929
Because l was afraid that
with my children growing up...

1239
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,231
...l was becoming obsolete...

1240
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:55,467
...and l needed to find a way
to slow life down...

1241
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,839
...and to make my family appreciate
what l do...

1242
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,275
...and what we have.

1243
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,884
But what makes Christmas perfect
isn't what we do...

1244
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:06,282
...it's our love for each other.

1245
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:11,688
And it should bring us closer
and not split us apart.

1246
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:14,027
l was hanging on so tightly...

1247
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:18,292
...and now l realize that
it's really about letting go...

1248
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,901
...and becoming even closer
in the process.

1249
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,196
Letting each other grow
and change.

1250
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,669
But what about the strike?
Where do you go from here?

1251
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:35,611
Look, l know my family loves me,
and l love them.

1252
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,376
And they've made me understand...

1253
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:41,579
...that Christmas doesn't have to be
done my way to be wonderful...

1254
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,022
...and it's not about the trappings,
it's about....

1255
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:50,358
<i>lt's about being together,</i>
<i>real and imperfect.</i>

1256
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,665
<i>And l bet if you asked my guys</i>
<i>right now...</i>

1257
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,997
<i>...they'd agree</i>
<i>that it's really important...</i>

1258
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,867
<i>...to help and support each other.</i>

1259
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,032
<i>At Christmas time</i>
<i>and all year round.</i>

1260
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,739
So really, my strike demands
have been met.

1261
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,542
The message has been heard.

1262
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:14,713
So l'm here to announce that
my Christmas strike is officially over.

1263
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:18,454
And l ask everyone else,
on this Christmas Eve...

1264
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:23,724
...that in the true spirit of Christmas,
you end yours too.

1265
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,694
l guess mine is over too.

1266
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,425
Yeah, she's right.

1267
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,529
Thank you, Mrs. Robertson.

1268
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,597
l work so hard every year.

1269
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,601
Merry Christmas.

1270
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,099
-Merry Christmas.
-l love you.

1271
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:10,773
l love you so much.

1272
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,354
Merry Christmas.

1273
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:26,619
Merry Christmas.

1274
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:34,100
These are delicious.
You must have a very good recipe.

1275
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,134
l do, but it's a secret.

1276
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:39,603
A close friend just gave me the recipe
and, well, l can't share it.

1277
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,369
You know, it's not exactly
as l would have done it...

1278
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,071
...but l really like it.

1279
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,173
-Mom?
-Mom.

1280
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,107
-Joy?
-Mom. Mom.

1281
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,679
l'm in the family room.

1282
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,920
We have a surprise for you.

1283
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:28,953
Yeah, l already saw it.

1284
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,388
You guys did a great job. l love it.

1285
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,189
Well, there's more. Jeremy.

1286
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:38,461
So we all listened
to what you said last night.

1287
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,498
And l just want you to know...

1288
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,264
...that even when l'm at college,
you'll always be my number one...

1289
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,438
-...in here.
-ln here.

1290
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,207
-Love you, Mom.
-Love you too.

1291
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:58,976
Mom, you do so much for us
and not just at Christmas.

1292
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,681
And we really need to tell you more
and how much we appreciate it.

1293
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,156
So thank you.

1294
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:16,099
Joy, we know how important
Christmas is to you...

1295
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,296
...because we're so important to you.

1296
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,875
And you mean so much to us.

1297
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:26,703
You don't have to worry about
this being our last, best Christmas.

1298
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:32,684
Because we have made
the Robertson family demands...

1299
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,288
...and we have all signed it.

1300
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,651
On a paper towel.

1301
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,986
''The Robertson family
Christmas demands.

1302
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:45,758
We pledge to be together
and help each other every Christmas...

1303
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,260
...and it doesn't have to be perfect...

1304
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:52,805
...because being together as a family
is all that really matters.

1305
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,267
Stephen, Mark and Jeremy.''

1306
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,944
Okay.

1307
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,787
Joy.

1308
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,238
Oh, it's my editor.

1309
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,003
Oh, l'm fine, honey. Go get it.

1310
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,141
These turned out beautifully.

1311
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:38,650
Oh, they did, didn't they?

1312
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,551
l don't know how you got that lnternet
company to deliver all the gifts on time.

1313
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,885
lt was easy.
l had Rosemary call and pretend...

1314
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,585
...that she was doing a story
on consumer complaints...

1315
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,560
...about companies that failed
to live up to their pledges...

1316
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,290
...at the holidays and ruin them.

1317
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,231
Now l know
where l get my militant streak.

1318
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,968
And l actually liked the gifts.

1319
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:02,500
l actually liked the candied yams,
better than mine.

1320
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:05,737
l mean, not that l want to do this
every year, but....

1321
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:08,781
My daughter, the micromanager...

1322
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,442
...would actually consider doing
something another way.

1323
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:17,449
Well, yes, if it encourages
the participation of the guys, l'm in.

1324
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,856
And besides, l will always
micromanage you at the store.

1325
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,621
Lucky me.

1326
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:25,923
So, what did he want?

1327
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,069
He said he wants my next book...

1328
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:33,367
...to be about a modern family
dealing with the stresses of Christmas.

1329
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:39,271
l think that one's been done already.
What did you say?

1330
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,812
l told him l write fiction.

1331
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,544
-Hey, are we ready?
-All set.

1332
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,949
-ls what ready?
-Oh, you'll find out.

1333
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,153
All right, we'd like to dedicate...

1334
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,453
...this Christmas song
to Joy Robertson.

1335
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:57,226
Rocking wife, mother, and daughter.

1336
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,856
Hit it.
