1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,100
You're on.

2
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,600
John, sorry to keep you waiting.
- Hello?.

3
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,300
She always knew I'd kill her.
She'd say:

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
"One of these days,
you're gonna shoot me.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,300
And you know what?.
You're gonna miss."

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,900
Her last words were:
"You'll never amount to anything."

7
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,100
She was wrong.

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,100
I'm a murderer.
I killed my own mother.

9
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,300
That's something, isn't it?.
- In case you just tuned in,

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,700
that was Raymond Linette,
out on parole

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,600
after doing 4 years for matricide.
That's murdering your mother.

12
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,800
And matricide is
what we're talking about tonight.

13
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,600
Our guests are Dr. Leo Richmond,
psychiatrist and author

14
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
of "The Mother-Killers:
Boys Who Kill Their Mothers."

15
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Dr. Richmond is here to help us
find out what makes them do it.

16
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,500
Mr. George Emeric,
grandfather of the paroled killer,

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,800
and of course Raymond himself.

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,900
Raymond, you're able to talk about
what made you do what you did.

19
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,800
I've talked about it every day
for 4 years. It's part of therapy

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,600
at Sedonia. - There's been
an outcry against such prisons.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,400
That let criminals out too soon?.
- The recidivism rate is almost 60%.

22
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm only out because of my grandpa.

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Mr. Emeric,
you're Ray's maternal grandfather?.

24
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,300
Yes. - Meaning:
he murdered your daughter. - Yes.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,900
Yet you've made parole possible
by taking him into your home,

26
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,600
where your daughter grew up.

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
The same room.

28
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,100
Could you tell us what
that feels like to you?.

29
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,700
You must've loved your daughter.

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,200
She was a world-class bitch
who didn't deserve a boy like Raymond.

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Marilyn, you're on.
- I'd like to ask Dr. Richmond:

32
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't girls ever kill their mothers?.
- The same dynamics don't apply.

33
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,300
You mean they never...
- Not as often as boys.

34
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,900
Maybe girls are too smart
to get caught.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,300
I don't have the statistics
on female matricide.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,900
Boys happen to be
my sphere of expertise.

37
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,300
So how did this become your sphere?.

38
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,200
My first involvement
with a mother-killer was 30 years ago.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,200
A man turned himself into his mother,
out of guilt for having murdered her.

40
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,400
Turned himself into her?. - Dressed
in her clothes, spoke in her voice,

41
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,600
killed as her, all to create
the illusion that she was still alive,

42
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,600
that he had not murdered her.

43
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,500
Matricide is probably
the most unbearable crime of all,

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
and most unbearable for the son
who commits it.

45
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,100
Raymond Linette has to be home by 10,
a condition of his parole.

46
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
Raymond, Mr. Emeric, I want to

47
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
thank you for joining us.

48
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Dr. Raymond, you will stay, won't you?.
- Glad to.

49
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,400
Our next caller is from...

50
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
No name either, I guess?.

51
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
We have to call you something.

52
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
You can call me... Ed.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Go ahead, Ed.

54
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,600
I listen to your program every night.
It's one of the pleasures of parole.

55
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Were you in Sedonia too?.
- Someplace like that.

56
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
But I never dreamed you'd
do a show so personally relevant.

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,300
You have a question for Dr. Richmond?.
- He sure likes hearing himself talk.

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Where are you calling from?.

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,300
Ed?.

60
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,400
I called because
the focus of your show tonight

61
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,500
is what makes boys
kill their mothers.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,800
But so far, your guests haven't
given us any insight into that.

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,300
I thought maybe I could help.
I'm a member of the doctor's...

64
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,400
What did he call it?. "Sphere."

65
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,600
Are you saying
you killed your mother, Ed?.

66
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900
Oh, I've killed before.

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,900
And now I have to do it again.

68
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,600
How old were you
when you killed your mother, Ed?.

69
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,700
I killed some other women too.

70
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,900
The first one
just wanted to have sex with me.

71
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Wanted to have sex with you?.
Is that grounds for murder?.

72
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
In my mother's eyes it was.

73
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,600
Sip?.

74
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
No thank you.

75
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,900
It's not like I have cooties.
- That's not what I meant.

76
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You look glad to see me.

77
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Anyone would be.
- Come on,

78
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,100
Iet's go watch the fireworks show
in the park!

79
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't leave the office.

80
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,000
You know what fascinates me about you?.
The way you keep to yourself.

81
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,800
I bet you can keep your mouth shut
about things. - What things?.

82
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
Do fireworks get you hot?.

83
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,700
Not inordinately.

84
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Inordinately...
I love sexy words!

85
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,200
I never heard a girl
talk like you before.

86
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,200
I guess we can see the show from here.

87
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Best place would be from up there.
That room up there.

88
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,600
That's my mother's room.

89
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
She's in bed.

90
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,600
Asleep?.
- Probably tossing and turning.

91
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,200
Hasn't been herself lately.

92
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,900
Will you show me your room?.

93
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,700
My mother'd love to catch me
sneaking a girl into my room!

94
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Then we'd better go now,
while she's still tossing and turning.

95
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,800
You want to, don't you?.

96
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,500
Let's go in the office.

97
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,000
Where?. On the floor?.
What kind of a girl do you think am l?.

98
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,800
There's a parlor in the back.
- Hey, boy!

99
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,900
Toilet's clogged up!
- I'll be right there.

100
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
Go on!

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,300
Wait in the parlor.

102
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Yeah?.

103
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Why are you here?.

104
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,400
What in the hell are you doing?.
- Just scaring you. Scaredy-cat!

105
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,900
Why my mother's room?.
- I thought it was yours.

106
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Shh! We'll wake up your mother.

107
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
This way!

108
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,400
Oh, it's stifling in here!

109
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm not embarrassing you, am l?.

110
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,300
What?.
- I thought I heard...

111
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Unhook me.

112
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
Let me.

113
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
You'd like to touch them...

114
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,100
Wouldn't you?.

115
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Put them down!

116
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,200
Is it a good smell?.

117
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,600
Not inordinately.

118
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you hear that?.
- It's the fireworks.

119
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,500
I'd better go check. Make sure
she's OK. - Your mother?.

120
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,100
Will you just stay here?.
- Since you said "please."

121
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Get that whore out of my house!

122
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
She's not a whore.

123
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,600
I said get rid of her!
Or do I have to do it myself?.

124
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
No, Mother. I'll get rid of her.

125
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,300
Kill her!
- Kill her?.

126
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,600
I can't.
No! No, I can't!

127
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,500
Alright, then I'll do it for you.

128
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,200
Come here, Norman.
Put your ear next to Mommy's lips.

129
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Come close to me.

130
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,400
We can't have girls in this house.
Listen to me:

131
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,300
You're my boy,
and I want you to stay my boy.

132
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,800
You're my best friend.

133
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,000
A boy and his mother should be close.

134
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,100
Norman!

135
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,600
Norman,
I know you're alone in there.

136
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,700
Mother! Oh God, Mother!

137
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Blood! Blood!

138
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,600
Was this the first time

139
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,500
you had a conversation with a corpse?.

140
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,000
Actually, we started conversing
soon after I killed her.

141
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,300
But I couldn't make her voice
sound as sweet as it was.

142
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,800
She was dead,
and in my mind, she grew old.

143
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Tell me, Ed. Where were you living
when you became a mother-killer?.

144
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,100
What's geography got to do with it?.
- Why won't you answer me?.

145
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Maybe it's not important.

146
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Ed, we're anxious to shed some light
on this most unbearable subj...

147
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Hello?.

148
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,300
You okay?.
- Yeah, I just cut myself.

149
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Bad?.
- No. Anything wrong?.

150
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Guess what I didn't pick up today?.
- The cake.

151
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm sorry. Can you do it?.

152
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,000
I can bake one easier.
- You couldn't say what I want on it.

153
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm not so good at icing.

154
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,300
So?. Will you?.
- Bakery'll be closed by now.

155
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,700
Nope. It's an all-night market.

156
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,800
Dinner'll be ruined if I leave it.

157
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Anyway, isn't it bad luck for a guy
to pick up his own birthday cake?.

158
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,700
I'll see if they can deliver it.
I can keep it cold downstairs.

159
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,900
Are you upset?.
- About what?.

160
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,000
What we spoke about before.

161
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,300
The good news.

162
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
If it's so good,
why would I be upset?.

163
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,600
It'll work out, Norman. You'll see.

164
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,900
Something's burning. See you soon.

165
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,300
... and the author of the book,
"The Mother-Killers."

166
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,100
In our last hour, we had a caller
who said he murdered his own mother.

167
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,500
We're hoping to hear from him again.

168
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,800
Ed, if you're listening,
we'd very much like to hear from you,

169
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,300
because, well, you've been there.

170
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,200
It's "Talk of the Town"...

171
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,400
KTK AM.
- KTK, can I help you?.

172
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh, Ed! Hold on a second.

173
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,800
The pulse of Central California!

174
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,100
Great! Welcome back, Ed.

175
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,700
Thanks. - Want to tell us
about your mother?. How she...

176
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,400
drove you to become
what you became?.

177
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,700
No, it wasn't her fault.

178
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,900
She was the product of her time,
the age of sexual repression.

179
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,100
You make her sound
positively Victorian.

180
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,200
Did all this happen in this century?.
- You were saying, Ed...

181
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,900
That my mother wasn't totally bad.
- I guess nobody's mother is.

182
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,700
If your caller is so anxious
to give us some insight into

183
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
what makes boys kill their mothers...
- Right. Ed...

184
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,100
What we need to know is,
what she did to you.

185
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,800
Did she smother you in some way,
the way some of us mothers do?.

186
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
Not inordinately.

187
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,400
She just made me feel unsure.

188
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,600
I never knew what to expect.

189
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,300
She'd be sweet one moment,
and then suddenly turn... mean.

190
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,700
She was that way with my father too.
Of course, with him, she was also...

191
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,900
You know, frigid.

192
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,300
You sound very sympathetic, Ed.
You must've loved her a lot.

193
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,100
A boy's best friend is his mother.

194
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
What about your father?.

195
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
He died when I was six.

196
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,200
He was stung to death by bees.

197
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,700
They stung his eyes, his nostrils,
even the insides of his mouth.

198
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,400
I was worried about my mother,
seeing him lying in that box.

199
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
He looked so horrible,

200
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,200
they had to cover his face
with a silk handkerchief.

201
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,000
I felt awful sad, mainly
because of how my mother looked.

202
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,900
How she looked always decided
how I felt at any given moment.

203
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,900
And she looked so sorrowful,
all in black.

204
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,900
I was too shocked to laugh.

205
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,600
I mean, I was real ticklish,
but this time...

206
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,400
I couldn't help it,
I giggled out loud.

207
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,300
Show some respect for the dead!

208
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
As if it were my fault!

209
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,700
Connie called and asked me
to say they'll bring her the cake.

210
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,900
She said your line's been busy.
- Thank you, Mrs. Lane.

211
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,100
I didn't realize
it was your birthday, Norman.

212
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,900
I might have something for you.

213
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,800
That's alright. Please, don't bother.
- I don't mind being bothered.

214
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,100
Thank you, Mrs. Lane.

215
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,100
Let's get back to "Talk of the Town"
with Fran Ambrose.

216
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,500
Go ahead, caller. - It sounds like
I shouldn't tickle my kid,

217
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,700
or he'll grow up and kill me.
- Maybe we should stop here.

218
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
Don't let this guy go!

219
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,700
No, Ed, don't! How about telling me
some good things about your mother?.

220
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,100
Good things?.

221
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,000
She had the most beautiful hair.

222
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
She usually wore it all tight
and locked up like a schoolmarm.

223
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
But sometimes,
when we were alone...

224
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,200
Hair, hundreds of light-years long.

225
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,600
In the cosmic scheme of things,
I know little boys are small.

226
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
But some days they can be...

227
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,700
Some days, little boys can be...
giants.

228
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
That's beautiful... poetry.

229
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
This is Fran Ambrose,
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

230
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,900
Tonight we're talking with a caller
who says he killed his mother.

231
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,700
Plus her boyfriend!

232
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,300
Did he abuse you too?.

233
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
No.

234
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,100
But she didn't need him.

235
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,000
He didn't make her life any better
than it was when all she had was...

236
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
me.

237
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,100
I was the man of the house.
She used to call me that.

238
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,100
I practically ran the motel
single-handedly by the time I was 15.

239
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,800
She depended on me.
Especially when she was scared.

240
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,500
She was scared to death
of thunder and lightning.

241
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Norman, come over here!

242
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No, not with those wet clothes!
Take them off!

243
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,300
Now hold me!

244
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,000
That night, I realized suddenly
that I was... I guess you could say

245
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,100
I had gotten
a little too big for my britches.

246
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,000
What's the matter with you?.

247
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,100
Norman?.

248
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,700
Norman!

249
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,100
What's wrong with you?. You sick?.

250
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,300
It's a wonder you don't have 101
exotic diseases, living in this mess!

251
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Mother, go back to bed.
You'll catch a cold.

252
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,500
A lot you'd care!
Sometimes I think you loathe me.

253
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,000
I could never loathe you.
Why do you say that?.

254
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,600
Always running from me.
Just when I need you most.

255
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,600
On a night like...

256
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,500
What is this?.

257
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,700
You dirty little pig!
Take that right out to the garbage!

258
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
No! Go as you are!

259
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,500
Maybe the rain'll wash
some of the dirt out of your system.

260
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,100
Pig! Dirty pig!
Dirty whoremongering pig!

261
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Some day, I'm going to wish
I'd been firmer with you.

262
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,700
I'd like to ask Ed
a question or two.

263
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,500
That all right with you, Ed?.
- Maybe.

264
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Your mother's abuse...

265
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,400
You didn't mind it, so long as
it was just the two of you. Right?.

266
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,900
Bad as it was, it was okay,
perhaps even enjoyable,

267
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,800
until she brought home a boyfriend?.

268
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,400
Could it be
there was a little jealousy there, Ed?.

269
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,500
If the doctor's trying to turn this
into some kind of incest tragedy,

270
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,500
tell him to forget it, Fran.
- Forget it, Doc.

271
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,000
If it was that kind of thing,
would I have killed those other women?.

272
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,500
How many did you kill?.

273
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,200
Fran?.
- I'm here.

274
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,500
Lots of authorities think
my "problem" is a matter of genetics.

275
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,200
You mean, how parents treat you
doesn't influence what you become?.

276
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Just about.

277
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
But you know better, don't you?.

278
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,400
One day I got home from school early.
I saw my mother going into a cabin.

279
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
I went in, and l...

280
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,800
peeped at her through a hole
that my father had made.

281
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,700
You peeped into the cabin and
watched your mother doing what?.

282
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Losing her mind.

283
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,700
Did she ever catch you spying?.

284
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,100
God knows
what she would've done to me!

285
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,100
Her cruelty could come
straight from the heart.

286
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:30,400
The summer before I killed her
was the hottest summer in history.

287
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,800
My mother hated the heat.
It made her feel...

288
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,700
Iike a dog.

289
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,400
I made it with a few drops of vanilla,
just the way you like it.

290
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm dying from this heat.
You'll wish you'd been nice to me.

291
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,400
Blot me
with some orange-flower water.

292
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,300
What should I use?.
- Your fingers.

293
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,900
Unless my skin disgusts you.

294
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,800
Does it?.
- No. Of course not. Don't be silly.

295
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
Then don't you be silly. Blot me!

296
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Do my legs first.

297
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Start at the ankles.
Find the pulse.

298
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Careless child!
Spilling Mommy's orange-flower water!

299
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Wicked boy!
- I'll buy you another bottle, honest!

300
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,400
Get off me!

301
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,000
You'll forget once and for all
about that filthy thing of yours!

302
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,000
You'll forget that you even have one.
Do you understand me, boy?.

303
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,700
There! That should help you forget.
See?. Look at yourself, boy!

304
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,500
Ha! Girl! Yes, girl!

305
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,300
Mama's little girl!
- No I'm not!

306
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,900
No, Mother, please!

307
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Mother!

308
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,300
Please, Mother, don't leave me here!

309
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,300
Here, you'll need this.
You'll stay locked in there

310
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,300
until you accept that you're a girl.

311
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,300
You'll probably have to go wee-wee.
Squat over this.

312
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,600
That's all that thing is good for,
making wee-wee. Is that clear?.

313
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,800
Answer me! Is that clear, Norma?.

314
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,100
Please! Mother!

315
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Don't leave me!

316
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,400
Please!

317
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,000
Please dear God,
don't let her leave me here.

318
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,200
Mother! Please! Mother!

319
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,700
No...

320
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,700
Please God, don't let her
leave me here! Please! Mother!

321
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,700
Ed, are you there?.

322
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,700
Ed, are you all right?.

323
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,300
Ed?.

324
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,800
I said yes.
- We didn't hear it.

325
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,400
I nodded.

326
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
We can't hear nods.

327
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,800
I'll be right back.

329
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,100
Tomorrow on the show:
"Right to life, or wrong."

330
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,800
Fran talks abortion
with Archbishop Anthony Taylor,

331
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,200
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

332
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,500
Mike, listen to this!
Tell him what you just told me.

333
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,900
This guy "Ed"...
I've been putting 2 and 2 together:

334
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,500
the mother, the boyfriend,
the motel, the other killings...

335
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,100
I'm convinced it's Norman Bates.
- The guy at the top of the show,

336
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,400
who became his mother.
- Gimme a break! - The point is...

337
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,900
Any threat that Norman Bates makes
must be taken very seriously.

338
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,500
He said: "Now I have to kill again."
- We need to find out who.

339
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,400
How do you plan to do that?.
- I don't know. My own style.

340
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,000
Meaning she'll ask him flat out.

341
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,300
If you've been listening,
you know he doesn't like that.

342
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,700
Let me go to work on him.
I can reach him.

343
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,800
I examined him after
he killed that girl in the shower.

344
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,400
Shouldn't I call the police?.
- He hasn't done anything yet.

345
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,100
We don't even know if it's him.
- What if it is?.

346
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,900
It could be important to know
where he is. - Fairvale, California.

347
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Call someone there. Not the police.
-The newspaper?. - Good idea.

348
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Find out if he's still at the motel.
Don't get anybody's ass

349
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,600
in an uproar.
Let's keep this our problem for now.

350
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,200
We're back. This is Fran Ambrose on
KTK, "Talk of the Town."

351
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,400
Tell me, Ed: when your mother
castrated you like that...

352
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,600
Castrated?.

353
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,000
Symbolically.
You must've felt like killing her.

354
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,900
I never felt like killing her.
Or anybody else.

355
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,100
But you did. And other women too.
And now you want to do it again.

356
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,100
That jerk's going to make
him hang up!

357
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,400
Look, Fran.

358
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,400
Maybe I oughta give
another mother-killer a chance

359
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,600
to call up and talk to you.

360
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,200
Ed, what was it:
3, 4 years later that you killed her?.

361
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,200
Not that long. About a year.

362
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,800
What's the matter?. What'd I do?.
- Nothing! Nothing!

363
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Then why are you hitting me?.
- Who else can I hit?.

364
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,900
It won't be built by the highway,
where the world could see us.

365
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,800
It'll be miles away!
Nobody'll even know we're here.

366
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,300
They'll put us out of business.

367
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,200
What am I going to do?.
How will we live?. You...

368
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,800
You're just like my father!
Never a drop of sympathy!

369
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,500
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?. What good are you,

370
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,300
if you can't show sympathy?.
- How?. - No, you just cause trouble.

371
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,300
Because of you, my bladder's damaged.
That's why I can't hold my water.

372
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,600
Did you know that?.
- Yes.

373
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,900
I was fine until I gave birth to you.
You caused a lot of damage!

374
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,900
I should've gotten rid of you.

375
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,000
Nothing you've done merits
all I've had to go through with you.

376
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,700
I should've killed you in my womb.
You sure as hell tried to kill me.

377
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,900
She sounds horrible.

378
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,300
It wasn't always like that.
You didn't know her.

379
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,600
She was a remarkable woman.
- So remarkable that you murdered her.

380
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,400
Ed, can you hold on?.
We've got to take a break.

381
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,200
This is Fran Ambrose
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

382
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,800
We'll be right back.

383
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,800
No disrespect, but Ed has
a lot of hostility against you.

384
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,800
Norman.
- That's why he's ignoring you.

385
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,300
Maybe you're better trained for this.

386
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,900
I'm just a talk show host,
but I know people.

387
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,900
And whatever Bates is, he's people.
- Two people.

388
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,800
One talks like a poet,
the other stabs women.

389
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,200
Bates left town years ago,
after the motel murders.

390
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,300
The place is a wreck.

391
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,300
Did you think to ask
where Norman did time?.

392
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,100
Fran said, this is "our problem."
- Doc, why don't you stay out of this?.

393
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,900
Are you asking me to leave?.
- No. Ellen will make you coffee,

394
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,300
and l... - You want to question a
psychopath without professional help?.

395
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,500
Maybe he's had enough
professional help!

396
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,300
Do you want to be responsible
for what he does after he hangs up?.

397
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I suggest you trace that call,
then contact the authorities.

398
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
We can't trace calls. And besides,
I don't think I like your attitude!

399
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,000
I won't be a party to this!
- Just a minute! - My way or yours!

400
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,300
Thanks for letting us plug your book.
- I can't believe it!

401
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,400
You'd let human beings
get killed for ratings?.

402
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,100
Ratings have nothing to do with it!
- They do to me.

403
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Maybe we can help him. I wanna hear
his story, and so do they.

404
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,300
Try it your way, and fail!
That murder will be on your head.

405
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,600
Fran Ambrose wants to talk to you!
Call the KTK talkline,

406
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,600
1-800-555-TALK.

407
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,700
Ed?. I didn't lose you, did l?.

408
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,100
Ed?. - I wouldn't hang up like that.
I think of you as a friend.

409
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,700
I hope you mean that.
- It's late. My wife'll be home soon.

410
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,700
I'm cooking tonight. It's my birthday.

411
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,800
Where did you meet her?.
- At the institution. - How romantic!

412
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,800
She was a patient too?.
- No. She works there.

413
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,300
She's a psychologist. One of the best.

414
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,600
The moment I met her, I said:
"You'll bring peace to many souls."

415
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,600
I wasn't just coming on to her.
She likes me for that.

416
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,400
Was it love at first sight?.

417
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,200
It was for her.
It took me a few more sights.

418
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:25,000
How quick did you get married?.
- Not very quick. I was hesitant...

419
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,700
So you've been living happily
ever after in your little home?.

420
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,800
It's her house.
From a previous marriage.

421
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,000
What's with Dr. Richmond?.
Haven't heard from him lately.

422
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,400
He had to catch a plane.
Book promotion tours are brutal.

423
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
Do you both live near the institution?.

424
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,600
Shouldn't we be getting back
to the focus of your show?.

425
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,700
Yeah. Well, how did you...

426
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,800
kill you mother?.

427
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,100
Slowly.

428
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,300
I'm wondering,
and I'm sure our listeners are too:

429
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,900
What was the last straw?.
Of all the things your mother did,

430
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,300
what really drove you to murder?.

431
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,800
It began the night she brought
that man home for the first time.

432
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,000
Good morning, good morning!

433
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,100
This is one morning you won't spoil!

434
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,500
Eat your breakfast and be off.
You don't want to be late.

435
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,800
Wait!

436
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,800
You saw us, didn't you?.

437
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,300
What do you mean?.

438
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,000
You were at the window.
You saw me and Chet, didn't you?.

439
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,700
Chet?.
- Chet Rudolph.

440
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,400
We're getting married,
as soon as he gets his divorce.

441
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,100
Where did you find him?.
Since when do you go to cheap bars?.

442
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,200
He does happen to be a bartender.

443
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Used to be, rather.
He'll start working here,

444
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,600
at our motel.
He's also going to live here,

445
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,500
in my house.

446
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,200
So you'd better get used to it.

447
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,000
Good morning, darling.

448
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,000
You two say hello to each other.

449
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,100
Hi there, Normie!
- You take my father's robe off!

450
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,000
No underwear.

451
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,600
You see, Norman...

452
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,900
You only want to be naked
around a lady when you're having sex.

453
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,200
Otherwise, it just ain't respectful.

454
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,000
Good toast!

455
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,700
Sensitive boy!

456
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,000
You weren't
about to give that man a chance.

457
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,300
He didn't deserve her.

458
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,000
Good. Nice, soft grass.
Won't hurt as much when you deck me.

459
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,700
Aw, come on, Norman!

460
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,200
I'm sorry. Sometimes,
I just don't know my own strength.

461
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,600
Now come on and get me back.

462
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,300
Come on. Get even!

463
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,000
What's the matter, Norman?. Come on!

464
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,700
You're not a girl, are you?.

465
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,400
Your mama swore to me you was a boy.

466
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,900
Not too badly hung either.

467
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,800
That's what she said!
- Shut up!

468
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,500
Kid's got potential.

469
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Ed, are you there?.

470
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You still with us, Ed?.

471
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,600
This is the Fran Ambrose Show
on KTK AM 490.

472
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,200
We'll be right back.
- KTK reports possible thunder...

473
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,300
I called the police in Fairvale.
- And?.

474
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,000
They were helpful,
until I asked where Bates got sent.

475
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,200
"Sorry, privileged information."
- I know the type.

476
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,600
Should I call the newspaper again?.
Maybe they can help.

477
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
It's your friend, Ed!

478
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,300
Welcome back, Ed.
Thanks for staying with us.

479
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,300
Sure. - Look,
about you having to kill again...

480
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,800
Is your mother making you do it?.
- She has nothing to do with it.

481
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,600
Not directly. But she's always had
a strong influence on my behavior.

482
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,700
After all, I have her seed in me.

483
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,100
After the last murder four years ago,

484
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,700
murders, plural,

485
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,400
I wanted to be executed,
or locked away for life,

486
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,100
so I'd never hurt anyone again.

487
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:27,200
I wanted to protect the world from
this bad seed known as "Norman Bates."

488
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,400
Instead, they sent me
to a place a lot like Sedonia...

489
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:39,900
The same rough therapy,
the same phased re-entry into society.

490
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,700
What I need to know is:
Why ruin this great new life of yours?.

491
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:51,000
I don't know who you intend to kill,

492
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,600
but whoever it is,
is it worth losing everything?.

493
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,700
Because that's what'll happen

494
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,800
when you get caught.
Unless you let me help you.

495
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,100
Help me not to get caught?.
- Don't get flippant about this!

496
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,400
You don't want to flush your new life
down the toilet.

497
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,100
I think you want me to stop you.

498
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,400
You're wrong,
and I can prove it by hanging up.

499
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,400
Let's give you a break, Ed.
Take another call.

500
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,500
Andrew,
first-time caller from Stockton.

501
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,300
This girl he killed,
'cause she wanted to have sex...

502
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,700
Discussing past victims
might not be productive. - Victims?.

503
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,800
The second one was an older woman.

504
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,200
Didn't you do a show recently
on young men and older women?.

505
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,400
I don't remember how I wound up
in her car at 2 in the morning.

506
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,500
Baby, your tongue
is like an elephant's memory!

507
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,800
No, wait...

508
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,800
Let me catch my breath, okay?.

509
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,500
Oh God! - What?.
- I forgot...

510
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,000
I have to give my mother
her 2 o'clock medication.

511
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,200
I'll be right back.

512
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Then I'll take you
someplace real private.

513
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,600
You mean it?.

514
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,200
Why did you bring her here?.
- I didn't.

515
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Don't lie to me!
I know about your cheap, erotic urges.

516
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,200
I wouldn't lie to you. - You would!
All men lie to their mothers

517
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,800
about their cheap desires.
You're no different!

518
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,700
Drive, whore!

519
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,900
No!

520
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,200
Stop!

521
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,700
No!

522
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,300
No!

523
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,400
Your plan to kill someone...
Are you going to do it again?.

524
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,600
Is your mother making you do it?.

525
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,900
Mother's not here anymore. She's dead.

526
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,900
Are you angry about that?.
- Not really. Talking with you

527
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,700
has helped a lot. - You mean you don't
feel as much like killing as before?.

528
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,500
I'm not feeling the emptiness as bad.

529
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,700
You've been feeling it from day 1.

530
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,500
It didn't start
until I saw her in her coffin.

531
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,300
It was OK when she was in the morgue.

532
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,200
But when they brought
her home in that thing,

533
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,300
I knew a pain
that I can only call "soul cancer '."

534
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,000
I had to have her back,
any way I could.

535
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,900
The undertaker put a wig on her,
because of what the strychnine did.

536
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,500
But I had to have her,
even without her crowning glory.

537
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,700
I had this hobby: taxidermy.
A passion, really.

538
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,500
I'd made so many little animals
look like they came back to life,

539
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,600
why couldn't I do it for her?.

540
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:38,000
Matricide is probably
the most unbearable crime of all,

541
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,200
most unbearable to the son
who commits it.

542
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,600
Norman,
we go off the air at 10 o'clock.

543
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,500
Think how your wife's gonna feel
when the police call her

544
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,400
to the hospital, or to the morgue.
This time your victim may strike back.

545
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,500
You may wind up dead.
What a loss that'll be for her!

546
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,800
She believes in you, Norman.

547
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,100
She must! She fell in love
with you at the mental institution,

548
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,600
and now you're going to

549
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,800
dash her faith to pieces?.
- I don't care. She deserves to die.

550
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,600
You're gonna... kill your wife?.

551
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,900
Call that newspaper. Tell 'em
it's a matter of life and death!

552
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,700
Norman, why?.
You said she deserved to die. How?.

553
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,700
What did she do
that she should pay with her life?.

554
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,400
She let herself get pregnant!

555
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Aha.
- I thought I'd convinced her

556
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,600
what a mistake it'd be to have kids.
Before we got married, I said:

557
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,300
"No kids, Connie. I've killed
damn near a dozen human beings.

558
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,100
I may be well now,
but I'll never be cured.

559
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,600
I'm still who I always was. My genes
are the ones I got from my mother.

560
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,800
I'm still her flesh and blood!

561
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:18,100
The Bates line ends with me."
And finally, she said okay.

562
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,500
Maybe she got pregnant by accident?.
- When she called,

563
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,900
she'd just heard from the doctor.
She didn't tell me

564
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,700
she went off the pill, because
she didn't want to stop making love.

565
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,200
We called it "making love."

566
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:38,700
But it wasn't supposed
to bring forth another monster.

567
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:45,000
So she planned this on her own,
after you said this to her?.

568
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,800
She just doesn't believe
than my problem can be genetic.

569
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,800
Scientists have proven that
the cause for my kind of insanity

570
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,000
is genetic.
But she just doesn't buy it.

571
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,400
What does she expect you to do?.
She knows your history.

572
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,800
She says she has faith in me.

573
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,600
Norman, we've only a little time left.
If we haven't talked this out,

574
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,600
will you stay on the line?.
We can talk on the phone just as easy.

575
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,100
I don't think
you wanna kill your wife.

576
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,100
That's why you called in.
Thank God you did, it's not too late.

577
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,700
It is too late. My mind's made up.
- But maybe Connie's isn't.

578
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,100
She can end this pregnancy.
- She'd never do that.

579
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,200
There's your God!

580
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Your mother's not here anymore.
Remember?. She can't tell you

581
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:51,600
what to do now. - That's right.
This time it'll be with my own hands.

582
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,300
Just like the first time.

583
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,700
Go down and see what's
keeping that boy. I'm so thirsty!

584
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,200
We can't have that now, can we?.

585
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,600
Wow! Room service has arrived!

586
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Not a word about my new kimono?.
- It's lurid.

587
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,100
It's "lurid"?.

588
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,400
Where does that boy get his ways?.
- Not from me.

589
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,700
Turn on the radio, will you?.

590
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,000
What is it?.

591
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,100
No!

592
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
It's poisonous!

593
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,700
You dirty little bastard!

594
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,900
You're dead! You hear me?. Dead!

595
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,500
You're dead!

596
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,900
Kill him! Kill the little bastard!

597
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,200
Norman!

598
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,900
Norman, will you stay on the line?.

599
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,200
Will you stay on the line?.

600
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,900
Please, once you hang up...
- That's the end of the Ambrose Show.

601
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:47,100
What did you say?.
- I said, the show's over.

602
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,700
San Joaquin Hospital...

603
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,100
It's for you.

604
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,300
Take a message.
- It's your husband.

605
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,600
Thanks.

606
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,400
Norman?.

607
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,900
Will you be coming home soon?.
- I was just leaving. Want anything?.

608
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,100
Don't come home.
Meet me at my mother's house.

609
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,800
Where?. - You heard me.
- Why?. - It's my birthday, isn't it?.

610
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:35,900
Yes, but... that sounds a bit morbid.
- I'm hanging up and driving there.

611
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,900
I'm expecting you, Connie.
- Norman, wait!

612
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,100
Just me and my trusty umbrella.

613
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,400
Ow!

614
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,900
Norman,

615
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,800
what are we doing here?.

616
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,700
Come on!

617
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:14,600
I tricked you, I had to. I hated it,
but I didn't know any other way.

618
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,800
I love you so much.

619
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,800
I want us to have a baby so much.

620
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,600
Oh, Norman, don't you see?.

621
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,700
We'll love our baby.

622
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,000
Our love will
make it grow strong and healthy.

623
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,800
But what if I can't love it?.

624
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:46,200
Why couldn't you?.
You can love. You do!

625
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,500
You love me.

626
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,800
Stop!

627
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,700
Stay!

628
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,200
You don't trust me.

629
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,900
All that faith and no potatoes.

630
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,800
Connie!

631
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,100
No!

632
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,000
Look at yourself!

633
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,100
You're not that person now, Norman.

634
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,600
You're not a killer, Norman.

635
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,700
Our baby won't be a monster.

636
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:55,600
Don't I count?.
I've never taken anyone's life.

637
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:01,200
I love you. Our baby will love you.
Give us a chance!

638
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,600
No more blood, Norman!

639
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,700
Please, no more blood!

640
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,500
Wait in the car.

641
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,700
I'm gonna get rid of the past.
For good. - How?.

642
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,700
I should've killed you in my womb!

643
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,700
What's the matter?.
You're not a girl, are you?.

644
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
Norman! Norman!

645
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,100
I'm not embarrassing you, am l?.

646
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,500
Go!

647
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,900
Connie!

648
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,600
Show some respect for the dead!

649
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,100
Help! Somebody please help!

650
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,800
No!

651
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,000
Norman!

652
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,700
I'm free!

653
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,900
Let me out of here! Norman!
Do you hear me, boy?.

654
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,500
Let me out!
