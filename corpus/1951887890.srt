1
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,697
<i>In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson...</i>

2
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,501
<i>commissioned Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark...</i>

3
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,442
<i>to explore the vast,
uncharted territories of the Northwest.</i>

4
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,179
<i>What most people don't know
is that there was a second expedition...</i>

5
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,045
<i>led by two other men...</i>

6
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,277
<i>men that may not have
possessed the courage...</i>

7
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,980
<i>vision, or intelligence of Lewis and Clark...</i>

8
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,250
<i>but men nonetheless.</i>

9
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:58,560
<i>Their story, such as it is,
begins in Arlington, Virginia.</i>

10
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:21,145
It'll take more than a couple of fops
to take me down!

11
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:27,720
I hope Satan himself burns the flesh
from your miserable bones!

12
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,982
Good God, lady!

13
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,921
Get your hands off me!

14
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,655
Leave me alone!

15
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,648
Faster, man. Faster. But not too fast.

16
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:01,050
As much haste as possible while
maintaining a tolerable level of comfort.

17
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,115
A man's life is at stake.

18
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,181
No!

19
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:08,092
On March 25, 1804...

20
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,192
Bartholomew Hunt...

21
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:14,468
a tracker employed by the army
of the United States of America...

22
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,062
was found guiIty of drunken
and disorderly conduct...

23
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,267
in the presence of an officer.

24
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,434
Then later...

25
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,742
he forced that officer to waItz with him
through a crowded mess hall.

26
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,944
Have you anything to say?

27
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,082
Yes, I do.

28
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:39,256
When I am dead
and have passed on to the next world...

29
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,856
I want you to lower me
from these gallows and...

30
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,195
kiss my hairy buttocks!

31
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,631
Hang him !

32
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,834
Take him down and choke him !

33
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,443
Hang him !

34
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,577
May God have mercy on this man.

35
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,122
Out of the way. Get back.

36
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:23,895
I have a stay of execution
signed by President Jefferson himself.

37
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:28,000
See? He signed it right here.
''Thomas Jefferson.''

38
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,472
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

39
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,122
Mr. Hunt, I plan on being the first man
to map a route to the Pacific.

40
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,421
But I require an expert guide.

41
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,089
lf you wanted a tracker,
why did you choose me?

42
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:51,895
-Why didn't you get William Clark?
-Don't you think I tried?

43
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:57,336
Meriwether Lewis beat me to him.
I'm sick to death of those two.

44
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,967
Lewis and Clark this. Lewis and Clark that.

45
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:03,274
We'll see who talks about them
after we beat them to the Pacific.

46
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,213
Then we'll see who gets invited
to the finest parties.

47
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:10,946
We'll see who's able to parlay their
accomplishments into a political career.

48
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,848
When the history books are written...

49
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,551
Lewis and Clark will be
but a footnote to a footnote...

50
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,720
and I, sir, will be the note.

51
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,234
My hands will grow rough,
my teeth may yellow...

52
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,204
I might even experience
a general soreness in the joints.

53
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:34,107
Yes, this mission will be
a treacherous one, make no mistake.

54
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,977
We will face danger from savages
and from bears.

55
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:43,148
These bears are wild, mind you.
Not trained carnival bears...

56
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,752
-with little hats.
-Sounds exhilarating, sir.

57
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:52,157
Few men would have the courage
for such an endeavor.

58
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,732
I'm not afraid, Mr. Burr.
My mind will protect me.

59
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,493
I'm a man of science, a man of learning...

60
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,470
a man who knows
how to buy the finest books.

61
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:07,098
Fear will be our breakfast,
and stark-raving terror our daily luncheon.

62
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,572
Mr. Hunt?

63
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,377
Mr. Hunt?

64
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,881
I'd be more worried about the Indians
than the bears.

65
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:20,013
It's common knowledge that...

66
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,115
when the savages capture a white man...

67
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,319
they will split open his head...

68
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,794
pick out his brains, and eat them...

69
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,631
with a crudely fashioned fork. So....

70
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,604
Have you witnessed such atrocities,
Mr. Hunt?

71
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,672
I've seen the forks.

72
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,315
You look like a man
who appreciates good whiskey.

73
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,551
Thank you, sir.

74
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,287
But I fear inebriation may cause me
to forget my manners...

75
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,352
in such fine company.

76
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,294
Good God, man,
I'm not talking about getting blind drunk.

77
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,766
I just meant for you to have a taste.

78
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:09,737
Well then, taste it shall be.

79
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,277
Not bad.

80
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,320
How about you get your own bottle?

81
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,404
Good morning.

82
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,635
I had Jonah put you in here last night.

83
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:50,073
It seemed a barn was the only suitable
place for a man in your condition.

84
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,343
I think there was something wrong
with that whiskey.

85
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,808
My head is splitting open.

86
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,813
I'm surprised you're hungover at all...

87
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:02,688
considering the amount you regurgitated
into the harpsichord.

88
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,194
Look. Sorry about that.

89
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,357
I'd better go now.

90
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:18,440
Mr. Hunt,
I cannot go on this journey without you.

91
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,710
I'm offering you a full partnership.
What do you think of that?

92
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,774
I think it ain't worth the spit you wasted
saying it.

93
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,249
I'm also willing to pay you $100.

94
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,020
-$200.
-$125.

95
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,722
$150.

96
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,388
Deal.

97
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,001
Great things are in store for us.
Soon our names will be on the lips of....

98
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,535
Well, on a great many influential lips.

99
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,903
Are you listening, Mr. Hunt?

100
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,344
I believe
those pigs would prefer their privacy.

101
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:09,921
Hell. I paid good money
to see this on stage in Louisville.

102
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:14,285
Of course, there the pigs were dressed
like the King and Queen of France.

103
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:18,126
Costumes. Legitimate theater.

104
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,544
I'm looking for Leslie Edwards.

105
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,141
-I am Leslie Edwards.
-My name's Jackson.

106
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:40,211
It's been my lifelong dream
to see the Pacific Ocean before I die.

107
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,551
Please take me with you.

108
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:46,288
An old bag of bones like you
wouldn't make it 100 yards upriver.

109
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:49,923
On my worst day
I could still beat the stuffing out of you...

110
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,899
you puffed-up crow's cock.

111
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,527
-No, you couldn't.
-I know.

112
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,098
Please take me with you.
I must see the Pacific.

113
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:03,304
-Can you deny an old man his dream?
-I cannot, and I will not.

114
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,137
Jackson, you may accompany us.

115
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,512
-Horse's ass.
-Turd!

116
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:13,280
-Help us load the boats.
-Sorry, can't do. I'm an old man.

117
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,417
Edwards, this man says you hired him
as an interpreter.

118
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,487
-You must be Guy Fontenot.
-I am.

119
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,363
It is my understanding
that you've mastered the languages...

120
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,131
of all the indigenous populations
from here to the Pacific.

121
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,729
-Who told you this?
-Why, you did, in your letter.

122
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,307
My letter?

123
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,343
The letter.

124
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,872
-Yes. Then it is the truth.
-Wonderful.

125
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,941
Which boat will we be in?

126
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,456
-We?
-Fontenot wants to bring his wife.

127
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,320
-I told him he can't.
-She's not my wife.

128
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:53,123
Not my wife. I buy her.

129
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,994
She belong to me as a property.

130
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:59,296
Well, the distinction has been noted.

131
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,863
Unfortunately, as you can see,
the boats have been fully loaded...

132
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:06,339
and we haven't even taken on my hats
and tea service.

133
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,377
They say you can't come.

134
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,474
You didn't let me finish.

135
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,780
Certainly we can make room.
I mean, who needs tea?

136
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,419
Let it be known...

137
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,524
that if I catch any man looking at her...

138
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:32,291
I will cut him like a pig.

139
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,795
Yes, I'll see if I can work that
into my speech.

140
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:47,809
Father.

141
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,785
Dear Lord in Heaven...

142
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,956
bless us as we leave this Christian world...

143
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,618
and give us courage to bring
your gospel of love and tolerance...

144
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,088
to the ignorant,
godless savages who await us.

145
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,293
Amen.

146
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:14,304
-All right. Let's go!
-Hold on, Mr. Hunt. Hold on, everyone.

147
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,773
I prepared a short address
to commemorate our embarkation.

148
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,446
Here we go.

149
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:24,111
Men, we are about to embark
on an unprecedented adventure...

150
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,916
to the great Northwest.

151
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,521
Unfortunately, Lewis and Clark
have a two-week head start...

152
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,618
so time is of the essence.

153
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,296
We will be pushing up the Missouri.

154
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,992
What? Against the current?

155
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,725
Mightn't it be easier
to go down the Mississippi...

156
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:44,637
-instead of up the Missouri?
-Yes, it most certainly would be.

157
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,565
We could go to New Orleans instead.

158
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:52,204
Gentlemen,
we have already been to New Orleans.

159
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,149
Sir, I've been to New Orleans.
It's wonderful.

160
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:58,846
I've been there as well.
The food alone is worth the trip.

161
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,555
The food, sir.

162
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,691
New Orleans.

163
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,254
All right, fine!

164
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,566
Any man who is too cowardly
to share the greatest adventure...

165
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,297
in our young country's history...

166
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:19,239
and would rather experience
the decadence of New Orleans, well...

167
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,071
then go right ahead.

168
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,749
Mr. Hunt, do something.

169
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,448
Next man who leaves for New Orleans...

170
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:38,591
will do so with a lead ball in his back!

171
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:42,258
Need I remind you
that you all have signed contracts?

172
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,923
What about them?

173
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:48,303
-They will be deaIt with.
-By who?

174
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,242
-All right, they escaped.
-Now get in the boat!

175
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,208
Everyone.

176
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,449
<i>And so our journey begins.</i>

177
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:07,980
<i>I believe the men and I share
a tremendous sense of excitement...</i>

178
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,651
<i>and anticipation for what lies ahead.</i>

179
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,563
Thank you, Higgins.

180
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:26,301
Your music will be a welcome companion
on our long journey.

181
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,233
Men, we'll be following
the map of trapper Pierre LeBlanc...

182
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:33,372
who explored the Missouri in 1792.

183
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,684
Hunt,
you've traversed most of these territories.

184
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,915
Tell the men
what they might expect to encounter.

185
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,487
Okay. Well...

186
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:46,125
-what I remember most were the animals.
-The animals.

187
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,226
Fearsome beasts
of the mountains and plains.

188
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,271
I seen a bear so powerful...

189
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,168
that it snapped a man's body in half
with his huge jaws.

190
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,310
I seen a badger with paws
as big as frying pans.

191
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,914
They'd rip your face right off. Right off!

192
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:17,117
There's nothing you can do with that.
Just rip it off.

193
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,218
Once there was a hawk
that swooped down from the sky...

194
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,393
and plucked a man's eyeballs
out of his sockets.

195
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:33,236
The fellow was screaming,
''I’m blind, I can't see!

196
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,606
''I can't get it off! ''

197
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,414
-Twice when I was fishing--
-Hunt...

198
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,517
-I think you're scaring the men.
-I think it's best they know.

199
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,749
Gives a man courage
to know what he's up against.

200
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,791
There's an animal now!

201
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:05,635
Kill him !

202
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,006
We can't kill it.

203
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,973
We're all dead!

204
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,310
-God save us!
-Hold your fire!

205
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,425
It’s only a squirrel.

206
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,932
He's got something in his hand!

207
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,170
<i>31 May, 1804.</i>

208
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:46,879
<i>We are now spending our first night
in the wilds.</i>

209
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,007
<i>From this point on...</i>

210
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,382
<i>hardship and deprivation will be
our constant companions.</i>

211
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,990
Jonah, it is absolutely brutal out here.

212
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,628
The water's nowhere near as hot
as it was in Virginia.

213
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,194
I wouldn't know, sir.

214
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:06,598
Personally, I just finished
washing my privates in the ice-cold river.

215
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:11,734
I think I’ll.... Yes, I think I’ll wear
my paisley robe this evening.

216
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,871
-It’s your prerogative, sir.
-Yes, it is.

217
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,012
Mr. Hunt here to see you, sir.

218
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:28,182
I just thought I'd tell you there's already
a problem with the men's morale.

219
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:31,192
It’s our first night out.
How can there already be a problem?

220
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,491
One faction feels that you're distant,
you don't care about them.

221
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:38,363
Another group feels that the original
high-minded goals of the expedition...

222
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,061
have been abandoned for quick profits.

223
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,031
You have to keep on top of these things.

224
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:52,745
...and we're all in this together.
We are no different from one another.

225
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:57,047
Except, of course, for our rank in society
and in this company.

226
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,784
Let us get better acquainted.

227
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,886
What do you do with your leisure time?

228
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,696
Leisure time.

229
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,260
You know, time for yourself
where you don't have to work.

230
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,132
Leisure.... Never mind.

231
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:23,775
You there, fingering that stomach wound.
Stand up and tell us a little about yourself.

232
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:29,045
-Me, sir?
-Yes, you. Bidwell, isn't it?

233
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,251
Yes, sir. What did you want to know?

234
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,360
Well, anything. Where are you from?
What's your family like?

235
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,593
Name's Bidwell, sir.

236
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,793
Yes, I know that.

237
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,403
All right. Well. Anyone else?

238
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,003
Sir, Higgins has a story.

239
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,871
Oh, yes. You're going to love this one.

240
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,141
Well, all right, Higgins. The floor is yours.

241
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:06,311
This particular event happened last
summer on my uncle's farm in Virginia.

242
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:10,586
My brother and I
had just finished cutting a field of hay...

243
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,853
and were enjoying the evening meal
under the shade of an elm tree.

244
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,495
He went down for water by the creek,
and while he was gone...

245
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:23,898
I took a bowl that was filled
with delicious plum pudding...

246
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,700
and placed into it, not one...

247
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,738
but two large pieces of sheep shit.

248
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,350
When he returned, I encouraged him
to taste the plum pudding.

249
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,015
And as sure as I’m standing
before you today, he did.

250
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,226
He ate it all. Shit pudding.

251
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,830
He ate shit pudding.

252
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:03,140
-You got your brother to eat sheep dung.
-Yes.

253
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,679
Yes, that's a very amusing story.

254
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:13,986
Tell him the ending. That's the best part.

255
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:20,455
And to be completely honest, sir,
I have no brother.

256
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:25,796
It was me! I ate sheep shit. I swear I did!

257
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:34,632
Yes, clever twist on the end there.

258
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:40,072
I think we've become well enough
acquainted for one evening.

259
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,778
Fun, fun.

260
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,689
He hasn't got a brother.

261
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:03,061
Higgins, when I said your music would be
a welcome companion, I didn't mean--

262
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:05,971
Don't you know any other goddamn tune?

263
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:10,343
-No, sir.
-Of course you do, lad.

264
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:14,270
Play them that haunting air
you played me this morning.

265
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,332
Quiet.

266
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,041
-What is it?
-Indians.

267
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,712
These are the Iowas.

268
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:53,685
Fontenot, please greet this man
in his native tongue.

269
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,417
Why do I laugh?

270
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:03,592
You see, of the hundreds of language
that I speak fluent...

271
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,634
this is not one of them.

272
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,400
Bad luck.

273
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:16,010
They do trade with whites.
He probably speaks English.

274
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,512
Good day. I bring you wishes for peace
from Thomas Jefferson...

275
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,814
the Great Chief of the Whites.

276
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:31,292
You've insulted him.
You forgot to introduce yourself.

277
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,526
I’m Bartholomew Hunt...

278
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,327
and this here is Leslie Edwards.

279
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,664
Your turn.

280
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:43,765
I was told you speak English. Is this so?

281
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:50,472
-We seem to be making some progress.
-Let me try something.

282
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:56,275
We wish to try....

283
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,718
Forget this.

284
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:07,091
We come in peace
on behalf of President Jefferson.

285
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:09,392
-You....
-Hunt.

286
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:20,005
-I am Chief Two Roads.
-lf you're the Chief, then who is that?

287
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,978
His name is Bent Twig.
He's not right in the head.

288
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,479
I’ve got it. Now what do I do with it?

289
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,915
-Put it on.
-All right.

290
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,440
Good news.
Looks like they're gonna let us live.

291
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:28,498
Let us live?

292
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,341
I had to give them
a few of your finer things, of course...

293
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:32,903
so they wouldn't kill us.

294
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:36,109
-They seemed so friendly.
-That's the way of the savage.

295
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:39,381
Pretend to be your friend, share a drink,
listen to your problems.

296
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,787
Next thing you know, they're scooping
your brains out with a spoon.

297
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:44,518
You mean a fork.

298
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,027
That would depend on the tribe.

299
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:54,163
Mr. Hunt,
the Iowas would never have killed us.

300
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:55,533
I know that.

301
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:59,062
I’m just not carrying that junk with us
the whole trip.

302
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,018
Help me! You keep away!

303
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,944
What the hell's going on?

304
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,488
Bidwell, take it easy.

305
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:19,990
What's happening here?

306
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,757
Sir, that French animal bit my ear off.

307
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,661
That's an absurd exaggeration.

308
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,864
My apologies, Bidwell.

309
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:31,633
He look in our tent.

310
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:35,437
He look at my woman. He saw her breast.

311
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:39,245
Her breast? You saw her breast?

312
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,181
I’ll say it before, and I said it again:

313
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,084
Any man who look on her will die.

314
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,526
Look at me.
I’m going to make an experiment.

315
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,530
Hello. Bidwell?

316
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:02,863
Can you hear me?

317
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,104
I can hear you, Pratt.

318
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:07,436
It works.

319
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,743
Well, of course it works.
He's standing right....

320
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,677
Let's get some sleep.

321
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,480
Good night, Bidwell.

322
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,153
<i>The race to the Pacific continues.</i>

323
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,752
<i>Although still bent on
beating Lewis and Clark...</i>

324
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,027
<i>I am cataloging new varieties
of flora and fauna.</i>

325
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:35,098
<i>I seem to be the only man
with an interest in science...</i>

326
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,197
<i>aside from Pratt and his dubious
experiment with Bidwell's ear.</i>

327
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,741
I shall name this flower Amanda's bloom.

328
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:47,710
Mr. Hunt, as my partner, you should be
naming some of our discoveries as well.

329
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,217
-Me?
-Yes.

330
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:55,986
You could name that fork in the river,
for instance.

331
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,994
Perhaps there's a loved one
you'd care to immortalize?

332
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,693
Loved one?

333
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,393
Yeah. Sure.

334
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,495
I know.

335
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:12,706
I name this here fork Pittsburgh Nellie.

336
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:17,503
A Welsh whore who could do things
with her one good arm...

337
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,776
that would make you forget
that thing on her neck.

338
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,483
<i>By permitting Mr. Hunt
to name some of our discoveries...</i>

339
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:32,958
<i>I have unleashed his imagination.</i>

340
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,721
<i>He now insists that I teach him to read.</i>

341
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,392
<i>His enthusiasm reminds me
of the schoolboy I once was.</i>

342
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,735
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

343
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,167
Excellent.

344
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:46,202
This is the uppercase...

345
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:48,733
''A.''

346
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,808
You know, I spent a day in school once...

347
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:54,610
but the schoolmarm claimed
that I just couldn't concentrate.

348
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,148
Well, let's prove her wrong, shall we?

349
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,855
You know, I’ve waited years
to hear somebody say that.

350
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,150
Again.

351
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,117
Hunt.

352
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,196
This is the uppercase ''A.''

353
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,500
The uppercase ''A.''

354
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,435
I got that.

355
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,504
All right.

356
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,940
And this is the lowercase...

357
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,743
''a.''

358
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,082
The...

359
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:38,851
lowercase...

360
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,585
''a.''

361
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,028
Oh, God.

362
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,337
Got it. Okay.

363
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,976
-And this is the--
-Enough!

364
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,820
Do you want my head to explode?

365
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:13,350
In the name of all
that is good and decent...

366
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,020
no more for today!

367
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,931
<i>In exchange for reading lessons,
Mr. Hunt reciprocates...</i>

368
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,941
<i>by teaching me some of his frontier skills.</i>

369
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,847
The buffalo is near now.

370
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,576
You can tell that
just by sniffing its droppings?

371
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:39,381
No. I can see the herd right over there.

372
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:44,654
Then why are you....

373
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,674
No, I shouldn't.

374
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,850
I couldn't possibly....

375
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,255
Edwards!

376
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:27,225
You're not doing any naming up here
without me, partner?

377
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,162
No.

378
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,873
-What are you looking at?
-The moon. I was looking at the moon.

379
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:37,339
For me, the moon brings to mind romance.

380
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:38,901
Yeah.

381
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,974
Have you ever been in love, Mr. Hunt?

382
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,917
I’ve had my head under a petticoat or two.

383
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:49,453
Good Lord.

384
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:53,493
Must you and the others
reduce everything to its crudest terms?

385
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:58,057
I thought I cleaned it up rather nicely
for you.

386
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,829
Mr. Hunt, behold the object of my desire.

387
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:06,301
Behold an angel sent down from on high.

388
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,441
''Angel from on high.''

389
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,447
Oh, my God.

390
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:25,248
From here on out,
you keep your distance, all right?

391
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,021
What? No.

392
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,099
No.
Get out of the way, you big French oaf!

393
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,732
Behind Fontenot.

394
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:41,874
Now do you see?

395
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,069
Yeah, now I see.

396
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,872
All right, that's enough.

397
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:54,982
I said all right, Mr. Hunt.
That will be enough.

398
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,424
I understand.

399
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,693
You want to watch her by yourself.

400
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:08,592
You want to be alone
so you can shake hands with Ben Franklin.

401
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,201
You know, polish the pewter.

402
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,978
Polish the pewter?
Jonah does that for me.

403
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,678
Yeah, right.

404
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,443
What? No.

405
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,644
Mr. Hunt, I assure you I’ve never....

406
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,117
<i>July 10.</i>

407
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,416
<i>I’ve driven the men hard...</i>

408
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:31,890
<i>and I’m positive we've closed the gap
on Lewis and Clark.</i>

409
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,292
<i>However, because of the currents,
I surmised that we'd be better off...</i>

410
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,957
<i>portaging for the next several miles.</i>

411
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:43,267
<i>It’s hard work, but it's nothing
compared to the deadly currents...</i>

412
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:46,067
<i>we'd be battling on the mighty Missouri.</i>

413
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,806
Here we go!

414
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:45,192
Everybody, wake up.

415
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,670
Oh, my God.

416
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:58,041
Whatever you do, don't move.

417
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,842
lf he sees you move, you're dead.

418
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:05,150
-My nose itches.
-Don't scratch it.

419
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:08,822
-Feels like there's a bug up in there.
-Wait.

420
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,324
I think it's leaving.

421
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,859
-I’m gonna scratch it.
-You scratch your nose, you're dead.

422
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:23,301
I don't know what's worse,
the bear or my itchy nose.

423
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,537
No. Don't.

424
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:38,440
The bear is worse.
The bear is definitely worse!

425
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:46,456
That poor, poor man.

426
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,195
Bidwell, can you hear me?

427
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,506
I fear the bear has killed Mr. Bidwell, sir.

428
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:03,071
He's failed to communicate with me
by way of his ear.

429
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:06,341
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work any way.

430
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:10,042
But even if it did,
he couldn't talk through it.

431
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,619
Never mind.

432
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,418
Help me.

433
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,224
-Bidwell!
-Sir.

434
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,367
Sir, I’ve been to hell and back.

435
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,732
Yes, I can see that.

436
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:33,236
I suspect that now you'll want
to lead a hunting party...

437
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,434
to slay that terrible beast.

438
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,401
Yes, that thought
did cross my mind briefly.

439
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,879
-But now I have a better idea.
-Yes, sir?

440
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,520
I shall fashion for you
the finest wooden leg you've ever seen.

441
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,053
But what about the bear?

442
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,720
Rest assured, Bidwell.
In 20 years or so, the ravages of old age...

443
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:58,788
will deal with the bear far more cruelly
than we ever could have.

444
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,301
Revenge is sweet, sir.

445
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:08,469
<i>July 29.</i>

446
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:13,069
<i>We reach the final settlement
before entering uncharted territory...</i>

447
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,115
<i>and God only knows what.</i>

448
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:28,423
-There. It seems as if we've arrived.
-Wait. I can read it.

449
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,772
For the love of God, man!

450
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:53,044
It says, ''Welcome to Snakes Bend.''

451
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:55,312
Oh, God, yeah.

452
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,123
Onward, men.

453
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,622
Snakes Bend. Almost had it.

454
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:08,830
I got it.

455
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,839
Yes, it's a tavern.

456
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,877
I think it would be a nice gesture
if I bought the men a few tankards of ale.

457
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:25,816
A nice gesture indeed.

458
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,688
We both know how you get
when you drink.

459
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:31,554
Oh, yes, we do.

460
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:38,255
And that's why I think you should go
to the trading post for supplies now.

461
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,694
All right, men. Fun, fun.

462
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,482
-To Capt. Edwards.
-Capt. Edwards.

463
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,491
Excuse me. I had heard
there was a party of brave men here.

464
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,786
I’m here to tell you...

465
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:13,698
that I’m not unfamiliar with the ways of
men who've been long in the wilderness.

466
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:17,102
I understand their cravings
for food and drink...

467
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,902
and also their cravings
for the companionship of young women.

468
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,035
-Women. He's got women!
-Where are they?

469
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:27,273
Wait for me outside.
I will take you to them.

470
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,210
Come on.

471
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,249
Gentlemen?

472
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,585
My woman pleasure me whenever I want.

473
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,317
Yes, I shall refrain, as well.
I made a solemn promise to someone.

474
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:42,789
Really?

475
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,488
Yes, I promised my doctor I wouldn't...

476
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,396
engage in that sort of thing.

477
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:52,331
-Got a drippy dong?
-No.

478
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:55,766
No more than normal.
It drips when it should...

479
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,410
and it doesn't when it shouldn't.

480
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:03,775
Will that be it?

481
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:07,554
Let's see. Beans, rope.

482
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:09,884
Is there a barber in town?

483
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:11,720
-I’m a barber, sir.
-Fine.

484
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:13,655
I’ll have a haircut and a shave.

485
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:14,751
By the way...

486
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,956
you smell like something
that's been passed...

487
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:19,056
through the system of a sick old woman.

488
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:23,035
Well, maybe I’ll have a bath, too, then.

489
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,328
Good idea.

490
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,073
This way, gentlemen. Don't be shy.

491
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:33,670
Come in and meet the ladies.

492
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,918
Did I not tell you they were beautiful?

493
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,392
Don't you have any real women?

494
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,487
These women may be whores,
but they have their dignity.

495
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:55,458
Now, who would like to be
the first to introduce himself?

496
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:05,978
Hello, my dear.
My name is Hieronymus Pratt.

497
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,774
Might you have relatives
in Richmond, Virginia?

498
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,791
Some of them flies were there
before I got in.

499
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:36,404
-I just saw Hidalgo.
-Hidalgo? With all his men?

500
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,010
No, just half a dozen.
But they're headed this way!

501
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:45,213
Double my wages
for anyone who will take my shift.

502
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:51,318
I have heard of this Hidalgo.

503
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,284
A Spaniard who wander the Northwest.

504
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,224
Even crazy people think he's....

505
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,549
Did you say something?

506
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:21,248
No, I....

507
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:24,016
You said something about my hair.

508
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,518
-No.
-Why not?

509
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,561
You don't like my hair?

510
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,200
-Yes, it's nice.
-''Nice''?

511
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:36,268
My hair is magnificent.

512
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,096
It’s long and soft...

513
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:42,336
and shines with the light
that comes from within. Can't you see it?

514
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:44,900
-Yes, it's beautiful.
-Beautiful, yes.

515
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,237
That's all I have to say.

516
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,773
Sorry if I frightened you.

517
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:53,848
Good God!

518
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:56,114
Good.

519
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,457
-You do good work.
-Thank you, sir.

520
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,552
I strive for excellence
in all my various trades.

521
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,656
Tell me, among those trades,
you wouldn't happen to practice--

522
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:07,064
Taxidermy?

523
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,733
No, I was going to say dentistry.

524
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:12,871
I’m primarily a taxidermist.

525
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,933
However, I have practiced dentistry
on the animals I’ve preserved.

526
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:22,639
And of course, over there.

527
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,376
Good.

528
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:30,219
'Cause I have got a molar
that's been bothering me since St. Louis.

529
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:32,652
I can oblige, sir.

530
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,629
He said, ''I know.
It wasn't a horse, it was a donkey.''

531
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,674
Her hair is perfect.

532
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,238
It’s beautiful.

533
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:57,811
Is this your woman?

534
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,546
She belong to me.

535
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,618
-And who are you?
-Guy Fontenot.

536
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:06,152
You may call me Hidalgo.

537
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,122
Hidalgo.

538
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:13,022
I wander the Northwest Territory
searching for a fabulous place.

539
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:17,327
A place where the earth trembles
and speaks...

540
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:21,100
and a white cross marks the location
of an age-old secret.

541
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,504
And what is the secret?

542
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,275
You try to trick me
with your deceiving questions.

543
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:32,777
But you will learn nothing,
not unless you join us.

544
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,020
Come on. You are perfect.

545
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:37,847
lf you join us...

546
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,521
everything that belongs to you
belongs to me, too.

547
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,561
And if I don't?

548
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:48,965
Then we tear out your heart,
cut off your limbs and skin you alive.

549
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,839
-I’ll join.
-Good. I’m delighted.

550
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,434
-Now this should dull your senses.
-All right.

551
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:01,975
What are you doing?
What, are you trying to kill me?

552
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:06,008
Put it down.
Put the thing down and pull my tooth.

553
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:07,854
God Almighty.

554
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,349
All right. Say ''ah.''

555
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,824
-In the back.
-All right.

556
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:20,795
That guy's in there.

557
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:37,546
-Come on, let's go.
-Don't take her.

558
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,811
Take me instead.

559
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,857
Put your hands on your hips.

560
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,665
No. Like this.

561
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:21,657
And here I’ve avoided the dentist for years
because I thought it'd hurt.

562
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,196
Look at that.

563
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:28,159
No. I think I’ll still keep the woman.
Come on, let's go.

564
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:31,165
You can't take a woman against her will.

565
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,374
Of course, maybe it's time for her
to spread her wings and fly.

566
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:42,880
Well, well.

567
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,348
What have we got here?

568
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:50,179
Hey, sonny boy.

569
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:55,085
Your mother wants her roasting pan back
when you're done playing with it.

570
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:58,996
I challenge you and the rest
of your ladies in armor to a duel.

571
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,093
-All of us?
-Every poofy prancing one of you.

572
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:06,334
<i>We are more than equal to a duel, senor.</i>

573
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:10,231
Especially since you won't live
past the first contest.

574
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:14,772
What weapons do you choose?

575
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:18,511
Pistols, swords, or bare fists?

576
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:21,147
Drink.

577
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,215
Drink?

578
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:26,823
Time's up.

579
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:33,492
Sorry.

580
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:37,735
I swear that's never happened
to me before.

581
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:31,646
Well done, Mr. Hunt.
I’m deeply impressed and grateful.

582
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:35,861
Maybe now you'll agree...

583
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,455
drinking has its benefits.

584
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:41,527
You saved my life.

585
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,970
Maybe now you'll agree...

586
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:47,497
drinking has its benefits.

587
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,071
You just said that.

588
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:52,435
Now, if you don't mind...

589
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,243
it's time for the liquor to take effect.

590
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,012
Fire!

591
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:04,582
My furniture. My draperies. My women!

592
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:06,958
Pratt's still in there!

593
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:22,600
It’s all my fault, Captain.

594
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,805
She said she didn't mind if I smoked.
I believed her.

595
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:33,852
Let's retrieve Hunt from the tavern
and get back to the boat.

596
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:38,489
I think we've seen all
that Snakes Bend has to offer.

597
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:41,455
My heart.

598
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:54,039
Permission to check
on the condition of my woman, sir.

599
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:58,373
I want to check on her bandages
and see if she can keep some food down.

600
00:49:58,445 --> 00:50:01,175
You realize, of course,
this woman of yours...

601
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,715
is made of straw?

602
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:06,082
Yes, sir.
I figure that's why she burned so easy.

603
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:35,970
Damn.

604
00:50:55,836 --> 00:50:57,167
Who is it?

605
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:02,635
Good evening. I was just collecting
samples of bark for President Jefferson.

606
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,007
Some bark. I was collecting it.

607
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,671
Samples of bark.

608
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:12,015
You're not like these other men.

609
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:15,783
You're softer, more delicate.

610
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:19,187
In a rather rough way, right?

611
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,721
Not at all. Look at you.

612
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:26,164
Thin wrists...

613
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:29,261
skin like a baby...

614
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,599
almost a total absence of shoulders.

615
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,006
All right,
I think you've flattered me quite enough.

616
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:52,750
Look at me.
I’m behaving like some kind of animal.

617
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,191
I liked it.

618
00:51:56,963 --> 00:51:59,329
No, no. This can never be.

619
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,135
I’m betrothed to another.

620
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,466
Besides, we come from different worlds.

621
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,065
You are primitive,
and you follow your baser instincts...

622
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:11,435
and I come from a culture
that values Christian morality.

623
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,706
Maybe one more couldn't hurt.

624
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:16,244
What? What did I say?

625
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:17,947
Shaquinna.

626
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,715
I don't see how it's possible...

627
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:26,225
for the river to flow up and over
those mountains to the western sea.

628
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,397
The river can't flow up and over anything.

629
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,394
So, I guess our journey's over.

630
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:40,537
No, never. We're pushing on.

631
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,574
We'll scale the Rocky Mountains
within the month...

632
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,745
and then build canoes...

633
00:52:46,646 --> 00:52:50,343
and float down the western slope
before the first frost.

634
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:53,917
<i>October 29.</i>

635
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:58,753
<i>What I had hoped was an early dusting
turned out to be somewhat more.</i>

636
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:03,656
<i>Our journey is half finished,
but our food supply is nearly depleted.</i>

637
00:53:04,564 --> 00:53:07,226
<i>The only man
who seems to be thriving is Pratt...</i>

638
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,292
<i>who is eating what remains
of his straw woman.</i>

639
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,997
<i>As for me, I seem to have come down
with a slight chill.</i>

640
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:18,169
What?

641
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:22,272
-What do you think you're doing?
-Last rites.

642
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:24,807
No, there will be none of that.

643
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:27,877
Please do not try to bury me
before I am dead.

644
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,516
Go away.

645
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,588
Mama.

646
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,367
I can make medicine that will cure him.

647
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,337
But I will need the egg of an eagle,
or he will die.

648
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:48,806
The egg of an eagle.

649
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,139
-That's all?
-That is all.

650
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:52,610
You know...

651
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,875
the last creatures we saw
were way down below the snowline.

652
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,215
You're a very brave man
to do this for your friend.

653
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,053
Ain't nothing more than me doing my job.

654
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,722
Better be going.

655
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,450
Oh, God!

656
00:56:43,116 --> 00:56:45,949
<i>We need the egg of an eagle,
or he will die.</i>

657
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:48,118
<i>He will die.</i>

658
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:09,006
Oh, dear God.

659
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,607
President Jefferson, I implore you.

660
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,479
lf we do not give bears the right to vote
they will rise up...

661
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:18,540
and bears will be in Congress.

662
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:22,520
And we will be the ones performing
in carnivals wearing little hats.

663
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:28,417
President Jefferson, a few months ago
I saw a naked Indian woman.

664
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:33,896
When I saw the naked Indian woman,
I had certain impure thoughts.

665
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:38,332
Something in me has changed
out here in the wilds.

666
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:40,929
You must rest.

667
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,801
I saw a naked Indian woman.

668
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:54,887
No!

669
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:37,218
Okay.

670
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:40,121
Where are you?

671
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,928
Protect your little birdies.

672
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:45,660
Okay.

673
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:57,646
Come on, you damn bird!
Come and get me!

674
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,462
I got it.

675
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,174
You broke it.

676
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,914
All I needed was the shell. Thank you.

677
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,230
The medicine is working.

678
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,996
Can I lick the bowl?

679
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:34,545
-Shaquinna.
-Yes.

680
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:36,946
Your fever has broken.

681
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:41,614
Thank you for standing by me.

682
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:45,315
The person you should really thank
is Mr. Hunt.

683
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:50,462
He risked his life
to bring back an eagle egg.

684
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:55,092
I could've just brought back the shell,
but nobody bothered to tell me that.

685
01:00:55,702 --> 01:00:57,465
Thank you, Mr. Hunt.

686
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:02,540
Now we'll build canoes
and be on to the Pacific by the first thaw.

687
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:05,907
I cannot begin to express my...

688
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,804
feelings.

689
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,180
Don't be talking about no feelings.
I don't want to have to punch you.

690
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:16,821
-Well, just the same....
-I’m serious.

691
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:37,571
Good God.

692
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:44,306
-What rare luck is this?
-What?

693
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:47,849
Lewis and Clark,
and the damn fools are portaging.

694
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:59,387
They're portaging because they think
the river is too dangerous up ahead.

695
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:03,458
-I think we should do the same.
-I see no reason for concern.

696
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:08,036
Sir, there's an old saying,
''White water in the morning.''

697
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,967
-Yes?
-That's it.

698
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:16,146
Mr. Hunt, this is our chance
to overtake Lewis and Clark.

699
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:17,682
Sure, we may overtake them...

700
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,651
but it ain't worth
risking the lives of the men.

701
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,018
I assure you all will be fine.

702
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,583
I hope to God you're right.

703
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,277
Don't worry, men.

704
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,754
According to my calculations, we have
less than a hundred yards of rapids ahead.

705
01:04:06,459 --> 01:04:09,587
My hat's off to you, sir. We made it.

706
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:13,932
Men, we have overtaken Lewis and Clark.

707
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,365
Gather up the pieces of the boat...

708
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:19,199
-and what's left of our supplies.
-No.

709
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,639
I beg your pardon?

710
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:25,575
You almost got us killed
just so you could be famous.

711
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:28,842
Well, I ain't taking no more.
I’m quitting this expedition.

712
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:32,009
-What of our partnership?
-Partnership?

713
01:04:32,184 --> 01:04:35,517
You didn't care nothing about
our partnership back there on the river.

714
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:37,749
Well, I don't care nothing about it now.

715
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:39,347
Who's coming with me?

716
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:41,325
To hell with both of you.

717
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:45,160
I’ve spent my entire life
trying to see the Pacific...

718
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:48,056
and I’m going by myself.
Who's going with me?

719
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,625
Jonah, where do your loyalties lie?

720
01:04:51,704 --> 01:04:54,537
I’m your slave. Who do you think I’m with?

721
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:57,508
-Thank you, Jonah.
-I’m going with Mr. Hunt.

722
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:01,441
We're close. Only a few hundred miles.

723
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:05,444
We will be the first.
Trust me, the worst is over.

724
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:09,750
The worst will never be over.
Not with this precious dandy in charge.

725
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:13,257
lf you want to live, come with me.

726
01:05:13,593 --> 01:05:16,926
Use your minds, men.
Think for yourselves.

727
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:21,260
Or would you rather have Mr. Hunt
do your thinking for you?

728
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,633
My heavenly Father
does my thinking for me...

729
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:28,271
and he thinks I'd be a damn fool
not to go with Hunt.

730
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:31,474
No, Father. Wait.

731
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:37,882
It is better to think for yourself.

732
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:42,081
And I think
we should continue to the Pacific.

733
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:44,253
Stout fellow, Bidwell.

734
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:46,348
How can you say that, man?

735
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,760
You've had it worse than all of us.

736
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:52,662
Been mauled by a bear,
your ear bit off by a Frenchman.

737
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:55,963
True enough, sir.
I have had my share of bad luck.

738
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,629
But I cannot abandon Mr. Edwards now.

739
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,138
For he alone has dared to dream...

740
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,509
and now we are so very close...

741
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:08,343
that I believe him when he says
the worst is over.

742
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:15,580
When I said the worst was over,
perhaps I spoke too soon.

743
01:06:15,755 --> 01:06:17,780
But now, surely--

744
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,027
Bidwell, get down!

745
01:06:22,528 --> 01:06:24,928
I’m sorry, I was aiming for your head!

746
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:26,021
You wait there!

747
01:06:26,098 --> 01:06:28,828
We'll be down in a moment
to capture you!

748
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:34,497
I want them in their underthings
when they die.

749
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:38,105
That makes it much worse,
don't you think?

750
01:06:40,046 --> 01:06:41,843
Prepare the gauntlet.

751
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:44,379
-What?
-The gauntlet.

752
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:48,011
I’ve decided these two men will die
running the gauntlet.

753
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,014
-The....
-The gauntlet!

754
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,081
All right. Calm yourself.

755
01:06:53,793 --> 01:06:56,227
You don't think I know
where there's a gambit?

756
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:57,853
-Gumblit?
-Sanchez.

757
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:58,919
Gauntlet.

758
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:02,131
You and the Frenchman
prepare the gauntlet.

759
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:06,571
I’m sorry we must cut short our fun,
my little kitten.

760
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:10,205
lf you so much as lay a hand on me,
I will kill you.

761
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:12,233
Take her away.

762
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:29,892
Punch him.

763
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:35,359
This is what it's all about.

764
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:44,235
Burn your feet, you cowards.

765
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,173
Wait.

766
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:58,087
Look at the poofy one.

767
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:07,599
Whose idea was the corn?

768
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,035
And now they're getting away.
Hector, Ferdinand, after them !

769
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:19,600
Go after them.

770
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:30,614
Over there.

771
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:49,032
Hurry, they're almost here.

772
01:08:52,845 --> 01:08:55,040
-Oh, God.
-Come on.

773
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:05,883
-Come on.
-Forget about me.

774
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,424
-You can do it.
-Save yourself.

775
01:09:09,295 --> 01:09:11,820
I’ll never forget this, Bartholomew.

776
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:20,002
<i>And now we kill you, senor,
and take your head back to Hidalgo.</i>

777
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,063
But we do have one tiny favor
to ask of you.

778
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:25,167
Yes. You see, so often,
when we bring a head back to Hidalgo...

779
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,610
it has a grim sort of look of terror on it.

780
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,640
It would really put us in good with Hidalgo
if you could smile as we kill you.

781
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,784
Go to hell.

782
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:41,652
No. Did you see how ugly your face was
when you said that?

783
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:46,762
-Say ''puppy.''
-Yes. Say ''puppy.''

784
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:49,824
You see, one cannot help but smile
when they say the word puppy.

785
01:09:49,902 --> 01:09:51,301
Say ''puppy.''

786
01:09:52,404 --> 01:09:54,668
Die, you Spanish bastards!

787
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:10,480
Puppy, you sons of bitches.

788
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:25,402
You know,
what you did back there for me...

789
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:27,838
was real nice of you.

790
01:10:27,907 --> 01:10:30,432
-It’s fine. Don't....
-You don't understand.

791
01:10:30,843 --> 01:10:34,973
It’s just that no one's ever done
nothing like that for me before.

792
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:36,875
And....

793
01:10:41,921 --> 01:10:43,786
Thank you, that's all.

794
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:46,080
Just thank you.

795
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,190
Especially someone like you...

796
01:10:52,264 --> 01:10:55,097
who could've got himself killed so easy.

797
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,462
I think he's asleep.

798
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:30,595
I think he's dead.

799
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:37,374
I’m sorry I scared you.

800
01:11:37,943 --> 01:11:40,036
I was just resting my eyes.

801
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,846
We need help.

802
01:11:42,614 --> 01:11:47,176
I will help. I am a proud warrior.

803
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:53,520
-Wait, at least let us explain the situation.
-There's no time for that.

804
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:57,585
Look, our men are being held captive
by at least 20 conquistadors.

805
01:11:57,663 --> 01:12:00,757
Are there others in your tribe
that can help us?

806
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,299
Perhaps men a bit younger than yourself?

807
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,128
Yes.

808
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:13,241
I am going to cut this woman's hair off.

809
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:15,643
Anybody want to guess why?

810
01:12:15,714 --> 01:12:18,581
-To entertain us?
-No.

811
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:22,044
-Because she asked you to?
-No.

812
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,615
I know!

813
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:28,316
Because her hair is more beautiful
than yours, and you're jealous.

814
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:29,851
No.

815
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:34,695
I am going to cut her hair off
because it's not as beautiful as mine.

816
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:39,637
Because, even if she won't admit it,
she's thinking:

817
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:43,664
''Why should I even bother to have hair
when he's got hair like that.''

818
01:12:44,009 --> 01:12:46,705
-You understand?
-No, not really.

819
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:49,537
I don't get it.

820
01:12:50,049 --> 01:12:53,246
Who cares?
I’m going to skin you all alive anyway.

821
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:56,013
-Prepare her.
-Prepare her.

822
01:12:58,424 --> 01:13:02,520
You indicated that the braves you had
summoned were younger than you?

823
01:13:02,594 --> 01:13:06,655
They are.
Running Puma is two years younger.

824
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,024
Strong Like Mountain is....

825
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,770
-Four.
-Four years younger.

826
01:13:13,672 --> 01:13:17,301
We appreciate you showing up and all,
but...

827
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,110
we're going to probably just do this alone.

828
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:24,906
At the moment of battle...

829
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:30,047
our spirits will soar
and give us the strength...

830
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:32,685
to fight.

831
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,728
This is the way we must travel.

832
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,329
This way,
we save our strength for the battle.

833
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:48,335
-Stop.
-What now?

834
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,499
Running Puma has to go back
behind tree again.

835
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:53,375
I’m sorry.

836
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:59,806
All right, look. This is the last time.

837
01:14:00,552 --> 01:14:04,613
Anyone else has to go, do it now.
I ain't stopping again.

838
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:18,766
I don't see
how these Indians are going to help us.

839
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:24,900
Perhaps we need not rely on them to fight.
Perhaps I can bluff Hidalgo using my wits.

840
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,537
This is getting much too difficult.

841
01:14:31,183 --> 01:14:33,674
We can finish brushing her hair
after she's dead.

842
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:35,720
<i>Stop right there, senor.</i>

843
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:40,052
This has gone too far.
You must release Shaquinna.

844
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:43,351
Such arrogance!

845
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:48,428
You are surrounded by an army of
Indian braves, who, on my command...

846
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:53,334
will descend upon you with all the fury
of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

847
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:56,171
Hell, we got more than four.

848
01:14:56,642 --> 01:15:01,545
And they got names like Soaring Eagle,
Strong Like Mountain...

849
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:05,674
and others, too.

850
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,720
Well, where are these braves?
Show them to me.

851
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:10,784
Show them to me, too.

852
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:14,182
I am one of these braves.

853
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,522
And I am one of these braves.

854
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:20,392
I am one of these braves.

855
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:28,002
That's quite an army!

856
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,207
Why should we fight?

857
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:33,836
Maybe if we wait a couple of hours
they'll die of old age.

858
01:16:28,066 --> 01:16:30,864
And you thought I couldn't escape you?

859
01:16:32,738 --> 01:16:33,727
You....

860
01:16:34,473 --> 01:16:38,409
Here's an idea.
You take off running into the woods...

861
01:16:38,543 --> 01:16:42,274
and I try to count to three
before I put another hole...

862
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:45,214
in your hairy French ass!

863
01:16:48,553 --> 01:16:51,647
''Hairy French ass.'' You had me going.

864
01:16:51,723 --> 01:16:55,124
''And I’ll put a big hole
in your hairy French ass.'' Man, you--

865
01:17:14,012 --> 01:17:17,778
<i>Hey, senor! Look what I have.</i>

866
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,312
Your woman!

867
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,148
-I’ll take care of this.
-No.

868
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,918
You've done enough, Bartholomew!

869
01:17:27,993 --> 01:17:29,620
-Leslie!
-Come on!

870
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,694
It’s time for me to fight my own battles.

871
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:40,095
Hidalgo is mine.

872
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:07,822
Sir, you are a coward.
You seized a woman and ran.

873
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,965
And now I’m going to teach you a lesson.

874
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:27,811
Either you're brave or you're stupid.

875
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,119
Perhaps there's not much difference
between the two.

876
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:45,759
You're a smart man.

877
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:49,500
After I kill you, I’ll have to look
at your brain to see if it's different...

878
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:52,634
from, you know,
other brains I might have seen.

879
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:03,949
Good God!

880
01:19:07,793 --> 01:19:09,385
Hello, baldy!

881
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:15,531
You shut up!

882
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:36,812
<i>Now you've seen me as I truly am, senor.</i>

883
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:40,485
I’m just a bald, fat man...

884
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,554
begging for your mercy.

885
01:19:45,564 --> 01:19:48,533
Edwards, we've just seen Lewis and Clark.

886
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,194
They're a mile away,
and they're headed for the ocean.

887
01:19:51,269 --> 01:19:55,706
My God! Well, come on, then.
We can still beat them !

888
01:19:58,143 --> 01:19:59,508
<i>Hey, senor!</i>

889
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:03,876
This business with my wig,
it's just between you and me.

890
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,436
Oh, my God!

891
01:20:39,184 --> 01:20:40,515
We did it.

892
01:20:43,955 --> 01:20:45,684
Not yet, we haven't.

893
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:48,755
They're going to get to the ocean
before us.

894
01:20:48,827 --> 01:20:52,456
The only way to beat them
is straight down that rock face.

895
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:55,458
Well, then, as leader of this expedition...

896
01:20:57,035 --> 01:20:59,560
I should be the one that climbs down.

897
01:20:59,638 --> 01:21:00,627
Leslie.

898
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,301
You ain't going down there.
You'll be killed. I should go.

899
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:07,873
Nonsense.

900
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,305
Then this is for your own damn good.

901
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,448
How was that for my own damn good?

902
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:21,447
Sorry. The punch was supposed
to knock you out.

903
01:21:22,227 --> 01:21:25,856
Let's see here. This here ought to do it.

904
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:34,237
What the hell are you doing? Go!
He's going to go.

905
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,299
Pratt.

906
01:21:39,778 --> 01:21:41,746
Give me the flag.

907
01:22:03,935 --> 01:22:05,266
Good luck.

908
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:34,359
Oh, God!

909
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:49,436
Oh, no.

910
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:03,517
Oh, God! No!

911
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:09,188
Oh, God!

912
01:23:19,144 --> 01:23:21,544
Oh, God! No!

913
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:25,143
Please, bird, don't hurt me.

914
01:23:25,216 --> 01:23:28,652
You put me on the ground,
you damn, dirty bird!

915
01:23:46,071 --> 01:23:47,436
Oh, my God!

916
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,538
Hunt! You did it!

917
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:27,303
We all did it!

918
01:24:31,783 --> 01:24:34,115
Wait. How did you get down here?

919
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:37,749
We found an Indian trail.

920
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:39,423
It was very nice.

921
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,982
Yes, they even carved little steps.

922
01:24:44,062 --> 01:24:48,192
Shame we didn't take another minute
or two to look around up there.

923
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:49,866
Leslie, look!

924
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:55,130
You're too late!

925
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,564
We beat you!

926
01:24:57,642 --> 01:25:00,805
Yeah! Go home, losers!

927
01:25:11,389 --> 01:25:15,485
Men, we're the first
to conquer this great continent.

928
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:25,759
-Time to head home.
-Yeah.

929
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,229
But why does it have to end here?

930
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:31,469
-What are you talking about?
-I’m talking about exploring!

931
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,033
Look here, men.

932
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:36,478
We've beaten this continent.
What say we try another?

933
01:25:36,748 --> 01:25:41,685
We could travel north to the Bering Strait,
a bridge of land and ice that leads to Asia.

934
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:43,849
We could walk there.

935
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:46,447
Walk to Asia.

936
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:49,023
I like it.

937
01:25:49,594 --> 01:25:51,357
And why stop there?

938
01:25:51,629 --> 01:25:53,620
We could go on to Europe.

939
01:25:54,365 --> 01:25:58,199
Edwards and Hunt,
the first Americans to walk to Europe.

940
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:02,765
The food alone is worth the trip.

941
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:03,865
The food, sir.

942
01:26:03,942 --> 01:26:07,844
This time, next Christmas,
we'll be sipping champagne in Paris!

943
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:02,339
English
