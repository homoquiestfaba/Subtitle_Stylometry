1
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,420
Hill, goddammit, do you copy?

2
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:49,422
Yeah, I copy. Go ahead.

3
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:54,462
Hey, there's a silver car
out here. Been here a few days.

4
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:57,255
I gave it a ticket, I don't
know, two or three days ago.

5
00:01:58,589 --> 00:01:59,589
No?

6
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:05,255
Hey, you know, give
me a read on 869663h.

7
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:15,754
Yeah, I'm not finding anything.

8
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:17,169
All right, you know what?

9
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,451
I'm gonna go look
for the driver.

10
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,464
10-4, sandman.

11
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:23,672
Roger that.

12
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,214
Hello?!

13
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:32,965
Hello?

14
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,466
Hello?

15
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,299
Ma'am?

16
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,297
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

17
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:25,716
Ma'am?

18
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,466
Ma'am.

19
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,758
Are you okay?

20
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,423
And welcome back to
kwlf. I'm David Walker.

21
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,840
Following up on
our breaking news,

22
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,923
senator Morrison's
suicide comes on

23
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,590
the heels of a scathing report

24
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:06,923
by New York times
journalist Nora Thompson.

25
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:09,757
The report details
Morrison's involvement

26
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,632
with a drug trafficking ring

27
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,507
and the funneling of profits

28
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,423
through the Morrison family
charity, hearts of children.

29
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,715
Now all of the Morrison family
assets have been frozen.

30
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:22,798
And, so far, there
has been no comment

31
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,423
from senator Morrison's
immediate family.

32
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,673
Please join us tomorrow
night at 8:00 P.M.

33
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,383
For an hour long report

34
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:32,965
on the rise and fall
of senator Morrison.

35
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,673
We have uncovered more details

36
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,133
on senator Morrison's
illegal activity

37
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,798
and a special
report and interview

38
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,674
with Nora Thompson herself,

39
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,882
the New York times journalist
who exposed senator Morrison.

40
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:49,090
Coming up next, what is a
social media influencer?

41
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:52,674
Do they matter? And
how can you become one?

42
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,591
We'll be right back after these
messages from our sponsor.

43
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,885
You're watching kwlf.
I'm David Walker.

44
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,635
It's about time. Been trying
to get a hold of you all day.

45
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:03,843
I didn't
know. I'm sorry.

46
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:07,136
I had a family emergency. And
I did call earlier, though.

47
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,718
Did you? I didn't notice.

48
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,885
Is your family, okay?

49
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:13,926
Yeah, everything's fine.

50
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,261
Good because I
wouldn't want to take up

51
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:17,845
too much of your time
if you're a preoccupied.

52
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:22,136
I need someone who
makes me their priority.

53
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:24,718
Hey, you
are my priority. 100%.

54
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
How are you?

55
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:29,177
Fine. Just getting
ready for tomorrow.

56
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,177
Nothing I won't
be able to handle.

57
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,719
Between me and you,
Clay auburn is an idiot.

58
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,719
I don't know who would
give him an anchor seat.

59
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,471
We used to go to
school together.

60
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,969
It's good that
you know him, though.

61
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:42,471
It'll lead to friendly
banter. Audiences love that.

62
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,679
Oh, that reminds me. Don't
bring up the senator's suicide.

63
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:51,679
Well, duh, obviously.
I'm not an idiot.

64
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:55,261
If Clay does,
just send your condolences.

65
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:56,927
Move on as quickly as possible.

66
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,220
I'm not gonna
give my condolences.

67
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:02,594
If you ask me, suicide was
too easy for that bastard.

68
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:05,303
And his family knew what he
was doing the entire time.

69
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,761
They don't deserve well
wishes or condolences.

70
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,844
- Nora.
- I'm a professional.

71
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:12,095
If it comes up, I'll play it up.

72
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,178
Hell, I'll even get teary-eyed
if the mood calls for it.

73
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:39,264
Stunning.

74
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,555
Everything we deserve, finally.

75
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,305
Mm.

76
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,890
Ew.

77
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,140
Hashtag rest day.

78
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,098
Hashtag journalist.

79
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:12,181
Hashtag New York times.

80
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,390
Perfect.

81
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,098
This is the life.

82
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,098
Hello, world!

83
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:56,806
Oh, my god.

84
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:01,472
We reached 1 million followers.

85
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,307
Nora Thompson, you
are finally verified.

86
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:10,972
My god, it's hard
to get verified

87
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,180
than it is to bribe
a congressman.

88
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:14,182
Yes.

89
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,305
You earned your a
fancy wine, girl.

90
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,099
Woo!

91
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,931
Any news on the pulitzer board?

92
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,806
You're definitely
one of the front runners.

93
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:34,264
I don't want to be a
front runner. I want to win.

94
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,890
So make it happen.

95
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,806
Yes. Yeah,
I will, don't worry.

96
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,347
Good. I also liked
your book idea.

97
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:43,181
I think we should
move forward with it.

98
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:44,890
Oh. Oh, perfect.

99
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,098
Perfect, I can get started

100
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,347
on that tomorrow.

101
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,765
I don't need to
know the details.

102
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:49,931
Now, look, I have to go.

103
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,390
I want to finish
prepping for tomorrow

104
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,765
and I want to look
fresh for the cameras.

105
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,722
It sounds really good.

106
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:55,933
Hey, you know, I had some...

107
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:05,098
Why, yes, Clay,
it is unfortunate.

108
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Of course...

109
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:10,683
Of course my thoughts and
prayers go out to his family.

110
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,890
Remember, viewers,
suicide is not the answer,

111
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:20,225
and there is help available
to those who are struggling.

112
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:32,976
That's it.

113
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:34,893
That's the one.

114
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:37,893
Cheers to you, bitch.

115
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,018
Happy to be here, Clay.
Thanks for having me.

116
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,143
Happy to be here, Clay.

117
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,557
Much better.

118
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,268
It is the only Clay
after all. Chump.

119
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,019
Perfect.

120
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,349
You deserve everything
coming to you.

121
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,476
Just the stupid
neighbor's cat again.

122
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,936
It's freezing.

123
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,435
Get back!

124
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:08,603
Get out!

125
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,645
Get out! Get back!

126
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,185
Get out of my house!

127
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Hey!

128
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,313
Let me outta here!

129
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:53,775
Let me out, you psycho!
People will be looking for me!

130
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,650
No!

131
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,607
Did you really think
that was gonna work?

132
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,651
Let me out!

133
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,359
You.

134
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,651
You know who I am?

135
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,565
Carolyn Morrison.

136
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,357
Senator Morrison's
oldest daughter,

137
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,191
and least favorite
from what I hear.

138
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,901
Good. Saves me a lot of time.

139
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,940
Favorite or not, that
kingdom was going to be mine

140
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,318
till you opened your
big fucking mouth.

141
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,565
Fuck! Ow!

142
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,443
Do it again.

143
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,690
I have pliers.

144
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:20,358
Now, stay quiet, or I'm
really gonna give you

145
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,525
something to scream about.

146
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:23,232
- No.
- Now open your mouth.

147
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:24,693
Open your mouth.

148
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,065
Shit.

149
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,527
Shit.

150
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,358
Stay quiet, or I'll
really give you

151
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,733
something to scream about them.

152
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,900
I'll kill him and throw his
body back here with you.

153
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,025
How you doing, ma'am?
Everything all right?

154
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:05,733
Yeah. I just needed to
take a break from driving.

155
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:07,359
Nature calls.

156
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,361
I see.

157
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,941
You do know I am
supposed to cite people

158
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:13,066
for stuff like that, right?

159
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,900
Have a heart, officer.

160
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:21,941
You got a light?

161
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:22,943
I don't smoke.

162
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,442
Hey, you know, you look like
that senator's daughter,

163
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,526
the one who offed himself.

164
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:34,401
Wait a minute, it is you.

165
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,903
Caroline, Carolina,
Carolyn, Carol-

166
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:39,442
Carolyn.

167
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:40,942
Carolyn. That's right.

168
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,109
You're all over the TV.

169
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,776
- That's me-
- oh, yeah.

170
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:45,944
In the flesh.

171
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:51,484
Aw, gee, I'm
sorry for your loss.

172
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:52,651
I've read the story.

173
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:53,819
All that money gone and,

174
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:56,401
well, guess that's
why you're not driving

175
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:58,903
one of those fancy
gas guzzlers, right?

176
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,736
I guess so.

177
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:06,651
Well, miss Morrison, don't
stay out here too long,

178
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,529
and you have a good day.

179
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,487
My sincerest condolences
to your family.

180
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:14,942
Thank you, officer.

181
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,028
- Yeah.
- You too.

182
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,445
Hey, you got
something back there?

183
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:35,860
No, I grabbed these
from the back earlier

184
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,362
and something must've fallen.

185
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,445
You want to check, officer?

186
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,860
Nah, it's fine.

187
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,068
Once again, miss Morrison,
don't stay out here too long.

188
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,070
Have a good one.

189
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,738
Shut up.

190
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,071
Do you want him to die?

191
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:16,781
Enough!

192
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,695
What the fuck?

193
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,117
Get up.

194
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,822
All right, I'm going
to remove the rag.

195
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:40,032
If you scream, I will
cut your tongue out.

196
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,448
What do you want?
You want money?

197
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,117
I'll get you money. I'll
get you whatever you want.

198
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,907
What did I say?

199
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:57,909
I'm not screaming.

200
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,325
We're gonna take
a walk that way.

201
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,949
What?

202
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:09,282
I can't walk through
the woods like this.

203
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,991
What, you afraid you're
gonna ruin your pedicure

204
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,740
now you're insta famous?

205
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:15,116
Get up.

206
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,238
Look, I'll do whatever you
want. Just don't hurt me.

207
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:19,617
Get up. Let's go.

208
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:22,949
Where are we going?

209
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,158
Down the trail.

210
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Why?

211
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,782
Ow, shit.
- Faster.

212
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,782
I'm going as fast as I can.

213
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,324
Maybe I should retie your
legs and make you crawl.

214
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:45,326
Bitch.

215
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,994
What was that?
- Stop stalling.

216
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,159
Did you hear that?

217
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:19,961
What, you've never
been in the woods before?

218
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:35,202
Aw, fuck!

219
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,953
You can't hide.

220
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:32,037
Fuck!

221
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:37,285
No!

222
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,451
Get up.

223
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:41,576
So what, you're
just gonna shoot me

224
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:42,951
and leave me for the animals?

225
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:44,245
Of course not.

226
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,952
Look, I'm sorry about your dad.

227
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,160
I didn't think-
- oh, god!

228
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,035
I don't give a
shit about my dad.

229
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,451
Outside of this fur
coat that he gave me,

230
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:55,495
he can rot in the
deepest depths of hell.

231
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,911
Well, then the money, i-

232
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,243
oh, shut the fuck up!

233
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:01,495
Jesus! Let's go!

234
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,244
Move.

235
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:08,954
Moving as fast as I can.

236
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,204
All right, stop. This is good.

237
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:18,829
Look, you seem like a smart
woman. We can make a deal.

238
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,494
You know, my father used to
take us hunting in the woods.

239
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:28,202
Thought you didn't
care about your father.

240
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,204
By my house.

241
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,994
At least that's what
we told my mother.

242
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,829
He used to make us
play these games.

243
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,830
You know, live up to the
Morrison family name.

244
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,079
This one time, he sent my
brothers out on a footrace.

245
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:51,496
He handed me a rifle and he
told me to pick one and shoot.

246
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,039
I picked my youngest brother.

247
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,080
He was an annoying little shit.

248
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:03,538
So I aimed.

249
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:09,247
My father slapped it down.

250
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:13,538
He said, "you don't
put down an annoyance.

251
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,247
You put down the biggest threat

252
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:20,623
and you make damn sure
they know it was you."

253
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:25,164
Not only have you
embarrassed me,

254
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:31,539
not only have you taken the
inheritance that I earned,

255
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:38,539
but you are the biggest threat
to any future that I have.

256
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,247
And so I'm going
to eliminate you

257
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:45,537
and I'm gonna have fun doing it.

258
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:50,038
Thought you didn't
care about your father?

259
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,165
Old habits die hard.

260
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:54,956
You really are
crazy, you know that?

261
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:59,079
Turn around.

262
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,163
You won't get away with this.

263
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:02,579
People will be looking for me.

264
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:05,081
Now, we're gonna play
our own little game.

265
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,413
You have a one minute head start.

266
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:10,204
You can go in any
direction you like.

267
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:11,954
And I'll count down from five.

268
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:12,954
Five.

269
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:13,746
I'm not gonna get very far

270
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:14,580
in a minute.
- Four.

271
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:15,582
It's not my concern.

272
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:18,415
Three.
- Hold it right there!

273
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:28,040
Put the gun down, nice
and slow, miss Morrison.

274
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:31,454
You need to mind
your business, officer.

275
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,204
I'm eliminating a threat.

276
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:35,747
Shoot her! What
are you waiting for?!

277
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:38,747
Calm down, ma'am. I
have this under control.

278
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,580
We'll get you outta here.

279
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:45,329
You shoot me, I shoot her.

280
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,080
I got a hostage.

281
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,747
Now I'll give you
to the count of three

282
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:51,247
to lower your weapon.

283
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:53,122
Don't make me shoot you.

284
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:55,166
Told you to mind
your business, officer.

285
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:58,999
Come on now! Think
of your family!

286
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:02,164
You come from a good
all-American family!

287
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,664
Are you kidding me?!

288
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,247
Ma'am, please!

289
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,122
I'm warning you, miss
Morrison, put the gun down!

290
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,330
That's it.

291
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:11,080
No one needs to get hurt!

292
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,330
Shoot her!

293
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:18,166
Told you to leave, officer!

294
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,166
No! Fuck!

295
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,455
C'est la vie!

296
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:39,374
Wait! Don't leave me!

297
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:55,165

Also...

301

Hold on.

302
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,541
We've just received
word that Nora Thompson,

303
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:12,873
the New York times investigative
reporter, is missing.

304
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,373
She's missed several interviews

305
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,666
and no one seems to
be able to reach her

306
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,499
or know her whereabouts.

307
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,832
They're interviewing all
that are close to her

308
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,791
and also senator
Morrison's family.

309
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:27,582
We will have more on this
as the story develops.

310
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:30,707
Next, how safe is your hybrid?

You're watching kwlf.

313
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:37,331
I'm David Walker.

314
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:26,419
Hello?!

315
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,583
Hello?! Is anybody in there?!

316
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:48,835
Oh, my god, thank you.

317
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:16,336
Yes.

318
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:14,462
Yes. Yes.

319
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:16,796
Yes!

320
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:22,421
Fuck!

321
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:32,587
No. No sleep.

322
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,670
What the hell is that?

323
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:51,422
Ew, it's disgusting.

324
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:30,920
Fuck.

325
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:33,086
At least it's something.

326
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:06,589
Dammit.

327
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,423
Yes.

328
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:24,712
Okay.

329
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:27,548
Come on.

330
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,131
Oh, yes.

331
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,714
Everything's gonna be okay.

332
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:34,881
Just breathe.

333
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,713
Oh, fuck.

334
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:48,923
Jesus. Fuck!

335
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:49,925
Let me in.

336
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:52,589
Let me in.
- And why would I do that,

337
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:53,964
you evil bitch?

338
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:56,048
I think it's on my tail.
Please, open the door.

339
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,256
I don't care. You
led it here, it can have you.

340
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:00,591
I'm injured.

341
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:02,800
You tried to kill me.

342
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,008
I'll give you dirt.

343
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:13,756
The scoop of your career.

344
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:16,675
I'll get you dirt on
every politician I know.

345
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:23,839
I grew up with the bastards.
I know all their secrets.

346
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:25,632
Please, just open the door.

347
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,590
And how do I know you
want to try and jump me?

348
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:32,632
It's empty.

349
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,257
I have nothing left.

350
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,008
I have nothing left.

351
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,009
Let me in.

352
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:44,757
Fuck. Screw it.

353
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,050
Come on.

354
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:51,008
Quickly, quickly

355
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:56,842
easy. Easy.

356
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,091
Did you get it? I
mean, did you kill it?

357
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:05,801
I think I wounded it earlier.

358
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:09,218
This is empty.

359
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,799
It's useless.

360
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,551
You don't have any more bullets?

361
00:42:15,218 --> 00:42:20,218
I have more guns in the
car, but I lost the keys.

362
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:32,843
You have them?

363
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:38,260
Whoa, what's that?

364
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:41,925
- Look-
- what are you doing?

365
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,802
The way I see it, I'm
the one in charge now.

366
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:47,841
I got the keys and the knife

367
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:49,967
and I'm not afraid to
use it, you got it?

368
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,967
I got it.

369
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,178
I hold the backpack
and the weapon.

370
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,925
Okay.
You're in charge.

371
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:01,261
That's right.
I'm in charge now.

372
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,261
All right, let's
move you over there.

373
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:09,969
Come on.

374
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:13,261
Easy does it.

375
00:43:21,885 --> 00:43:22,885
Oh.

376
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:28,759
Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

377
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,759
We need to get
you to a hospital.

378
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:31,761
Ow.

379
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:37,717
Ow! That hurts.

380
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,134
Hold still!

381
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:44,261
All right, relax, relax, relax.

382
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:49,303
That looks better.

383
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,304
All right, I'm not a doctor.

384
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,135
What kinda animal could do this?

385
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:05,220
Um, shouldn't you use that
to clean your wounds, maybe?

386
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:09,427
Shut up and take a drink.

387
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:11,385
Okay.

388
00:44:12,387 --> 00:44:13,343
Ew, no.

389
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:15,968
That is disgustingly strong.

390
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,012
No thank you. Disgusting.

391
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:23,802
You know, we wouldn't be
here if it weren't for you?

392
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,093
You know, we wouldn't be here

393
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,802
if you didn't go blackmailing
hookers for intel?

394
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:31,052
I mean, it was pretty smart,

395
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:36,055
but it was painfully obvious
to those of us on the inside.

396
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,011
Oh, why didn't you stop me

397
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,679
if you knew I was onto your dad?

398
00:44:43,387 --> 00:44:44,512
We're all sinners, honey.

399
00:44:48,263 --> 00:44:51,386
Oh, god, what I wouldn't do
for a cigarette right now.

400
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,428
Smoking kills. My
body as a temple.

401
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,386
Oh, spare me.

402
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:57,386
I knew what girls like
you did in college.

403
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,511
Girls like me?
And what is that?

404
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:03,969
Oh, you know, kind with
a stick so far up their ass

405
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,720
when they finally
blow off steam.

406
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,886
It's epic.

407
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:11,511
Yeah, that might've
been me. Whatever.

408
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:12,513
Let's go.

409
00:45:17,388 --> 00:45:20,094
Are you coming?

410
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,055
Just one...

411
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,137
Shit, what is that thing?

412
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:34,388
I don't know.

413
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:38,263
Never seen anything like it.
I didn't get a close look.

414
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,763
What about the deputy?

415
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,264
I think he's dead.

416
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:51,431
I don't think he survived.

417
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,514
Have you seen anything like
that in these woods before?

418
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:03,429
I told you, I used to hunt
by the woods near my house.

419
00:46:03,431 --> 00:46:05,889
These were a suggestion
from a friend.

420
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,181
A friend.

421
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:10,429
Some friend.

422
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:18,387
Are you okay?

423
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:19,932
Mm? I'm fine.

424
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,055
Carolyn. Carolyn.

425
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:25,098
What? What?

426
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:29,306
Think you might
have hypothermia.

427
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:31,472
I'm fine.

428
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,140
I'm...

429
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:37,098
No, you lost a lot of blood.

430
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,348
Here, hold on one second.

431
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,473
Here.

432
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:54,223
It smells like shit,
but it'll keep you warm.

433
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,390
Lean up.

434
00:47:13,182 --> 00:47:14,223
Is that okay?

435
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,346
It's fine.

436
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:17,972
You don't smell that?

437
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:19,098
Smell what?

438
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,140
Forget it.

439
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:24,056
I think you might be in shock.

440
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:25,058
Oh, no.

441
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:27,224
I'm in survival mode.

442
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,596
We need to get out of here.

443
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,849
How? That thing is out
there waiting for us.

444
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:37,181
We stay here,
we're sitting ducks.

445
00:47:41,515 --> 00:47:42,891
It's gonna come find us.

446
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,596
I think we should
wait it out here.

447
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:48,224
And wait for it to get us?

448
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:54,639
How do I know that
you won't jump me

449
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,933
once we get out there?

450
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,640
Leave me for dead?

451
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,099
You have the keys.

452
00:48:01,308 --> 00:48:05,974
And I, I don't have
the strength to fight you.

453
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:18,059
Is there food?

454
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:21,433
No. The cabinets were empty.

455
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:24,017
Wait.

456
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,267
What are you doing?

457
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,723
Nothing. Nothing.

458
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:37,598
You were just...

459
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Forget it.

460
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:42,267
Here.

461
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:44,973
We should at least try and
dress some of those wounds.

462
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:46,432
They look disgusting.

463
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:47,307
At least it'll help you

464
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:49,309
stop bleeding.
- Jerky?

465
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:08,473
What are you doing?

466
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:11,475
Mm. I haven't eaten
since this morning.

467
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:43,266
What was that?

468
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:44,268
What?

469
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:48,018
Oh, it must be back.

470
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:53,224
Hello?
Is anyone in there?

471
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:55,266
I need help. Please!

472
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:58,099
Oh, my god, it's the deputy.

473
00:49:58,101 --> 00:50:01,141
He must've gotten away.
We have to help him.

474
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:03,435
No, I'm not going out there.

475
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,684
I thought you don't leave
any people or hunters behind.

476
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:10,268
That's the marines.

477
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:15,186
If you want to help
him, you go right ahead.

478
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:18,186
Fuck.

479
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:26,561
Okay, I'm gonna go out there
and help him. You wait here.

480
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,562
Hello?

481
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:50,186
Deputy?

482
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,478
Help!

483
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,311
Is anyone there?!

484
00:50:58,352 --> 00:50:59,851
Hello?

485
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:02,142
Hello?

486
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:03,436
Please, help me.

487
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:07,267
Deputy?

488
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:10,476
Come here, please!

489
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:11,478
Help!

490
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:14,601
Deputy?

491
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:16,770
Please, help me!

492
00:51:18,353 --> 00:51:19,687
Is anyone there?!

493
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:21,812
Deputy?!

494
00:51:23,145 --> 00:51:24,770
Over here!

495
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,226
Where are you?!

496
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:29,438
Please, help me!

497
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,351
I'm coming!

498
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:34,770
Please!

499
00:51:36,937 --> 00:51:37,937
Help!

500
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,393
Deputy!

501
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:19,522
Deputy?!

502
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:25,314
Deputy!

503
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:32,022
Deputy?!

504
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:45,815
Deputy!

505
00:53:56,815 --> 00:53:57,854
Deputy!

506
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,523
Help!

507
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:07,521
- Deputy!
- Please!

508
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:08,439
Please!

509
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:09,729
Where are you?!

510
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,104
Over here!

511
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:12,106
Deputy!

512
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:14,441
Please!

513
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:19,106
Help me!

514
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:21,898
Where are you?!

515
00:55:00,442 --> 00:55:02,564
Carolyn, open the door!

516
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,647
It is coming! Let me in!

517
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,565
Please, let me in! He's coming!

518
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:09,398
Carolyn, what are you
doing?! Let me in!

519
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,730
What are you doing?!

520
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:11,732
Come on!

521
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:17,398
Carolyn, open the door!

522
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,606
Let me in!

523
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,855
What are you doing?!

524
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:20,857
It's coming!

525
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,440
Carolyn, open the door!

526
00:55:24,442 --> 00:55:27,147
What are you doing?!

527
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,481
Where the hell did
that come from?

528
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:51,023
I found it in
the closet earlier.

529
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,359
You said you had my gun.

530
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:54,817
Shit.

531
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,025
How does it feel to be hunted?

532
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:06,775
Excuse me?

533
00:56:07,942 --> 00:56:12,734
That article you wrote,
that's how my family and I felt.

534
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:16,942
Look, I'm sorry.

535
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:21,818
Oh, god.

536
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:25,065
Come on. Come with me.

537
00:56:25,067 --> 00:56:27,482
Take a look at that.

538
00:56:32,443 --> 00:56:33,901
Okay, so what's the plan?

539
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:36,443
Why are you asking me?

540
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:40,693
I figured you had more
experience with stuff like this?

541
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:47,609
We run for the road and
drive off as fast as we can.

542
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,818
Swell. And you sure
you're up to the challenge?

543
00:56:53,568 --> 00:56:56,816
I'm fine. It's
just a flesh wound.

544
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:06,152
Fuck. It's back.

545
00:57:07,818 --> 00:57:11,858
So how do you wanna do this?

546
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,982
We've gotta move.

547
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:17,150
Here, take it. You're
gonna need this.

548
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:19,275
I found it in the
closet with the shotgun.

549
00:57:19,277 --> 00:57:20,650
Okay.

550
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:22,692
It's a gun.
That's the trigger.

551
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:23,983
Put your finger on
it and you pull.

552
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:25,650
Great. Thanks.

553
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:29,860
We sprint for the car. If
you see the creature, shoot.

554
00:57:37,278 --> 00:57:38,151
What are you doing?

555
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:40,608
I look like shit.

556
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:43,942
It's a good thing
it's not a beauty contest.

557
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:45,485
Oh, my gosh, I know.

558
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,070
Okay.

559
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:52,692
I don't see it.

560
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:53,694
There's no eyes.

561
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:56,775
Let's do this. Stay close.

562
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,278
Don't run off without me.

563
00:58:15,986 --> 00:58:17,776
Are you sure you're okay?

564
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:19,151
I'm fine.

565
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:22,071
How much...

566
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:31,194
Shh, shh! You'll
lead it right to us.

567
00:58:31,196 --> 00:58:32,984
Don't ever touch me again.

568
00:58:32,986 --> 00:58:34,609
Oh, fuck.

569
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,027
You'll give our position away.

570
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:38,693
I fell onto a dead mangled
body, what do you expect?

571
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:39,943
Calm down.

572
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:41,110
You calm down.

573
00:58:41,112 --> 00:58:43,112
Oh, shut up.

574
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:48,360
It can mimic people.

575
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,945
Yeah, looks like it.

576
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,152
What are you doing?

577
00:58:56,154 --> 00:58:57,903
Trying to find something useful.

578
00:58:59,237 --> 00:59:01,777
You gonna stand there and
watch or are you gonna help?

579
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,152
I'm not touching him.

580
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:07,862
Snowflake.

581
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:11,237
Sorry we didn't all
grow up with a psycho dad.

582
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:15,152
There's no gun. Fuck.

583
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:17,360
He probably lost
it in the attack.

584
00:59:17,362 --> 00:59:19,735
Look for his keys. He
probably has more in the car.

585
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:20,737
Good idea.

586
00:59:21,988 --> 00:59:24,277
Ah. Bingo.

587
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:25,279
Nice.

588
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:31,777
Are you sure you're okay?

589
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:33,735
Yeah.

590
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:34,862
Just asking.

591
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:53,197
What?
- Run!

592
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,780
Wait!

593
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,072
Fuck! That bitch!

594
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:08,822
Which way?

595
01:00:09,863 --> 01:00:10,863
Carolyn!

596
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,736
Carolyn!

597
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:14,989
Shh.

598
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,863
I think it's gone.

599
01:00:29,822 --> 01:00:31,695
Yeah, I think you're right.

600
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:33,780
Think the coast is clear.

601
01:01:19,032 --> 01:01:20,821
What? What's wrong?

602
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:22,072
Is it your cut?

603
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:23,074
No.

604
01:01:24,074 --> 01:01:25,074
I'm starving.

605
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:27,322
All right, well, we'll get you

606
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:28,238
a steak when we get outta here.

607
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,199
Let's just get outta here, okay?

608
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:32,779
Give me the knife.

609
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:34,197
- Why?
- Just give me the damn knife.

610
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:35,947
Look, if you try something,

611
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:37,322
I will scream as loud as I can

612
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,238
and bring that monster
right to us, okay?

613
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,197
Okay. Just give it.

614
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:42,113
If I die, you die.

615
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,988
- Okay, okay.
- Got it?

616
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,365
Give me the knife.

617
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:49,240
You see something, run.

618
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:51,574
Just hurry up.

619
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:06,447
Carolyn, what are you doing?

620
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:07,449
Stop it! Carolyn!

621
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:10,866
Stop it! What are you doing?!

622
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:14,823
Please, stop.

623
01:02:14,825 --> 01:02:16,198
It's not enough.

624
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,782
You're sick! Stop it!

625
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:20,239
Carolyn.
- It's not enough.

626
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:21,241
What?

627
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,450
Stay back.

628
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,450
- It's not enough!
- Stop!

629
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:30,448
Get off of me!

630
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:38,281
Die, you fucking bitch!

631
01:02:38,283 --> 01:02:39,283
Die!

632
01:02:40,575 --> 01:02:41,575
Die!

633
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:45,533
Die!

634
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:50,325
Fuck!

635
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:05,992
Rot in hell, you fucking bitch.

636
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:12,616
Stop fighting, Nora.

637
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,785
Stop fighting, Nora.

638
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:02,329
Become one of us.

639
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:38,411
Hey, home base,

640
01:07:38,413 --> 01:07:41,539
doesn't look like
anybody's back here.

641
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:44,331
Hello?

642
01:07:45,706 --> 01:07:46,706
Hello?

643
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:54,370
Whoa, man. Oh, hey!

644
01:07:54,372 --> 01:07:56,538
Oh, my god, oh, my god.
- Help me.

645
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,245
- God.
- Please, please, help me.

646
01:07:58,247 --> 01:07:58,912
All right. All right.

647
01:07:58,914 --> 01:07:59,912
Yeah. No, no, no.

648
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,287
- Please-
- what happened to you?

649
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:04,370
We have to go! We
have to go now, okay?!

650
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:05,621
Do you hear me?!
- Can you stand up for me?

651
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,663
Come here, come here.

652
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:09,370
Okay, okay.

653
01:08:09,372 --> 01:08:10,372
No. Come on.

654
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:13,247
Come here.

655
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:16,245
I'm gonna put you
right here, okay?

656
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:17,455
Okay?
- We have to leave.

657
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:18,580
All right.
Yes, we're leaving.

658
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,204
We're leaving.
- We have to leave.

659
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:24,414
We're gonna get you back
to the station, all right?

660
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:26,830
Know what? We're gonna
get you to a medic.

661
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:27,746
We're going. We're going.

662
01:08:27,748 --> 01:08:29,913
Listen, we're gonna
get you to the station.

663
01:08:29,915 --> 01:08:30,913
We're gonna get
you to the station.

664
01:08:30,915 --> 01:08:32,830
We're gonna see a medic, okay?
- It's coming!

665
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:34,287
Please, let's go.
- What's coming, ma'am?

666
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:36,663
- It's coming!
- Okay, yes, yes, we're going.

667
01:08:36,665 --> 01:08:37,665
We're going. We're going.

668
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:39,915
Go in. Go in.

669
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:44,832
All right.

670
01:09:00,832 --> 01:09:01,832
Stay here.

671
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:00,832
Ma'am, I just checked it out.

672
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:02,623
It's just to deer or
something, all right?

673
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:03,916
Everything's gonna be okay.

674
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,291
What's wrong, ma'am?
What's out there, ma'am?

675
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,625
Ma'am?

676
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Ma'am?

677
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:29,959
I'm hungry.

678
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:02,918
Welcome back. Breaking news.

679
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,876
As we reported a few days ago,

680
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:07,126
Nora Thompson, the
journalist who uncovered

681
01:13:07,128 --> 01:13:11,501
senator Morrison's charity
scandal, has gone missing.

682
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:14,710
There's still no sign of
the New York times reporter.

683
01:13:14,712 --> 01:13:16,710
She disappeared over a week ago

684
01:13:16,712 --> 01:13:18,793
when she was expected
to make an appearance

685
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,545
on several news outlets,
including our very own.

686
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,252
Police believe foul
play is involved.

687
01:13:25,254 --> 01:13:27,960
Once again, the Morrison
family has denied

688
01:13:27,962 --> 01:13:31,085
any involvement with
her disappearance.

689
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:34,793
Coming up, weather
with windy breeze.
