 at what point in the procedure

you're referring to.

147
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:26,486

 poses no danger itself.

Dr. Riggs, based on the
 records and your years

457
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:18,722

 an opinion as to what caused

00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,742
I do.

460
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,813
And what was the
 cause of death?

461
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:27,773
A ruptured aorta,
 internal bleeding,

462
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:30,653
which in turn caused the
 lowering of the blood pressure.

463
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:33,682
In layman's terms, the heart
 did to not have sufficient fluid

464
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,903
to pump, so it stopped.

465

And what, sir,
 caused the rupture?

We can't answer that
 with absolute certainty,

467
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:44,363

 certain things.

I can tell you that
 Dr. Salisbury certainly

The rupture was on the anterior
 side of the aorta-- the front.

The surgeon making an
 incision in a man's back

476
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,674
would not puncture the
 front of the aorta,

the part facing the abdomen.

478
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:22,194
Well, now, if Dr. Salisbury
 did not puncture the aorta,

479
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,813
what did cause the rupture?

480
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:27,443
We call that spontaneous
 aortic aneurysm.

481
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:31,494
And did Philip Corrigan have
 any prior medical abnormalities

482
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:33,624
that might have
 caused this to occur?

483
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:38,124

 previous history of some degree

I mean, I know it
 doesn't sound good, Jake,

but that's the way it was.

537
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:07,608
Y'all played house, and she
 asked you to ace her husband.

538
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,797
Well, she said it should
 just be the two of us,

539
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,118
but that Philip would never give
 her the right kind of divorce.

540
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:14,088
There was some kind
 of a pre-nuptial.

541
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:18,018
And she said I was
 a doctor, and I

542
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:20,249
should know about these things.

543
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:23,618
Then she-- she asked
 me if I'd ace him,

00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:25,059

 everything-- and tell him?

653

The murder weapon--
 succinylcholine,

673
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,171
a drug used in anesthesia.

674
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,250
It paralyzes the
 limbs and the lungs.

675
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,610
In anesthesia, a respirator
 breathes for you.

676
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,290
Without a respirator,
 you just lie there

677
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,891
and watch yourself die.

678
00:37:00,891 --> 00:37:02,280
Where'd it come from?

 but it belongs to your client.

She played him, counselor.

681
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:10,770
She manipulated him, just like
 she manipulated my father.

682
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,021
She hated my father, but
 she couldn't divorce him.

683
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,340
She'd get nothing because of
 the pre-nuptial agreement.

684
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,741
But if he died while
 still married to her,

685
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,451
she'd get the house, the boat,
 and 50% of a $100 million

686
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,150
estate.

687
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:25,461
That's a lot of money.

688
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:31,051
In your profession,
 counselor, I

689
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:32,161
think they call that a motive.

 biting better than the catfish,

Charlie, in the category
 of things too ugly to eat,

693
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:56,751
possum's right up there
 at the top of the list.

694
00:37:56,751 --> 00:38:01,212
Many things in
 life are ugly, Jacob.

695
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:05,162
Many ways of dying are ugly.

696
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:09,602
Though few of them are uglier
 than being poisoned with

697
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:13,312
succinylcholine.

698
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:16,752
Your, um, friend--

699
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,832
Susan Corrigan.

700
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,512
Susan Corrigan-- She
 told you right about that.

701
00:38:24,532 --> 00:38:26,552
There must be some way
 we can determine if it

702
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,143
were administered, though.

703
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:31,292
Well, it would be
 difficult to trace

704
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,242
succinylcholine in the body.

705
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:38,782
It breaks down into
 succinic acid and cholene,

706
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,173
and both substances are
 normally found in the body.

707
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:47,492
Of course, a physician
 would know that.

708
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,753
It would be a flawless way
 for him to commit a homicide.

709

Five years ago, the same Miss
 Melanie Newton marries one Mr.

1237
01:17:25,248 --> 01:17:28,397
Philip Corrigan on June 12th.

1238
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:30,738
Far as I can see, there's
 no record of divorce.

1239
01:17:30,738 --> 01:17:33,377
Best I can figure, she had a
 fifth anniversary and wedding

1240
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:34,858
all on the same day.

1241
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:44,948
Dr. Riggs, not to steal
 your thunder, but you're

1242
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:47,318
prepared to testify
 for the defense

1243
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:53,828
that Philip Corrigan died from
 a spontaneous aortic aneurysm,

1244
01:17:53,828 --> 01:17:55,028
isn't that correct?

1245
01:17:55,028 --> 01:17:57,288
Correct.

1246
01:17:57,288 --> 01:18:00,998
Lots of things can cause a
 spontaneous aortic aneurysm,

1247
01:18:00,998 --> 01:18:03,238
right doctor?

1248
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:08,449
That's right-- hypertension,
 arteriosclerosis,

1249

syphilis, trauma.

1250
01:18:12,928 --> 01:18:15,608
How about a huge injection
 of succinylcholine?

1251
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:19,128
Would that cause
 trauma to the heart?

1252
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:23,719
The trauma I'm referring to
 would be from a serious blow,

1253
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:26,539

 hitting the steering

1254

 or a vicious punch,

1255

could that really have caused
 Philip Corrigan's aneurysm?

1267

Yeah, but nobody
 can know for sure.
