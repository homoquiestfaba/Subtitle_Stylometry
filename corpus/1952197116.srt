1
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,855
( sighs )

2
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,529
So did you like
the movie?

3
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,007
I think the movie was good.
Yeah.

4
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,168
It was very
entertaining.

5
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,368
What about you?

6
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,970
I liked it.

7
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,972
It wasn't
what I expected.

8
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,008
Too many people
in this...

9
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,976
in this movie theater.

10
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,278
Yeah?

11
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,715
I don't do very well in--
with crowds.

12
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,883
( laughs )
I know.

13
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,822
It was great,
you know,

14
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,790
very well done,
very well done.

15
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,526
And the way he
describes, you know,

16
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:12,764
the different steps that
led him to do that--

17
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,465
that's what's
interesting.

18
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,667
It's a documentary
kind of movie.

19
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:18,803
I thought it wasn't
going to happen.

20
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:22,140
They kept saying,
"Oh, we're not gonna get away with this."

21
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,343
And they did.
I was surprised.

22
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,779
Yeah, it was good.

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,848
Would you
watch it again?

24
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,883
Yeah.

25
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,552
Sorry to interrupt.
Have you decided on a wine this evening?

26
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:36,554
- Yes.
- What would you like?

27
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,390
Can--?

28
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:41,793
- red is good for you?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,728
Can we get
a bottle of--?

30
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,998
The first time he asked
for money was two years ago.

31
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,235
The second time--
six months ago.

32
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:54,139
And now,
two days ago,

33
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,574
he's asking
for some more.

34
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,879
And he's a friend.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,148
And, you know,
I help him.

36
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,151
But it's a lot of money
we're talking about.

37
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,452
And it never ends.

38
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,323
So what do I do?

39
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:13,992
What would you do?

40
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,795
<i>It sounds like he's</i>
<i>taking advantage of you.</i>

41
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:35,780
It's good
to see you.

42
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,449
It's always good
to see you.

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,188
Thank you.

44
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,994
Come here.

45
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,111
MAN:
<i>Attaboy.</i>

46
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,446
<i>Get 'em.</i>
<i>Get 'em.</i>

47
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,149
Good.
20, 19,

48
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,751
18, 17.
Focus.

49
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,587
16, 15, 14...

50
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,657
Two.

51
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,492
Good stall here.
Good stall.

52
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,962
Beautiful, Zizzo.
Drop it down.

53
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,998
Attaboy.
Good set.

54
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,632
Ow.

55
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,568
- I'm just kidding.
- How're you feeling?

56
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,636
- All right.
- Eat your Wheaties this morning?

57
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,472
- My Wheaties?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,941
I had my muscle milk this morning,
Wheaties after.

59
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,077
So what's going down?
What's new?

60
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,980
You want to hear everything
or just recent things?

61
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,682
Let's start at two or three
and work your way up.

62
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,252
Let me ask you
a question.

63
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,486
Yeah.

64
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,488
What are you doing
this weekend?

65
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,123
What am I doing
this weekend?

66
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,125
No, the other trainer
I'm working with.

67
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:57,362
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I do.

68
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:17,792
MAN:
<i>Chelsea, I'm ordering breakfast.</i>

69
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,760
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what you want?</i>

70
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,964
I'll just have whatever you're having.
Thank you.

71
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,733
What about the bailout?
How do you think that's going to turn out?

72
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:28,636
That's not
gonna work.

73
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,872
You need more money
in the system,

74
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:35,710
a lot more money than
what the government is putting in.

75
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:39,580
It's just
the beginning.

76
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:45,085
So I don't know
what to tell you.

77
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:48,923
I think it's better
to stay cash and...

78
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:53,394
that's what I do anyway,
so it's good for me.

79
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,062
No it's not.

80
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:23,490
( speaking French )

81
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,826
I'm out of here.

82
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:27,962
Thank you
very much.

83
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:31,131
- I hope I'll see you soon.
- Me too.

84
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,434
- Take care.
- You too.

85
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,103
CHELSEA'S VOICE: <i>I met with Philip</i>
<i>on October 5th and 6th.</i>

86
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:40,841
<i>I wore a Michael Kors dress and shoes</i>
<i>with La Perla--</i>

87
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:43,410
<i>I wore a Michael Kors</i>
<i>dress and shoes</i>

88
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:45,680
<i>with La Perla lingerie</i>
<i>underneath</i>

89
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,915
<i>and diamond stud</i>
<i>earrings.</i>

90
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:52,252
<i>We met at 7:30 at the hotel</i>
<i>and had a drink downstairs.</i>

91
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:55,089
<i>He liked my dress</i>
<i>but didn't go into detail why</i>

92
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,758
<i>and didn't mention anything else</i>
<i>about my appearance.</i>

93
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,359
MAN:
<i>So how did it go?</i>

94
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,862
It was fine.
We had a nice dinner,

95
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:06,433
you know, went back
to the hotel.

96
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:09,003
But he's
very well endowed

97
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:12,406
and sometimes I just can't
handle him that long.

98
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:17,377
Lucky for me, though,
he's attractive,

99
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,947
so that helps and I
at least enjoy myself.

100
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,984
But it was weird
when I left.

101
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,353
He didn't even stand up

102
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:29,556
to hug me or say goodbye
or kiss me on the cheek.

103
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:33,527
It was a very
awkward departure.

104
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:36,263
He's never
done that before.

105
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,003
CHELSEA'S VOICE:
<i>We ate dinner at Blue Hill.</i>

106
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,804
<i>Philip didn't ask</i>
<i>for a menu</i>

107
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:45,840
<i>and had the chef serve us</i>
<i>a five-course meal,</i>

108
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,975
<i>a different wine</i>
<i>with each course.</i>

109
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,945
<i>We went to the 9:40
showing of "Man on Wire"</i>

110
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:53,580
<i>at the Sunshine Cinema.</i>
<i>And he liked the movie.</i>

111
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:57,184
<i>We went back to the hotel</i>
<i>and talked for half an hour,</i>

112
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,020
<i>mostly about</i>
<i>a friend of his</i>

113
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:02,356
<i>that keeps borrowing money from
him and not paying it back.</i>

114
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:06,593
<i>Then we had sex for about an hour.</i>
<i>After, we talked about--</i>

115
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:11,532
<i>After, we talked for about 15
minutes and he fell asleep.</i>

116
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,601
<i>At breakfast he briefly told me
his worries regarding the economy</i>

117
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:17,604
<i>and said I should invest</i>
<i>my money in gold.</i>

118
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:20,908
<i>He also mentioned a book about
how the Federal Reserve works.</i>

119
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:23,077
<i>He didn't make</i>
<i>another appointment.</i>

120
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,015
<i>Sometimes clients think</i>
<i>they want the real you,</i>

121
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,284
but at the end
of the day they don't.

122
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:33,587
They want what they want you to be.
They want you to be

123
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,956
something else.
They don't want you to be yourself.

124
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:38,559
Suppose I'm that rare
client that really wants to--

125
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,594
if they wanted you
to be yourself,

126
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,997
they wouldn't be
paying you.

127
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,134
I know you've been buying
five sessions at a time.

128
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:49,136
Right.

129
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:52,039
You realize you're losing
money by doing that, right?

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,709
But I'm taking it
as it goes, you know?

131
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,544
I know. I hear that.
The whole thing is is, like,

132
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:00,981
if you buy more sessions, obviously
you're gonna save a lot more money.

133
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,617
I think our relationship is good.
You're liking what we're doing.

134
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:06,253
- You do a great job.
- You're feeling good. You're looking good.

135
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,322
You've gained
five lbs. of muscle.

136
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:10,490
- You're on your way to a six-pack.
- I'm trying.

137
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:13,594
I don't think our relationship
is going to end soon.

138
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,563
So my suggestion is let's
have you buy a bigger package--

139
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,566
- like 25 or 50.
- What did I do last time? 10?

140
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,302
- You did five.
- That went quick.

141
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:25,906
So if you did 25 or 50, you'd be saving,
like, 20 bucks per session.

142
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:29,309
So you're looking
at saving $400.

143
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,347
And I know times are a little crazy,
but that's my point.

144
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:36,016
I know what I pay for five.
What's it go up to from there?

145
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,119
You pay $150
for five.

146
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,921
And you'll end up
paying $125

147
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:43,057
If you end up
getting 25 sessions.

148
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:46,426
You are the beautiful,
young ingenue accompanying--

149
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,495
Let me ask you
a question.

150
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:51,031
Not to pry,
but you guys--

151
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,033
I mean, you guys
are hurting.

152
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,035
Everybody's hurting right now.
How do you--?

153
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:57,371
You're gonna spend money?
You're going to do this?

154
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:59,673
Self-medicating.

155
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,541
<i>Don't worry about that.</i>

156
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,244
<i>I'm go?</i>

157
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,611
<i>If I was hurting,</i>
<i>I wouldn't go.</i>

158
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:05,946
<i>I can't afford</i>
<i>to go to Vegas.</i>

159
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,481
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to afford to go to Vegas.</i>

160
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:08,883
<i>I can afford for you</i>
<i>to go to Vegas.</i>

161
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,785
<i>We all can afford</i>
<i>for you to go to Vegas.</i>

162
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,287
<i>In fact, we almost can't
afford for you not to go.</i>

163
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:15,455
<i>You gotta come,</i>
<i>dude, seriously.</i>

164
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:18,358
<i>All right, let me see</i>
<i>what I can do.</i>

165
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,394
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

166
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,232
Hi, Chris.
Package for you.

167
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,334
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.

168
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,336
Thanks.

169
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,541
I'm starving.

170
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,410
CHELSEA:
<i>How was work?</i>

171
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:39,680
Work was good--
a little crazy.

172
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,682
I trained Zizzo.

173
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:44,151
He was trying
to convince me to go

174
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,586
To some crazy
trip in Vegas.

175
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,023
Vegas?

176
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,458
Yeah, boys' trip
to Vegas this weekend.

177
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:55,796
I told him I didn't think
you'd approve of that.

178
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:58,265
Do you get bored of just
talking to rich people?

179
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,567
It can get tedious.

180
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:02,569
It can get tedious?
Why?

181
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,138
It can.

182
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,808
You really have to adapt and
become something that they want.

183
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,609
Oh, God.

184
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,213
I mean, do you find
yourself caring at all?

185
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,681
I do.

186
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,851
I think you're getting a little
worked up about it, though.

187
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,419
Because the economy
is fucked.

188
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,855
And my business
is fucked.

189
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:23,123
I'm making 1/10 of what
I made two years ago.

190
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,359
It's just getting
worse and worse.

191
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,696
And this is something that is
gonna fucking fall by the wayside

192
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,698
if I can't
get it together.

193
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,700
And I've aged out
of the business also.

194
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:38,939
So I fucking show up on
a set and people ask me--

195
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,976
They think I worked on
"McHale's Navy" or something.

196
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:44,644
Did that other show
get picked up?

197
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,646
Yeah, it might have
gotten picked up,

198
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,949
but it's not a sure thing.
And it's not enough

199
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,651
To maintain what
I'm kind of used to.

200
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:54,054
You don't think so?

201
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,257
I can't tell.
I don't know what the fuck's going on

202
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,392
in the business
anywhere anymore.

203
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,727
( exhales )

204
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:02,897
Well, anyway,
thanks for listening.

205
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,333
I've been in so many
relationships where nobody listens.

206
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:09,736
I definitely think relationships
are about communication, don't you?

207
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,939
God, totally.

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,675
Jesus, that's why we--
it's completely two-way.

209
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:19,113
We're constantly exchanging
kind of what we think.

210
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,481
I mean, that's how
people relate.

211
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:22,816
It's just so
fucking ridiculous

212
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,185
the way everybody wants
something completely one-sided

213
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:26,686
and want
something for nothing.

214
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,423
Sorry, my hands
are really cold.

215
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:32,126
It's okay.
I'll warm them up.

216
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,595
MAN: <i>Well, my first
thought is I do like it.</i>

217
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,697
<i>I do like it.</i>

218
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:40,301
<i>It's just that,</i>
<i>I'll tell you, right now</i>

219
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:45,272
<i>It's a tough time for me to start
pioneering a new line like this.</i>

220
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:48,108
<i>The economy right now</i>
<i>is really in the toilet.</i>

221
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:51,178
<i>And we got a store</i>
<i>full of stuff.</i>

222
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,381
<i>And we do have stuff</i>
<i>that somewhat competes</i>

223
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,550
<i>with this type</i>
<i>of garment right now.</i>

224
00:13:56,551 --> 00:13:59,353
CHRIS:
<i>Right.</i>

225
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:01,488
MAN:
<i>I'd like to show it real quick</i>

226
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,992
to Marvin, just to get
an idea of what he thinks.

227
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:07,727
I'm thinking
right now, no.

228
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,197
But I'm thinking maybe
down the road we can try it.

229
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,267
Marv, uh...

230
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,369
you know,
I would definitely--

231
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,138
I'm definitely okay
with it being on consignment

232
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,674
because it gets a chance
to be out on the floor

233
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,743
and see how it does.
You guys have a very big store

234
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:27,314
and I'm sure we could find a little
bit of space to put the stuff out there.

235
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,649
I know it's going to sell. I
know people are gonna buy it.

236
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,418
This way
I'm okay with that.

237
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,787
If it doesn't sell, then I'll
take it back. That's fine.

238
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,390
<i>But I would like to have it out
there for the Christmas season</i>

239
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:39,693
<i>Because that's when</i>
<i>people are buying things.</i>

240
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,628
MAN: <i>Everyone has to</i>
<i>stop talking and listen.</i>

241
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,531
<i>If we don't close</i>
<i>this deal on Friday</i>

242
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:46,433
<i>We have to pay</i>
<i>a huge, huge penalty.</i>

243
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:50,204
<i>There's no way this deal's
gonna close on Friday.</i>

244
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:53,207
The whole world is afraid
of redemption. No one knows--

245
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,876
70% of all hedge funds are
gonna be out of business...

246
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:58,578
CHELSEA: <i>On October 25th</i>
<i>I met with Dennis.</i>

247
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,483
<i>We had lunch at Nobu and
then went to a hotel room.</i>

248
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,886
<i>During lunch he talked
about the financial crisis.</i>

249
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,888
<i>When we got back</i>
<i>to the room</i>

250
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,956
<i>he immediately</i>
<i>got on the phone</i>

251
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:13,227
<i>and ordered</i>
<i>some MaCallan 25.</i>

252
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:16,030
<i>I put on a Kiki de
Montparnasse corset,</i>

253
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,132
<i>panties and gloves.</i>

254
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,867
<i>The shoes</i>
<i>were basic Zara.</i>

255
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:23,237
<i>After he got off the phone</i>
<i>we made out for a while.</i>

256
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:27,074
<i>Then he asked me</i>
<i>to masturbate, which I did.</i>

257
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,843
<i>Then he masturbated</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

258
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:32,779
<i>He made another appointment</i>
<i>for November 3rd.</i>

259
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,382
MAN: <i>I think one element</i>
<i>that could be improved a lot</i>

260
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:36,983
<i>is the photography.</i>

261
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,153
You should have
much better pictures.

262
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,888
I have pictures I can give you.
That's not a problem.

263
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,358
Are they really
top-quality pictures?

264
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,026
They should look like
"Playboy" pictures.

265
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:47,428
Yeah, they're
perfect.

266
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,696
Yeah? Okay.
That's important.

267
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:53,600
And we could improve the logo
and general style of the site,

268
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,769
make it look
much more high-class.

269
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,572
Okay, I also
wanted to--

270
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,240
I don't know exactly
how you'd do this,

271
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,142
but I would
really like it

272
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:05,446
if my site would come up
in the search engines.

273
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:09,249
You know, like--

274
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,218
I don't know exactly
how you do that,

275
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:14,754
But when you Google
"escorts," I come up.

276
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,091
It's a little tricky.
It'll take some time.

277
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,793
But one good idea is
to get yourself listed

278
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,795
in a lot of directories
and review sites.

279
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,231
The more links there
are to your site,

280
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:27,201
the better your rankings in
the search engines are gonna be.

281
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,803
- You can do that?
- I can help you with that.

282
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:32,139
Sure, sure.
But that takes monthly work,

283
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,741
if you want to work out a
monthly maintenance contract...

284
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,410
How much?

285
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,178
You have to continually
update it every month.

286
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,381
How much would you charge
just to design it?

287
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,484
About 1500 bucks.

288
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,819
And how soon could you
get it done?

289
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,923
I could only work
after hours here, so...

290
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:52,359
MAN OVER PHONE: <i>Can we sort
of start over here?</i>

291
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,029
<i>I am not trying</i>
<i>to tell you</i>

292
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,031
<i>how to run</i>
<i>your business.</i>

293
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,134
<i>I'm trying to help you</i>
<i>enhance your business.</i>

294
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,902
<i>And I think</i>
<i>I can do that.</i>

295
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,971
<i>If I didn't think</i>
<i>I could do that,</i>

296
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:07,107
<i>I wouldn't have taken</i>
<i>an interest in you.</i>

297
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,309
<i>You seem like</i>
<i>a pretty smart girl.</i>

298
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,547
<i>Are you familiar with
an escort named Tara?</i>

299
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,382
I'm not.

300
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:19,486
<i>Okay, well, you might</i>
<i>want to check out</i>

301
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:22,623
<i>Some of the stuff that's
been posted about this Tara</i>

302
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,791
<i>On "The Erotic</i>
<i>Connoisseur."</i>

303
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,494
I don't usually like
checking out reviews.

304
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:30,930
<i>Well, let me tell you</i>
<i>a little story</i>

305
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:32,932
<i>about what happened</i>
<i>to Tara.</i>

306
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:36,803
<i>Tara is 20 years old,</i>
<i>kind of came in here</i>

307
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:40,106
<i>just falling off the turnip
truck, doing her own thing.</i>

308
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:43,443
<i>And when I put up</i>
<i>the reviews,</i>

309
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,912
<i>her rate started going up.
Do you understand?</i>

310
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:49,650
<i>This is making you more
upscale than you've ever been.</i>

311
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,153
<i>You think you know</i>
<i>an idea of upscale,</i>

312
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:56,923
<i>but what I'm offering you</i>
<i>is upscale beyond.</i>

313
00:17:56,924 --> 00:18:00,093
So...

314
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,962
So anyhow,

315
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:05,999
do you have to develop
business skills?

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,635
Who does your books?

317
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,972
That's something
I'd rather not answer, actually.

318
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:16,510
Well, I'm not gonna--
let's just say, do you keep books?

319
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:19,079
<i>I do. Let's just say I have
a few people that help me out.</i>

320
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,081
<i>I'd like to</i>
<i>keep it at that.</i>

321
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:23,083
MAN: <i>I think you want</i>
<i>to look at this time</i>

322
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,385
<i>As a time to actually</i>
<i>get more invested.</i>

323
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,722
Personally, my wife and I have gotten
more aggressive with our family.

324
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:31,692
We set up a 529
for our young son.

325
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,361
We wanted to get
more involved here,

326
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:39,132
because you don't see these levels,
these opportunities very often.

327
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,701
If you sit back like
everyone else and sell,

328
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,703
you're actually going
against the grain

329
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,240
of what you should be doing-- investing.
It's important.

330
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,141
How's your wife?
How's Rachel?

331
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,810
She's well. She's better.
Thanks for asking.

332
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:53,813
Yeah, of course.
How's your son?

333
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:57,317
He's good too.
Everyone's well.

334
00:18:57,318 --> 00:19:00,854
Every family right now feels stress.
We watch the news.

335
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:04,891
We watch this
Presidential election

336
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:07,227
and this campaigning.
And it's stressful

337
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,062
to wonder where
our country's going.

338
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,664
Definitely.

339
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:14,067
I think sometimes you
just gotta turn it off.

340
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,503
You just can't even
listen to it.

341
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:20,540
I think, more importantly, you
have to look at your career, really.

342
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,444
I see your ledger. I see your
numbers. You're good at what you do.

343
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:27,180
You could possibly be the best
at what you do. You're amazing.

344
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:30,784
But let's not rest
on our laurels here.

345
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,521
There's more things
you could be doing.

346
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:37,257
Like what?

347
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:40,827
It just seems like
everything changes.

348
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:44,063
A reflection point like this allows you
to look at it and see what's changed.

349
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:47,167
I asked you to meet with
Michael for that exact reason.

350
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,969
<i>I think he has</i>
<i>a really good view</i>

351
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,038
<i>of what's going on</i>
<i>in your market</i>

352
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,309
<i>and could take you</i>
<i>to the next level.</i>

353
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,879
<i>What exactly does he want?</i>
<i>What exactly does he do?</i>

354
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,316
MICHAEL: <i>What differentiates you</i>
<i>from those other women</i>

355
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:06,386
is what's gonna make these
other businesses grow for you.

356
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,955
So I do understand it,
but I just wanted to say that.

357
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:11,591
Besides that,
there's other things.

358
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,493
There's so many things
that you can do

359
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:16,162
that will allow you to
continue having your anonymity,

360
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:18,264
but you can continue
to grow your business.

361
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:21,802
Here's an example--
do you really think

362
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:26,272
some woman would want to take
her 16-17-year-old daughter

363
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:28,942
to my boutique if they
knew I was an escort?

364
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,512
If it was a sex boutique
and it was a couple,

365
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:35,148
that'd be a different story, but
that's not what I'm interested in.

366
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,917
I'm not trying to be
insensitive to that. I get that.

367
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,953
I'm just trying to
make sure you understand

368
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:43,990
there's an opportunity lost if
you don't take advantage of that.

369
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:47,627
In what other ways could
I do that where I'm safe?

370
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:50,163
Well, like, you
could write a book.

371
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:53,299
We could do a movie
about your life.

372
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,802
Right now
that's really hot.

373
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,971
People are making
movies like that.

374
00:20:57,972 --> 00:21:01,641
MICHAEL:
There's Tara right there.

375
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:02,942
Tara.

376
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,378
Sugar!

377
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:05,512
- Darling, how are you?
- How are you?

378
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,247
Very well.
Good to see you.

379
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,549
- This is Chelsea.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

380
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,218
I have to get out of here.
Thanks for lunch.

381
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,354
- It was nice to see you.
- You too.

382
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:17,123
We have about 20 minutes.
Want to grab a quick drink?

383
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,559
- I'd love a drink right now.
- Let's do it.

384
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,628
- So how was your flight?
- It was good.

385
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:26,533
- <i>Where are you staying?</i>
- <i>I'm staying over at the "W."</i>

386
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:30,336
Yeah, it's really
depressing.

387
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,539
Well, you know, you're
successful, you're very creative.

388
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,409
I'm sure there's plenty
more opportunities

389
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,477
- in front of you--
- Yeah, I know, I know.

390
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:39,646
I know, but it's--

391
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,548
I don't really want
to talk about it,

392
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,283
But it's just
bad out there.

393
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,218
I mean, if I--

394
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:49,088
You know, two holes in the ground
that were gonna be buildings,

395
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,725
now the banks have--
you know, it's just a bad time.

396
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,760
I have a big office.

397
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:56,162
But that's just--
it's why I'm a little...

398
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,334
I don't
want to leave.

399
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,544
- MAN: Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:16,817
Here.

401
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,452
You can just
put that right there.

402
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:20,654
Thank you.

403
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,459
Um...

404
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:37,036
I haven't seen you
in almost two weeks now.

405
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:39,573
- Yeah, that's a long time, right?
- I know. God.

406
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:43,176
( sighs )

407
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:48,014
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

408
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,785
How long have I
been coming here?

409
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,887
Two and a half
years...?

410
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:57,256
God... Two
and a half years.

411
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,696
- CHELSEA: It's not that long.
- It's not that long?

412
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:04,397
No.

413
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:09,836
Feels like a--
feels like...

414
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:12,506
Doesn't feel
like a long time.

415
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,508
It's been fun,

416
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,410
But it feels like you're a
big part of my life, you know?

417
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,313
I look up and suddenly
you're a big part of my life.

418
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:22,315
I'd like
to think so.

419
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:25,184
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

420
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,889
( sighs )
Yeah.

421
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,891
You have a lot
of makeup on today.

422
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:33,426
- Do I?
- Yeah.

423
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,231
I like it,
it's just...

424
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:40,066
Someone else
have you do that,

425
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,868
or did you just
do it on your own?

426
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,302
- I did it myself.
- Yeah?

427
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,539
This is how
it usually is.

428
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,408
CHELSEA'S VOICE:
<i>On October 18th I met with Dan.</i>

429
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,578
<i>I wore a vintage black</i>
<i>cashmere sweater,</i>

430
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,112
<i>Earnest sewn jeans</i>

431
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,114
<i>and Pour La Victoire</i>
<i>boots.</i>

432
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,651
<i>Dan talked</i>
<i>the entire time.</i>

433
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,886
<i>We didn't have sex.</i>

434
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,655
<i>He was very upset</i>
<i>about a contract</i>

435
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:04,824
<i>his firm lost</i>
<i>to I.M. Pei.</i>

436
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:06,994
<i>He set a date</i>
<i>for Tuesday.</i>

437
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,528
MAN:
<i>So they gave us a booth</i>

438
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,230
<i>And they started doing</i>
<i>the bottle service,</i>

439
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,132
<i>and they started just</i>
<i>bringing all this shit.</i>

440
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,834
We were totally hammered.
As we're leaving,

441
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:18,906
some other manager comes in
and decides not to comp it.

442
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,042
It was, like,
10 grand.

443
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,244
10 grand was
our bar bill.

444
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,512
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Isn't that sick?

445
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:28,949
That's a big bar bill.
( laughs )

446
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,287
Oh, I'm sure it was a
lot of champagne, wine.

447
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:36,689
I don't even know.
There was a little ring of us.

448
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,426
Then it grew. And by the time
there was that outer ring,

449
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:42,029
I think strangers were just
ordering buckets of beer

450
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,965
- and champagne and shit.
- Oh my God.

451
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:49,202
<i>It was so fun, though.</i>
<i>I think he charges the movie.</i>

452
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:51,571
<i>She needs to get</i>
<i>one of those--</i>

453
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,241
<i>what do they call those
things? It's like a vaporizer.</i>

454
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,010
She did.
It didn't last long.

455
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:59,879
Didn't get her
high enough?

456
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,881
I don't know
what it was.

457
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:04,251
DAVID: My buddy tried
one, but he didn't like it.

458
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,086
He's been smoking
a long time

459
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,888
and he missed the burn and
the coughing in the lungs.

460
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,992
He needed it.
The clean thing wasn't enough for him.

461
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,927
Chelsea?

462
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,628
- Hi.
- Hello.

463
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:17,364
I thought
that was you.

464
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:18,966
Hi. I'm Ken.

465
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,569
- How are you? David.
- Hi, David.

466
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,607
<i>I'm just taking off,</i>
<i>but I thought I'd say hi.</i>

467
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,776
DAVID:
<i>See you.</i>

468
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,445
And how's Sheila?

469
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,814
She's doing good.
She's doing good.

470
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,649
There's always gonna be
old people too,

471
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,052
No matter what's going on
with the economy.

472
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,355
She's doing okay,
still at the center,

473
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:45,392
even though she's a little
afraid that, you know--

474
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,296
Cutbacks, recession,
depression--

475
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,132
They might lose their funding.
But that's a long way off.

476
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,868
We should
get together soon.

477
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,337
<i>Yeah, we should</i>
<i>get together.</i>

478
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,640
<i>I think she'd< like that again.</i>
<i>That'd be nice.</i>

479
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:04,244
You know, there's not a lot
of couples like you guys.

480
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:06,513
<i>I agree.</i>
<i>There's not a lot of couples like us.</i>

481
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:11,151
A lot of people think they
can separate love from sex.

482
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,686
And when they
get into it...

483
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:17,790
they're intimidated, their
emotions arise, they get jealous.

484
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,827
With you guys,
it's simple.

485
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,803
- Chris.
- Jess, nice to meet you.

486
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:33,106
Nice to meet you.
Come into my office.

487
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:36,843
- How're you doing?
- Great. This place is beautiful.

488
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:39,779
CHRIS'S VOICE: <i>Are you guys
looking at expansion?</i>

489
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,416
<i>From the looks of this place, it
looks like you're well-funded.</i>

490
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,684
<i>You already have</i>
<i>four locations.</i>

491
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:47,220
<i>How aggressive are you about
finding other locations?</i>

492
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:49,222
We do not want
to take over the world.

493
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:52,292
But we do want
to expand our facilities.

494
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:55,529
We want about 10 clubs
in the area,

495
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,098
but we certainly don't want
to take over the world.

496
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,602
We want to maintain a
boutiquelike style-- of operating style

497
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:04,871
<i>So that we can cater</i>
<i>to each member.</i>

498
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,140
<i>So many of the corporate</i>
<i>monsters out there</i>

499
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:09,008
<i>are very rigid</i>
<i>in their policies,</i>

500
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:10,944
<i>and that's the last thing</i>
<i>that we want to do.</i>

501
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:15,182
The problem is with gyms
is it's hard for the--

502
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:17,150
a-- I have to take
care of my client,

503
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,686
but b-- I need the facility
to take care of my client.

504
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:20,987
They're with me
for one hour,

505
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:24,291
but they're in the gym
for the whole year.

506
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:28,495
I'm liking, I think, that I hear that
that's very important to you guys. Yes?

507
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,663
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

508
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:33,733
If you look at the club alone,
it's a $15-million facility.

509
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:37,137
so we have to maintain
retention with our members.

510
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:41,241
So if we're not getting results,
guess what-- they're gone.

511
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,842
I was wondering
if we could do something

512
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:44,544
where I could start
working with you more--

513
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:47,046
not just doing my sessions where
I'm getting a piece of them,

514
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:50,217
but something where I could
help you train the trainers

515
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:55,355
or manage the place, and you
could cut me a base salary.

516
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,857
I just have to start doing
more for myself, you know.

517
00:27:57,858 --> 00:28:02,229
I've gone out and checked
some other places out

518
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,031
and felt some
people out and--

519
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:06,699
You've looked
at other places?

520
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,269
After all the times
I've helped you out here

521
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,537
you've looked
at other places?

522
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,705
I mean, again,
I just looked,

523
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:15,074
just to feel out what
I was gonna say to you.

524
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,909
And I'm here to you
first, obviously.

525
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,179
How do you feel
about the other places?

526
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,848
I mean, look, I've been
working with you a long time.

527
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,716
I don't want
to leave here.

528
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:27,621
But at the same time I
need to do something now.

529
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,690
I need to step it up. I've been
doing this for too long, man.

530
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,425
Right now is not
exactly the best time

531
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:35,462
To start hitting people up
for more money.

532
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,531
I know that.
I know that.

533
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:40,066
But that's exactly
almost why I have to.

534
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:43,136
Because I don't know how much
worse things are gonna get.

535
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:46,773
Or hopefully they turn around
and get better. I don't know.

536
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:49,008
But all I do know is I've
been doing this long enough

537
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:51,110
to where I need a change.
If it's gonna be

538
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:53,046
with you guys,
I would love to do that.

539
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,416
And if it's not, I understand,
but then I have to move on.

540
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,751
You're talking about
more of a management role,

541
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,354
taking a piece of the profits,
stuff like that.

542
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:04,123
I've been trying for weeks just
to get you to wear the shirts.

543
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:08,728
And you can't even pass
along with me on that.

544
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:12,098
I got to be honest with you, Bill,
I'm not a uniform guy.

545
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:15,902
I mean, I love the gym.
I just don't love the T-shirts.

546
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:18,471
But if I have
to wear a T-shirt

547
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:20,907
to be on the team,
I'll do that.

548
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:22,409
That's what I mean--
more of a team role.

549
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,511
I don't see you
in that role.

550
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,279
I don't get that
feeling from you.

551
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,915
I get you're more of an outsider,
more of an independent

552
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,384
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants
kind of guy.

553
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:45,365
- Hi, how can I help you?
- What's your cheapest prepaid phone?

554
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,633
Cheapest prepaid?
Let me show you.

555
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:56,443
This is $110. You get 200 minutes
and nights and weekends free.

556
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,945
$110 and I only get
200 minutes?

557
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:01,114
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I'll give you $80 for it.

558
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:03,483
<i>No, our cost is $95.</i>
<i>I can't give you for $80.</i>

559
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:06,119
Then I'll take $95,
and I'll buy two.

560
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,254
<i>No, I can give you</i>
<i>$100 if you want.</i>

561
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:12,625
Okay, that's fine.
I'll take two then.

562
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,961
<i>Hi, David.</i>
<i>This is Chelsea.</i>

563
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:18,264
<i>Hi. You're real.
You can never tell with these websites.</i>

564
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:22,502
( chuckles ) So I checked
out your information

565
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:24,571
and I see
that you're a writer

566
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:28,174
and your company is in L.A.
Is that where you live as well?

567
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,910
<i>Yeah, I live in L.A.</i>
<i>I'm just in for a couple days.</i>

568
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,413
Do you travel a lot?

569
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,648
<i>I do, you know,</i>
<i>project to project.</i>

570
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,284
<i>I just go wherever</i>
<i>they're shooting.</i>

571
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,653
<i>I'm in New York,</i>
<i>like, five times a year.</i>

572
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,655
What kind of writer
are you?

573
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:45,057
<i>Screenwriter.</i>

574
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:50,330
So what are you
looking forward to?

575
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,798
Do you have anything
specific in mind?

576
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:57,470
<i>Well, you know,</i>

577
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,639
<i>after looking</i>
<i>at your site</i>

578
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,874
<i>I'd just really love to
get together with you.</i>

579
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,410
<i>I'm just feeling</i>
<i>kind of stressed out.</i>

580
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:05,678
<i>I should probably</i>
<i>see a shrink,</i>

581
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,048
<i>But it seems more fun</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

582
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:11,184
Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

583
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:15,021
Are you married?
Do you have kids?

584
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:17,957
<i>Yes and yes</i>
<i>and no comment.</i>

585
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,827
How many kids
do you have?

586
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:23,929
<i>I have two</i>
<i>little girls.</i>

587
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,132
<i>Don't make me</i>
<i>feel bad, though.</i>

588
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,034
I won't.

589
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,840
Would you like
to meet tomorrow?

590
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,876
<i>Yes, I would,</i>

591
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:40,680
<i>But tomorrow is my</i>
<i>screening and my dinner.</i>

592
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:42,282
<i>That's what</i>
<i>I'm in for.</i>

593
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,284
<i>So I can't do it</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

594
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,587
<i>And I leave Friday morning.</i>
<i>How about tonight?</i>

595
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,855
I can't do it
tonight.

596
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,924
<i>Really?</i>

597
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:55,895
Have you ever even seen
an escort before?

598
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:59,499
<i>No, this is my first time.</i>
<i>Is it that clear?</i>

599
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,536
Well, no, it's just
that I have this policy

600
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:05,971
that I usually
don't see a client

601
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:08,308
unless they've been
with an escort.

602
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,077
You know--

603
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,079
<i>Do you make</i>
<i>exceptions?</i>

604
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,915
Actually, I was just
going to tell you

605
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:19,719
that I was looking
at your birthday

606
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,291
and it actually coincides
with mine really well.

607
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:28,060
Let me see if I could
push some things around.

608
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,563
CHELSEA'S VOICE: <i>We clicked.
There was something there.</i>

609
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:33,966
- <i>And I told him that--</i>
- WOMAN: <i>You told him that?</i>

610
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,769
I told him that I was going
out of town for the weekend.

611
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,939
- Right.
- And he didn't like that at all.

612
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,408
And what really
set it off was

613
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:45,010
when he insulted me
about my, you know--

614
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,280
all my
personology books.

615
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:50,116
Right.

616
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:54,254
I had a feeling he didn't
support me in my belief.

617
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:58,658
And I found out
last night for sure.

618
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,995
So you found out last night
that he's not into astrology?

619
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:05,798
It's not astrology.

620
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,402
Are you gonna
do this to me too?

621
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,471
- It kind of is.
- It's not.

622
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:18,478
20,000 people-- that's more
than just reading star signs.

623
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,380
<i>I definitely think</i>
<i>it's important.</i>

624
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:24,384
It's critical to have
somebody who supports you.

625
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:29,121
But it's important to,
you know--

626
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:31,991
I don't want to be
negative, 'cause I think

627
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:33,693
that feeling when you
connect with a client

628
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:35,695
is the best feeling
in the world.

629
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,697
I don't want to be
sort of down on that.

630
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,409
It's funny because I wanted
to get away from my parents.

631
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,378
I didn't want to depend on them.
I didn't want their money.

632
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:54,547
That's more than
half the reason

633
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,517
I started doing this
in the first place.

634
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,519
I have a lot of money
saved up,

635
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,288
and I won't completely feel
like I'm dependent on him,

636
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,491
- <i>monetarily at least.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

637
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:10,596
<i>But he made me</i>
<i>feel happy.</i>

638
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,131
<i>And I want to know</i>
<i>if that's something</i>

639
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,734
<i>that will continue</i>
<i>or if it won't.</i>

640
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:19,639
CHRIS: <i>Do you really believe
what's coming out of your mouth?</i>

641
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,307
<i>You think--</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

642
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:22,975
<i>Let me guess--</i>
<i>this guy's married.</i>

643
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:25,712
<i>Does he have a family?</i>
<i>What do you think's gonna happen?</i>

644
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,347
You're gonna go away
this weekend...

645
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:29,014
something magical
is gonna happen?

646
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:31,217
He's gonna go home
to his wife--

647
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:33,486
who he's cheating on
by the way--

648
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,388
and say, "Hey, Honey,
guess what?

649
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,891
I spent three days with a
hooker, and guess what--"

650
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:42,161
I don't know what's going to
happen. And that's the point.

651
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,431
I know what's gonna happen.
You know what's gonna happen?

652
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,835
You're gonna go on your
little trip, all right?

653
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,837
And when he's done
playing with you

654
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,138
because he's having
a midlife crisis,

655
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,274
he's gonna leave you
and go back

656
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,976
to his normal,
great life

657
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:59,311
with his wife
and his family

658
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:02,982
and he's gonna leave you
high and dry. And guess what--

659
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:06,151
then you're gonna come back here,
and there's no here anymore.

660
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:09,288
And you'll be stuck with
you and your books, alone.

661
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:12,625
I promise you that.

662
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:19,932
I wish I would've known
you felt like that.

663
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,601
MAN:
<i>So that's it?</i>

664
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:24,003
Just fucking blindsides
you out of nowhere?

665
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,674
Blindsides me out of
nowhere, walks in and,

666
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:32,545
"I am going away with
somebody and it's over.

667
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,814
That's the end
of it."

668
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:37,583
Buddy, listen.

669
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:40,520
I feel for you. From fucking
everything you told me about this girl,

670
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:44,089
you loved her. You were happy.
This was the thing.

671
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,458
So for that
I feel for you.

672
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,694
But, honest to God,
good fucking riddance.

673
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:51,697
- It's not good riddance.
- It is good riddance.

674
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,999
It's the first girl in
as long as I can remember

675
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,503
that I really care about--
cared about.

676
00:35:57,504 --> 00:36:01,240
Let me tell you, all
women ultimately are evil.

677
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,310
They're the worst species.
They're worse than fucking hyenas,

678
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:07,179
because they have
all the power.

679
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,316
- I'm sensing a little frustration from you.
- They have all the power.

680
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:12,452
<i>And they know this.</i>

681
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:15,688
- CHELSEA: Do you ever listen to Jim Rome?
- DAVID #2: <i>Yeah, I love Rome.</i>

682
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:18,123
CHELSEA: <i>He always talks</i>
<i>about Charles Barkley,</i>

683
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:21,594
<i>and he had a bill</i>
<i>at some club in Vegas</i>

684
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:24,129
<i>for 15 grand</i>
<i>in alcohol.</i>

685
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,199
And he was like,
"It was just an accident. I forgot to pay it."

686
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,935
He walked out on it?

687
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,337
No, it was just like he said,
"put it on my tab,"

688
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:34,273
and never paid it, honestly
just forgot to pay it.

689
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:36,308
- DAVID #2: Sure, Charles.
- ( laughing )

690
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:40,480
Sock down $15,000
worth of booze

691
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,482
and then waltz
out of the door.

692
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:45,485
Then he repeats it,
like, five times.

693
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,887
You see that when they
hand you that funnel cake

694
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:50,957
with the powdered sugar on it.
It's all hot and crispy.

695
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,293
You think, "this is
gonna be great."

696
00:36:57,664 --> 00:37:00,633
INTERVIEWER:
<i>I guess what I'm building up to</i>

697
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:04,704
is I'm trying to see the role
that this guy plays in your life--

698
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:07,940
not necessarily your
relationship between him--

699
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:11,744
I'm not interested in the intimate
details between these two people--

700
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:15,615
you and your boyfriend.
I'm interested in the kind of relationship

701
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:20,753
somebody in your business would have
with somebody they actually love.

702
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:23,455
Let me speak with him and
see how he feels about it.

703
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:28,794
This journalist mark
is actually really nice.

704
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:31,196
He's a little intrusive,
but--

705
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:32,932
<i>Intrusive?</i>
<i>How so?</i>

706
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,568
He's a journalist,
so that's his job, right?

707
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,337
It's just I'm not used
to that really.

708
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:39,872
He wants
to meet you.

709
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,742
- He wants to meet me?
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:44,911
What does he want
to meet me for?

711
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:48,548
He's never met
an escort

712
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:51,751
that is in a committed
relationship.

713
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:54,921
WOMAN: <i>He just continues</i>
<i>to keep asking me out.</i>

714
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,690
He's even talked about my
boyfriend too, like if I say--

715
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:59,992
I feel like he's
gonna be like, "Oh...

716
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:02,061
bring your boyfriend out,
or we can do this,"

717
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:04,096
and, "if your
boyfriend's away..."

718
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:07,366
I know guys that do
stuff like that--

719
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,735
He'll have you bring the boyfriend out
but then hit on you the whole time...

720
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:13,072
- Exactly.
- That you're with him anyway.

721
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,274
So it doesn't even matter if I
tell him I have a boyfriend or not.

722
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,209
So, I mean...

723
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,512
I don't know what to do.
I'm gonna keep training him

724
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:23,916
and continue
to blow him off nicely,

725
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,518
but I'm at a loss
right now.

726
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,655
That's like
the worst situation.

727
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:32,792
I've been there before, but
for girls it's so much worse.

728
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,495
Just kick the crap out of
him every time you see him.

729
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:38,631
Make him throw up,
so he can't think about

730
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,601
<i>asking you out and then
he'll start to hate you.</i>

731
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,435
<i>I hope so.</i>

732
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:47,539
- Either that or get in really good shape.
- <i>That's true too.</i>

733
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,575
<i>And then you might want</i>
<i>to go out with him.</i>

734
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:52,878
<i>I don't know about that.</i>
<i>I'm not sure about that.</i>

735
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,816
<i>You can make him over,</i>
<i>like a work in progress.</i>

736
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:01,721
- Hi.
- Hi. May I help you?

737
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,522
Glenn wouldn't happen
to be here, would he?

738
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:05,758
Yes, right this way.

739
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,532
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

740
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,875
Glenn, someone
to see you.

741
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,277
- Ah, Miss Chelsea, I presume.
- Thanks.

742
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:27,146
Thanks, Dad.

743
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:30,182
- What the fuck is up?
- Hello.

744
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:36,922
So how do you like what I
haven't done with the place?

745
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:41,127
Uh... This is
your place?

746
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,129
It's kind of
a nice setup.

747
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,534
I've got a little deal
with <i>Pater</i> there.

748
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:51,170
So you're
supposed to be

749
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:54,439
a "sophisticated
escort," I read.

750
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,442
Would you like a little Schoenberg?
( bangs keys )

751
00:39:57,443 --> 00:40:00,012
I could improvise
on it for hours.

752
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:03,015
Ahem--

753
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:09,388
So what's
on the menu?

754
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,423
What would you
like to know?

755
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:14,960
Well, it's not so much
what I'd like to know.

756
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:17,963
It's what I'd like
to feel.

757
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:21,366
But again...

758
00:40:22,635 --> 00:40:25,905
I don't think you
really understand

759
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:29,508
what I can do for you
if this goes well.

760
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:32,277
I trust you've looked
at my site again.

761
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:36,348
You've seen
some of the girls

762
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,118
who are the stars of
"The Erotic Connoisseur."

763
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,120
I've got a very big
project coming up

764
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:43,956
that I think, if this works
out, you'd be perfect for.

765
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:47,426
I'm organizing a junket,
such as it is,

766
00:40:47,427 --> 00:40:50,196
to Dubai.
You know Dubai?

767
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,832
Lots of money.
Very tall buildings.

768
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,436
Arab people with cash flowing
out of their water faucets.

769
00:40:57,437 --> 00:41:00,773
I'm gonna take a bunch
of girls to Dubai.

770
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:04,543
Everybody there says that the
Russian hookers are the best.

771
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,545
I want to convince
the Dubai elites

772
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,848
that it's best
to buy American.

773
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,718
It's very-- it's all
on the up and up.

774
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,319
The great thing about
the whole project

775
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,323
is that it sounds like
a white slavery ring,

776
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:21,526
but it's not.

777
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,562
And again, I think
this could be something

778
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:26,132
that really ups your profile,
gets you more money.

779
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:31,570
I want to help you.
And you can help me help you

780
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:34,273
by giving me a
little bit of a sense

781
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:36,308
of what you're like
to be with.

782
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:41,513
How does this trip to
Dubai exactly benefit you?

783
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:43,515
It benefits
everybody.

784
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:46,185
I've got some people out
there who set up the capital.

785
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:49,088
We go out there totally
first-class all the way--

786
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,390
private jet,
champagne...

787
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:52,658
( sing-song voice )
cocaine--

788
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:54,660
All sorts of
yummy yummy things.

789
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:56,829
We're out there.
We spend a week.

790
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,731
On your off-hours you
do whatever you like.

791
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:02,268
But on your on-hours
I bring you to men

792
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,071
who will pay $2500,
$3500, $10,000

793
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,674
just for the pleasure
of shaking your hand.

794
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,776
And then it goes
from there.

795
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,045
If you want
a piece of this,

796
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,015
it might be...

797
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,383
( sighs )
in your interest

798
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:21,420
to give me some play.

799
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:26,125
We talked about review
copy, as it were.

800
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,027
I'd like to see
what it's like

801
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,362
to be with someone

802
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:32,497
as breathtaking

803
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:36,601
as you are.

804
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:38,437
Here I have...

805
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:40,973
a new, hygienic,

806
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:43,375
lovely Q-tip.

807
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:46,212
And maybe...

808
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:50,015
to get a better sense of something,

809
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:52,384
you could take
this Q-tip

810
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:56,856
and swab it a bit
on your treasure part...

811
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:01,560
give it to me,
whereupon I will

812
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:04,496
take a little taste,
and in this fashion,

813
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:09,001
I will be able to discern
whether your treasure part

814
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,504
tastes like
fresh maple syrup

815
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:15,875
poured onto a hot-off-the-griddle
piece of French toast

816
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:18,878
on the one hand,
or...

817
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,280
a salt lick doused in
chlorine on the other.

818
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:24,583
You see, this is the thing.
This is the kind of wordplay

819
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:28,120
the kind of vivid
verbal imagery

820
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:32,524
that makes "The Connoisseur"
the connoisseur.

821
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:34,726
GIRLFRIEND:
<i>Oh, God.</i>

822
00:43:36,729 --> 00:43:39,265
How'd it go?

823
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:42,368
Thank you.

824
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,468
Not so well.

825
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:46,038
But I don't really
want to go into that.

826
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,308
I dealt with that and I
just want to leave it there.

827
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:52,177
But when I came home,
I tried calling Chris,

828
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:54,479
'cause I really needed him
and he wasn't there.

829
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:00,319
And meet you-- like, meet
and talk to you Wednesday?

830
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,254
Mm-hmm.

831
00:44:04,357 --> 00:44:08,827
Okay, what is that
gonna entail?

832
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:10,996
Hopefully more money.

833
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:13,232
He said he could help
increase my rate.

834
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:18,637
That's what he said?

835
00:44:18,638 --> 00:44:21,740
<i>What did he say in
relation to the other girl?</i>

836
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:30,349
<i>He said he reviewed her</i>
<i>and she did really well.</i>

837
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,985
INTERVIEWER: <i>Do you ever get
intimidated by other women's bodies</i>

838
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:34,954
that are in
competition with you?

839
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:38,357
Not at all.
I'm very happy with what I have.

840
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,261
You look great, but this is
a high-stress business, right?

841
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,397
- You know?
- True.

842
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:48,467
I mean, there's always
somebody else.

843
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:52,237
<i>( street drummer plays</i>
<i>throughout )</i>

844
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,653
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. Thank you.

845
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:25,070
- Hi there, how are you?
- Hi. Good.

846
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,889
( drumming continues )

847
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:36,909
Yeah, so what did he
say about that?

848
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,978
You know how Philip was acting
really strange the other day?

849
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:41,679
Yeah.

850
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,681
Now I know why.

851
00:46:43,682 --> 00:46:45,317
Why?

852
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:47,886
Or I think
I know why.

853
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:50,588
I was shopping today.

854
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:54,192
And I saw him

855
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:57,695
and some girl outside
who I've never seen.

856
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:00,665
I think it's
that new girl,

857
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:03,101
the one the hobbyist
was talking about.

858
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:05,237
Oh, <i>that</i> new girl.

859
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,506
You think it was her.

860
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:10,909
What'd she look like?

861
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,946
Similar to me.
She had long brown hair,

862
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:18,417
thin, pale skin.

863
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,353
She's taller, though.

864
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:25,123
And that upsets you, of course.
Listen to me.

865
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:27,125
I don't know how much
this hobbyist

866
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:30,728
is playing this
to his own favor--

867
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:33,131
you guys against each other,
the new girl in the street--

868
00:47:33,132 --> 00:47:35,700
to help himself out and try
to get a freebie off you.

869
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:38,470
And, honestly,
can I tell you something?

870
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:42,540
You are the best
at everything you do, okay?

871
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,076
And just because
there's some new girl--

872
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:45,877
there's always going to be new
girls that come on the scene,

873
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:49,414
but nobody does
what you do, okay?

874
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,649
So please do me a favor and
do not let it stress you out.

875
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,286
I know you're competitive
and want to be the best,

876
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,589
but you <i>are</i>
the best.

877
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,924
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

878
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:01,759
Can you get me
another drink?

879
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,695
Yes, I can get you
another drink.

880
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:12,237
Excuse me, guys.

881
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:15,440
I'll take a ginger ale and whatever
looks like a vodka something.

882
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:17,442
- What's going on, brother?
- CHRIS: Nothing much.

883
00:48:17,443 --> 00:48:21,246
- Nice to meet you.
- MAN: Heavy date?

884
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,115
I'm trying
to cheer my girl up.

885
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,150
Not my date.
It's my girlfriend.

886
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:28,586
That's all right.
She's having a bad day.

887
00:48:28,587 --> 00:48:31,123
MAN #2:
He's been checking her out.

888
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:49,901
- CHELSEA: <i>"buy me."</i>
- <i>( DAVID #2 laughs )</i>

889
00:49:49,902 --> 00:49:51,736
We're having a conversation
with this one here.

890
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,371
Oh, yes?

891
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:55,307
He's done very well,
as you can see.

892
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:58,410
- DAVID #2: A lot of red dots in that book.
- A lot of red dots.

893
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:01,313
Actually, that one
is available.

894
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:03,315
I love that one.

895
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:06,585
Kind of reminds me
of a crown.

896
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:10,021
CHELSEA:
<i>When I went to meet him,</i>

897
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:12,324
he listened.

898
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:15,893
He made me feel a way
I haven't felt with Chris

899
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,896
since the first couple
months of being with him,

900
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:21,633
and probably
more so than that.

901
00:50:21,634 --> 00:50:25,036
Yeah, I mean,
that's great.

902
00:50:25,037 --> 00:50:27,005
I love that when it
happens with a client--

903
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:29,874
you meet somebody and there's
like a real connection.

904
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,444
It is different.
A client's different

905
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:36,248
from a boyfriend.
It's a different kind of relationship.

906
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:38,517
There's boundaries there

907
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,852
where it's just
a little bit artificial,

908
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:42,854
<i>whereas what you have</i>
<i>with Chris is really--</i>

909
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:45,524
<i>it's a real relationship.</i>

910
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:48,793
MAN ON TV: <i>This is not the end.</i>
<i>This is not the worst.</i>

911
00:50:48,794 --> 00:50:52,797
<i>I think it's going to get much
worse before it gets better.</i>

912
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:56,834
If I hear one more thing about
this debate, I'm gonna throw up.

913
00:50:56,835 --> 00:50:59,971
If I hear the word "Maverick" one
more time, I'm gonna throw up.

914
00:50:59,972 --> 00:51:01,806
INTERVIEWER:
<i>There could be somebody</i>

915
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,576
who just really wants
the real you, right?

916
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:10,982
I mean,
the real you.

917
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,652
In other words,
that's a lot of money

918
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,154
<i>for a short</i>
<i>period of time.</i>

919
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:17,855
<i>You don't want to get</i>
<i>the fake diamond.</i>

920
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:21,560
<i>You want to get</i>
<i>the real diamond.</i>

921
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,861
<i>What else</i>
<i>do you want to know?</i>

922
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:26,898
<i>Another</i>
<i>blind alley here.</i>

923
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:29,601
<i>It's the story</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

924
00:51:31,704 --> 00:51:34,072
DAVID #2: <i>So listen, the idea</i>
<i>of going home this weekend</i>

925
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,074
is really starting
to bum me out.

926
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:38,142
And I'm thinking
a crazy thought.

927
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,679
I'm thinking
I'm not going to.

928
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,181
You have any big plans
this weekend?

929
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:48,820
Want to spend
the weekend together?

930
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:52,657
Yeah.

931
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:55,026
Good. You want
to get out of town?

932
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,964
Okay, I'm gonna take
care of some things

933
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:02,066
I need to do
on Friday morning.

934
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:04,636
I'm gonna send
a car for you,

935
00:52:04,637 --> 00:52:07,505
take you to this place in the
Hudson Valley I know about.

936
00:52:07,506 --> 00:52:09,608
It's called Monteverde.

937
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,143
And I'm gonna meet you
up there in the afternoon.

938
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:15,580
We'll spend the weekend together
and see where this thing goes.

939
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:17,949
Okay.

940
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,352
It's a plan?

941
00:53:18,877 --> 00:53:22,847
CHELSEA: <i>About a year ago I found</i>
<i>these books on personology.</i>

942
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:24,849
<i>So the first thing</i>
<i>I ask a client--</i>

943
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,851
<i>or one of the first</i>
<i>things at least--</i>

944
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:30,154
<i>is when is their birthday.</i>
<i>And that helps me see</i>

945
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:31,723
<i>if this person is going
to put me in danger,</i>

946
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:34,526
<i>if they're gonna be</i>
<i>a risky business decision.</i>

947
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,729
INTERVIEWER:
<i>So you vet them out by seeing</i>

948
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,198
<i>if they have their personal
details on the top of their head?</i>

949
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,434
That's right.

950
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:44,569
The guy you met--
you mentioned him before--

951
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,904
the guy you met
before your boyfriend

952
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:48,540
that you were kind of
interested in,

953
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,542
he was interested in you.

954
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:52,944
How did you handle
that situation?

955
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:00,284
Let's just say
I handled it.

956
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:03,421
- Yeah, but--
- Or I am handling it.

957
00:54:03,422 --> 00:54:05,457
You are handling it?
It's still going on?

958
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,225
What's next?

959
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:11,696
Where have you been?

960
00:54:11,697 --> 00:54:14,065
- I've been out.
- Out where?

961
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,133
I've been calling--
I haven't heard from you in hours.

962
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:18,102
I just had my phone
turned off.

963
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:22,540
I've been freaking out,
calling you incessantly.

964
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:25,042
Get that for me.

965
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:30,749
It broke.

966
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,385
Where have you been?

967
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:36,320
I told you.
I was out.

968
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:40,258
It's freezing
out there.

969
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:42,427
Doing what?

970
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:44,996
Seeing somebody.
What do you think?

971
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:48,433
I think that you've been
gone for the entire day

972
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:50,435
without any contact.
I thought--

973
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:52,737
I didn't know if you
got attacked or what.

974
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:57,776
Are you still gonna take
that trip to Vegas?

975
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:01,646
I have no idea.
No.

976
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:03,681
I told them, no,
I'm not going to Vegas

977
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:06,317
'cause you
couldn't come.

978
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:08,319
I don't know--

979
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,355
( sighs )
What is going on?

980
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:13,925
- Maybe you should.
- What does that mean?

981
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:20,799
I met somebody today.

982
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,936
You met somebody?
Okay, what does that mean?

983
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:27,071
I want to go away
for the weekend.

984
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:33,778
( stuttering )
I'm sorry, I'm not understanding.

985
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:37,482
You met somebody today--
a client, right?

986
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:40,485
You know our rule is you
don't go away with clients.

987
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:54,732
It's just something
I have to do, you know.

988
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:56,534
No, I don't know.

989
00:55:56,535 --> 00:55:58,837
I don't even know what you're
talking about right now.

990
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,839
Who is this client?

991
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,374
I've actually
never met him,

992
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:06,478
but there was
something there.

993
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:08,646
There was definitely
something there.

994
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:11,850
Today was the first
day you met him?

995
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:14,586
I just said that,
didn't I?

996
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:18,823
This is just hard
for me to suddenly--

997
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:23,628
you're suddenly going away with
someone you met <i>today.</i>

998
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:26,430
Does this have something
to do with your books?

999
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:31,936
Yeah, it does.

1000
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:34,806
But that's not
the only reason.

1001
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:41,345
There's just
something about him.

1002
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:43,314
And there's something
I feel I can't miss--

1003
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:45,349
I can't
miss out on.

1004
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:50,321
Okay, let's back up.

1005
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:52,590
Did I do something?
Is this about me?

1006
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:55,760
It's just for two days, Chris.
It's for two days.

1007
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:58,195
- Okay, I get it.
- I don't know what's gonna happen.

1008
00:56:58,196 --> 00:57:00,965
Is this because of me
talking about Vegas?

1009
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:03,535
Is this something
to get back at me?

1010
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,704
Not at all.

1011
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:10,842
What's this
guy's name?

1012
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:12,777
Don't worry
about his name.

1013
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:20,151
What does this mean, you're
going away for the weekend?

1014
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:22,086
I'm just going away
for the weekend.

1015
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:24,488
That's it or you're
making other plans?

1016
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:26,558
Look, we've been together
for over a year and a half.

1017
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,126
I'm gonna need more than just
a "hi, how are you doing?"

1018
00:57:29,127 --> 00:57:31,563
"I'm fine. I'm going away
for the weekend." All right?

1019
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:33,965
You don't even know
this guy.

1020
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:36,434
Chris, you know
what this means to me.

1021
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:39,503
You know what my books
mean to me.

1022
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:42,740
Books.
You know, look,

1023
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:45,710
I was cool with your books 'cause
it made you feel comfortable

1024
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:47,879
and it made
your work easier,

1025
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,883
but at the end of the day they're
<i>books--</i> written by some guy

1026
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:54,218
that probably has never been
in a relationship in his life

1027
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:57,488
and doesn't know what the
fuck he's talking about, okay?

1028
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:59,523
- You think so?
- Yeah, I think so.

1029
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:03,027
I knew you felt that way.
Why didn't you just admit it?

1030
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,731
- Why didn't you admit it?
- Because you weren't talking about leaving me

1031
00:58:06,732 --> 00:58:10,034
For a guy that you read
about in a book, okay?

1032
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:13,170
- I didn't say I was going to leave.
- We're not living in a book.

1033
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:15,940
- I said we're going away for a weekend.
- You and I are real.

1034
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:18,409
It's not just a guideline
or a format for my business.

1035
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,812
It's for my
fucking life.

1036
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,348
No, it's--

1037
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:27,151
We are our lives.
Do you understand that?

1038
00:58:27,152 --> 00:58:31,055
What you do for work--
you met a client today.

1039
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:33,224
You didn't meet
your soulmate.

1040
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:36,160
You didn't meet some guy you
read about in a book, okay?

1041
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:38,162
I don't know that
and you don't know that.

1042
00:58:38,163 --> 00:58:41,232
No, I do know that.
You don't spend one day with a guy

1043
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:43,567
and destroy
over-a-year relationship.

1044
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:48,072
I mean,
we live together.

1045
00:58:48,073 --> 00:58:52,076
We're just gonna
throw that all out?

1046
00:58:52,077 --> 00:58:55,513
I didn't say I was
throwing it all out, Chris.

1047
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:58,916
I said I need to find out.
I need to figure this out for myself.

1048
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,184
Yeah, well, if you go
on this trip,

1049
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:03,821
you're throwing
it all out, okay?

1050
00:59:03,822 --> 00:59:06,390
- You understand that?
- You're so selfish.

1051
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:08,926
There is no going
on this trip.

1052
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:13,031
You're incredibly selfish.

1053
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:15,499
- What did you say? I'm selfish?
- You're selfish.

1054
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,935
I'm selfish?
I've bent over backwards for you

1055
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:20,938
- while you go out and fuck guys for money!
- Don't fucking yell at me.

1056
00:59:20,939 --> 00:59:24,608
And I don't do anything.
I sit here like a jerk-off all day.

1057
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:27,578
Don't fucking
yell at me.

1058
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:31,315
<i>( ringtone chiming )</i>

1061
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,930
A little cold.

00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,342

1066
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:04,548

01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:08,485
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I can't come.</i>

1068

<i>I have to go home.</i>

1069
01:00:12,057 --> 01:00:15,392
I'm already here.

1070
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:18,129
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

1071
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:24,068
<i>The room's taken
care of, but I just--</i>

1072
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:26,604
<i>I was video-chatting with
my kids this morning</i>

1073
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:29,073
<i>and the tears just started</i>
<i>pouring out of me.</i>

1074
01:00:29,074 --> 01:00:31,609
<i>And I realized</i>
<i>I have to go home.</i>

1075
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:38,616
CHELSEA:

1076
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:44,522
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:00:44,523 --> 01:00:46,524

<i>dark straight hair,</i>
<i>and perky little body,</i>

01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:50,962
<i>Chelsea would appear</i>
<i>to have the potential</i>

1080
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:54,265
<i>to satisfy in the goth</i>
<i>or girl-next-door modes.</i>

1081
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:57,268
<i>Alas, Chelsea seems intent</i>
<i>on marketing herself</i>

01:00:57,269 --> 01:00:59,670
<i>as a sophisticated</i>
<i>escort.</i>

1083

1084

01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,602
How are you?

01:03:14,406 --> 01:03:17,241
Good.

No.

1115
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,113
Want to talk about it?

1116
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:57,982
I really shouldn't.

1117
01:04:00,018 --> 01:04:02,052
But it's just been
really bothering me.

1118
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,459
Something happen?

1119
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:16,033
There's this guy
who runs a message board

1120
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:19,403
and he's really nobody.

1121
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:23,874
And...

1122
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,777
he wanted to meet me

1123
01:04:26,778 --> 01:04:28,746
and have sex for the exchange

1124
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:34,885
that in return he'll write
a good review about me,

1125
01:04:34,886 --> 01:04:37,087
tell people that I gave him

1126
01:04:37,088 --> 01:04:40,124
the time of his life,

1127
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:43,327
which I already know
I do, but--

1128
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:45,329
( laughs )

1129
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:48,633
I shouldn't talk about this.
I'm sorry.

01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:53,804
You can if you want.

1131
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:04,982
He took a Q-tip

1132
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:07,585
and he asked me
to put it on my vagina.

1133

<i>shower for three days.</i>

talking about this.

you need some air.

Do you want
to go downstairs?

When somebody-- we agreed
to do this, right?

1150
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,987
We agreed to meet here and
have this kind of situation,

1151
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:31,789
which is a transactional
situation like the one

1152
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,258
you deal with all the time
in your business, right?

1153
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:37,895
Now we're up to this part
where I'm asking you something

1154
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,531
that would actually be
interesting to me,

1155
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:42,466

holding out on me.

1156
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:47,170
I mean, the thing is that
the inner you is really--

1157
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:49,373
I mean, there's--

1158
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:52,777
in this business it's all
about appearance, right?

1159
01:08:52,778 --> 01:08:56,547
If you weren't beautiful, nobody'd
be paying to bang you, right?

1160
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:59,016
To put it grossly,
right?

1161
01:08:59,017 --> 01:09:03,353
So the thing is that
if you weren't beautiful,

1162
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:05,723
you wouldn't be
in this business.

1163
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,325
Is that right?

1164
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:10,795
Do we agree on that?

1165
01:09:10,796 --> 01:09:15,966
So suppose
I like your looks,

1166
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:18,168
but I'm really much more
interested in the real you

1167
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:21,872
because I get a sense from
looking at your picture--

1168
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:24,408
I'm not talking about myself,
but say somebody else--

1169
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:26,410
I got a feeling
looking at your picture

1170
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:28,979
and also looking
into your eyes right now

1171
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,014
and the way you're doing
that with your hair

1172
01:09:31,015 --> 01:09:33,651
and the way you're wearing
your little outfit there

1173
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:36,386
and all that kind of stuff--
and I like your earrings--

1174
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:39,389
and here's somebody I'd like
to get to know a little better.

1175
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,426
So is that iron door
always gonna be closed?

1176
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:47,431
For most people, yes.

1177
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:49,667
Most?

1178
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:51,836
It's possible that
there might be a crack

1179
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:54,071
in that little door
you could walk through?

1180
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:57,808
This kind of thing that you
could possibly get through?

1181
01:09:57,809 --> 01:10:01,111
I assume the armor in your
situation must be very thick,

1182
01:10:01,112 --> 01:10:03,347
just because
it has to be, right?

1183
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:06,617
So what kind of guy
would it have to be?

1184
01:12:31,429 --> 01:12:33,430
( knocks )

1185
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,201
( beeps )

1186
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,705
- Hi, Naim.
- Hey, Chelsea.

1187
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:43,741
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

1188
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,743
Good, thank you.

1189
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:49,046
- You look lovely.
- Thanks.

1190
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:53,450
But it's very important that you
vote for McCain-- very important.

1191
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:55,953
I know. We've had
this discussion.

1192
01:12:55,954 --> 01:13:00,090
The state of Israel
must continue.

1193
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:02,693
He's the man.

1194
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:05,362
Everybody's buying gold
'cause they think

1195
01:13:05,363 --> 01:13:10,067
it's a good hedge
against the stock market.

1196
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:12,536
A friend of mine
told me that today,

1197
01:13:12,537 --> 01:13:15,673
actually said I should
invest my money in gold.

1198
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:20,343
People think that
you should buy diamonds,

1199
01:13:20,344 --> 01:13:24,882
but diamonds don't really
have a resale value.

1200
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:28,251
Unfortunately,
it's a myth.

1201
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:30,688
Gold is
the way to go.

1202
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,192
( sighs )

1203
01:13:49,874 --> 01:13:52,076
Here.

1204
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:56,446
( shuddering )

1205
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,292
( gasps )

1206
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,403
( sniffles )

1207
01:14:29,313 --> 01:14:32,382
( moans )

1208
