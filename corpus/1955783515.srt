1
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:21,367
KICK BOXER
RETALIATION

2
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,641
What a great opportunity
this is for Kurt Sloane,

3
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:38,867
stepping into the last minute.

4
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,819
With Hoskins out on a back injury,
this could go either way.

5
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,348
At this point, Renzo, I
don't know what to expect.

6
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:50,663
He comes, he wins, he
disappears, he's back.

7
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,911
I'm completely confused.

8
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,927
He looks like he means business.

9
00:07:57,073 --> 00:07:58,797
"Did you see that?"
Wow!

10
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,377
Man, you gotta love this guy.

11
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:10,933
Ladies and gentlemen,
your winner, Kurt Sloane!

12
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,098
Hey everybody, we're here with
the winner, Kurt Sloane.

13
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,267
Man, hell of a fight.

14
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,348
I want to know, what do you
call that finishing move?

15
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:29,035
That was like the hurricane arm bar that's
what they call it, the hurricane arm bar.

16
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,820
Hurricane arm bar.
I like it, I like it.

17
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,967
Congrats again.

18
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,916
When I went down...
I must have blacked out.

19
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,863
Don't ever scare me like that again.

20
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,896
I had this dream.
It's really strange.

21
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,722
Promise you'll never leave me.

22
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,918
I promise.

23
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,577
Got a limo waiting for us out front...

24
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,577
with full bar.

25
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,512
Let me grab a shower and
I'll meet you there.

26
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:42,802
Okay.

27
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:25,855
Kurt Sloane?
US Marshall services.

28
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,785
What can I do for you?

29
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:36,634
I don't know. Um... you could
come along quietly, I guess.

30
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,636
What for?

31
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,906
Apparently, tough guy,
you killed someone.

32
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,845
This is for Eric.

33
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,658
Maybe you forgot.

34
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,726
About 18 months
ago over in Thailand? No?

35
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,825
That was self-defense.

36
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,702
Ah. Well, that's good.

37
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:15,103
That's the kind of stuff that you want
to tell the judge once you get there.

38
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,082
We were just told about
getting you there.

39
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,903
Can I see that badge again?

40
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,837
Sure.

41
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,757
Welcome back.

42
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:20,802
Shock and aw!
Just like you feeling now!

43
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,902
The man who killed Tong Po.

44
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:37,787
The odds for an American
beach boy were astronomical.

45
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,950
You will be joining with
him in hell shortly

46
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,917
Maybe.

47
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,768
What I need it was for
you to take his place

48
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,972
As the next big attraction.
That would have been...

49
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,677
but you left Thailand.

50
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:08,895
Today is when you find out...
It doesn't work that way, does it?

51
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:12,690
It is time for you to defend your title.

52
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,154
In another fight to the death.
Don't you think?

53
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,121
Never again.

54
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,000
You are not smart enough to let me go.

55
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,017
You touch me again,
and I will break your nose.

56
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,958
The sense of humor.

57
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,995
Stop!

58
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,045
This guy.

59
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,115
One more fight to death.

60
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,725
Against the current champion.

61
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:25,154
That's all I am asking! "Voila"!

62
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:57,087
Step in to the ring with Mongkut.

63
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,065
I will pay you 1 million American dollars.

64
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,937
Tax-free.

65
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,066
Or you spend the rest
of your life in prison.

66
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,814
Without the possibility
of ever getting out.

67
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:21,785
Just remember, the man in this
prison loved Tong Po.

68
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:25,112
They know who you are.
Surprises and fears.

69
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,024
They are making a move on you.

70
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:24,166
I got this.

71
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,050
You better call the prison doctor.

72
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,088
Tell him there is three
broken ribs and a punctured lung.

73
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,190
Dislocated jaw and a broken nose.

74
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,131
That was not too good, was it?

75
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,933
One day in the general population
and already in some sort of trouble.

76
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,141
You are not going to make it, Mr Sloane.
At least not like this.

77
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:40,757
Behind these walls,
you will have fight to the death everyday.

78
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:45,051
So why not just take the money?

79
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,092
When you'll agree to fight for me,

80
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,064
You will instantly call from
choking on your own vomit.

81
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:59,967
To comfort well, and provocative
sensual amusement.

82
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,073
Kurt.

83
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:15,057
Are you in there?
You with me on this?

84
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,020
When you were kid,
did you get your ass kicked much?

85
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,995
You look so much better with
that nose I give you.

86
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:34,907
I do love your spirit.
I hate to waste it.

87
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:46,989
Can you believe she actually
sent me this picture?

88
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,959
Wow, that's crazy!

89
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,820
- Hello?
- Honey, it's me.

90
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,855
Kurt. Where... where are you?
What happened?

91
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:20,857
- I've been going crazy here.
- I've been kidnapped.

92
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,389
I am outside of Bangkok in a prison.

93
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:26,129
Kidnapped? Kurt!
Where are you?

94
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,733
You interrupted my meditation.

95
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:39,935
Meditation, really?
Does that help you to stay calm?

96
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,875
I'm calm. Very calm.

97
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,939
I guess not.

98
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,094
I keep my fist fast and hard.

99
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,028
Ready to break anything that it hits.

100
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:02,772
What is important that could not
be said at the police station.

101
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:04,793
I do not feel safe
at the police station.

102
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,465
What could possibly be safer than that?

103
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,555
I need your help.

104
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:10,542
A few years ago, when you were a cop
you investigated us.

105
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,440
And now you want our help?

106
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,185
Tell me where my husband is.
Here's the payment.

107
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,530
He is being held at the
northern jail facility

108
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,215
for the murder of Tong Po.

109
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:31,568
- Who is responsible for this?
- Thomas Tang more, a fight promoter.

110
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:37,093
You did not hear that from me.

111
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,677
Get him released.

112
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,571
You do not have that much money.

113
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:49,565
Follow her.
Tell me where she goes.

114
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:09,329
That's the way they have implemented
the attitude adjustment.

115
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:20,077
I want what you got.
You took the lash without a whimper.

116
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,008
Over here.

117
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,958
Every day I want you to come
down here and grab this plant.

118
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,865
Deaden the nerves.

119
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,834
Put it on your back at night.

120
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,069
The rest will have to do with your mind.

121
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,887
- Can you walk?
- Maybe.

122
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:00,207
C'mon. Behind the wall.

123
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:03,159
You will never fight the same way again.
Trust me.

124
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,001
Durand.

125
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,881
Kurt.

126
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,151
What are you doing here?

127
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,663
Training fighters.

128
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:14,764
Here? Why?

129
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:18,768
Because I was accused to participate
in the murder of Tong Po.

130
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,127
Can you believe that?

131
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,538
And also I wont give you up.

132
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,977
So Mr. Moore blind me.

133
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,013
Don't get sentimental.
It is a blessing.

134
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,754
How is any of this a blessing?

135
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,658
Being able to use my sense
without the eyes...

136
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,087
It's a blessing. Being able to know the
answer before the question.

137
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:47,892
It's a blessing..

138
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,969
Don't look in my eyes.

139
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,942
You are not alone.

140
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,979
After 2 weeks we have made
absolutely no progress.

141
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:18,695
Yeah, we have to find a way to act this up.

142
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,931
And see our adamant and condition to fight

143
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,901
We can all, dismay him later...

144
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:28,035
Once we get bored with this.

145
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,033
Are you ready to listen to me now?

146
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:38,012
I know this guy.
I know how to break him.

147
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,894
Hey. You rang?

148
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,830
Thanks for coming.

149
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,799
Are you kidding?

150
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,068
So what have you been doing?

151
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,131
Working for a private investigator,

152
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,033
looking for deadbeat dads.

153
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm looking for my husband.

154
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,817
I think he's in the northern jail.

155
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:16,786
I also need you to get to the kidnapper.

156
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:19,078
This guy's name is
Thomas Tang Moore.

157
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,957
I know he's got more
money than God.

158
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:25,094
Well, it's not about the ransom money.

159
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,796
Let me keep over some stats.

160
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,798
I'll meet you back here in two hours.

161
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,191
Okay. thanks.

162
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,059
Don't worry.
We'll find him!

163
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,170
My man Kurt Sloane.

164
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,114
I still owe you two broken ribs.

165
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:29,859
I may have deserved that.
But I am just here to talk to you.

166
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,923
The answer is still no.

167
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:33,987
Is it now?

168
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:39,935
In that case, I have something
you might want to see.

169
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,714
If you touch her...

170
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,355
I am not the one you have to worry about.

171
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,077
You know what he wants.

172
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:08,896
Now... are you willing
to talk to Mr Moore?

173
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:26,141
Did you just say yes?

174
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,141
Yeah.

175
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,854
What else they can do to you?

176
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,918
They got my wife.

177
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:43,989
I am so excited about the fight.

178
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:48,904
This is a fight
I will pay to see.

179
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:51,168
Well, obviously.

180
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,169
I have my conditions.

181
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:02,318
You may not have any contact
with her or anyone else...

182
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,943
until the fight.

183
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,118
But we can show you
she's very well cared for.

184
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:09,792
If anybody hurts her...

185
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:13,796
We die! We all die!
You die!

186
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,928
Not you. You...

187
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,120
You have to feel yourself.

188
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,025
The air moves.

189
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:54,992
Before it moves.

190
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,146
Because...

191
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:02,312
You are him.

192
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,774
Use his force as yours.

193
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,981
Anticipation.

194
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,082
Hidden anticipation.

195
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:54,648
No, put your weight behind.

196
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,896
That, come on.

197
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,972
You gotta get past him first.

198
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,942
Have faith in your ability.

199
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:19,178
Tell me when you start to feel
it coming close to you.

200
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,299
Now.

201
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,923
Take off the blind fold.

202
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,058
Too late to do anything.

203
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,944
Well that didn't work.

204
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,849
How is your training going?

205
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,174
He's getting it.

206
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:51,292
Oh, yeah? Maybe he'll
never get it, you know?

207
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:52,688
Oh, he got it in him.

208
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:55,150
Listen, Briggs.
I know his skills.

209
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,727
And he may never be that good.

210
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,863
He will beat Mongkut.
Guaranteed.

211
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:02,798
You mention Mongkut one more time,

212
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,767
then I'll smash your big face.

213
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:06,126
Oh really?

214
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:50,813
Do you see what I mean?

215
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:52,172
He is blind as a bat.

216
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,143
No more jail!

217
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:03,087
You will train in the comfort
of my luxurious suburb compound.

218
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,056
So just sit back and enjoy the ride.

219
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,704
I need my trainer, Durand.

220
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:17,973
And I still need to train
with my prison crew.

221
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:21,169
I am here to help.
Done!

222
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,645
I'll need a field trip
for and exhibition fight

223
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:24,946
when I am ready.

224
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,915
I love this guy.

225
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,912
You have to start the training.

226
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,848
Start?
Start.

227
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:05,149
Start the focus.
And to forget everything else.

228
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,081
It's kind of hard.

229
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,827
They kidnapped your wife.

230
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:16,064
You have to fight big monster.

231
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:17,991
Let's laugh about it.
Ha ha.

232
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,167
Let's go back to the
business and get focused.

233
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:30,102
Your strength against its weakness.

234
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:36,978
It's your speed and your flexibility.
Dexterity.

235
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,726
What's his weakness?

236
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,961
That's a good question, Kurt.

237
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,899
I would like to see Mongkut training.

238
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,636
How do you see anything?
You are blind.

239
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,100
Well, then you have nothing to worry about.
I just want to see him..

240
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,177
Meet Mongkut.

241
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,039
State of the art miracle of
bioengineering killing machine

242
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,693
A fighter bred from generation of fighters.

243
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:20,087
With the top modern chemistry.

244
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:28,197
By the sound of his breathing, he sound
like a rhinoceros. Right?

245
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:34,777
His handler graduated
Cambridge top of his class.

246
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:39,014
Went right to work for Mr Moore
for mil a year.

247
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,790
What is he doing?

248
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,792
An adrenaline cocktail.

249
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,118
This is not the way.
You know this.

250
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:57,800
There is no drug testing for
illegal underground fights right?

251
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:02,094
This is not the martial art.
It's not the truth.

252
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:31,667
Mongkut is a superior
human specimen.

253
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,869
Greater faster.

254
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,934
Stronger than any human being
on the planet.

255
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:59,889
Everything okay with your champion?

256
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,089
Oh, yeah. He is fine.

257
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,123
Oh yeah.

258
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,139
Let Kurt live.

259
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,141
I beg you.

260
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:05,059
What about this?
I fight Mongkut instead of Kurt.

261
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:09,157
Well, it will be exciting, no?

262
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:12,025
That would be exciting.

263
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,902
You got quite a follow on.

264
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,966
This is true.

265
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,067
One problem. You are blind.

266
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:37,860
Maybe blind..

267
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,829
With the sensation I can see
ugliest man in the world.

268
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,155
The strongest man in the world.

269
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,843
Yes, of course, forgive me.

270
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:58,881
But to see blind men fighting...
will make a fortune. No?

271
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:02,151
That is a really exciting prospect.

272
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,011
But of course, I don't
really need the money.

273
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,996
Cancel this fight.

274
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:22,927
You really thought you could
appeal to my better nature...?

275
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,999
Good bye.

276
00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:16,083
You have to learn how to fly.

277
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:41,783
The strongest man
does not always win.

278
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:44,018
But the smartest one does.

279
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:57,056
Not bad.

280
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:25,888
Thanks.

281
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:29,865
- I am a friend of Liu's
- What?

282
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,800
She told me you're here.

283
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:35,002
And they took her.
I am here to help you.

284
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:41,942
Okay. Higher than that.

285
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:45,038
High. Kick high.

286
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,686
Higher than that.
He's 6 feet 10. C'mon.

287
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,147
Higher. Again.

288
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,898
He will kill you in a second.

289
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,196
Death has its benefits.

290
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:08,470
You will save a lots of expenses.

291
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:12,310
- I killed Tong Po!
- Mongkut is four times Tong Po, Kurt.

292
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:18,416
You will lose.

293
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,148
There might be another way.

294
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:30,990
All I need is the third guy
to cause the disturbance.

295
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:47,075
Well done.

296
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,005
Hey. You smoke?
Yeah, sure.

297
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:04,989
We just caught a break.

298
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:07,996
New guard over there.
He knows where she is.

299
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,225
The dragon on his arm
it's in the video.

300
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,900
We got to go now.

301
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,192
Do this thing tonight while
he's on duty.

302
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:24,003
Time for that field trip.

303
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,915
I have to clear with Mr Moore.

304
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,044
I get on that.

305
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:07,077
The money.

306
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:06,172
Master Durand! It's always good
to see you again, my friend.

307
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,883
King.

308
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,653
I know you.
Kurt Sloane, isn't it?

309
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:15,724
Yeah, I remember you from the awful
shackling you took last time you were here.

310
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,758
That's right.

311
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:19,084
Yeah, I trust you never try that again huh?

312
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,832
You know, Joseph King by name...

313
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,700
Joe king by nature.

314
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,935
Ah, you've heard that before.

315
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:34,776
So, word on the street has it
that you're fighting Mongkut.

316
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:36,845
Have you always been suicidal?

317
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:41,014
Do me a favor. Can he
fight your fighter?

318
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:47,054
So you are back to get your ass kicked huh?

319
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:51,017
Well, I will have to see
your money first friend.

320
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:53,118
Money.

321
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,124
Thank you.

322
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:05,707
Holy molly, look at that!
Easy money just walked in the door!

323
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,810
Again, come with me.

324
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:10,345
Hold on.

325
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:15,618
Remember, we are
not here for that.

326
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:16,852
Yeah.

327
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,121
- Be careful.
- I got this.

328
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:25,957
Ladies and Gentlemen, we
have a brand new challenger.

329
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,763
Well, technically
he's an old challenger

330
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:30,799
with suicidal tendencies.

331
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,770
Let's welcome this misguided
unfortunate soul.

332
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:38,972
Kurt Sloane, ladies and gentlemen.

333
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,677
A brave young warrior.

334
00:54:42,678 --> 00:54:46,815
Willing to risk it all, to last
just 2 minutes in the ring.

335
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:50,852
With the one and only soul survivor.

336
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:53,822
The beast. The Widow maker.

337
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:58,150
The bringer of pain, Moss.

338
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:36,056
I hate violence.
I need to go to the bathroom.

339
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,134
I need your phone.

340
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:50,970
I need the phone.

341
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:29,049
Travis.
"Daddy, is that you?"

342
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,684
Wait, the fight's over.

343
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,887
Kurt wins.
Nice bloody skill.

344
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,202
You come here once and make
an utter fool of yourself

345
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:14,118
and then come back to mop the floor
with my best fighter? Come here.

346
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,929
My take.

347
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:25,199
The next time we
should to be partners.

348
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:27,938
Maybe next time.

349
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:32,045
I guess all the training paid off.

350
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:43,183
Where the fuck is that bullshit?

351
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,954
Move, move, move!
Move, move, move!

352
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,884
Long time pops.

353
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,892
He's my son, Travis.
Time to go.

354
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:20,542
Go save your wife.
Trust me. I will take care of them.

355
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:22,891
- Come on, let's go.
- Go, go.

356
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:40,748
Where the hell are we going?

357
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:43,885
That's up to you.
You know where she is.

358
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:46,051
I know where Liu is.

359
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:50,692
You are standing right next to
in the video. Where is she?

360
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,153
What is this about?

361
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,903
All right, listen.
Let's go to the river.

362
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,899
North Row!

363
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:06,963
Aye aye.

364
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:37,093
What?

365
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:03,898
So... how many guys
hiding behind this cars?

366
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,666
I am telling you, this is it.

367
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,767
No more bullshit.

368
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:08,736
Let me go, I will show you.

369
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:10,505
You're gonna need me to get in anyway.

370
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,940
You might wanna start being
a little more specific.

371
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,879
- Where are we going?
- Penthouse, top floor.

372
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,977
<i>ACCESS GRANTED</i>

373
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:26,079
You are gonna regret this one.
I'm telling you this man.

374
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,172
Go.

375
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,116
Put your gun down.
Drop your knife.

376
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:26,847
You okay?
Yes, I'm okay.

377
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:28,828
- Are you sure? You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

378
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:30,106
She can shoot.

379
01:11:30,785 --> 01:11:32,074
Let's go.

380
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:51,900
Put him down.

381
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:13,166
Do you know, you should not be here?

382
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:33,073
No!

383
01:12:40,855 --> 01:12:42,986
Honey, wake up! Honey!

384
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,760
Honey, wake up.
Wake up.

385
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,119
Call an ambulance!

386
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:51,930
Call an ambulance! Right now!

387
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:59,004
Wake up, wake up.
Please, wake up.

388
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:06,613
You will tell Moore I will fight that
son of a bitch anytime anywhere.

389
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:37,878
They told me that...
if she comes out of that coma...

390
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:42,081
What is this if?
Don't even think about it.

391
01:14:10,678 --> 01:14:13,071
I don't believe in church...

392
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:21,953
but I pray like a fool
for you to come back.

393
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:27,059
He loves the you. He needs you.

394
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:52,007
Kurt?

395
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:54,111
God.

396
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:03,085
You scared me.

397
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,930
Now you know how I feel.

398
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:15,132
I am gonna fight him.

399
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,079
I know.

400
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:25,076
So what's his weakness?

401
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,084
A glass jaw.

402
01:15:35,763 --> 01:15:41,702
When you have his heart racing,
you make your move.

403
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,868
But the timing has to be perfect.

404
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:45,928
So what's the move.

405
01:15:47,775 --> 01:15:51,044
The kill-shot, right to the jaw.

406
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,919
Ladies and gentlemen.

407
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:37,989
Welcome to the original
muay Thai temple.

408
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:44,062
It all started here, over
two thousand years ago.

409
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:49,059
The villagers sent their
children here to study.

410
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:55,938
And the teachers were masters
of martial arts.

411
01:16:57,812 --> 01:17:02,139
And all the spirits of
all the Muay Thai fighters...

412
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:06,787
...were taught here,
and fought here.

413
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,114
And found their mastery here.

414
01:17:11,826 --> 01:17:16,893
Their spirits are here with us tonight!

415
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:27,874
Ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to bring out the man...

416
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,844
who bought us the biggest upset ever.

417
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:35,349
And I was so amazed
in the fighter's ability.

418
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:41,822
To withstand the punishment...
and waited for his moment.

419
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,957
Some say it must be luck.

420
01:17:48,796 --> 01:17:50,893
Kurt Sloane!

421
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:31,905
But today we will find out
if that luck holds.

422
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:36,939
Because here tonight,
to avenge the mighty Tong Po...

423
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:43,043
weighing at 400 pounds...

424
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,179
He has killed over 20
opponents in the ring.

425
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:49,823
Let's here for the man of the hour..

426
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:52,991
The biggest man of any hour...

427
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:58,022
One and only... Mongkut!

428
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:14,140
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

429
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:18,942
Mongkut! Mongkut!

430
01:19:55,823 --> 01:20:01,083
An application was downloaded
on your cellphone.

431
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:04,123
You can not bet
during fight hours.

432
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:08,835
At the end of each round,
you can place another bet.

433
01:20:08,836 --> 01:20:14,073
But you cannot change
the original bets. Clear?

434
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,874
Ladies and gentlemen...

435
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:20,104
Pick your bet.

436
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,869
You've been well trained.
Don't forget...

437
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:47,004
flexibility, dexterity
and momentum.

438
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:57,073
And remember...
the kill-shots.

439
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,044
Fighters!

440
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:25,812
I am so happy to hear that your wife
came out of the coma.

441
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:29,082
I just want you to know
that after I kill you...

442
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,111
I will keep that sweet ass warm at night.

443
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:36,952
To your corner.

444
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:04,007
Round one.

445
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:54,952
Shit.

446
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:57,054
No.

447
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:15,882
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

448
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:20,620
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

449
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:23,185
Kurt! You have to
feel the air move...

450
01:24:23,624 --> 01:24:24,948
before it moves.

451
01:24:32,733 --> 01:24:34,057
That's right.

452
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:41,032
Kurt! Conquer it!

453
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:59,154
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

454
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:05,921
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

455
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:24,141
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

456
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:29,789
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

457
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:35,153
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

458
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,010
- Stop.
- C'mon, Dad.

459
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,089
Let's hear Kurt Sloane!

460
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:07,185
Cause he may not be here with us
but stronger.

461
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:09,896
C'mon, wake up.

462
01:26:09,897 --> 01:26:12,732
Kurt! Kurt!

463
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:14,967
This is a really bad idea.

464
01:26:15,736 --> 01:26:17,060
I know.

465
01:26:17,838 --> 01:26:19,839
I don't stand a chance.

466
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,971
Are you gonna make this quick?

467
01:26:24,745 --> 01:26:28,782
I have an idea.
Don't let him hit you...

468
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:32,109
touch you.
Stay away from him. Okay?

469
01:26:32,753 --> 01:26:34,884
Yeah, good tip, Dad.

470
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:40,960
Moore wants us to finish this up.

471
01:26:46,767 --> 01:26:48,159
He's really big.

472
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:49,993
I know.

473
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,912
Get out there and get this guy down.
Let's finish this.

474
01:27:10,524 --> 01:27:13,993
Cause it is our advance rounds,

475
01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:19,126
with the blades to the elbow...
to the knees.

476
01:27:25,906 --> 01:27:28,003
Round 2.

477
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:04,134
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

478
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:42,171
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

479
01:28:54,895 --> 01:28:56,924
Yeah!

480
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:18,685
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

481
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:23,047
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

482
01:30:36,663 --> 01:30:38,021
He's dead.

483
01:30:47,808 --> 01:30:49,726
Kurt! Kurt!

484
01:30:50,567 --> 01:30:53,034
Kurt! C'mon. Please!

485
01:30:57,551 --> 01:31:00,019
Said you wouldn't leave me. Kurt!

486
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,077
Kurt!

487
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,138
We have a winner!

488
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:24,101
The greatest warrior in the world!

489
01:31:24,711 --> 01:31:29,038
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

490
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,880
Bravo!

491
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,060
I would like to see his face again.

492
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:07,050
Take me away from here.

493
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:49,052
Holy shit!

494
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,089
Oh, my God!

495
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:02,131
To the greatest fighter in the world!

496
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:14,887
White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

497
01:33:14,888 --> 01:33:20,956
White warrior! White warrior!

498
01:33:22,896 --> 01:33:25,027
Time for the third round.

499
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,700
No. This is over.

500
01:33:27,701 --> 01:33:29,093
Do I look dead to you?

501
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:33,162
The only way I am going down
is if you ugly me to death.

502
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:38,744
White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

503
01:33:38,845 --> 01:33:42,310
White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

504
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:44,142
C'mon.

505
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:45,451
Take it easy.

506
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,178
Do something!

507
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:51,021
Fighters! To your corners.

508
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:59,188
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Do not cash in any payment.

509
01:33:59,866 --> 01:34:02,259
This fight is not over!

510
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:08,006
Double or nothing!

511
01:34:09,943 --> 01:34:16,243
At this moment, make your bets.
Double or nothing.

512
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:26,049
The blindfold.

513
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:30,084
Okay.

514
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:36,032
And now for the third round.
Back from the dead...

515
01:34:37,804 --> 01:34:41,073
Kurt Sloane wants more punishment.

516
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,168
Say again.

517
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:49,241
Go. Kill him.

518
01:34:49,983 --> 01:34:52,148
Let's fight!

519
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:56,956
White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

520
01:34:56,957 --> 01:35:02,160
White warrior! White warrior!

521
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:08,133
You have to feel its thoughts...

522
01:35:09,903 --> 01:35:11,904
The air moves...

523
01:35:11,905 --> 01:35:18,166
before he moves.
Anticipation.

524
01:35:55,982 --> 01:36:00,150
The strongest man does not always win.
But the smartest one does.

525
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:12,153
Come on!

526
01:36:45,799 --> 01:36:49,967
Kurt! Run the big man to the ground.

527
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,005
C'mon!

528
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:48,988
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

529
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:53,889
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

530
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:58,153
Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

531
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:38,871
Your brother is brave.
Your brother was a warrior.

532
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:43,006
Unlike you.
Such a coward.

533
01:39:49,949 --> 01:39:53,184
If you keep coming up with the
drive to desire and will to win

534
01:39:53,753 --> 01:39:55,247
I will make you immortal.

535
01:40:04,764 --> 01:40:08,192
This is your destiny.
Believe in yourself.

536
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:50,070
