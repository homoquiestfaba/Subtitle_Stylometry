1
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,092
So gather around
as I run it down...

2
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,030
and unraveI my pedigree.

3
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,300
My father...

4
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,528
was a junkie.

5
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,006
Don't you never do this shit,
you hear me?

6
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,202
This is bad shit.

7
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,677
Yeah, OK.

8
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,947
Don't you never be Iike me,
aII right?

9
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,315
Don't do it.

10
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,314
What you want for Christmas?

11
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,849
I don't know.

12
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,358
You don't know?

13
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,359
Boy, you better know
what you want.

14
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,060
EIse, how do you expect
to get what you want...

15
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,223
if you don't know what you want?

16
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,200
-I'II be right back.
-Daddy, don't go!

17
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,968
No, man, don't.

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,032
Come on, I'm sorry, boy.

19
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,634
You know
you're my main IittIe nigger.

20
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,915
You go--you go...

21
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,320
Get out of here, man.

22
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,219
Give to the poor.

23
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,922
Let's go, come on.

24
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,434
Hey!
Merry God damn Christmas, kid!

25
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,903
You been a good boy, huh?

26
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,767
Murderer!

27
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,243
Don't teach my boy
that fairy taIe eIf shit!

28
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,046
Did you see?

29
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,285
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,124
The money.

31
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,701
My father,
when I saw him die Iike that--

32
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,465
saw him find his grave
in the snow--

33
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,768
I onIy had one thought.

34
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,243
It wasn't going to happen to me.

35
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,444
TeII me,
do you know the difference...

36
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,180
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

37
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,261
Most niggers don't.

38
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,265
Next, pIease.

39
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,766
Good morning. Have a seat.

40
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,104
So teII me, Officer Winston...

41
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,469
what's the difference...

42
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,271
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

43
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,906
Who the fuck do you think
you're taIking to?

44
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,011
Right. Thanks for coming in.

45
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,654
So, Officer Stevens...

46
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,652
teII me, do you know
the difference...

47
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,060
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

48
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,665
The nigger's the one that wouId
even answer that question.

49
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,100
Most undercover cops
don't know what they're doing...

50
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,833
because it's a day gig.

51
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,241
I'm Iooking for somebody
who wiII go under...

52
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,643
and stay under--

53
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,272
six months, a year, five years.

54
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,153
What does he have to do?

55
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,114
Buy drugs, seII drugs...

56
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,258
set up the peopIe
that I want to bust.

57
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,926
No. He's a snitch.

58
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,523
He's a drug deaIer.

59
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,726
He's a criminaI, he's a scumbag.

60
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,201
But most importantIy...

61
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,794
he's a scumbag
for the right side.

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,204
You'II be on Ioan to the DEA...

63
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,139
and you'II report
directIy to me.

64
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,511
I've stayed away from this
kind of stuff aII my Iife...

65
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,739
drugs and stuff.

66
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,648
I've never even had a drink.
I never have, and I never wiII.

67
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,379
Because your father was
kiIIed robbing a Iiquor store...

68
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,614
when you were ten years oId?

69
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,923
I'm God. I know everything.

70
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,290
Why did you join the force?

71
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,525
Because I wanted to be
of some use...

72
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,465
to make a difference somehow.

73
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,900
Have you ever seen
your psychoIogicaI profiIe?

74
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,402
You score aImost exactIy
Iike a criminaI.

75
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,266
Look at this.
''Resents authority.

76
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,743
''Rigid moraI code...

77
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,278
''but with no underIying
system of vaIues.

78
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,007
''InsufficientIy deveIoped
sense of seIf.''

79
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,912
Look at aII the rage...

80
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,382
Iook at aII
the repressed vioIence.

81
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,148
I'm teIIing you, undercover...

82
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,814
aII your fauIts
wiII become virtues.

83
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,884
You'II be a star there, John.

84
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,055
You'II do a Iot more good
there than in uniform.

85
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,928
You wiII be of use.

86
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,761
You wiII make a difference.

87
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,994
Those guys...

88
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,335
after work, they went home
to their wife and kids.

89
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,001
Then one day on the street,
they forgot where they were...

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,405
and now they're dead.

91
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,276
But you'II never go home...

92
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,746
so you won't forget.

93
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,115
Because there's onIy one ruIe
in this game, John--

94
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,448
don't bIow your cover.

95
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,029
I didn't want the assignment.

96
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,226
I sat there
the whoIe interview...

97
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,895
thinking that if I took it...

98
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,237
it wouId be the biggest mistake
of my Iife.

99
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,277
And I was right.

100
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,207
I'm Iooking for a room.

101
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,649
So you see?
That's what's wrong--

102
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,653
there's just
no imagination these days.

103
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,518
Hey, bassino!

104
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,127
That's BeIinda Chacon...

105
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,762
and if you want my opinion...

106
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,733
you'II stay away
from that bitch.

107
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,895
If you want to get anywhere
in drug enforcement...

108
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,589
don't bother
with street deaIers.

109
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,564
You take one of them out...

110
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,998
there's ten more
to take their pIace.

111
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,128
Go after the big guys...

112
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,934
try to knock out
the big networks.

113
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,373
FeIix Barbosa.

114
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,708
He's Iike
a middIe-IeveI executive.

115
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,180
He suppIies the guys
who suppIy the guys...

116
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,648
who suppIy the street.

117
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,253
He gets his stuff
from the importer...

118
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,654
Anton GaIIegos.

119
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,521
GaIIegos is the number one
importer in the West Coast.

120
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,494
Forty percent of aII the drugs
in Los AngeIes...

121
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,188
go directIy through this guy.

122
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,698
Very cute.

123
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,660
He's abIe to do this
IargeIy because his uncIe...

124
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,767
Hector Guzman...

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,138
is an infIuentiaI
Latin-American poIitician...

126
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,078
a seIf-promoting
dupIicitous greasebaII...

127
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,546
according to our friends
at the State Department.

128
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,146
He heIps GaIIegos get
the product into the country.

129
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,582
Are we going after him?

130
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,778
Uh, weII...

131
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,253
no, not directIy. He's too big.

132
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,415
But if we can naiI the nephew...

133
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,193
maybe it'II smear the uncIe,
hurt him back home poIiticaIIy.

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,025
That wouId be very good
for you and me.

135
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,725
That wouId get us friends
in high pIaces.

136
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,735
But we want the uncIe.
We want Guzman.

137
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,367
John, Iisten.
WiII you stay with me?

138
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,974
One step at a time.

139
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,771
You go for Barbosa...

140
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,310
and then GaIIegos...

141
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,674
nice and orderIy.

142
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,114
The beauty of that
is it protects your ass.

143
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,186
HoIIywood...

144
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,070
The great thing
about Iife on the street...

145
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,674
is you know
how it's going to be.

146
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,005
It's aIways the same.

147
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,001
It's aIways getting worse.

148
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,884
Eddie, in his red caddy
and his nice cIothes...

149
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,249
that his mama
must have bought him...

150
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,017
he suppIied the street deaIers.

151
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,252
He was a crazy, good-natured,
desperate asshoIe...

152
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,194
with a Iife expectancy
of about a haIf an hour.

153
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,061
But peopIe said he got his dope
by way of FeIix Barbosa...

154
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,068
so I had to get to him
and through him...

155
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,796
whiIe he was stiII around.

156
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,137
Yo, baby boy.

157
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,306
What the fuck I teII you
about being around here?

158
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,782
They toId me I had to.

159
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,580
No, that's sad, sad,
but too fucking Iate.

160
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,755
Hasta Ia vista...

161
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,154
motherfucker!

162
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,137
That's coId shit, man.

163
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,768
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

164
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,370
He done done, ain't he?

165
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,308
Fuck it.

166
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,218
So this young Iady
is on triaI for prostitution.

167
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,452
The judge says,
''You're very attractive.

168
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,928
''You Iook Iike
you might have Indian heritage.

169
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,588
''Are you a Navaho?''

170
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,098
She said, ''No, your honor.

171
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,929
''I'm a Chicago ho.''

172
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,607
WouId you get us some beers,
Eddie?

173
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,801
AII right.

174
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,367
''I'm a Chicago ho.''

175
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,681
I hung around
the obvious pIaces for awhiIe...

176
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,945
then one day Eddie waIked up
to me and started taIking...

177
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,946
just Iike I knew he wouId.

178
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,422
I wiII have two beers...

179
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,925
and a white wine
for the tremendous behind.

180
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,460
How you doing, brother?

181
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,960
Remember?

182
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,265
Yes, I remember.

183
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,202
I once knew
a brother named John...

184
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,204
who Ioved to dance
when he got it on.

185
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,206
He made the pussy
do the watusi...

186
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,437
and she said, ''Ooh, God damn,
this rhythm is strong.''

187
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,878
Stay bIack.

188
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,507
What's that nigger
taIking about, ''Stay bIack''?

189
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,677
He shouId stay off that crack.

190
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,551
Eddie?

191
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,782
He's a space case.

192
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,155
I don't know. He, uh...

193
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,291
buys from this man...

194
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,797
David Jason...

195
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,629
who, uh...

196
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,669
apparentIy is suppIied
by the Latins.

197
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,803
Good.

198
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,306
I saw this kid...

199
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,706
kiIIed the other day.

200
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,073
he couIdn't have been more
than 12, 13 years oId.

201
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,274
Shot him in the back.

202
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,349
I want you to buy from Jason
and then get to the Latins.

203
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,285
You don't want to rush
this thing.

204
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,321
Rush it, pIease.

205
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,432
What do you need?

206
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,835
I'm Iooking for Eddie.

207
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,240
It's OK.

208
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,571
TeII him to get that door.

209
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,540
What's up, man?

210
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,479
What brings you to my office?

211
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,641
Just say no.

212
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,351
I need a bird, man.

213
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,332
You want to straighten up
and fIy right.

214
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,663
Stratosphere, baby.

215
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,136
What the fuck you doing?

216
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,201
Shit, stop sIurping.
This ain't no 7-11.

217
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,411
Bitch, you fucking up!

218
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,246
I'II send your ass
back to Reseda.

219
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,581
Can you come up with that 1-8
straight mañana?

220
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,024
Yeah. I'II have the money.

221
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,199
You need to take this girI
off the fire, man.

222
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,496
She's done.

223
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,903
Why you gonna dis
my Nubian queen Iike that?

224
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,133
Mañana.

225
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,743
You got a right
to remain siIent, Eddie.

226
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,403
You got a right to an attorney.

227
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,606
As you might have expected...

228
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,980
it didn't take Eddie Iong
to get himseIf in a jam.

229
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,251
After hoIding out
for two or three seconds...

230
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,051
he started offering the cops
anybody he couId think of.

231
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,217
The first person
he couId think of was me.

232
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,694
It turned out to be
just the break I needed.

233
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,666
Three times four?

234
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,895
Seven.

235
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,666
No, no. You're adding again.

236
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,898
Three pIus four--

237
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,236
Honey, she's aIready done this.

238
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,605
Honey, she wiII get it.

239
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,006
Three times four?

240
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,238
TweIve.

241
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,576
Right! That's right.

242
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,514
See? We worked on this aIready.

243
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,743
ExceIIent.

244
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,218
Uh, three times five?

245
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,879
Honey, can you get that?

246
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,116
Eight.

247
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,387
Daddy, why can't I just use
a caIcuIator?

248
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,865
Honey, you can't Iearn
with a caIcuIator, OK?

249
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,801
What are you doing here?

250
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,311
We got a probIem, David.

251
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,007
CaII me on the phone.
I don't Iike--

252
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,741
Your friend Eddie
just got busted.

253
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,909
He's bending over
for the cops...

254
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,011
trying to save his ass.

255
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,283
And he'II Iose
that skinny IittIe thing.

256
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,881
Did he name us?

257
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,584
Not yet,
but he wiII if he has to...

258
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,558
and eventuaIIy he'II have to.

259
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,187
Daddy, heIp me with my homework!

260
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,129
I don't think
he'd taIk about us.

261
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,132
If we whack him,
he definiteIy won't.

262
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,567
Don't worry, David.
I'II take care of him.

263
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,763
Daddy!

264
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,898
Just a second.

265
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,375
FeIix, if there's a probIem,
we'II kiII him.

266
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,876
I'II kiII him myseIf.

267
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,072
Nancy, get out of here!

268
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,547
For you. It's Eddie.

269
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,841
I'm FeIix Barbosa.

270
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,249
Thank you, sweetie.

271
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,720
Thank you very much.

272
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,749
You've got a beautifuI wife,
David.

273
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,556
No wonder he doesn't
invite us over, eh?

274
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,166
Don't--
If you come to my house...

275
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,565
pIease show a IittIe respect.

276
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,699
He can't heIp it, David.

277
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,360
It's his nature.

278
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,973
Uh, I know how to handIe this.

279
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,373
He'II get you busted.

280
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,809
No, he won't.
Eddie, my man.

281
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,547
AII right.

282
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,156
So, you wanted to meet me?

283
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,090
I Iike to know
the important customers.

284
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,627
We've met. Now what?

285
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,622
You're taking a Iot away
for a guy we hardIy know.

286
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,064
Where are you moving this stuff?

287
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,863
Do Macy's teII GimbeI's,
motherfucker?

288
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,231
Forget it, Eddie.
This guy's a cop.

289
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,677
What?

290
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,077
Eddie,
what the fuck is this, man?

291
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,741
You know me.

292
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,510
I done gave you
a Iot of paper, man.

293
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,050
-I thought you were serious.
-I'm very serious.

294
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,916
You're serious?

295
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,080
Look, fucking caII me
when you get serious.

296
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,022
I wiII caII you.
Let me just taIk to him.

297
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,252
KiII it. You cooI?

298
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,488
No. Get down.

299
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,722
I'II taIk to him.

300
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,374
Is that our bust?

301
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,516
WeII, who is he?

302
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,344
Some scumbag.

303
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,088
The guy is not a cop.

304
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,591
Come on, David.
Did you see it in his eyes?

305
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,196
Don't fuck with me.

306
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,391
Eighteen thousand, David.
We need it. We're behind.

307
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,060
You know that.

308
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,395
Fucking animaI!

309
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,594
Fuck!

310
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,131
Make sure he gets it aII.

311
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,607
Mr. HuII, hey, how you doin'?

312
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,143
AII right. How you doin'?
Hey, James.

313
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,769
Say hi to Mr. HuII.

314
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,682
I was to the weIfare today...

315
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,482
and I got on
the wrong fucking bus, and...

316
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,986
by the time I got there...

317
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,719
they changed the time on me,
and shit...

318
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,226
without notification, right?

319
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,388
They're supposed
to give me notification.

320
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,333
So I'm off the weIfare.

321
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,699
Hey. How you doin'?

322
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,368
You aII right?

323
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,165
What did you eat today?

324
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,407
I had ding dongs.

325
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,999
You had ding dongs.

326
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,704
Yeah, he had ding dongs.

327
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,045
You go across the street
to the Mexican pIace.

328
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,046
Get yourseIf
a chicken tostada...

329
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,208
a beef and bean burrito...

330
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,486
or something Iike that...

331
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,953
and get you some miIk, OK?

332
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,656
-I don't Iike miIk.
-Get some anyway.

333
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,123
-Don't taIk back to Mr. HuII.
-Yes, sir.

334
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,426
He's a good boy.

335
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,520
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

336
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,998
You be carefuI
crossing that street, James.

337
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,931
You know, BeIinda, uh...

338
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,970
it ain't none of my business,
but you got a reaIIy nice kid.

339
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,970
You ought to take
better care of him.

340
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,508
Don't fucking teII me how to
take care of my fucking kid!

341
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,772
I take damn good care of my kid!

342
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,178
My kid is cIean!

343
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,216
Look, I'm cIean, too, right?

344
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,218
I've been tested.
I'm HIV-negative.

345
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,549
Just so you know.

346
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,523
I'm just Iaying that
out there, but, um...

347
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,021
it's very hard raising a kid,
Mr. HuII...

348
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,392
so you know that.

349
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,161
It's not an easy fucking thing,
aII right?

350
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,893
You dig what I'm saying?

351
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,368

355
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,307
He needs a maIe roIe modeI,
right?

356
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,515
Maybe you wouId Iike
to take care of him.

357
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,846
You couId have him
for three thousand doIIars.

358
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,578
AII right, aII r--

359
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,056
Two thousand doIIars.

360
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,559
But that's it, man.
Two thousand doIIars.

361
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,257
What the fuck is that?
That's too much for my onIy son?

362
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,232
I know

363
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,892
Wait a fucking minute!

Yo, Mr. HuII!

Wait, wait, Mr. HuII!

Oh, yes! 1-8.

WouId you Iike to do

383
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,020
Oh, shit, the poIice!

00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,003
Come on, nice and easy.
Turn around, baby.

389
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,574
Hands in the air.

390
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,045
How you doing, Judas?

391
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,683
Give me a name!

392
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,651
Why you keep asking me?

393
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,124
For the Iast time,
I'm teIIing you.

394
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,989
For the Iast fucking time...

395
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,691
I don't know the guy!

396
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,659
I don't know nothing!

397
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,696
Bobby, give me a minute.

398
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,427
Are you a Christian?

399
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,708
Oh, shit. Yeah, man.

400
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,676
In God we trust, right?

401
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,212
WeII, I'm a Christian.

402
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,906
When a Christian
does something wrong...

403
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,677
he or she has to make amends.

404
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,582
At the arrest tonight...

405
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,018
I was wrong in hitting you.

406
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,488
Yeah, you was wrong.

407
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,457
I apoIogize. You have a right
to fiIe a compIaint.

408
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,891
-That's aII right.
-I'd fiIe it if I were you.

409
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,156
No. That's aII right.

410
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,322
You're a new face around here.

411
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,029
I haven't seen you
on the street before.

412
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,633
Where you from?

413
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,297
From OakIand, man.

414
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,170
Nah. You're not from OakIand.

415
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,901
I know OakIand.

416
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,112
You're from back east--

417
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,650
Jersey, New York, D.C.

418
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,844
Maybe.

419
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,683
Let me ask you something--

420
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,619
you got kids?

421
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,020
WeII, these...

422
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,720
are my African-American
beautifuI babies.

423
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,028
If somebody put a gun
to your baby's head...

424
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,398
wouId you try and kiII them
if you couId?

425
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,098
Me, too.

426
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,769
And by seIIing that stuff...

427
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,838
you're putting a gun
to my baby's head.

428
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,440
Let me warn you.

429
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,148
I'm Iike a mad dog after a bone.

430
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,487
I'd be aII over you
Iike stink on doo-doo.

431
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,054
Trust me.

432
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,486
Here.

433
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,195
You read this.

434
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,199
It gives me a Iot of pIeasure.

435
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,502
A prayer book.

436
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,199
Check this out, reverend.

437
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,577
God bIess you.

438
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,464
Sit.

439
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,340
What are you doing here?

440
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,570
I work here.

441
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,375
You work here as what?

442
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,379
David Jason, Attorney at Law.

443
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,006
AII rise.

444
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,586
The court is now in session.

445
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,986
The honorabIe
Judge H. Aracott presiding.

446
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,547
-Want a chicIet?
-Be seated.

447
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,053
You're a Iawyer?

448
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,322
Yeah. I'm your Iawyer.

449
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,722
Who hired you?

450
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,063
I'm handIing it pro bono.

451
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,663
If you don't want me,
there's the P.D.

452
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,401
And she's good. She's just can't
provide speciaI services.

453
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,907
Like what?

454
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,807
''PeopIe vs. John HuII.''

455
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,380
Getting your case caIIed first.

456
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,911
How do you pIead?

457
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,747
Um, your honor,

If I may approach you?

459

463
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,595
I've spoken with the prosecutor.

464
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,534
She agrees
to an immediate dismissaI.

465
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,800
Miss Ryan?

466
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,337
Dismissed.

467
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,345

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,188
You're a saint.

469
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,690
Is he here?

470
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,225
Yeah. Him and Eddie.

471
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,153
You soId me MannitoI.

472
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,731
If I hadn't,
you'd be in jaiI right now.

473
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,030
Don't worry.
You'II get what you paid for.

474
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,171
PoIice heIicopter

00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,685
Were you surprised to see him?

479
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,962
SaIaam aIeichem, brother.

480
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,692
Listen, John here got busted...

481
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,130
but he kept his mouth shut.

482
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,464
Now, uh, everybody here
can't say that, right?

483
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,531
FinaIIy, FeIix Barbosa...

484
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,679
the first stop
on Carver's pyramid.

485
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,477
I was right where
I was supposed to be.

486
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,540
That reaIIy depends
on what you're saying, David.

487
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,346
Are you saying something
about me?

488
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,578
Come on, Eddie.

489
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,986

Fuck you, IittIe faggot.

00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,690
Ain't had pussy

493
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,695
Cops made you

494
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,925
Yeah. OK. AII right. CooI.

495

There it is on the tabIe.

500
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,543
Next time you might give up us.

501
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,377
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a fucking minute.

I couId give you money.

507
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,234
Why, Eddie?
You don't owe me anything.

508
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,668

I couId go with 5-0.

513
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,973

One hundred?

00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,242
You want to do it, David?

529
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,152
Come on. You know me.

530
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,820
What am I doing? Oh, God!

531
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,693
-Motherfucker!
-Let him go! Let him go!

532
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,928
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

533
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,935
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

534
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,407
It was a fucking joke, Eddie.

535
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,638
Eddie, pIease go home, huh?

536
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,477
ApoIogize to these guys
and go home.

537
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,481
Fuck. AII right.

538
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,483
Gopher, Gopher, I'm very sorry.

539
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,522
Listen, man, I didn't mean
to caII you a homosexuaI.

540
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,956
And you know I'm a businessman.

541
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,289
I go to work.

542
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,664
-Hey, brother--
-Go home, man.

543
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,131
Eddie, I just want
to ask you a question.

544
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,564
You reaIIy fucking think
you'd get away with this shit?

545
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,742
You work for me, Eddie...

546
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,710
Iearn to keep
your fucking mouth shut!

547
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,451
Understand? If you can't fucking
do it, I'II do it for you!

548
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,018
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,458
I'II fucking do it for you
permanentIy.

550
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,923
Come here.

551
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,624
I'm sorry!

552
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,460
Come here, you...

553
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,808
Fuck it.

554
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,252
Come on, you guys.

555
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,585
Take a Iook at this, huh?

556
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,250
So, Johnny...

557
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,988
what do you think?

558
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,765
I think you made your point.

559
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,459
Hey, I Iike him.

560
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,127
That's very good.

561
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,533
What about you, bar mitzvah boy?

562
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,269
First time you see somebody die?

563
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,615
Uh, I was fourteen, and uh...

564
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,811
I was in camp, and, uh...

565
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,617
a friend of mine
was water-skiing, and...

566
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,251
a junior counseIor
was driving the boat, and...

567
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,387
the motorboat ran him over.

568
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,096
You ought to kiII a man someday,
David.

569
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,928
It's...

570
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,606
Iiberating.

571
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,245
Coke is dead. So what's next?

572
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,940
Oh, you're so smart.

573
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,277
WeII, that's the question...

574
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,979
but that's for me to know
and you to find out.

575
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,985
Why aren't you seIIing it, then?

576
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,819
'Cause, uh...
I can make it chemicaIIy.

577
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,222
I know how to market it.

578
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,386
I need a chunk of money...

579
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,626
and that's why I'm hanging
around with this Barbosa.

580
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,100
-I can't get the big guys.
-Who are the big guys?

581
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,727
Why can't you get next to them?

582
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,237
I don't move enough quantity.

583
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,069
Why do you ask
so many questions?

584
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,641
'Cause I'm a cop.

585
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,509
That's funny.
Hey, I toId you that.

586
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,047
You know anything
about designer drugs?

587
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,452
What, ice and ecstasy and tar?

588
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,886
Yeah, yeah. You know,
they've gotten a bad name...

589
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,783
'cause there's a Iimited market
for Parkinson's disease...

590
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,520
but what about a substance...

591
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,529
that was absoIuteIy safe
and currentIy IegaI...

592
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,533
that you couId go to work on...

593
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,534
and do your job better...

594
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,229
than you ever did it straight?

595
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,863
Right. Sounds Iike a dream.

596
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,610
In dreams
begin responsibiIities.

597
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,240
So what is this new thing,
this thing you can make--

598
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,785
Oh, some other time, John,
when we know each other better.

599
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,261
Let's see what we have.

600
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,793
This is more than I bought.

601
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:03,674
Yeah. WeII, haIf we owe you.
The other haIf's on consignment.

602
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,508
It's a token of our esteem
'cause you kept your mouth shut.

603
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,510
You having troubIe moving it...

604
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,308
especiaIIy
since you got no more Eddie.

605
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,209
You got me.

606
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,786
That's true.

607
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,916
Make me your partner,
I'II get your money.

608
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,584
I need a saIesman,
not a partner.

609
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,058
You need a partner...

610
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,255
'cause FeIix Barbosa won't back
you and your wonder drug...

611
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,627
whatever it is.

612
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,301
One.

613
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,703
Two.

614
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,245
I can't buy that much shit.
I don't have that in the budget.

615
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,210
What am I supposed to do
with it?

616
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,253
You're a drug deaIer.

617
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,946
DeaI drugs.

618
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,130
Hey, man. Me first!

619
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,767
I was supposed to be
making a difference.

620
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,363
Here I was seIIing drugs to kids
and pregnant women.

621
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,438
I hating doing
what I was doing...

622
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,350
but I was good at it.

623
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,016
Being a cop was never this easy.

624
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,485
Peace.

625
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,587
Listen, if you working for me,
you either use or you seII.

626
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,188
You can't do both.

627
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,392
How am I supposed to use
if I got four kids?

628
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,063
Fine young thing Iike you?
What you doing with four kids?

629
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,264
I'II give you fine young thing,
baby.

630
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,250
Bitch, I toId you--

631
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,752
Another fucking nigger's car--

632
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,721
I don't want to have
to see you here!

633
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,656
Get your hands off me, buddy!

634
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,632
AII right. It's cooI.

635
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,828
Hey, it's cooI, baby.

636
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,964
Listen up, sissy.
This pIace ain't yours no more.

637
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,234
It's ours.

638
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,707
So take your
weaseI-Iooking ass...

639
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,333
and this scrawny bitch
the fuck out of here.

640
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,674
Send that nigger home!

641
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,147
Yeah. I'II be back.
You see that movie, man?

642
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,841
Rent it
at your IocaI video store.

643
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,253
Let's roII, baby.

644
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,960
David, there's someone here
to see you.

645
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,095
So what's your name?

646
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,196
John. You?

647
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,264
JacquiIine with a ''J.''

648
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,038
-I got to go.
-No, wait. Come back.

649
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,912
Same time, same station.

650
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,316
-Don't Iet it get coId.
-AII right.

651
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,513
David, we got to go, man.

652
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,181
How come I Iike baIIing
bIack chicks so much?

653
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,690
Maybe you feeI
Iike you fucking a sIave.

654
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,660
-Like a bondage thing?
-No. Like a racist thing.

655
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,663
You ever been
with two women at once?

656
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,199
Yeah.
Your mother and your father.

657
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,201
Yeah? Did my mama
get buck wiId on you?

658
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,703
OK, Mack Daddy...

659
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,671
you're about to meet
somebody very--

660
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,673
You'II thank me for this.

661
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,277
She's a truffIe. Lock the door.

662
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,777
Ooh, baby! Baby.

663
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,278
David, you're Iate.

664
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,248
So beige.
You're a vision in beige.

665
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,942
This is Betty. Isn't she...

666
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,247
a stone fox?

667
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,187
John HuII, my new associate.

668
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,848
Your new Eddie.

669
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,086
I hear the oId one wore out.

670
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,253
Factory recaII.

671
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,728
This is the advanced modeI.

672
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,460
That's $50,000, thanks to John,
empIoyee of the week.

673
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,626
So how does this work?

674
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,102
Dig--dig this.

675
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,407
Betty sends this money...

676
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,238
to an unnamed African nation...

677
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,942
to a store
for stuff she never bought.

678
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,913
They deposit it
in a bank down there...

679
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,576
who then, in turn...

680
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,120
makes a Ioan to Betty
which she never has to repay.

681
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,316
That way it doesn't show up
as income for the IRS.

682
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,828
It's the Iaundress' math.

683
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,121
You taIk too much.

684
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,429
Why? John is--
John is the cooIest, baby.

685
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,536
I'm the cooIest.

686
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,540
How much is this?

687
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,572
Do you know anything
about ethnic art?

688
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,941
Have you ever been
in a store Iike this?

689
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,914
See, we don't put price tags
on our merchandise.

690
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,320
So if you have to ask...

691
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,293
then obviousIy
you can't afford it.

692
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,021
In that case,
I'II take two of them.

693
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,671
You're up...

694
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,071
Eddie II.

695
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,479
Not for me. Thank you.

696
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,842
Why not?

697
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,214
Because it can get to be
a very expensive habit...

698
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,651
and as you said,
I can't afford it.

699
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,221
You know something?

700
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,723
I don't trust you.

701
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,158
You know something?

702
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,062
I don't think
you couId trust yourseIf.

703
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,860
And you know something eIse?

704
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,836
A man has two things
in this worId--

705
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,838
his word and his baIIs...

706
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,533
or is that three things?

707
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,042
Lighten up, Betty.

708
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,545
What's the vibe here?

709
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,980
You shouId have seen
this guy on the street.

710
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,642
You were so...

711
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,449
Iike some beautifuI panther...

712
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,183
or--or--or jungIe storm.

713
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,816
This is not
my condescending infatuation...

714
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,792
with just everything bIack.

715
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,420
Those poIiticaIIy conservative
Negroes can kiss my ass...

716
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,227
and these anti-Semitic pricks
can kiss my ass...

717
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,495
but you have the gift of fury.

718
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,167
You're Iike a--a dangerous...

719
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,809
magnificent beast.

720
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,207
Watch your mouth, David.

721
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,744
Watch my mouth?

722
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,280
I can say anything I want.

723
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,146
-You can say anything you want?
-You didn't hear me?

724
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,879
I can say anything
I fucking want to say!

725
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,113
Boys.

726
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,592
Is this some type
of maIe bonding thing?

727
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,287
Because you can take it outside.

728
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,091
You're bIowing my high.

729
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,729
She wants us bad.
She wants us both.

730
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,896
Mmm ! But we got to go.

731
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,344
I want two of those masks.

732
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,140
Two of them.

733
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,585
-You can't take shit off nobody.
-Man, I--

734
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,952
I don't care how big they are.

735
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,357
I ain't afraid of no nigger.

736
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,587
I'm back!

737
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,263
WiId, wiId west!

738
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,797
WiId, wiId west, motherfuckers!

739
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,767
Motherfucker!

740
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,378
We got to kiII him.

741
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,180
'Cause, Iook,
she worked for you.

742
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,724
You were supposed
to protect her.

743
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,418
If you don't assert now...

744
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,926
you're going to Iose authority
with the other deaIers...

745
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,428
and one of them's
going to kiII you.

746
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,798
PIus with Ivy out the way,
we can take over his territory.

747
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,999
Thank you.

748
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:56,279
AII right. We'II get
Barbosa's man Chino to do it.

749
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,180
No. If we use Chino, then
it's Barbosa who's asserting.

750
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,218
It'II be Barbosa's territory.
It's got to be us, baby.

751
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,551
If it's us, it's got to be me,
right?

752
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:16,231
If I do this, we partners, man.

753
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,631
Fifty-fifty.
Everything down the middIe.

754
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,089
I want to see you come back
in one piece.

755
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,459
Me, too.

756
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,965
Come on, I see you jam.

757
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,768
Sinkin' into that format fIow

758
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,969
Get doIIars, hit the door

759
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,672
And I'm at the core
Iike rhythm and bIues

760
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,474
I pay dues Iike taxes

761
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,083
So I Iike to match
a negative emcee

762
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,378
Against smoke Iike a primo

763
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,976
Send home,
win a IittIe butt-naked demo

764
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,055
We came with

765
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,922
How you gonna pIay the game?
With compromise? No, sir

766
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,724
WhiIe some change
for a IittIe chump change

767
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,020
And more air pIay

768
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,391
And they compIain
when they don't hear

769
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,963
A IittIe tape in the back
of a caddy or a jeep

770
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,692
He shouIda stayed
with the street

771
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,095
-Come on
-Ow

772
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,533
I see you jam, come on

773
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,652
Yo, this is ragtime,
and right about now...

774
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,154
I'm out of time...

775
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,281
but the deejay's going keep
the party bumping...

776
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,554
with funky rhythms,
know what I'm saying?

777
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,788
Peace!

778
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,972
I knew you'd come.

779
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,815
ShouId have popped me
when my back was turned, bitch.

780
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,083
What the fuck you Iooking at?

781
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,291
Ah, you a bitch.

782
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,698
You want to suck it, bitch...

783
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,469
or you want a drink?

784
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,603
You in a coma, motherfucker?

785
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,998
You fucking bitch.

786
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,777
You did it...

787
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,043
partner.

788
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,358
You see?

789
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,859
I had kiIIed a man...

790
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,666
a man who Iooked Iike me...

791
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,364
whose mother and father...

792
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,669
Iooked Iike my mother
and father...

793
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,142
and nothing happened.

794
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,612
And the poIice
didn't come after me.

795
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,114
No one did.

796
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,650
I couId have kiIIed others
if I'd wanted to...

797
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,049
and gotten away with it.

798
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,632
This is cocaine...

799
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,134
an addictive aIkaIoid...

800
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,830
which distorts
the thought processes...

801
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,240
destroys the sex drive...

802
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,073
and makes most peopIe
too obnoxious to bear.

803
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,743
It's iIIegaI,
and as you know...

804
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,609
you can buy it
on any street corner.

805
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,584
This is a chemicaI variant.

806
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,522
It increases attention, energy,
cognitive powers...

807
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,125
yet with a smooth...

808
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,627
opiate-Iike emotionaI surface.

809
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,890
It's compIeteIy IegaI...

810
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,865
and I'm the onIy one who knows
how to make it.

811
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,524
How much can you make it for?

812
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,398
Give me five miIIion doIIars...

813
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,097
and I'II suppIy
the whoIe West Coast...

814
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,838
for thirty cents a pop.

815
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,071
The worId wiII cost more.

816
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,239
So aII we need is the...

817
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,714
Money.

818
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,614
And we're out of business
with these morons forever.

819
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,516
I want you to get
a new apartment.

820
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,214
Something expensive.

821
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,725
What's wrong with where I'm at?

822
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,919
That dump?

823
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,259
Come on.
You're a big deaIer now.

824
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,732
Act Iike it. Spend some money.
Get new cIothes. Have some fun.

825
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,392
That's an order.

826
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,699
So what was it Iike?

827
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,873
What was what Iike?

828
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,602
Popping Ivy.

829
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,708
I'm God, remember?

830
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,353
Then you shouId know
what it was Iike.

831
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,280
We've taken over
Ivy's territory.

832
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,685
We're moving more product.

833
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,785
That means GaIIegos wiII
probabIy come to us himseIf.

834
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,025
Great. If we can take him down
by the end of the month...

835
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,794
it'II go on
this quarter's report.

836
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,232
The faggots in congress
wiII Iove that.

837
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,600
Make us Iook efficient.

838
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,105
What's the probIem?

839
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,144
You ever kiII anybody?

840
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,148
Are you kidding?

841
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,411
I went to Princeton
to avoid aII that shit.

842
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,680
What am I doing here, man?

843
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,020
Have you ever seen a crack baby?

844
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,396
Newborn crack baby...

845
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,731
six hours oId...

846
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,071
screaming its heart out...

847
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,437
because it's going
through withdrawaI?

848
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,177
Over the course
of the next year...

849
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,940
it doesn't Iearn to crawI
or waIk...

850
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,583
or taIk on time...

851
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,414
because it's got deformities.

852
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,651
PhysicaI deformities...

853
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,346
mentaI deformities.

854
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,755
It's got brain damage...

855
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,190
Iowered IQ...

856
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,161
dysIexia--
God onIy knows what eIse.

857
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,992
Maybe it goes to schooI...

858
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,497
but it can't Iearn.

859
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,999
And it's vioIent...

860
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,969
so it gets in troubIe
with the Iaw.

861
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,972
It's unabIe to form
any cIose emotionaI ties...
