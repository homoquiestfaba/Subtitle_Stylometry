1
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,742
(reporter) The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia,

2
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:24,547
and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal,

3
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:27,451
which should be complete by New Year's Day,

4
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:30,582
close to the US president's
''Home by the holidays '' pledge.

5
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,523
Yet even as the conflict winds down,

6
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:38,395
the US military remains in a high state
of readiness, eager to answer the call.

7
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,335
(radio) Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. l've got
unknown rider not responding to coms.

8
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,269
Suspect hostile intent.

9
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:49,538
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.

10
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:02,652
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need
to get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

11
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,398
- Nose wheel.
- Check.

12
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,839
- Gun-blast diffuser.
- Clear.

13
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,172
- Right intake. Left intake.
- Check. Check.

14
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,838
- Ejection seat is safe. Arm handle.
- Copy. l show safe.

15
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,347
- Com lFF.
- Up and up. Let's go. Move it.

16
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,078
- DDl, MPCD and ETD.
- Go flight.

17
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:34,314
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- lt's all green across the board.

18
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:36,584
- OK for start.
- Copy. OK for start.

19
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,252
- OK, right throttle, 15 per cent.
- Copy, 15 per cent. Go for two.

20
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:42,796
Two is up. ECS turbine is online.

21
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,991
Copy. Nozzle coming in at 73 per cent.

22
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,531
- Good to go.
- Copy. Good to go.

23
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,637
That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.

24
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,798
Cat four, abort.

25
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:56,207
- What?
- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?

26
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,337
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.

27
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,679
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:06,678
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace.

29
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,484
l cannot wait for this shit to be done.

30
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,560
OK.

31
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,488
Four more days.

32
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:24,498
You know what l was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

33
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:28,372
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.

34
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:31,742
Yeah, but you know what?
l bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

35
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:36,045
Or fly for a rock star. l mean, if anybody
needs a good pilot, it's those guys.

36
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:40,952
Whenever you turn around we've lost another
band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em.

37
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,656
l mean, it's sad.

38
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,887
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens
from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.

39
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:51,022
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...

40
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:55,396
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

41
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:08,143
Let me ask you something. How fast
do you think we're headed into the wind?

42
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,483
Chris, we're still on alert. lf Reigart
wanders up to the tower, we're dead.

43
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,254
All right, let's do it.

44
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,326
That's the spirit.

45
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,062
- Rutherford. Right here.
- lncoming!

46
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:31,238
You guys ready for a little lesson in physics?

47
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,536
You never learn, kid.
l'm gonna take your money this week.

48
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:37,111
Wind's blowin' up a gale.

49
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,813
l bet you 20 bucks each
l catch it when it comes back.

50
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,976
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?

51
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,248
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.

52
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,824
( ''What'd l Say'' by Ray Charles)

53
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,912
Hey, mama, don't you treat me wrong

54
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,949
Come and love your daddy all night long

55
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,190
All right now...

56
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,615
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!

57
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,990
That is awesome!

58
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,256
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!

59
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:32,856
Well, tell me what'd l say, yeah

60
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,562
Tell me what'd l say right now

61
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,298
Tell me what'd l say

62
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:40,499
Tell me what'd l say right now

63
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,977
Tell me what'd l say

64
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:44,971
Tell me what'd l say...

65
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,408
Wilson!

66
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:54,949
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.

67
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:16,104
This is a lot of sorties for an action
that's winding down, Leslie.

68
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:19,578
l'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

69
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:25,117
You understand how important it is that your
pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?

70
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,712
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.

71
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,922
The treaty depends on it.

72
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,085
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.

73
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,900
- What is this?
- l invited him to report on the battle group.

74
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:45,098
l'd like you to give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.

75
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:50,572
Admiral, l find the press to be an intrusive
presence. lt inspires showing off.

76
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,442
What's so funny, Admiral?

77
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:56,210
You, Admiral,
are just what the conflict needs.

78
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,721
- An uncomplicated man.
- l'll take that as a compliment.

79
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,857
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?

80
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,429
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.

81
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,900
- l know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.

82
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:17,403
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?

83
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,803
Well, we just finished up in Sarajevo,

84
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,672
and your Admiral wanted us
to pump you guys up.

85
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,938
Sounds like Reigart. ''Be prepared.''

86
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:29,380
Well, it's better to be prepared
than to be caught sleepin' in the field.

87
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:32,078
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.

88
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,113
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

89
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:39,921
Well, l'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.

90
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,822
You know, everybody has a role to play.

91
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,630
See, me, l'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.

92
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:52,639
You, you're a navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

93
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,178
You don't get to pick your fight.
lt comes to you.

94
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,170
Yeah, l get it.

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,443
But at least give me a fight l can understand.

96
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:07,014
Vukovar? Where's the place
we flew over the other day? Sreb...?

97
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,988
Srebrenica.

98
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,820
And good luck talkin' to someone at home:

99
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,588
''Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people.''

100
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:19,224
''No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping...'' lt's like a joke.

101
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:25,170
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. l am.

102
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,241
(shouting)

103
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,071
Look at these guys.

104
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,583
See, that's exactly what l'm talking about.

105
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:43,885
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.

106
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:46,927
And those days are over. They are long gone.

107
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,297
l used to think l'd get a chance to do it.
Now l realize l'll be eating Jell-O.

108
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,261
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.

109
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,429
Lieutenant Burnett?

110
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,633
Admiral Reigart would like
to see you immediately.

111
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:03,768
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

112
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,778
Thank you.

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,371
Maybe he wants to give you
his daughter's number.

114
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,513
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good.

115
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,679
l don't know anything, Lieutenant.

116
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,192
Now, that is cynical.
And Southerners usually aren't that cynical.

117
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,922
l give you a compliment
on how great your alma mater looks,

118
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,761
and you think l'm tryin' to pump you
for information. What does he want?

119
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,767
l guess you'll have to see, sir.

120
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,605
- (knock at door)
- Come.

121
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:37,305
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

122
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,643
Lieutenant Burnett.

123
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:45,378
- Sir, about the football today, l know...
- l have your letter.

124
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:48,422
l understand you're interested
in leaving the navy.

125
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,391
Yes, sir. lt's time to move on.

126
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:54,690
lf you don't mind my asking,
move on to what?

127
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:55,763
Sir?

128
00:09:55,864 --> 00:10:00,324
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

129
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,633
You've had an interesting career, Lieutenant.

130
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,074
l remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

131
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:13,912
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd,

132
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:17,746
you received a non-punitive letter of caution

133
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:21,754
for disorderly behavior
at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

134
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:25,849
Another letter a month later
for something involving Chinese New Year

135
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:28,422
at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,192
One can only imagine what that was.

137
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,502
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant,
what happened to you?

138
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:45,802
Sir, l signed up to be a fighter pilot.
l didn't wanna be a cop.

139
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:51,477
l certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the
beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.

140
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,952
That and the routine on the ship
kinda wore me out.

141
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,353
- The routine?
- The routine.

142
00:10:57,225 --> 00:11:01,184
What you don't know from experience
is that the routine, the systems checks,

143
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:06,290
the drills, the maintaining of discipline,
that's what you do to prepare for war.

144
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:10,328
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

145
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:14,772
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're
at war every time you step on this boat.

146
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:18,039
- You understand that?
- No, sir, l do not understand.

147
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,073
lf we're at war, why don't we act like it?

148
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:26,244
Cos as far as l can tell, we go out,
we fly around and we come back.

149
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:32,483
Maybe we're pretending we're in the fight,
but we're not fighting, we're watching.

150
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:37,327
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.

151
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:41,493
Sir, l've given the navy seven good years.
l think l've served my country.

152
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:46,070
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

153
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,200
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.

154
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:54,270
You will serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

155
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,817
l'll keep your letter in my pocket.

156
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,355
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

157
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,398
You're dismissed, mister.

158
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,300
Sir.

159
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,017
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.

160
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,452
He's tellin' the truth.

161
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,549
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?

162
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,627
Oh, that's good.

163
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,891
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, l thought
you were kidding about getting out.

164
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:47,331
You telling me l gotta find another navigator?
ls that the deal?

165
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,871
l can't do it anymore. l'm done. l'm sorry.

166
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:09,553
(PA system) All hands. An air contact
believed to have originated in the North Pole

167
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:13,320
has been spotted
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

168
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,656
No, no, it's good to hear your voice. No, no.

169
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,759
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.

170
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,768
They're putting up tinsel,
and it's very Christmasy.

171
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,930
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her l said ''merry Christmas.''

172
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,767
We're disappointed
that we won't be seeing you.

173
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,071
Well, you may get to see a lot of me soon.

174
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,013
Well, we understand. You got
important things to do over there.

175
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,879
Dad, l gotta go.

176
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,910
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, l gotta get goin'.

177
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:42,683
- All right, l love you.
- Bye.

178
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,361
That son of a bitch!

179
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,798
Did you see this? He put us
on the holiday mission. Goddammit.

180
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:58,895
- Well, at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.

181
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:03,909
- lt's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.

182
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:07,048
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

183
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,037
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

184
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,018
Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.

185
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,716
He's got a brand-new car

186
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,560
Looks like a Jaguar

187
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:24,590
lt's got leather seats

188
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,335
lt's got a CD player...

189
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,961
(''player'' echoing)

190
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:41,609
Wouldn't it be great to look back
and there's Britney Spears?

191
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:46,517
But wait, she wants to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.

192
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,369
We'll start over again

193
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,480
Grow ourselves new skin

194
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,611
Get a house in Devon

195
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:22,946
Drink cider from a lemon

196
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,360
(TV) The CincinnatiAccord verifies Serbia's
commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia.

197
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:54,848
l welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.

198
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:23,172
Coordinates 3 0 1 5 0 6.5 1 1 5 0 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.

199
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:26,549
- You sure about that?
- l'm readin' it right here, pal.

200
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,922
Yeah, well, uh...

201
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:35,523
the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats,
cos we're flyin' over a lake.

202
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,665
Goddammit.

203
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:46,365
And a warm thank you to the US intelligence
community, ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,538
Yet another useless joyride at the cost
of mere millions to the US taxpayer.

205
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,349
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity
in section four alpha to our left.

206
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,615
Must be in that forested area.

207
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:07,217
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

208
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:11,492
Yeah, l know, l know. But the scope
doesn't lie. There it is. Let's check it out.

209
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,126
We're not supposed to fly that section.
The brass'll have a shit fit.

210
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:18,330
Hey, we're on recon,
so let's recon something.

211
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,670
Stack, it's probably just
some locals fooling around.

212
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:25,542
Could be a good opportunity
to test our shiny new digital camera.

213
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,047
Why do l listen to you? All right, let's do it.

214
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:37,221
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

215
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,089
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.

216
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,800
- lDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

217
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:53,102
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.

218
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,713
Rolling digital.

219
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,988
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

220
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,385
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

221
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,335
(jet flying overhead)

222
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:06,880
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.

223
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,197
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!

224
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,290
What?!

225
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,936
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!

226
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,872
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

227
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,574
- l see a single missile tracking on us.
- l don't see it. Call my turn.

228
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,981
Slice left. Hard!

229
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,649
Jesus Christ!

230
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,848
Where is it?

231
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,925
Reverse right!

232
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,128
Try to break the lock!

233
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,002
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.

234
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,036
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.

235
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:15,048
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?!

236
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,640
l can't see shit! Where is he?!

237
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,764
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!

238
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:34,562
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- l got him! l got him!

239
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,705
(yells)

240
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,937
We need a bigger heat decoy.

241
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,782
We're screwed!

242
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:03,095
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!

243
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,455
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!

244
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,935
Good fireball!

245
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:19,543
Clear on top. Coming back down.

246
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:24,317
l got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

247
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,818
That's it! One down. Up we go.

248
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,627
- Where's the second?
- No joy. l don't have it in sight.

249
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,830
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.

250
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,936
Hard left.

251
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:48,597
- l'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!

252
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,638
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!

253
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:56,375
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?

254
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:02,678
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break!

255
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,520
l got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!

256
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,594
Nose break, right!

257
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,030
Shit!

258
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:30,974
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!

259
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,690
Goddammit.

260
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,981
(Christmas song plays)

261
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:25,059
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, l really like Christmas.

262
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,396
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.

263
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,932
Ark Angel Zero Six.

264
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,100
Burnett and Stackhouse.

265
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,735
Goddammit. l put 'em on the holiday mission.

266
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,280
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.

267
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:45,216
We have a radar plot of flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

268
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,981
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

269
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,523
ln the red is actual.

270
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,331
Lost contact is here.

271
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,835
They're off-mission. What the hell happened?

272
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:10,000
lt'll be tough to pick up a beacon signal,
even from a satellite.

273
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,271
The terrain is extremely rough.

274
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,210
Damn weather's sure not helping.

275
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:17,215
Contact Admiral Piquet,
alert NATO chain of command.

276
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:21,185
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep
out over all US national circuits.

277
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,381
And get through to Admiral Donnelly.

278
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,050
- No names.
- No names, sir.

279
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,304
Stack! Stackhouse!

280
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,917
Stack!

281
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,279
Are you OK?

282
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,287
Yeah.

283
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,783
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm OK. You look terrible.

284
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,157
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.

285
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:04,628
Let me see this. Oh, man.

286
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:09,966
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.

287
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,605
Shit. Squeeze right here.

288
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:20,780
So...

289
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,306
where are we, Mr Navigator Man?

290
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:28,346
ln the mountains north of Miciovic.

291
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,854
You think they saw us eject?

292
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,623
We are not gonna be around to find out.

293
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:40,891
Reigart'll be curious
what happened to his $40 million plane.

294
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:44,164
Forget it. l already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

295
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,068
What?

296
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,941
You think it'll work up there?

297
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,169
Yeah. Just get high enough.

298
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:56,509
All right. All right, sit tight.

299
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:01,347
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

300
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,019
Listen, l should've dodged
that second missile.

301
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:10,160
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you.

302
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,596
l thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

303
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:17,898
l used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.

304
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,553
Oh, God.

305
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,201
(cheering)

306
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:22,659
Oh, shit.

307
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,442
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

308
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:01,993
Urgh!

309
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,935
Oh, goddammit.

310
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:12,011
(muttering) Son of a bitch.

311
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:21,145
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

312
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,676
Not bombing mission, right?

313
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,186
You photograph?

314
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,465
(soldiers laugh)

315
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,565
You alone?

316
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,940
Correct.

317
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,456
No!

318
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,006
(whistles)

319
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:04,437
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.

320
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,981
(garbled over static) Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?

321
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:14,882
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's some interference.

322
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:17,286
lt's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.

323
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,620
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.

324
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:24,095
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey
directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.

325
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:26,222
(beeping)

326
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,768
(beeping stops)

327
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:39,208
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?

328
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:40,647
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

329
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:43,377
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

330
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:49,755
Ark Angel is down. l say again.
Ark Angel is down, and l am on the run.

331
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:52,484
Slow down. What is your count?

332
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:01,130
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

333
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,630
No names over the net.

334
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,102
Confirm your last.

335
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,335
Minus one. Confirmed.

336
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,935
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

337
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:19,615
You're saying a uniformed soldier
killed your flight officer?

338
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,780
No, l'm saying they executed him.

339
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,757
They talked... They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

340
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:31,525
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

341
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:36,432
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. All l need is a ride.

342
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,196
Zero Six, consult your chart.

343
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,102
Reposition to rally point three.

344
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:49,276
l read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.

345
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,408
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just get to the rally point.

346
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,283
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.

347
00:35:57,223 --> 00:36:00,659
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.

348
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,490
Let 'em know l need a green light
to go get my boy.

349
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,818
Command and control
comes from Red Crown.

350
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:12,660
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.

351
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,699
Use advisedly.

352
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,793
l want gimbal attachments
for all fast ropers.

353
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:21,733
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

354
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,603
- (knock on door)
- Come.

355
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:29,008
Admiral, what's going on down there?

356
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:33,074
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

357
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:36,388
Who authorized a search and rescue?

358
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:40,391
- l did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.

359
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:45,423
Maybe l didn't make myself clear. We have
pilots down. One probably already dead.

360
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:49,298
Admiral, l have spoken personally
to Bosnian military commanders.

361
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:51,529
They say the shoot-down was perpetrated

362
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:55,734
by renegade forces
attempting to disrupt the peace process.

363
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,537
Of course they say that.

364
00:37:57,644 --> 00:38:02,343
They're also claiming, Admiral,
that your aircraft was way off-mission.

365
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,316
lf we fly in there we create a shitstorm,
and the whole treaty will collapse.

366
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:10,048
Admiral, Burnett says
that Serb troops murdered his pilot.

367
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,488
ls your pilot an expert on Bosnia?

368
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:16,255
Can he distinguish between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

369
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:20,423
Because l can't, and l've been
posted here for five years.

370
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:24,462
lf your man is in danger,
he should get himself into a safe zone.

371
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,506
That is what he's briefed and trained to do.

372
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:33,135
Listen, Leslie. l can have your fleet
commander order you to stand down,

373
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:35,840
or you can do it yourself.

374
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,396
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.

375
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,875
Zero Six, go ahead.

376
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:47,912
Zero Six is at rally point three
and standing by.

377
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:52,873
Zero Six, latest intel
says your current location

378
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:56,853
undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.

379
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,925
Say again your last.
l am at the rendezvous point.

380
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,919
You need to hump it out to a safe zone.

381
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,933
l set lP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,

382
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:12,402
Virginia 2-0. Read back.

383
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:28,354
No.

384
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,921
Negative. Negative.

385
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:35,527
l do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup?

386
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,689
l am good to go.

387
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:40,789
l say again, l am good to go now.

388
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,800
Burnett!

389
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:52,973
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

390
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:57,510
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. l am very sorry.

391
00:41:57,884 --> 00:42:02,116
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

392
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,247
Create some angles between
you and your pursuers.

393
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,022
Use your training. Use your head. Evade
and survive, and we will bring you home.

394
00:42:10,129 --> 00:42:12,029
Understand? We will bring you home!

395
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,231
(shouting)

396
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:24,143
Zero Six?

397
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,376
Zero Six?

398
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,580
Someone's coming.

399
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,888
(frequency static)

400
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:46,598
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.

401
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,634
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

402
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:07,786
We're tracking him in the SClF, sir.

403
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:10,155
On me.

404
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,477
At ease.

405
00:43:40,586 --> 00:43:44,852
Sir, we were able to track the emergency
radio signal to somewhere in this radius.

406
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:49,587
lt's pretty far away. But we think
the pilot transmission came from here.

407
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:59,001
This is imagery from a Northrop Grumman
relay satellite downlinked through Stuttgart.

408
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:03,508
We've hot-wired it for heat image,
and it's streaming in now.

409
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,635
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

410
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,348
OK, here we go.

411
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,129
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

412
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,841
(shouts in Serbo-Croatian)

413
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:51,219
Fuck!

414
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,525
What's going on? He's down.

415
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,257
He been shot?

416
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,933
They're almost on him.

417
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:10,667
Son of a bitch.

418
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,673
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

419
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:17,781
(Reigart) They're right on him!

420
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:34,833
What are they doing?

421
00:45:52,118 --> 00:45:54,951
(issues orders)

422
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:10,568
What's goin' on?

423
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:26,476
Has he been killed?

424
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:19,367
He's moving. That's him.

425
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:28,337
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.

426
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:32,110
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.

427
00:47:32,218 --> 00:47:34,049
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.

428
00:47:34,153 --> 00:47:38,453
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for chrissakes!

429
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:40,525
We're down. lt's cooked.

430
00:47:40,726 --> 00:47:45,129
l want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?

431
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:46,994
Yes, sir.

432
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,931
- (knock at door)
- Come.

433
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:26,637
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

434
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:31,566
l was trying to motivate him, Tom.

435
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:33,235
Sir?

436
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:35,745
Burnett. ln the radio room.

437
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:38,544
l was...

438
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:43,884
l was trying to motivate him,
but... maybe l carried it too far.

439
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:47,015
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.

440
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:51,220
Just human, sir.

441
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,725
- Tom.
- Sir?

442
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:02,106
lt's why l push 'em so hard.
For times like these.

443
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:12,947
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.

444
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:17,148
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

445
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:21,625
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got
a guy on the ground, and we're sittin' here.

446
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:23,695
lt's a complicated situation.

447
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:26,356
Why isn't this all over the news?

448
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:31,368
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale,
or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out?

449
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,629
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.

450
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,198
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

451
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:43,273
Now, this kid might not have
the best attitude, but he's no idiot.

452
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:47,682
- He says he's gettin' shot at, l believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?

453
00:49:47,786 --> 00:49:51,984
Command tells me l gotta sit on my hands.
What else can l do?

454
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:55,590
Right.

455
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:58,527
l forgot. lt's not your call.

456
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:01,461
You're damn right it's not my call!

457
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,237
Apology, sir. Of course,
you can't do anything.

458
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,690
(TV) lt's been confirmed that an American
combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet,

459
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:07,891
has been shot down over Bosnia.

460
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,334
lt was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia
at around 6:00 yesterday morning.

461
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:12,961
Mr Burnett?

462
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:16,667
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator
is believed to have survived.

463
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:17,901
lt's about your son.

464
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:22,376
Their names are being withheld,
pending notification of their next of kin.

465
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,717
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down.

466
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:28,946
lt's the Serbs who control
most ofsouthern Bosnia,

467
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:31,352
but they allege insurgents are to blame,

468
00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:34,858
and say they're doing everything
to help locate the crew.

469
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,920
lt's also unclear what, if any, impact
this incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...

470
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,622
Admiral.

471
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,458
You and l have known each other
for how long? Five years?

472
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,622
Something like that.

473
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,864
l've always commended your work
to your superior officers.

474
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,563
l've sent you information
whenever you requested it.

475
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,833
Thank you, sir. l appreciate your support.

476
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,307
And this is the thanks l get?

477
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,910
We have one disagreement
over how to handle a downed pilot,

478
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,811
and you stab me in the back?

479
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,647
You go to the media, to my contact,
and you make me look like an asshole.

480
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:13,245
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

481
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,985
Our man is down behind enemy lines!

482
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,526
Now what the fuck is the problem?!

483
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,627
Do you have any idea how much damage this
incident may cause to the peace process?

484
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:27,897
All l know, Admiral, is that the American
people want their pilot back.

485
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,532
Exactly! Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

486
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:37,503
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

487
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:42,108
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

488
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:47,181
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

489
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,121
You might have helped save
your man today, Reigart.

490
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,756
And l emphasize might.

491
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:01,634
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

492
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,113
(distant clanking)

493
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,323
(child's laughter echoing)

494
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,904
(echoing laughter continues)

495
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,525
(adult voice)

496
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,088
(truck engine starts)

497
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,688
Shit!

498
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,725
(men shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

499
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,445
Shit.

500
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,666
Argh!

501
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,016
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel.

502
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,185
(knock at door)

503
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,493
They've got a signal. lt's Burnett.

504
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:31,931
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six.

505
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,334
l'm on course with your last instructions.

506
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,706
(breathing heavily)

507
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:42,767
Am keyed up and waiting for your...
waiting for you to name the fairway.

508
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:46,839
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son?

509
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,982
l don't know. You tell me, sir.

510
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:55,820
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself,
uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.

511
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,893
Understood?

512
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,898
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.

513
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,994
Good for birds ?

514
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,505
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.

515
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:16,272
You need to get there, stay out of trouble
and Big Mother will pick you up.

516
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,006
Next contact at, um...

517
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,272
1700.

518
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,350
Roger.

519
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,020
Alpha Whiskey?

520
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,390
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.

521
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,939
Sir, l shouldn't have left Stackhouse.

522
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,981
Distract him.

523
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:57,144
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was
garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.

524
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,813
How's it holding up?

525
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,923
The gear's good. l have a basic pack.

526
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,397
l left some of it at the crash site.

527
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,603
l guess l got rattled when l ejected at Mach 3.

528
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,668
You still got your boots,
haven't you, cowboy?

529
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,509
Roger. They were tied on.

530
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,578
You got it made.

531
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:37,251
You're an optimist, sir.
See, l had you figured for a grouch.

532
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,891
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.

533
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,096
Roger.

534
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,798
Are you gonna be there, sir?

535
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,374
That's affirmative, son. Out.

536
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,046
He's here.

537
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,515
Yes, sir. l suggest we place him here.

538
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:06,884
lt's open ground near the town of Hac,
well inside the safe zone.

539
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,792
All right, let's go for the extraction.

540
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:53,902
(Reigart) ..command area responsibility.
lngress will be north, egress south.

541
01:02:54,904 --> 01:03:01,002
From the radio contacts, you can see he has
basically circled back towards the crash site.

542
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,513
Call sign is ''Avalanche.''
Authenticate: ''Romeo Two, X-ray.''

543
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:11,086
Continue: ''Bulldog.'' Delay: ''Cycle.''
Abort is ''Washdown.''

544
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,348
Aircraft down is ''Cobalt.''
Success is ''Ripper.''

545
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,524
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

546
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:24,322
Bravo will establish a perimeter, then
haul ass back to the helo on my command...

547
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,368
Admiral Reigart.

548
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,734
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

549
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,467
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly.

550
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:36,341
l have spoken with Admiral Donnelly
and have his full support.

551
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,437
You will stand down.

552
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,695
( ''The Wanderer'' by Dion on radio)

553
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,037
(Stackhouse, whispering) Chris.

554
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,379
( ''The Wanderer'' continues)

555
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,525
Hey!

556
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,040
Yeah.

557
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,262
You American?

558
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,973
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

559
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,576
Nine millimeters?

560
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,285
Nine millimeter.

561
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,387
Do you have water?

562
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,516
Water? No water.

563
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,205
Thanks.

564
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,014
lt's good.

565
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,044
lce Cube.

566
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,783
Yeah. l like lce Cube.

567
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:45,088
l like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.

568
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:49,222
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

569
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,727
(raps)  They said stop, freeze

570
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:56,032
l got froze up
because l'm public enemy number one

571
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,671
One, one, one, one

572
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,976
That's good. That's good, that's good.

573
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:19,760
You know where we're going?

574
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:20,829
Hac.

575
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,421
Hac? That's good. Good.

576
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,439
Jesus Christ!

577
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:44,382
Tell him to go!

578
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,984
Hey, come on! Come on!

579
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,017
Hey. Bonjour.

580
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,810
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?

581
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:55,482
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. l'm an American soldier
that's been shot down.

582
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,684
Shut up.

583
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,694
(speaking Serbo-Croatian)

584
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:05,192
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking photographs.

585
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,769
Photographs of what? Of what?!

586
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,105
Lokar's come back here again,
killing everyone.

587
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:16,008
lt's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children,
women... Buried them up in the hills.

588
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:19,046
ln the hills?
Yes, l saw them. l saw the graves.

589
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,986
Yes, l saw them. l saw the bodies in the hills.

590
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,647
Tell him. l am an American.
l am on your side.

591
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:31,658
- That's what l'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.

592
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,625
Tell them you are an American.

593
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,459
- They don't kill American.
- lce Cube, tell them.

594
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,500
Tell this guy that we have
photographs that can help...

595
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:43,038
Bullshit!

596
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,333
America say they make them sign deal.

597
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,640
- l swear to God...
- But they already break it!

598
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,807
America government for shit! Now go!

599
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,729
(heavily distorted breathing)

600
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,920
(static)

601
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,904
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

602
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,943
(gunfire continues)

603
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,301
Hey, hey, hey...

604
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,336
lt's OK. lt's me.

605
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,703
Come on.

606
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,149
Time?

607
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,156
Three minutes, sir.

608
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,035
Stop! Shh.

609
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:17,465
(distant helicopter)

610
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:30,151
Let's go.

611
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,529
(phone rings)

612
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:54,599
Reigart.

613
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,009
(Piquet) Leslie, l'm afraid there's bad news.

614
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:03,816
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac.

615
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,685
l regret to inform you
that Lieutenant Burnett is...

616
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:10,516
dead.

617
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,618
- l am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.

618
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:27,833
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.

619
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,242
Yet once again in Bosnia,
that's proved an illusion.

620
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,144
And in the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave,

621
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,683
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found

622
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:40,448
the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett,

623
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:43,319
whose plane was shot down two days ago.

624
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,524
The Serb authorities are claiming
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas,

625
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:53,294
opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.

626
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:58,061
(CNN reporter) The Serbs say the body
was discovered by one of their teams

627
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:02,872
in a search-and-rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.

628
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:07,005
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's hopes
for a clean exit from the Balkans,

629
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:12,417
and frustrates US military leaders, only days
away from a withdrawal from Bosnia.

630
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:16,350
(Sky reporter) For NATO's forces
on the eve of their departure,

631
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,588
the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death
comes as another dark blow

632
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:26,328
at the end ofa disturbing and ultimately
unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.

633
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,566
Savior Six, Savior Six
from Gold Eagle command.

634
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,975
Be advised the package is not in position.

635
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,278
Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.

636
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,793
Hey!

637
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,056
Hey! Wait!

638
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,276
We're here!

639
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,569
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!

640
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,007
We're right here!

641
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:18,050
You've gotta be shitting me!

642
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,728
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

643
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,098
- Captain...
- We did nothing!

644
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:38,670
We did nothing.

645
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:06,492
We were right here.

646
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,062
We were right... Fuck!

647
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,537
What's that?

648
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,560
lt's not safe here. We'll keep going.

649
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,037
No. You go.

650
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:27,238
They killed my pilot
because we took pictures of the graves.

651
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,941
And l know where they are.

652
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,713
And l'm gonna get 'em,
so he didn't die for no reason.

653
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,624
Don't follow me.

654
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,700
lt's safer here.

655
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,634
Shit.

656
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:09,676
Goddamn. Why is this off?

657
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,548
Why is this off? Why is this...?

658
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:39,437
(bird squawking)

659
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,615
Come on.

660
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,651
Come on! Goddammit!

661
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,383
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.

662
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,761
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

663
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:13,967
(PA) For the information of all hands,
this ship will be relieved on station.

664

lt will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.

665
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,998
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SClF.
- All right, thank you.

666
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,760
(beeping)

667
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,837
lt's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.

668
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,963
The only way to reactivate it
is from the seat, manually.

669
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:48,709
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

670
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:53,947
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar
with our systems to reactivate that beacon.

671
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,539
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup.

672
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,417
lt's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.

673
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,649
Sir, l agree.

674
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:07,860
Sir, we really should notify NATO command,
or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.

675
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:13,491
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, l get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

676
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:17,093
Piquet was very clear with his objections, sir.

677
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,568
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it.

678
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:24,475
l'm not gonna let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

679
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,936
OK. All right. OK.

680
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:03,066
OK, all right.

681
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,342
Goddamn!

682
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:17,755
(explosion in distance)

683
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:43,017
Gentlemen,

684
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:46,611
l wanna make one thing clear before we leave.

685
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,717
l intend to put you in harm's way.

686
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:57,225
Any man who doesn't wish to join
this mission, step away right now.

687
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,170
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

688
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:28,609
About two clicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

689
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,850
(helicopters approaching)

690
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,639
(beeping)

691
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:55,359
(yells)

692
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:00,338
Argh!

693
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:17,280
Argh...

694
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:23,253
(rumbling)

695
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:38,812
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

696
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,529
(Reigart) There he is. There he is!

697
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,879
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?

698
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,417
Come on!

699
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:35,425
Come on! Come on, kid!

700
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,945
lt's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.

701
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,497
Goddammit!

702
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:25,442
Come on!

703
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,713
OK.

704
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,397
Go!

705
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:51,171
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.

706
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:53,473
Sir, he's on the rope.

707
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:05,357
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

708
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,523
Come on, son. Come on!

709
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:16,266
Go!

710
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:37,048
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

711
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:11,616
Hey, Chris.

712
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,693
Hey, Glen.

713
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:15,162
Admiral.

714
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,726
This is why they killed Stackhouse.

715
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:34,076
Admiral?

716
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:38,345
You were holding a letter for me.
l'd like to get it back.

717
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,111
l think l can find it.

718
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:01,003
( ''The Rescue Blues '' by Ryan Adams)

719
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:23,524
And everybody wants to see you suffer

720
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:30,429
They know that you need the pain so much

721
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:40,039
They throw you up a rope
when you're too high to cruise, baby...

722
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:43,547
Lord, you lose, lady

723
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:48,655
Then they charge you with the rescue blues

724
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:56,553
The rescue blues

725
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:09,204
And everybody wants to see you fall

726
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:17,179
That's why they always love
to get you high, high

727
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:25,651
And everybody knows
you need the pain so much, lady

728
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,855
Keep in touch, baby

729
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:34,992
Just don't charge me
with your rescue blues

730
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:38,298
Oh, oh

731
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:42,031
Rescue blues
