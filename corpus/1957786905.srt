1
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,472
Soto Health, this is Cassy.
Hi, Claire.

2
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,343
Yeah, he's drinking
tons and tons of water.

3
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,246
I'm making sure of it.
No, yeah, don't worry about it.

4
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,549
Yeah, I'll totally...
I got it, I'll check on him.

5
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,451
Yeah. For sure. Okay, bye.

6
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,321
- Hi, Dom. Happy holidays.
- Cassy.

7
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,190
Hey, I know I'm 15 minutes
early, but it's kind of important,

8
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,160
so if he isn't doing anything, I'd
rather not wait and get straight to it.

9
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,395
Okay, let me check in with him.

10
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,203
Dom's here,
he says it's important.

11
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,036
If you're available now,
should I send him in?

12
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,980
Uh, just have him wait.
It's not quite time yet.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,115
Yeah, thank you, Cassy.

14
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,730
- Does he make you wear that hat?
- Why?

15
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,532
'Cause I can't share the holiday
spirit of my own volition?

16
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,736
No, no. Just seemed like
one of those Jorge things.

17
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,938
Well, I'll have you know
it was a joint decision.

18
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,374
This year's theme is inclusion. We
wanna make sure no one's left out.

19
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,210
Chinese, Muslims, Jews,
Hindus, everyone's holiday

20
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,580
is as worthy of attention
as Christmas.

21
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,280
- What about Kwanzaa?
- Who?

22
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,818
Soto Health, this is...
Fuck off, Andrew!

23
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,488
I told you
not to call me at work.

24
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,591
My creeper ex.
I only went out with him

25
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,426
because he's like 12 feet tall, so
I figured he'd have a 12-inch dick,

26
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,063
but turns out proportions
don't work that way.

27
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,398
And he has a crazy Korean
fetish.

28
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,934
Memorized lyrics to all these
K-pop songs I don't even know,

29
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,770
watches all the dramas.

30
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,171
He even tried buying me
a Korean school girl outfit.

31
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,641
Can you imagine me
in a school girl uniform?

32
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:58,178
- I can only imagine.
- Anyway, I like it.

33
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,947
Keeps my head warm.

34
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,550
Besides, it adds
to the overall cheer.

35
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,789
Is he actually doing something
or is he just sitting in there?

36
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,857
You've known him
the longest, you tell me.

37
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,828
Soto Health, this is Cassy.

38
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,131
Hi, Ms. Rottenstein,
how can I help you?

39
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,000
Sure. Okay, Monday.

40
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,251
<i>Mayeda Realtors, this is Rita.</i>

41
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,022
- Hey, it's me.
<i>- Dom, where the hell did you go?</i>

42
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,458
<i>I had Darius Ebner in here expecting
to be shown the Rowley house,</i>

43
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,861
<i>but surprise, you're not here.</i>

44
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>- Also, isn't this the house that Jorge wants?</i>
- Shit.

45
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,668
I'll call him later,
can you reschedule him?

46
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:58,405
<i>I already did to tomorrow, 'cause
you'll be here in the office tomorrow.</i>

47
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,342
<i>Why can't you leave a note?
Or use the spoken word?</i>

48
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,846
<i>"Hey, Rita, I'm leaving."
No, you can't.</i>

49
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,215
<i>- You have an appointment!</i>
- Okay, I'm sorry.

50
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,382
Look, uh, I'll leave a note
next time.

51
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,461
Look, if Lisa calls looking
for me, can you tell her...

52
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,821
<i>Lisa's already called
looking for you.</i>

53
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,999
<i>I told her I don't know where you are
because I don't know where you are.</i>

54
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,827
Well, if she calls again, just
tell her I'm meeting a client.

55
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,063
<i>- Which client?</i>
- Uh, a new one.

56
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,600
<i>Thank you for making my job
harder by not telling me anything</i>

57
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,836
<i>- and making me lie to your wife.</i>
- Rita, please, can you...

58
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,907
I'm dealing with something
right now, okay? Thank you.

59
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,739
Trust me, proportions
don't work like that.

60
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,208
You remember how tall
Andrew was?

61
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,911
Well, "disappointed"
isn't even the right word.

62
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,546
Wait, let me put you on hold.

63
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,150
Yes? Will do.

64
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:20,288
Dom? Dom?

65
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:26,761
Dominic, the highlight
of my week.

66
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,831
- You were just sitting there, weren't you?!
- Oh, come on.

67
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,599
Jorge, I really need your advice

68
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,935
and you made me sit
outside for 15 minutes,

69
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,137
looking at a book
of nude women with scars!

70
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,005
Hey, what do you think of it?

71
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,440
I had to drive through
a mile of smoke to get here!

72
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,144
Okay, don't yell at me,
I didn't start the fire.

73
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,545
Would you sit down already?

74
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,687
Arguing is not good for your
mental and physical health.

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,655
What did I tell you about that?

76
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,356
Why do you have that anyway?

77
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,491
- What?
- The scars book.

78
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,095
Oh, that's... Claire's
getting lipo for her birthday,

79
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,633
so she thought it would help prepare
me, you know, in case of any scarring.

80
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,936
Isn't that dangerous? I thought
the mortality rate was absurdly high,

81
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,474
- like one in 5,000 or something?
- Oh, no, that was the '90s lipo.

82
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:19,046
Besides, I made sure she's going
to the best surgeons in the country.

83
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,350
You know, I could not live
without her.

84
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,819
- Right, that's why you divorced her.
- Hmm.

85
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,522
Symbolically. But we never
went through the paperwork.

86
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:33,460
But you know what? She's a totally different
person ever since we got back together.

87
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,664
I'm talking about going
from Roman Catholic, uptight,

88
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,634
and super jealous of any woman
near me

89
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:44,038
to doing witchcraft
and be so trusting.

90
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,375
She's the one who actually
introduced me with Cassy, you know?

91
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,144
Hey, by the way, when can
we tour that Rowley house?

92
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,313
Claire really wants the house,
you know?

93
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:56,651
Yeah, yeah. Listen, these pills you
gave me, they don't calm me down,

94
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,021
- they just make me tired as shit.
- Hey, don't take one, then.

95
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:03,291
Come on, here.

96
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:09,496
These are uppers, these will
cancel out the downer you just took.

97
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,699
- Do you have any water?
- No.

98
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,001
Um, just take it dry,
feels better.

99
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,673
Yeah. Oh, and these.

100
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,677
These, my friend,
are the new Prozac in town.

101
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,113
- What are they?
- Oh, they're called fen-phen.

102
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:29,083
They makes you alert,
gives you dopamine.

103
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,253
- Are they safe to mix? What are the other ones?
- Oh, come on, Dom.

104
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,089
I'm not gonna give you
anything I won't take myself.

105
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,924
Hmm? See?

106
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,695
Just take it. There you go.

107
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,300
Wow.

108
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,370
So what's new in real estate?

109
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,341
I've been having dreams.

110
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,813
- What kind of dreams?
- So I'm in the middle of the country somewhere,

111
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,414
I drive up
to an auto repair shop,

112
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,717
which is a combination
of Costco gas station lines

113
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,353
and driveways that lead
up to an auto garage,

114
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:08,589
and there was the worker, the guy
at that one Jiffy Lube that rips you off.

115
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:12,460
- Yeah, all Jiffy Lubes rip you off.
- I know, those fuckers.

116
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,564
Anyway, I left and went to
go to my car. It was gone.

117
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,767
I go to the manager's office
and my car had been towed.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,969
There in the tow section,
I clicked my car remote

119
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,672
for my car to honk
so I could locate it

120
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,842
and I found it was crushed
between two other vehicles.

121
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,178
- And how did that make you feel?
- I was devastated.

122
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:34,081
I felt so helpless.

123
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,418
So then the guy from Pert London
shows up, somehow he works there too,

124
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,454
and then I beg him to release my car
because I have no money to pay for it,

125
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,623
and I'm in the middle
of nowhere.

126
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,658
But instead of empathizing
with me,

127
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:48,095
- they start making fun of me for being Caribbean.
- What do you mean?

128
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,865
Like, making racist
Jamaican jokes and stuff.

129
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,368
- But you're not Jamaican.
- I know, but in the dream I was,

130
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,704
and I was really offended
by their remarks.

131
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,549
Anyway, that part might not really be
relevant. I'm just telling you because...

132
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,309
The relevance of dreams
isn't so much in the details

133
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,545
as in the emotions
and reactions to them.

134
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,816
See, because
the subconscious emotions...

135
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,719
...can be the manifestations
of real life concerns

136
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,655
- that you might be experiencing.
- It's Rita, I'll just...

137
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:18,292
Hey, you know what to do,
put her on the speaker phone.

138
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:22,296
- Seriously?
- Yeah, no secrets here.

139
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,799
This space is only for truth.

140
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:32,306
- Rita?
<i>- Lisa called again, I told her what you said to tell her</i>

141
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,675
<i>and she said to let you know
she's on her way</i>

142
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,312
<i>to Burbank Airport
and to call her back.</i>

143
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,082
- O-kay.
<i>- Dom, what's going on?</i>

144
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,684
<i>- Why are you avoiding your wife?</i>
- Thank you.

145
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,686
<i>Dom, you have...</i>

146
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,189
Dom, why are you not talking
to Lisa?

147
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:52,059
Let me tell you something, the road
to hell is paved with ignoring your wife.

148
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,762
I mean,
Claire always calls Cassy.

149
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,731
But if she called myself, I
would not dare not to pick it up.

150
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,900
Yeah, well, I'll get to that.

151
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,380
In my second dream, I'm
being chased through the city

152
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:06,173
by a Hispanic couple,
man and a woman.

153
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,608
Hispanic or Latino?

154
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,378
I don't know the difference.

155
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,048
Well, today, Hispanic
generally refers to anyone

156
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,519
of Spanish speaking origin,
including Spain.

157
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,720
But some people say
it doesn't include Brazil

158
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,722
since they speak Portuguese.

159
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,391
But they count as Latino, so.

160
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,529
This is... for some people, this is
a matter of preference, you know?

161
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:30,698
Me, can be Latino, Hispanic,
doesn't matter.

162
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,869
- I don't think they were Brazilian.
- Okay.

163
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,644
Anyway, in my dream I have
the power to warp through walls

164
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:47,982
by crashing into them and entering
a void space where they can't see me

165
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,317
but I can see through the walls
to them.

166
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:53,821
And I can also fly,
though very slowly.

167
00:10:55,156 --> 00:11:00,227
I move a few feet with each flap of
my arms, and at the mercy of the wind.

168
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,799
I know the couple wanted me in connection to
something, but I don't remember what it is.

169
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,969
I know only the feeling
of narrowly escaping them,

170
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,840
floating just out their reach
from the window of a high rise,

171
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,511
watching them watching me
as I escape through the air,

172
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,812
over the wide ocean between us.

173
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:21,916
And then I wake up.

174
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,591
Okay, so how does this relate
to you not talking to Lisa?

175
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,628
You don't see it?
This is the Pert London deal.

176
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:36,330
My car represents the company
they're taking away from me.

177
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,332
And the whole laughing at me
for being Jamaican

178
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,335
is them laughing at a foreigner,
AKA the British laughing at me

179
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,970
because they know
I'm being played.

180
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,507
- Ah.
- The Hispanic woman is Lisa!

181
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,275
Trevor, one of the Pert
London partner, is Hispanic!

182
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:51,478
- Come on.
- I wasn't paying attention to the signs when I was awake,

183
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:54,481
but in here, subconsciously,
I'm picking it up.

184
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:56,951
Lisa being Hispanified means
she's leaving me for Trevor,

185
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,420
the Hispanic Pert London guy.

186
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,222
I can't go through
with this deal now!

187
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,991
Dom, that's not how dreams work.

188
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,027
What do you mean? You said it
yourself, they're the subconscious

189
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,196
manifestations of real-life
concerns.

190
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,498
Yeah, but emotions
of real-life concerns

191
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:14,368
doesn't mean they're evidence
of anything.

192
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,172
And I said, "Sometimes." Sometimes
doesn't mean anything at all.

193
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,741
So you think my brain's giving
me these scenarios at random?

194
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,344
The fact that Pert London
is in both of them is random?

195
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,013
The Hispanic guy chasing me
and Trevor from Pert London

196
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,916
just happening to be
Hispanic is meaningless too?

197
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,052
- You think this is just coincidental bullshit?
- I don't know, Dom!

198
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,888
I only took psychology
one semester in college.

199
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,291
I'm a goddamn accountant,
remember?

200
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:42,564
Look, you're welcome to come here
anytime you want and talk things through.

201
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:45,399
But if you're having some
serious doubts about your marriage,

202
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,202
then you need to go see
a professional.

203
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,606
Why don't you and Lisa go see
a marriage counselor, huh?

204
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,407
Someone specially trained
to help you through

205
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,342
whatever you are going through
in life.

206
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,414
It's too late.

207
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,084
She's about to be on a plane
to London.

208
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:10,090
- Well, do it after that trip.
- I don't think she's coming back.

209
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:14,328
Oh, keep ignoring her phone
calls and you might be right.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,571
A month ago, we had a sit down
with Pert London.

211
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:27,808
<i>It was me, Lisa,
and their two partners,</i>

212
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,310
<i>including Trevor.</i>

213
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,514
<i>Lisa bought coffee
for everyone...</i>

214
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,650
<i>and when she gave Trevor his...</i>

215
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,352
<i>I saw a look between them.</i>

216
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,890
Oh, yeah? And did her eyes pop out
like Bugs Bunny and stretch to his penis?

217
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:47,161
Hey, I have a photographic
memory. I know what I saw, okay?

218
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,130
There's a difference between
looking and "looooking."

219
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah, okay, you said it
longer the second time.

220
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,539
Okay, so you have
photographic memory, right?

221
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,010
What's the prescription number
on this bottle?

222
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,549
77835196-B.

223
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:12,286
Correct. But you didn't notice
that it doesn't say my name.

224
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,688
It says Kate.

225
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,825
- Who's that?
- That's not the point.

226
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,127
The point is that
you might have perfect memory,

227
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,797
but you only seeing the details
that you wanna see.

228
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:25,265
See? And that's distorting
the bigger picture.

229
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,035
Let me ask you something,
has Lisa given you

230
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,840
any actual indications that she
was unhappy with her marriage?

231
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,944
Or this is just because of a look or
your silly dream about her being Hispanic?

232
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:40,314
Yes, Lisa's been distant lately.

233
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,983
I don't remember the last time
she said "I love you" on the phone.

234
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,452
Well, do you say that to her?

235
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,622
There's one more thing...

236
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,457
I get real-time alerts
on all our credit cards

237
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,493
for any charges over $50.

238
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:53,862
Look at the most recent one.

239
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,398
Seventy-seven dollars, Wendy's.

240
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,834
Fuck, for how many people?

241
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,803
No, no, no.
The one above it.

242
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:04,672
Oh, 366, KKO Airways.

243
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,841
That's a one-way ticket price.

244
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,878
Well, people buy one-way
tickets all the time, just to be safe.

245
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,413
Besides, don't you both
have family in London?

246
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:16,651
I mean, it makes sense, she wants
to set extra time to see them, right?

247
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:20,087
No, that might not be anything
out of the ordinary by itself,

248
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,356
but add on everything else
I just told you?

249
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,093
I need to talk to your friend before
I lose my company along with Lisa.

250
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,364
- The divorce lawyer, Rodan or something?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

251
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,735
You are not divorcing your wife
over premonitions, dreams, or looks.

252
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:36,604
I don't care how stretched out
you say that word.

253
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,939
We're gonna set you up with
a marriage counselor right now

254
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,775
because you are not
thinking straight.

255
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,779
And when Lisa comes back
from London, which she will...

256
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,851
- You're picking that up right now.
- I can't.

257
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,820
No, wait!

258
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:07,201
You've reached Dominic Mayeda,
please leave a message.

259
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,204
<i>Dom, it's me.
I'm at the airport and I've just found</i>

260
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,640
<i>that my binder with all the
Pert London documents</i>

261
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,543
<i>is not in my suitcase.
Check my desk.</i>

262
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:19,146
<i>They don't take facsimile, so you'll
have to mail it to the PLP's office.</i>

263
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,659
<i>I'll be at my parents' tomorrow
and then with Pert the day after,</i>

264
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:25,553
<i>so it needs to be mailed Next Day
Air today to get there on time, okay?</i>

265
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,154
<i>Bye.</i>

266
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,724
What the hell is wrong with you?

267
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,126
I took it out of the suitcase.

268
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,963
- What?
- The binder with the document.

269
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,439
I took it out last night
while she was asleep.

270
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,667
Oh, my God.
I know what this is.

271
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:43,403
- Jorge, if I'm right about this, then...
- This is a mid-life crisis.

272
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,808
- What? No, it's not.
- Yes. Trust me, I've been through this too.

273
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:49,744
That's one of the reasons
I separated from Claire.

274
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,646
Love always changes over time.

275
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,415
It's either growing or dying,
there's no in between.

276
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,218
But you know what I learned
since I got back together with her?

277
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,421
You get a say in that!

278
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,528
Love isn't always about not
being able to live without someone.

279
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:12,000
Sometimes it's choosing not to live
without them, even when you can.

280
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,703
Huh, that almost sounds wise.

281
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:19,841
You like the second part? A Jehovah's
Witness said it to me over the weekend.

282
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:23,611
Same guy tried to get me to
invite him inside for three years.

283
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,014
<i>Este cabron</i> never gives up.

284
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,448
Damn.
All right, so now we gotta go.

285
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,460
All right, let's go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

286
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,295
- What are you doing?
- Up, up, up. Put your shoes on.

287
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,123
Shoes on. You gotta
go home, get the binder,

288
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,992
mail it before the post office
closes.

289
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,028
- Jorge?
- Yes.

290
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:44,498
Cassy, can you give Dom
a candy cane for the road?

291
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,869
- I don't want a candy cane.
- Okay, um, the fire's moved west,

292
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:51,506
so they just closed down the five in both
directions, so there's no way to get south.

293
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,510
So all your
appointments are canceled.

294
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:58,746
Hey, can you check if the
fire's near Rowley and Balboa?

295
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,423
There's a house there
that Claire and I were...

296
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,651
Oh, God. It's too late.
What have I done?

297
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,320
Excuse me.

298
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,924
Can I see a doctor, please?

299
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,326
I've been walking and I think
I breathed in smoke.

300
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,294
I can't stop coughing.

301
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,365
Oh, this is an accounting office,
ma'am, there's no doctor here.

302
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,603
I don't understand,
it says Health Clinic outside.

303
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,872
No, it says Accounting Clinic,
ma'am.

304
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:28,375
As in financial health
if you need a money doctor.

305
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,745
Otherwise,
you need a real doctor.

306
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,047
I got sick last year,
and now I got pneumonia,

307
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,716
- and I've just got very...
- Cassy.

308
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,751
It's over.

309
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,219
I can't return the binder now
even if I wanted to.

310
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,632
The deal's gonna fall through
after everything we worked for,

311
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,891
and now Lisa's
definitely gonna divorce me.

312
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

313
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,863
Listen to me, buddy.
It's not too late, okay?

314
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:52,466
Yes, it is. The highway's
closed. The post office will close.

315
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,936
You know I started this company
before we were married.

316
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,238
- It was just me and a computer.
- I know. I know.

317
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,775
I need to prepare
my divorce options, Jorge.

318
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,410
Let me at least keep my company.
Let me talk to Rudoy.

319
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,312
- No, no, no...
- Let me talk to her!

320
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,248
Ay!

321
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,593
<i>Puta madre!</i>

322
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,762
Okay, you know what?

323
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,630
Fine.

324
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm gonna call her right now
and she's gonna calm you down.

325
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,635
- Okay?
- What the hell was that?

326
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,071
- Did you see that?
- Ah, it's just cramps.

327
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,238
It happens.

328
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,341
Here.

329
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,180
Take one, too, it's gonna calm
your nerves.

330
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,918
Anyways, she's seen it all.

331
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,353
She knows what a real
failed marriage looks like

332
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,924
and she's gonna tell you it's all
your nerves because this is what it is.

333
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:53,661
It's all nerves. I mean,
your company being bought.

334
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:57,364
You know, Lisa going away
on a trip, these goddamn fires.

335
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,768
Ashes everywhere. I mean,
how can you not be anxious?

336
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,209
<i>You have reached Melanie Rudoy.</i>

337
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:13,147
<i>Leave a message or I will
never, ever return your call.</i>

338
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:16,050
Hey, Mel, it's Jorge. Can you
call me back at the office please?

339
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:19,020
It's important, okay? Bye.

340
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,889
Jorge, are you sure those pills
are safe to mix?

341
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:25,660
- Look at me, I'm sweating.
- It's fine, it's just the stress.

342
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:26,861
Here.

343
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,229
I'm sweating too.

344
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,838
Hello?

345
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:40,407
<i>Jorge, hello. Hey, I got 15
minutes before my next meeting,</i>

346
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,009
<i>just so you know.</i>

347
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,078
Yeah, that's no problem,
uh, I'll be quick.

348
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,880
Listen, I got you
on the speaker phone

349
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:49,150
with my buddy, Dominic,
and he's a little worried,

350
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:52,019
you know, about his wife
and, you know, I mean

351
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,522
how she's going away
on a business trip without him.

352
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,692
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- So it's all nerves, you know?

353
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,494
But I think that it will
make him feel better

354
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,363
if someone with your expertise
can give him some perspective

355
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,033
because you know
when there's real trouble.

356
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,268
<i>Of course, of course.
He's there right now?</i>

357
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,738
Yeah, he can hear you,
go ahead, Dom.

358
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,574
- Hi, this is Dominic.
<i>- Hello, Dominic.</i>

359
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,275
<i>This is Melanie Rudoy.</i>

360
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,212
<i>You can call me Mel
or Rudoy, but not easy.</i>

361
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:22,449
<i>So you are worried
your wife is going</i>

362
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,686
<i>to cheat on you during this
business trip, is that correct?</i>

363
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,924
Well, the thing is I saw
a look between...

364
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,126
Forget the fucking look!

365
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,930
Look, long story short,
he and his wife are selling

366
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,699
their real estate company
to a bigger one in London,

367
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:42,136
so she's flying there to close
the deal,

368
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,373
but he thinks that she's gonna be
leaving him for a guy at the London office

369
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,376
because they don't say "I love
you" on the phone anymore.

370
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,913
And she hasn't bought
her return ticket yet.

371
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:56,117
- Well, it's a little more...
<i>- You don't say "I love you" on the phone to each other?</i>

372
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,085
Not for a while now.

373
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,087
Because we work together

374
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,123
and when we started
getting more business...

375
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:05,226
<i>Well, you know, that happens
to couples sometimes.</i>

376
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:08,896
<i>You just get busy and you start
to overlook little things like that.</i>

377
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,266
<i>I don't think it means your
relationship is dead or anything.</i>

378
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,912
<i>You should just try saying it to
her next time you talk on the phone</i>

379
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,138
<i>and maybe she'll start
saying it again.</i>

380
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,274
That's exactly what I told him.
See, didn't I tell you that?

381
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:25,513
<i>Also, people buy one-way tickets
all the time for this type of things.</i>

382
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,783
<i>Let me ask you, though, why
aren't you going with your wife?</i>

383
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,852
<i>- What is her name?</i>
- Lisa.

384
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,988
<i>Okay, Lisa. Why aren't you
going with Lisa to do this deal</i>

385
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,157
<i>if you don't like that
she's traveling by herself?</i>

386
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,259
I can't, I don't do well
on planes.

387
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,695
<i>- Why? You get sick or something?</i>
- No, I just...

388
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,495
It's just a phobia, you know?

389
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,333
I mean, I know a guy
who's afraid of hot dogs

390
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,069
because they look very much
like penises to him.

391
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,771
<i>Oh, so like a homophobia, huh?</i>

392
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:54,342
No, I'm not homophobic.
It's just planes. Uh...

393
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,545
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

394
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,981
<i>So basically,
you don't trust Lisa?</i>

395
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,817
Well, it's not that I don't
trust her, it's just, I feel like a...

396
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,152
It's just,
this is what I'm telling him,

397
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,955
Mel, it's all feelings, nerves.

398
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,225
She hasn't actually done
anything to be suspicious,

399
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,894
it's all in his head.

400
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,529
<i>Look, it's not about
her doing something.</i>

401
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,666
<i>She's cheating or not cheating,
if he's not sure,</i>

402
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,035
<i>that's a problem that you
can't just think away.</i>

403
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,704
<i>He has to be sure.
Simple.</i>

404
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:27,208
<i>- So when is her trip?</i>
- Oh, she's already at the airport.

405
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,644
<i>Okay.
And you dropped her off?</i>

406
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:32,213
- I didn't.
<i>- Why not?</i>

407
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,582
Oh, I mean I offered,

408
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:37,919
but she just said
she would just take a cab.

409
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,654
<i>Well, that's suspicious.</i>

410
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,255
- It is?
- What do you mean?

411
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,924
What's suspicious about that,
Mel?

412
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,059
It's so he could be
at the office.

413
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,762
<i>Hey, look, you called me.</i>

414
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:50,231
<i>I drive my husband to the
airport and he drives me.</i>

415
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,533
<i>I would be suspicious
if he refused.</i>

416
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,602
<i>Sometimes people don't want
to be driven</i>

417
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,671
<i>because they don't want
their spouses to find out</i>

418
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:59,439
<i>they're meeting someone else
or going somewhere else</i>

419
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,776
<i>they don't say they're going.
Things like that.</i>

420
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,511
- You think so?
- Oh, hold on.

421
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,713
Let's not jump in
to any conclusions here.

422
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,682
<i>No, we don't jump to anything.</i>

423
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,583
<i>We just make sure, simple.</i>

424
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,953
<i>I have to go,
but I'll give you the number</i>

425
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,888
<i>of someone that can make sure
for you.</i>

426
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:16,891
<i>He's retired now, but he was
a great PI back in the day</i>

427
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,259
<i>when I worked with him.</i>

428
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,027
<i>Just tell him I sent you his way</i>

429
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:22,196
<i>and he will give you
a good rate, okay?</i>

430
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:25,066
<i>- You have a pen?</i>
- Wait, you mean go to the airport?

431
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,235
Hold on, I don't know
if that's really necessary.

432
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,306
<i>I decide when it's time
for him to come in.</i>

433
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,276
<i>Look, Jorge, I'll text the
number to you, I have a client.</i>

434
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,446
- Wait, wait, Mel...
<i>- Also, Dominic, don't use your cell phone to call him.</i>

435
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,415
<i>We don't want Lisa to see
the call on the phone bill, okay?</i>

436
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:42,750
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- Okay.

437
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,628
Great, now we have
the phone number

438
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:57,765
of a guy we can send over
to spy Lisa at the airport.

439
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,333
Fucking unbelievable.

440
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:04,138
- We have to do it.
- Are you fucking kidding me, Dom?

441
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,273
I mean, hiring a guy to spy
on your wife

442
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:09,310
is something you do
if you find, like, love letters

443
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:12,947
or, uh, credit cards in a motel
you've never been to.

444
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,418
Not because fucking
silly dreams about flying

445
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,855
- or being Jamaican or whatever.
- It's not just the dreams.

446
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,157
- It was a fucking look!
- Okay, don't yell at me!

447
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,826
I'm trying to help you out.

448
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,796
- You don't even know how much this guy costs.
- I know.

449
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,766
Look, maybe I'm having
a mid-life crisis.

450
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,602
Maybe it's just stress
and it's all in my mind.

451
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,438
But Melanie's right,
it's not gonna go away

452
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,140
if I just stop thinking
about it.

453
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:41,876
The simplest thing
is to do is to find out.

454
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:44,011
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

455
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,670
Make sure you ask how
much he charges first, okay?

456
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,547
<i>Hey-lo!</i>

457
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,848
Hi, is this, uh...

458
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,650
I'm sorry, we didn't get
your name.

459
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:24,685
I'm Jorge and this is Dominic.
Um...

460
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:28,189
We're friends of Mel Rudoy.
She gave us your phone number.

461
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,392
<i>Aw, Mel? Definitely had some
exciting times working with her.</i>

462
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:36,063
<i>Well, you got the right number. I'm Charlie,
my friends call me Chuck, or Chucky,</i>

463
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:38,365
<i>or Chuck-a-latte.</i>

464
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,569
<i>Nah, I'm just joking.</i>

465
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,070
<i>So, uh, hey, how can I help
you gentlemen?</i>

466
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,339
Well, it's kind of
a time sensitive matter.

467
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:49,677
<i>- Hold on, how time sensitive?</i>
- Uh...

468
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,379
Can you get to Burbank Airport
in like 30 minutes or so?

469
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:55,282
<i>Oh, extremely fucking time
sensitive. Okay, I'll tell you what.</i>

470
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,451
<i>I'm gonna grab some stuff,
get in the car,</i>

471
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,564
<i>I'm gonna call you back
as soon as I get on the road,</i>

472
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:02,289
<i>and you guys can shoot
all the details onto me.</i>

473
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,059
- Okay, sure.
<i>- All right, Jorge, you said, right?</i>

474
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,760
And Dom. Dominic, Dom.

475
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:09,096
<i>All right, Dominic or Dom,
talk soon.</i>

476
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:13,067
Okay, we're doing it.

477
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,269
You didn't even ask
how much he charges.

478
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:18,239
It will be a good rate,
you heard Mel.

479
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:21,642
Fine. Fine. Fine. If that
makes you feel better, then hey.

480
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,546
You know what?
I do feel better.

481
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,047
I think maybe I just needed
to do something about it.

482
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,450
- You know?
- Hey, speaking of doing something,

483
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,085
you better call somebody
right now

484
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,420
- and get the binder from your place.
- Oh, shit.

485
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,723
Wait, shouldn't we wait
for Charlie?

486
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:38,893
I mean, I'm not saying he's
gonna find anything, but...

487
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,895
We'll wait actually for him
to mail it,

488
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,097
but at least have it ready.

489
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,966
Right. I think I know.

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,236
What are you doing?
You cannot use your phone.

491
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,938
- Why not?
- You heard Mel.

492
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,174
What about if Lisa asks you
if she sees the phone number

493
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,910
- on the phone bill?
- I'm calling my cousin.

494
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,646
What's it matter if she sees
that number?

495
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,347
I don't know, Dom.
What about if she ask about it?

496
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:03,184
You couldn't call her because
you were meeting a client,

497
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,252
but you calling your cousin
instead?

498
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:07,656
I don't know, Dom,
it's... it's up to you.

499
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:22,136
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Frances. Hey, it's Dom.

500
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,271
<i>Dom? Where are you
calling from?</i>

501
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:26,340
<i>- I don't have this number.</i>
- It's an office line.

502
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,843
Hey, you're not busy, are you?
I need kind of a big favor.

503
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:34,683
<i>- Depends on what the favor is.</i>
- Okay, so Lisa left a binder at home

504
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,685
that contains very important
documents

505
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,886
that I need you fetch
and possibly mail.

506
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,422
<i>- Right now?</i>
- Yes, before the post office closes.

507
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:43,958
It needs to get to London
before a meeting.

508
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:46,360
<i>I can't, I'm going out tonight.</i>

509
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,062
<i>Your place is 40 minutes
from me.</i>

510
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,831
<i>W-Why can't you do it yourself?
Where... Where are you?</i>

511
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,701
It's not 40 to my place,
it's 15 max.

512
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,369
<i>Yeah, it is, with rush hour
and all the fires around town,</i>

513
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,171
<i>it's 40 minimum, mate.</i>

514
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,840
<i>What about Rita, who gets
paid to do work for ya?</i>

515
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:02,843
I can't. Look, you're the only
person I can trust with this right now.

516
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,411
Everyone else is gone
for the holidays.

517
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:07,248
<i>Exactly, Dom, it's the holidays.</i>

518
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:11,218
<i>Once a year, I get to go
to parties I actually enjoy.</i>

519
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,688
<i>You know I love ya, but I'm
not missing it for your wife.</i>

520
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:15,756
- This isn't just Lisa...
<i>- I don't understand...</i>

521
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,592
It might be Charlie
on the other line.

522
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:19,436
<i>...she's actually getting paid
to do this kind of shit...</i>

523
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,128
Sorry, let me call you
right back.

524
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:26,433
- Hello?
- -<i>Claire says to make sure you're drinking water.</i>

525
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,270
<i>And are you expecting
a call from a Chuckzilla?</i>

526
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,972
Uh, yes and yes.
Put him through.

527
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:36,777
- <i>Uh, yeah, Dom?</i>
- Yes, and Jorge.

528
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,114
- That was Jorge, this is Dom.
<i>- All right, Dom and Jorge.</i>

529
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:43,618
<i>Listen, I should be there in
less than 15. Lay it all over me.</i>

530
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:48,455
I need to find out
if my wife is... I don't...

531
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:51,626
If she's even there, I guess. I
didn't drive her to the airport.

532
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,460
<i>Wait, is she supposed
to be getting there</i>

533
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,396
<i>or is she already inside
the gate?</i>

534
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,742
Inside the gate. She likes to
be at the boarding door early.

535
00:29:57,766 --> 00:30:00,901
<i>Okay, I'll have to buy a
ticket. Which flight is it?</i>

536
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,136
Uh, one second.

537
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:08,275
KKO, flight 226.

538
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,745
Stops over in San Francisco
before London.

539
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,247
- You can return it, right?
<i>- I don't know, I'm just gonna get</i>

540
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,617
<i>the cheapest thing I can
get just to get in the gate.</i>

541
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,728
- <i>Unless you want me to board the plane?</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

542
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,621
You don't need to board
the plane.

543
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,288
He doesn't need
to board that plane.

544
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,657
Yeah, you don't have to board.

545
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,659
Just find out
if she's actually there,

546
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,960
or with anyone,
or anything like that.

547
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,663
<i>Okay, send me a text
with her photo</i>

548
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:30,264
<i>and a description
of her clothing.</i>

549
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:32,232
<i>I'm gonna hang up
and buy a ticket right now</i>

550
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,068
<i>so I can beeline
through security.</i>

551
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,749
- Give me his number.
- What are you doing?

552
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,140
I'm sending him a picture
of Lisa.

553
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,109
What?
You cannot use your phone.

554
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,020
Well, I can't send a picture
through this fucking thing.

555
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,180
Yeah, well, you can email it,
right?

556
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,415
- Do you have his email?
- No.

557
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,484
Then give me his fucking
number! It's one text!

558
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,028
I'm not the one being
suspected of cheating here.

559
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:55,557
I'm just thinking ahead, okay?
Here.

560
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:03,030
You know, if Lisa isn't cheating,
then spying on her like this

561
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,699
is as bad as cheating yourself.

562
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,768
You know?
- No, it isn't.

563
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,436
I'd be flattered if I found out
Lisa was stalking me,

564
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,606
or at least paying someone to.

565
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,007
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the problem with suspicion

566
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,511
is that the moment you act
on them,

567
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,979
doesn't matter
what the outcome is,

568
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:20,849
trust is already damaged,

569
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,250
the relationship is
just no longer the same.

570
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,957
- Hey, your cousin.
- Right.

571
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,834
<i>Dom, I told ya,
I'm sorry, but I just...</i>

572
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,170
- Wait, let me claim this favor coupon.
<i>- A what coupon?</i>

573
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,472
The favor coupon you gave me
when I saw you in London

574
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,040
for one favor.
I have it right here.

575
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,076
<i>What the hell are you...?</i>

576
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:53,380
<i>Oh, my God, you mean
the "forgive me" coupon?</i>

577
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:58,986
- Huh.
<i>- Bloody hell, I gave that to you when I was like six.</i>

578
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,156
<i>- Why do you still have it?</i>
- I don't know, I get sentimental

579
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,025
about stuff I have
in my wallet for a long time.

580
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,361
- Anyway, I'm cashing it in, so...
<i>- First off,</i>

581
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,731
<i>if I didn't emphasize it
enough the first time,</i>

582
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,099
<i>I gave that to you
when I was six.</i>

583
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,602
<i>Second, even if I chose
to honor that thing,</i>

584
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,905
<i>it's a "forgive me" coupon.</i>

585
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,908
<i>So I'll forgive you for
attempting something so stupid.</i>

586
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,843
Yeah, I'll give you one
in return.

587
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,344
You can use it for any favor
you want.

588
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:26,480
Frances, please,
I'm begging you!

589
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:33,020
- Hello?
<i>- I want five favor coupons.</i>

590
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,154
Five?

591
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:39,259
<i>- Is that a yes or a no?</i>
- All right, yes.

592
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:43,565
<i>Fuck's sake, fine, I'll give you
a call when I get to your place.</i>

593
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:44,933
Yes.

594
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,569
Thank you.

595
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,904
<i>You owe me so much after this.</i>

596
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:51,405
<i>I'm going to miss
a Christmas raffle</i>

597
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:53,207
<i>with actual good prizes
this year.</i>

598
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,375
Come on, you never win those.

599
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,211
At least I saved you
wasting your money on it.

600
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:59,614
<i>I've already bought
the bloody ticket!</i>

601
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:02,316
<i>You know what?
I want 10 favor coupons.</i>

602
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,552
- Wait, we already agreed!
<i>- Ten!</i>

603
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:07,622
Oh, fuck.

604
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,159
God fucking damn it!

605
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,028
- What the... fuck did you give me?!
- Calm down!

606
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:19,934
- Calm down! Hey!
- Why do you have so many pills?!

607
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:22,269
Calm the hell down!
Calm... calm down!

608
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:25,573
Calm down!

609
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,981
What the fuck is wrong with you?

610
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,147
Jorge?

611
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:39,521
Jorge, what the fuck?!

612
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:42,456
Is that the drugs?
Is that gonna happen to me?

613
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:45,827
It's nothing, trust me,
it's just stress.

614
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:54,836
Hey, it's Mel.

615
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:11,619
- <i>I just called your cell.
</i>- Call my office number, not my cell.

616
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,522
<i>Why not?
Is Claire going to be jealous?</i>

617
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,390
No, she trusts me completely,
okay?

618
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,493
Those calls goes through Cassy,
that's how we do things.

619
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:22,229
<i>Okay, okay, I'm just
clutching your balls.</i>

620
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:25,633
<i>Did you call Charlie?
Is Dom still there with you?</i>

621
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,768
Dom?

622
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:32,372
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Dom, did you call Charlie?</i>

623
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,745
Yeah, he's on his way
to the airport right now.

624
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,346
<i>Good.</i>

625
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,883
Hey, how much does
this guy charge anyway?

626
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,319
<i>Depends on the job, but he'll
give you a good rate, don't worry.</i>

627
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,655
What the hell is a good rate?

628
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:50,324
I mean, we didn't even sign
any forms before he took it on.

629
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:54,062
<i>- Jorge, it'll be fine.</i>
- Okay, I'm just saying, I know he's your guy and all,

630
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,430
but we're not paying
if it's unreasonable.

631
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,666
<i>Eh, come on,
it'll be reasonable.</i>

632
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,101
<i>Just don't jilt him,
he's going to end up hiring me</i>

633
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:04,505
<i>to sue you both.</i>

634
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,407
<i>I'm kidding, I only do divorces.</i>

635
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:09,777
<i>- Let me know how it goes.</i>
- Okay.

636
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,277
Are you sure
you don't want half of this?

637
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:48,181
Claire makes the best
corned beef sandwiches.

638
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,790
Hey, you trust her right?

639
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:57,257
Mel?

640
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,459
She knows what she's talking
about.

641
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,995
She's a character, though.

642
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,665
Hey, you'll never guess
how I met her.

643
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:09,403
- Well, guess.
- I don't fucking know. On a cruise?

644
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:14,142
At the BDSM club.

645
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,578
You mean like whips and people
having sex all tied up?

646
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,322
No, no, no, no, no.
They were not having sex.

647
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,783
It's just the theme of the club,
you know?

648
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,417
Like costumed dancing.

649
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,556
There were some people
having sex there too.

650
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:32,560
- She's into that, huh?
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

651
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:36,631
- What were you doing there?
- Claire.

652
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:40,001
- I told you, a completely different woman.
- What happened?

653
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:43,037
I mean, you said she's
like a witch or something?

654
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:46,440
Well, I think deep down
inside there is magic in all of us.

655
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:50,310
You know, maybe we are like
witches to some extent.

656
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:52,146
But you know what I think?

657
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,982
I think that you and Lisa
just need something new

658
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:57,151
in your relationship.

659
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:59,219
You ever talk about having kids?

660
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,389
We've had the kids talk already.

661
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,491
Okay, well if you're not
having kids,

662
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:08,029
then you should spice
things up in the bedroom.

663
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:10,198
You know? Ah, here.

664
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,802
This is the place.

665
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:18,371
I promise you it's fucking
fantastic.

666
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,976
I don't know,
Lisa's not like that.

667
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,678
Like what? Into sex?

668
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:26,748
- You're always telling me she's a smart one.
- So?

669
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,249
So it's very well documented
that the more intelligent

670
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:32,553
the person is,
the more pervert they are.

671
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:34,421
Huh, yeah!

672
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:35,990
Bill Gates?

673
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,759
The biggest pervert.

674
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,927
- I know it.
- What?

675
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,329
I mean, just look at Japan.

676
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:45,499
One of the most advanced
nations in the world,

677
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,903
so far ahead of United States
in terms of technology

678
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,072
and societal efficiency.

679
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,576
Have you seen a Japanese porn?

680
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,079
I mean, I've...

681
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,715
It's crazy.

682
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:03,050
Things you'll never dream of.

683
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:06,187
Oh, my God, okay, they have one

684
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,857
where they have
this scientist there, right?

685
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:15,395
And he builds this device
to stop time

686
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:20,367
so he can use it
at a superhero yoga class.

687
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,172
So...

688
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:30,812
Are you kidding me?
Superhero yoga class?

689
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:33,080
Oh, my.

690
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:37,151
America have no imagination
in comparison.

691
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,588
For you guys, it's all like penis
and vagina, penis and vagina.

692
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,591
Oh, I mean, I can't even get
a hard-on

693
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,793
seeing a vagina anymore.

694
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:49,063
For me, it's just like, oh,
looking at someone's armpit.

695
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:58,906
- Hello?
- -<i>I have Chuck-E-Cheeses on the line.</i>

696
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,176
- Ah?
<i>- That Kentucky guy that called earlier.</i>

697
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,581
Oh, is he really from Kentucky?

698
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,083
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Yes, put him through.

699
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,586
- <i>Hey, Dom and Jorge.</i>
- Charlie, did you find her?

700
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,922
<i>Based on the photos
you sent me, I'm 95% sure</i>

701
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:18,159
<i>that I'm eyeballing her
right now.</i>

702
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,661
Okay, so she definitely
wasn't lying about the flight.

703
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:23,598
<i>Yeah, she's sitting next
to a guy in a suit right now.</i>

704
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:29,469
- Is he Hispanic?!
<i>- Not sure, could be Chicano, but I ain't racist,</i>

705
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,138
<i>so I can't really say.</i>

706
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,040
Send us a picture!

707
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,156
Soto Health, this is Ca...

708
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:24,558
I swear to God, Andrew,
it's over.

709
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,594
I hope this brush fire
moves in your direction

710
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:29,096
and burns down only your house
with you inside.

711
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,571
Afternoon, miss.

712
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,878
Are you here on a real
official police business

713
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:46,347
or is this just an excuse
to see me?

714
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,818
Real police business, but, um, when
are you gonna let me take you out?

715
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,891
How tall are you?

716
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,962
Hold on one second.
Hold on one second.

717
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,030
Are you sure this is him?

718
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,666
I don't care! Get on the
fucking plane, Charlie!

719
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,535
<i>Okay, listen...</i>

720
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,804
One sec. Yes?

721
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,273
Sorry to interrupt, the
police just came by to tell us

722
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,742
they're doing voluntary
evacuations in this area.

723
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,277
Nah, that's just for old people.

724
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,778
Tell us if it becomes mandatory.

725
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:20,815
Okay, will do.
Have you been drinking water?

726
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:32,126
All right, Charlie, so walk us
through what to expect here.

727
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,494
You said you had a plan
for this exact scenario?

728
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,497
<i>Yeah, listen, I don't have a lot of
time to get a ticket for this flight.</i>

729
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:40,801
<i>Call Melanie and tell her
we're doing Hoolagarification.</i>

730
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:44,972
- What?
<i>- Hoolagarification on a plane. She'll explain everything.</i>

731
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,341
<i>Just sit tight
and if everything goes to plan,</i>

732
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,611
<i>this whole thing will be in the
bag once we land in San Francisc...</i>

733
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,182
- What's Melanie's number?
- Hoola-what?

734
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:57,651
- Jorge, what's her number?
- I'll dial it.

735
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:58,753
Calm down.

736
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,764
<i>You have reached Melanie Rudoy.</i>

737
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:13,534
<i>Leave a message or I will
never, ever return your call.</i>

738
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,504
It's Dom, from Jorge's office.

739
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:19,440
Hoola...
Hoolagalination.

740
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:21,175
- On a plane.
- On a plane.

741
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:24,645
God damn it!

742
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,380
Dom, as your only friend...

743
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:28,215
I trusted her!

744
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,317
She was the one pushing
for this deal, you know?

745
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:32,329
That's why I let her take
a lead in this whole affair,

746
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:33,821
and now she's having an affair!

747
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:35,156
Relax.

748
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,791
You heard Charlie.

749
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:39,126
He and Melanie
have a Hoolagalant plan

750
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,494
that's gonna make things right.

751
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,363
Just, you have to be patient.

752
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,999
Hey, here, here.
Have some of my sandwich.

753
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:47,001
- It has Vicodin in it.
- No, Jorge!

754
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,836
I'm tired of your unbridled,
optimistic,

755
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,005
"everything's gonna be okay"
bullshit!

756
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:54,041
- Everything's not gonna be okay!
- Well, keep yelling at me

757
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:56,477
because it's gonna solve
everything.

758
00:42:56,511 --> 00:43:00,314
My God, look what she's doing
to me.

759
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,350
My heart's beating
outta my chest. It hurts.

760
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,520
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

761
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:07,321
That's just the uppers.

762
00:43:07,354 --> 00:43:09,757
What?
You said it wasn't the pills!

763
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:13,027
It's not pills. I mean...

764
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:18,466
Look at all that smoke
in the distance.

765
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,103
We're probably breathing it
and we don't even know it.

766
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:24,839
Why isn't she calling back?

767
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:27,542
Hey, relax, it's been only
two minutes.

768
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,710
You act like we've been waiting
forever.

769
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:33,347
No, there's no such thing
as forever.

770
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,928
Wait, that window doesn't
open! No, no, no, no, no, no!

771
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,955
Get the fuck back!
I'll smash through it!

772
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:44,258
- Don't do that.
- You said it yourself, Jorge! I have a choice in all this.

773
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,595
And if I'm gonna lose
everything, it'll be on my terms!

774
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:49,531
- But you have to live!
- There's nothing to live for!

775
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:52,733
Yes, you have to live for a
chance to fight for what you love.

776
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,945
I mean, if you really love
Lisa, you're not gonna give up

777
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:57,204
on her no matter what.

778
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:59,707
Also, you promised me
you will get me a good deal

779
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,276
on the Rowley house
for a long time now.

780
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,078
Are you really gonna
jump out of that window

781
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:06,881
and break that promise after
everything I've done for you?

782
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:16,724
You know what?

783
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,392
Let me show you something.

784
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,939
I wasn't gonna tell anybody
about this,

785
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:33,575
but I think this is
the only thing

786
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:35,476
that's gonna de-stress you
right now.

787
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:43,017
Now I gotta tell you,
it might seem scary at first,

788
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,086
and I don't really know
how it works,

789
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,257
but this is some sort of like
hallucinogenic smoke or something.

790
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,936
But I've done it a bunch
of times with Claire

791
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,065
and it's completely safe,
so don't freak out.

792
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,833
Okay?

793
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,932
Don't worry.

794
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:34,268
It's... it's completely safe.

795
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:38,239
That's what he thinks.

796
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:48,583
Don't act like
you don't want it.

797
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:56,490
This little guy never lies.

798
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,837
What the fuck?

799
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:48,268
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

800
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:53,173
So you can just go right now.

801
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,876
Go, okay? I don't know.
Why are you even here?

802
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,978
I said I don't wanna talk
to you anymore!

803
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:00,648
- Can you just go?
- Yeah, go away.

804
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:02,883
Yeah, what are you saying?
Go away.

805
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:05,886
- I just wanna talk.
- No, Andrew leave before I call the cops.

806
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:08,031
- I just wanna talk.
- Hey, they asked you to leave, man.

807
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,923
Yeah, you gotta go.
You gotta go.

808
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,992
- Why can't we just talk?
- No.

809
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,927
You have to leave, right? Hey!

810
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:18,198
- Hey!
- Asshole!

811
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,802
- You wanna get arrested?
- Yeah, circus asshole.

812
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,642
Fine, I'm going.

813
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:33,280
Hey, what the...

814
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:37,484
Ew!

815
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:47,327
God!

816
00:48:52,734 --> 00:48:54,803
You son of a bitch!

817
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:08,949
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

818
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,053
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

819
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:15,055
So that was the ex-boyfriend?

820
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:17,424
Strong emphasis on the ex.

821
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:20,260
What happened to you?

822
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,897
Oh, I spilled some...

823
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:26,801
Jorge had this antique
whatever it was, it had some oil...

824
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,736
I have an extra shirt
if you want?

825
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,947
I was gonna spend the night
at my girlfriend's place tonight.

826
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,807
- Oh, no, that's okay.
- No, it's fine.

827
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,742
It's just a pajama shirt,
so it's oversized.

828
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:35,976
It should fit.

829
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,814
You can just give it back
whenever.

830
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:49,891
Thanks.

831
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:57,297
Jorge, I'm so sorry.

832
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,099
I never thought he'd show up
like that.

833
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:01,769
I swear, I'm gonna file
a restraining order on him.

834
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:03,437
Yeah, don't worry about it.

835
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,073
Okay? Hey, listen.

836
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,087
Orange chicken, and add
whatever you want there.

837
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,599
Hey, don't forget to lock
the front door

838
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:24,291
in case that comes back.

839
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:25,560
- Got it.
- Okay.

840
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,263
Any special requests?

841
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,966
For food?

842
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,935
Oh, not a picky eater.

843
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,369
Okay, cool.

844
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:40,608
By the way, I'm going out to
drinks with my friend tonight.

845
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,342
You two should meet.

846
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,712
I have a sixth sense
about that stuff.

847
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:46,289
I mean, it's not like
you can go home anyway,

848
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,448
the highway will probably still
be closed.

849
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:51,786
Well, you have a point there.

850
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,721
I guess I don't have a reason
not to.

851
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:55,523
Great, I'll see you later then.

852
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:14,876
You need to tell me what the fuck that
thing is and what just happened because...

853
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,745
I know, I know,
it's scary at first,

854
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:19,881
but trust me, it's the best
stress reliever.

855
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,716
How the fuck is that
a stress reliever?

856
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:23,851
Ah, you're telling me
it didn't get you off?

857
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:26,253
No, it didn't get me off,
you sick fuck.

858
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:29,557
Wow, I stopped you from
jumping out of that window.

859
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:32,359
- Oh, I'm sorry you had a bad trip.
- That wasn't a trip, Jorge.

860
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,996
That was some demonic shit!
Look at my goddamn neck!

861
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:40,267
- Ha, those are tension marks.
- I'm not tense, I was fucking choked.

862
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,103
Where'd you get that? Did
Claire give it to you? Did she?

863
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:44,939
- So what?
- So you said she does witchcraft,

864
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:46,373
that makes her a fucking witch.

865
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:47,909
Does she worship the devil too?

866
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:50,678
- Oh, my God, am I possessed?
- You know what?

867
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:53,081
I let you attack me because
you're under a lot of stress,

868
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:56,450
but I draw a line here
at insulting my wife.

869
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,251
If that's what you're gonna
be doing...

870
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:08,930
- No, we gotta destroy this.
- -Get off me, you fucking crazy bastard.

871
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:11,899
Get off! Get off!

872
00:52:14,636 --> 00:52:17,204
Get off me!

873
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:19,741
Pick up the goddamn phone,
it might be Mel.

874
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:23,143
You pick it up, it's your phone.

875
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:28,315
You idiot, you're gonna
mess up the Hooligan plan.

876
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:38,893
Ow!

877
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,930
Shit, it's Frances. Hello?
Are you at my place?

878
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:46,166
- Don't use your phone.
- Fuck, let me call you right back.

879
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:53,107
<i>Why aren't you using your cell?</i>

880
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,910
It's... I'll tell you later.
But the house key...

881
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:58,646
<i>Yeah, I know, I'm already
inside. Some advice, though, yeah,</i>

882
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,482
<i>if you keep your spare key under a fake
stone, maybe put some real stones around it.</i>

883
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:05,185
Right, okay. Look, the documents
are in my laundry basket.

884
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:07,155
You'll see it, it's right by
the bed.

885
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,859
You meant on top
or in the basket?

886
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:13,493
Like in...

887
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,963
- Underneath the clothes.
<i>- Oh, gross.</i>

888
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,431
<i>Should I even ask at this point?</i>

889
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:19,000
It's kind of complicated
right now.

890
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,969
Anyway, uh, the envelope's
in my desk. Um...

891
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:24,539
Address is on the header
of the document, Pert London.

892
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:26,541
<i>Right, okay.
I'll go and mail this now.</i>

893
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:28,776
<i>You want the fastest service
they have, right?</i>

894
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,179
Yeah, but here's the thing.
Uh...

895
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,182
I kind of need you to wait
for a bit until I call you to mail it

896
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,450
because I'm waiting on a call.

897
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,853
<i>- Well, how long is that?</i>
- Like...

898
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,390
- Maybe an hour?
<i>- An hour?</i>

899
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:45,793
Less than that.
Maybe 45 minutes.

900
00:53:45,827 --> 00:53:47,695
<i>Ugh, you want me to sit here
on my arse</i>

901
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:49,731
<i>for 45 minutes waiting
for a phone call?</i>

902
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,398
<i>Are you taking the piss?</i>

903
00:53:51,431 --> 00:53:53,134
I know, I know how it sounds.

904
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,303
But look, order some food,
order a movie,

905
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:58,472
do whatever you want there,
it's on me.

906
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:01,175
<i>Oh, yeah, whatever I want?
Well, I'll swipe someone on Tinder</i>

907
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:03,211
<i>and bugger a guy in your bed,
then, eh?</i>

908
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:06,814
I would rather you didn't,
but if that's what you want.

909
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:10,417
<i>Fucking hell, Dom, this
is mental, you know that?</i>

910
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,087
I know, but if there were
a time that I desperately needed

911
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:15,189
to use my family card, it's now.

912
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:18,760
So please do not mail it
until I call you to.

913
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,964
<i>All right, then, call me.</i>

914
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:25,398
Thank you.

915
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:33,306
Give me some of that.

916
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:44,185
I always wanted to ask,
why the hell do you call

917
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:47,354
your office Soto Health
Accounting Clinic?

918
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,923
Makes no sense.

919
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:51,391
For the search results
of course.

920
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:55,530
I am the number one Soto
business search result for this area.

921
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:56,864
And you know why?

922
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:03,037
Because "health clinic" is
such a popular search term,

923
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:06,607
so everybody's clicking
on my website.

924
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:47,480
- What the fuck?
- Dom?

925
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:50,685
- Dom!
<i>- Dom, I got your message.</i>

926
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:53,921
<i>- What did Charlie tell you exactly?</i>
- He didn't tell us anything.

927
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:56,691
What the hell
is a Hoolagalifinakis?

928
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:59,861
<i>Well, Hoolagarification
was a battle plan</i>

929
00:55:59,894 --> 00:56:02,630
<i>Charlie and I used back in
the day to get the best deal</i>

930
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,299
<i>in a divorce by having Charlie
stake out on a trip</i>

931
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,500
<i>to record a cheating spouse
with their lover</i>

932
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:10,605
<i>and then serving the divorce
papers right on the trip</i>

933
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,707
<i>before they had any chance
to cover it up.</i>

934
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,544
<i>Like on a cruise, a plane,
or an airport, things like that.</i>

935
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:19,280
<i>Don't ask me about the name,
Charlie came up with it.</i>

936
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:21,616
Okay, so Charlie gets
all the evidence on the plane

937
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:23,651
and serves the papers
at the airport?

938
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,330
Then that gives me more say in
what happens with the company, right?

939
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:29,824
<i>Well, no, because this plan
doesn't work anymore.</i>

940
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:32,492
What do you mean it doesn't
work? You said you did it before.

941
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:34,896
<i>Yes, but that was
a long time ago.</i>

942
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:39,233
<i>I don't think Charlie realizes how
much laws have changed since he retired.</i>

943
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:42,803
<i>Now it's all no-fault divorce,
which means infidelity</i>

944
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:45,239
<i>really has no impact
in divorce proceedings</i>

945
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:48,376
<i>unless you specifically
signed a prenuptial agreement</i>

946
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:49,977
<i>with an infidelity clause.</i>

947
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:51,712
<i>Do you have a prenup?</i>

948
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,814
- No, but...
- Can't he sue them or something?

949
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:57,151
I mean, if one of their
partners is cheating with Lisa

950
00:56:57,184 --> 00:57:00,154
and she's been pushing
to sell the company to them,

951
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:02,857
isn't that like illegal
conspiracy or something?

952
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,327
<i>More like just bad
fucking luck, unfortunately.</i>

953
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,396
<i>Look, if she hasn't closed
the deal yet</i>

954
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:11,832
<i>and you want to cancel,
then don't sign anything.</i>

955
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:14,936
<i>But bottom line is, Charlie
can come back with a sex tape</i>

956
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:17,672
<i>and she will still take
half of everything.</i>

957
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:21,242
- Oh.
<i>- I know that might be difficult to hear, Dom.</i>

958
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,577
<i>But at least when Charlie lands,</i>

959
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:26,247
<i>you will know if Lisa's
cheating or not cheating on you.</i>

960
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,917
<i>Simple. Anyway, I have to
go, but best of luck to you</i>

961
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:32,687
<i>and let me know if you
end up filing for divorce.</i>

962
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,689
<i>I will give you good rate.</i>

963
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:37,792
<i>Jorge, I'll see you at the
club, huh? Maybe bring Dom.</i>

964
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:41,963
<i>I'm sure some Soft Corn will
help him forget about Lisa.</i>

965
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,406
And you are probably thinking
some bad thoughts right now.

966
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:27,308
But before you do anything,
just let me say

967
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,510
that we don't know
if she really is cheating

968
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:32,947
until the plane lands
and we hear from Charlie.

969
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,518
So right now, it's a kind
of a premature lamentation.

970
00:58:55,503 --> 00:58:57,438
Okay, and you know what,
even if she's cheating,

971
00:58:57,471 --> 00:58:59,206
which I still think she's not,

972
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,178
but if she is, there's plenty
fish in the water, right?

973
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:06,547
What about that girl
you met on the online game?

974
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,016
Cosmo, Cosmic?

975
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,219
And you know what,
also Cassy can help you out too.

976
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:13,988
Oh, she loves to set people up,

977
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:17,024
and she has a lot of very
young and beautiful friends.

978
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,293
Come on, Dom.

979
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:26,333
Hey, buddy, listen,
you cannot be hard on yourself.

980
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:30,404
I mean, at the end of the day, we're
all just animals trying to get our fix.

981
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:35,376
That's all love is, it's
chemicals swirling in our heads.

982
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:39,514
And who knows, maybe Lisa,
she has some chemical

983
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:42,917
imbalance right now,
and you cannot control that.

984
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:46,020
But you know what?

985
00:59:46,053 --> 00:59:48,222
You know how we can
fight those bad chemicals

986
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,890
in your head right now?

987
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:53,160
Watch.

988
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:05,773
I have morphine pills.

989
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:08,577
Oh, this will cheer you
right up.

990
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,112
You don't need love.
Oh, my God.

991
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:12,880
Oh, my God.

992
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,750
And these, oh, you know
what these are?

993
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:27,862
Oh, my God.

994
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,365
Hey, Dom,
you know what these are?

995
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:32,867
I got it from my nephew,

996
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,705
it's like some kind
of special Mexican LSD.

997
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:42,042
If you take this, you cannot be
sad. You maybe be a little scared,

998
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:46,280
if you're not in the right mindset,
but definitely not sad, okay?

999
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:51,318
Uh... You know what? You know what
these kids are calling it in the streets?

1000
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:55,890
Oh, my God, they call it
<i>panocha de angel.</i>

1001
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:04,633
Here, here, here, watch.
Oh.

1002
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:07,368
Panocha de angel.
<i>Angel pussy.</i>

1003
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,442
Jorge, thanks for everything.

1004
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:17,478
You've been a good friend.
I'm going home.

1005
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:19,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You cannot go home.

1006
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:22,116
The highway's still closed.
Still fire.

1007
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:24,586
- I'll go around it.
- No, it's gonna take you forever.

1008
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:26,453
Maybe hours.

1009
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:28,989
Hey, why you don't stay
at my place?

1010
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:31,325
I'm sure Claire
would love to have you over.

1011
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:32,927
No, you've done enough already.

1012
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,362
Okay, hey, listen,
it's not good to be alone

1013
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:37,031
in this type of situation.

1014
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:39,668
I'm not alone,
my cousin's at my house.

1015
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,144
If you're worried about me
trying to off myself,

1016
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:43,003
I'm pretty sure she'd try
to stop me.

1017
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:44,838
Okay, okay, okay,
let's get your jacket.

1018
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,274
You know how this fires make it
really windy outside.

1019
01:01:47,308 --> 01:01:50,844
- I didn't bring a jacket.
- See, that's why you cannot go home.

1020
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,615
You cannot even remember what you
were wearing when you came in here.

1021
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:55,950
You left it in the couch,
in my office.

1022
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:09,029
- Hey, I don't see a...
- Swallow.

1023
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:11,633
Swallow, Dominic.
I'm trying to save your life.

1024
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:14,501
Swallow, the <i>panocha de angel.</i>
It's gonna help you out.

1025
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:18,072
Listen to me, I'm doing this
to save your life.

1026
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,940
Swa... Ow!

1027
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,983
You're a fucking drug addict,
Jorge.

1028
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:31,485
You know that?
You're a fucking drug addict.

1029
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,521
- I'm doing this to save you.
- You...

1030
01:02:33,555 --> 01:02:35,222
are...

1031
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:38,560
a... fucking... drug addict!

1032
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:43,497
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't break that!

1033
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:46,834
Don't break that!
Fuck! <i>Puta madre</i>!

1034
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:49,103
Claire is gonna kill me.

1035
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:18,499
Poor baby.

1036
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:21,101
Ah!

1037
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:29,744
No, please don't eat my soul.

1038
01:03:29,778 --> 01:03:34,616
Don't worry,
I'm not that kind of a lover.

1039
01:03:35,015 --> 01:03:37,151
Please don't eat my brains.

1040
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:42,289
That's a zombie, baby.

1041
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,092
I don't do that either.

1042
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,394
What... what are you?

1043
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:50,998
I'm a succubus, honey.

1044
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:56,571
We feast on the lust of a man.

1045
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,874
Are you real
or am I hallucinating?

1046
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,976
I don't know.

1047
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:08,248
Does this feel like
a hallucination to you?

1048
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:12,152
But I destroyed your box!

1049
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:16,957
Demons don't possess objects,
baby.

1050
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,426
They possess people.

1051
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,095
But I saw you come out of it.

1052
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,132
That's for show.

1053
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,835
For Jorge.

1054
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:30,037
To make him feel
more comfortable with me

1055
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:33,006
and the deal I made
with his wife.

1056
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,976
I keep him in check

1057
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:39,446
and in return I get to snack.

1058
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,717
Here and there.

1059
01:04:43,852 --> 01:04:45,720
How about you, Dom?

1060
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:51,959
I can make you forget her.

1061
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:59,634
Replace all those
hurtful memories...

1062
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:03,036
with good ones.

1063
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:08,275
You just have to say yes.

1064
01:05:11,546 --> 01:05:13,715
I can't. This is wrong.

1065
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:19,888
It's not cheating

1066
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,090
if Lisa's already doing it.

1067
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:27,662
I don't even know
if she's really...

1068
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:29,196
I need to hear from Charlie.

1069
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:31,699
I won't know for sure
until the plane lands.

1070
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:33,902
I need to wait for Charlie.

1071
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:37,705
You're just putting off
the inevitable, Dom.

1072
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:41,241
You already know the truth.

1073
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,578
You saw it in the look.

1074
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:45,513
- No.
- Remember?

1075
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:48,248
No, I don't.
I don't know for sure.

1076
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:53,153
Yes, you do.

1077
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:59,527
Go ahead, call Frances.

1078
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:02,597
Ask her the question
that's been burning

1079
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,633
in the back of your mind.

1080
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:10,471
The one you've been too afraid
to ask

1081
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:13,106
the moment you thought of it.

1082
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:34,929
<i>There you are.
Am I mailing this or what?</i>

1083
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:37,665
Not yet, I'm still waiting
to hear back from someone.

1084
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:41,068
<i>All right, whatever. I ended
up watching</i> Battlefield Earth

1085
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,604
<i>and now I want to finish it.</i>

1086
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:44,572
<i>Why do you have this on Blu-ray
anyway?</i>

1087
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:46,908
Uh, it's Lisa's, not mine.

1088
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:49,176
<i>Really?
She likes these kind of movies?</i>

1089
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:52,947
Hey, can you check something
for me,

1090
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:55,517
in the bathroom
next to my bedroom?

1091
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,585
<i>All right, one sec.</i>

1092
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:03,357
<i>- I'm here, what is it?</i>
- Check in the cabinet behind the door,

1093
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:06,794
there should be like a small
wicker basket thing there.

1094
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:09,496
<i>Okay, there's pills in here.</i>

1095
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:19,206
Are there any
birth control pills in there?

1096
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:24,077
<i>Mmm, no, it's just Motrin IB
and some Advil.</i>

1097
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:29,918
Okay. Thanks.

1098
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,020
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1099
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:34,454
Yeah.

1100
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:38,125
I'm just tired.
You know, with everything.

1101
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:40,995
<i>What is everything, Dom?</i>

1102
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:42,730
<i>You know you can talk to me,
right?</i>

1103
01:07:42,764 --> 01:07:44,532
<i>Are you and Lisa okay?</i>

1104
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:47,067
Okay, I'm just gonna
let you finish your movie.

1105
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,237
Call you back in a few.

1106
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,471
<i>Dom, wait.</i>

1107
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,741
<i>Dom...</i>

1108
01:08:03,952 --> 01:08:06,219
She was supposed to go
off the pill this month...

1109
01:08:08,523 --> 01:08:09,891
after we sold the company.

1110
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:15,797
We were gonna work less hours,
start a family.

1111
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:25,607
Maybe she threw away the pills
since, you know, it was time.

1112
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:29,409
Is that what you really believe?

1113
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:34,314
Yes.

1114
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:38,452
Yes, I wanna forget.

1115
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,437
Lisa?

1116
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,740
Lisa! Lisa!

1117
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:35,910
Lisa. Lisa.

1118
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:40,347
- Lisa, Lisa.
- Let her go.

1119
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,249
I...

1120
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:44,819
am... your...

1121
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:47,454
Lisa now!

1122
01:10:45,513 --> 01:10:49,183
- I can't, I don't wanna do this anymore.
- Stop fighting me!

1123
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:53,187
This is what you want.

1124
01:10:53,221 --> 01:10:56,224
No, I remember the coffee!

1125
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,760
Even if I was at the end
of the room in a meeting

1126
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,762
and we had the fight
the night before,

1127
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:04,397
Lisa always gave me my coffee
first before anyone else.

1128
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,034
And I've been treating her
like a coworker.

1129
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:10,171
Lisa is cheating on you.

1130
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:15,076
You saw the "looook"
she gave him.

1131
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:20,413
No amount of coffee
is going to change that.

1132
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:22,917
I don't care.

1133
01:11:24,118 --> 01:11:26,120
She still gave me my coffee
before him.

1134
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:29,524
That means she still
chooses to put me first.

1135
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:35,663
Jorge's, right, I have to
focus on the right details.

1136
01:11:37,098 --> 01:11:38,298
I have a choice.

1137
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:43,436
I'm gonna start over and make
sure I'm going to put Lisa first,

1138
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,672
no matter what.

1139
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:48,242
Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

1140
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:56,383
How boring.

1141
01:12:31,686 --> 01:12:33,855
<i>Hey-lo, you know who this is!</i>

1142
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:36,190
<i>Stay late...
Shit, I got it wrong.</i>

1143
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:39,527
Charlie, it's Dom.

1144
01:12:41,062 --> 01:12:45,132
I change my mind. I don't want to
know anything you found out on the plane.

1145
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:48,002
You hear me?
Don't call me back.

1146
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,105
Just send my bill
to Jorge's office.

1147
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:07,355
<i>You know what?</i>

1148
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:10,490
<i>I'm ashamed to admit,
but I kind of like this movie.</i>

1149
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:14,394
Hey, you can go ahead
and mail the papers now.

1150
01:13:14,427 --> 01:13:16,063
<i>Okay.</i>

1151
01:13:16,097 --> 01:13:18,633
<i>Are you crying?</i>

1152
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:21,569
No.

1153
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,983
<i>You've reached Lisa,</i>

1154
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:38,753
<i>leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

1155
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:43,090
Hey, it's me.

1156
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:46,994
I mailed the papers and, uh...

1157
01:13:49,397 --> 01:13:53,401
I just wanted to thank you
for doing this trip.

1158
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:58,906
If it wasn't for the plane,
you know, I would.

1159
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:02,143
I love you, Lisa.

1160
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:07,882
I'm sorry I haven't
said this in a long time.

1161
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:14,855
And I'm sorry I've been
taking you for granted.

1162
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:21,362
But I want you to know
that I love you so much.

1163
01:14:24,799 --> 01:14:27,168
I wanna have a family
with you...

1164
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:31,272
and let you tie me up
and do whatever you wanted

1165
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:34,508
to do to me because I love you
so much.

1166
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:38,846
And when you come back...

1167
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,983
I'll make sure
you never forget it.

1168
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:53,794
Well... well, that's all.

1169
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,798
Bye.

1170
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:29,730
Jorge! Jorge!
Hey, wake up!

1171
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,934
Chinese food's here.

1172
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,504
Call 911.

1173
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:56,791
They're pretty sure he's just severely
dehydrated and just needs some fluids,

1174
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:59,727
but they're gonna take him to
the emergency room just in case.

1175
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,831
I called Claire and told her, she's
gonna head over to the hospital right now.

1176
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:06,267
That's good.
Thanks for doing that.

1177
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:17,011
Hey, if you can keep
all of this...

1178
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:18,479
Don't even worry about it.

1179
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,882
When that door closes...

1180
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:24,585
Won't even ask how you got
those marks on your neck.

1181
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:30,191
Jorge may have given me
some substances.

1182
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:32,793
I know, that's why I don't ask.

1183
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:37,031
Just make sure Jorge
takes it easy, okay?

1184
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:40,434
I'm not planning on leaving
this office anytime soon.

1185
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:41,602
Noted.

1186
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,772
Let me run to the bathroom,
then I'll lock up?

1187
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:40,094
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

1188
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:43,598
<i>Dom, I have some bad news.
The Rowley house burned down.</i>

1189
01:17:43,632 --> 01:17:45,675
<i>I'm headed out for the day,
just thought you should know.</i>

1190
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:47,968
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Aw, shit.

1191
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:54,008
Hey, I think I'll have to skip out on
the drinks with your friend for tonight.

1192
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:57,745
What? Don't say you have to go
home, the highways are still closed.

1193
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:02,816
- I checked.
- No, I think I should go check on Jorge at the hospital.

1194
01:18:03,652 --> 01:18:05,530
He invited me to stay
over at his place tonight,

1195
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:08,088
so this is the least I can do
as a friend.

1196
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:12,594
Ugh, I guess that's
an acceptable excuse.

1197
01:18:12,627 --> 01:18:14,995
Well, let me give you my number.

1198
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:18,432
Just in case.

1199
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:21,035
Thanks.

1200
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:28,108
Cheer up, Dom. There's
always a reason to smile.
