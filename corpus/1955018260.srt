1
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:29,463
He's here.

2
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,223
Carl.
Martin.

3
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,623
Mr. Hale,
it's an honor.

4
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:38,823
When I was a kid, I saved
that Time magazine cover,

5
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,823
"The Man Who Built New York."

6
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,103
You're the reason I
got into this business.

7
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,383
Sit, please.

8
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:47,302
And congratulations on
the downtown contract.

9
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,982
Thank you. I didn't know
the word was out yet.

10
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:54,223
Hard to keep the word in on a
$200 million deal like that.

11
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,182
I hear you lobbied
Councilman Clark pretty hard.

12
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,182
Just a few steak dinners,
that's all.

13
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,823
I'm not talking about the Kobe.

14
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,142
Look, Martin...

15
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:05,301
You called
the Hale Group a "relic."

16
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,421
I'm not sure if those
were my exact words.

17
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:12,101
No. Your exact words were, "The old
man won't be around for long."

18
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,621
At least, that's how
the Councilman remembers it.

19
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,421
You're getting the
contract, aren't you?

20
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,661
I don't want the contract.

21
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,541
You think $200 million
means you've arrived?

22
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,580
What I want is to offer you
a lesson from an "old man,"

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,780
free of charge.

24
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,941
We've spoken with
Simon and Cohen.

25
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,140
Between them, they control
seven seats on your board.

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,540
And they support me.

27
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,861
They've come to see the need for
someone with the wisdom of experience.

28
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,740
And someone who might remember

29
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,740
that Councilman Clark's first
campaign, 30 years ago,

30
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,540
was bankrolled by
Mr. Hale here.

31
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,059
Try and appreciate
the irony, Mr. Baldwin.

32
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,819
You say I'm the reason
you got into this business?

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,420
Now, I'm the reason you're out.

34
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:04,738
You son of a bitch!

35
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,246
You're gonna be dead in a year.
And then who gives a shit?

36
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:14,018
He's wrong.

37
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,338
I won't last six months.

38
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,897
It's metastasized.
Liver and lungs.

39
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:25,218
This morning the oncologist was
talking about hospice care.

40
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,338
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,418
Don't be.

42
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:31,417
What you and
Judith went through,

43
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:34,417
losing a child,
that's a tragedy.

44
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:38,818
An old man dying. I'm supposed
to say, "That's life."

45
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,337
Still feels like
a kick in the nuts.

46
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,257
Have you told Claire?

47
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,617
I haven't had a chance.

48
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,977
Well, she won't return my calls.

49
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,816
Jesus, Damian,
if she only knew...

50
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,896
She has every
reason to be angry.

51
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:55,496
Oh, peanuts.

52
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:56,937
I'll send...
I'll send it back.

53
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:59,776
Cancer's eating me alive, and
I'm worried about allergies.

54
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,177
Maybe I should order a P...

55
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:04,856
PB&J.

56
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:08,217
No.

57
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,536
You know, I wanted
to tear all this down

58
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,856
in the '70s,
replace it with condos.

59
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,135
And now?

60
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,295
Couldn't if I tried.

61
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,575
Mayor declared it a landmark.

62
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:29,695
Oh, Martin, you ever hear about
something called "shedding"?

63
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,535
Shedding?
You mean like a snake?

64
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:34,095
Ah, it's nothing.
Forget about it.

65
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,495
It's just something
I was reading about.

66
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,293
Hi. You've reached Claire.
Please leave a message.

67
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:18,612
How many? Before me?

68
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,252
Less than a dozen.

69
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,933
Shedding is an
exclusive endeavor.

70
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,891
You mean expensive,
Dr. Albright.

71
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:26,811
Well, all of our
clients are wealthy,

72
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:27,972
but that's not
how they're chosen.

73
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,292
No, we cater to the great.

74
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:33,572
The visionaries, whose loss
would be a blow to all of us.

75
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:35,891
Simply put, we offer
humanity's greatest minds

76
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:38,211
more time to
fulfill their potential.

77
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:43,891
If you think about it, your
homes, your yacht, your jet...

78
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:46,451
All custom-built by the
world's finest craftsmen.

79
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,451
And so will your
new body be as well.

80
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,732
Genetically engineered
for perfection.

81
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:54,091
Harvested to maturity,
so looks, athleticism,

82
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,330
every detail of your new anatomy

83
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:59,571
will be designed to offer you the
very best of the human experience.

84
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,690
A reflex.

85
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,090
It's alive?

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,530
Only in the most basic sense.

87
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,130
A bundle of organic tissue.
But right now an empty vessel.

88
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,731
If you can really do what you
say, then why the makeshift lab?

89
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,850
I mean, why all the secrecy?

90
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,369
You're asking
the wrong question.

91
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,569
Oh. What's
the right question?

92
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:34,809
You've built
an empire from the ground up.

93
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,609
Worked every day to create
something from nothing.

94
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,528
Now, as you slip away,

95
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,287
people will call
your work your "legacy."

96
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,968
They'll insist that your buildings
somehow make you immortal.

97
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:58,488
What's your point?

98
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,247
Do you feel immortal?

99
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:22,814
Thanks for
supporting the cause, guys.

100
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,699
I'm gonna give
him a call, but...

101
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:26,303
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

102
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:28,567
Here,
sir, would you like a flyer?

103
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:31,286
Remember, we want everyone
at the rally to be respectful.

104
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,927
We're trying to win people over.

105
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:37,686
Dad.

106
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,766
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
Ugh.

107
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,966
I'm sorry to show up like this.

108
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,736
It's the only place I
knew I could find you.

109
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,925
Well, I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

110
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,445
Let's take a ride uptown
to that place by Macy's.

111
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:52,714
You used to love their sundaes.

112
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,886
Yeah, when I was eight.

113
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,245
Is something wrong?

114
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,045
You don't look well.
I'm fine.

115
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,044
Now, please take a ride with me.

116
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,284
Look, it's just
a bad time, okay?

117
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,400
Maybe we can meet up later.

118
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,404
Not later.

119
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:14,925
The revolution can wait, Claire.

120
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:16,405
I don't get you.

121
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,964
Months go by.
Years even.

122
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,044
I'm at work, Dad.

123
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:25,004
This isn't work. It's a bunch
of children throwing a tantrum.

124
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,683
Look, I didn't come
here to do this again.

125
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:37,363
I came because I want
to make things right.

126
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,883
What does that mean?

127
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,163
I know you're short on funds.

128
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,763
How...
Just take it.

129
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,761
You know, you can really be
a manipulative asshole.

130
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,723
Don't be a fool, Claire.
I'm trying, here.

131
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,482
No, you're not. You're
doing what you always do.

132
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,883
Showing up on your terms,

133
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,203
expecting your checkbook
to solve everything.

134
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,201
I am talking about a future

135
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,721
where the aged and infirm
can shed their prisons.

136
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,161
A future where...

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,521
Where the fate of a healthy mind

138
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,480
is not determined by the fate

139
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,601
<i>of a failing body.</i>

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Okay...

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,920
Oh, my goodness.

142
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,198
Albright.

143
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:07,919
I don't feel immortal.

144
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:13,038
If we do this, there's no turning back.
Your old life is over.

145
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,838
You see someone from your
past, you walk away.

146
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,359
Is that clear, Mr. Hale?

147
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:19,839
You have your conditions,
I have mine.

148
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,797
You get paid
after the procedure.

149
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,798
I may be dying,
but I'm not a fool.

150
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,758
Settle your affairs and fly
to New Orleans on Tuesday.

151
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,677
Your death needs to
be public, Mr. Hale.

152
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:36,197
Have lunch at Commander's. I
recommend the chicory coffee.

153
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,997
You've reached the
residence of Martin and Judy.

154
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:43,997
Please leave a message.

155
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,957
Sorry to bother you
at the ranch, Martin.

156
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:51,756
You mind meeting me for lunch
in New Orleans?

157
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:10,876
Yeah,
it's a three-point favorite,

158
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:12,955
and that just means a home field
advantage for New Orleans.

159
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:15,031
Well, you know, we've seen
this before, when these...

160
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,874
Are you going to stay?
George wants you to.

161
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,235
The Hale Group without Hale? No.

162
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:47,874
Thank you.

163
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:52,914
Judy's been spending most of her
time up the coast at the ranch.

164
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:03,593
I think it's time for me to cash
out and join her full-time.

165
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:11,753
I wish you could
drive out, come see the new place.

166
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:14,153
If the maids
would ever stop quitting,

167
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,592
we might finally be
ready for visitors.

168
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,432
Damian, are you okay?

169
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,311
What's the matter?

170
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,511
I...
What?

171
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:29,632
What?

172
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,152
Call 911!

173
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,272
Oh!
Damian!

174
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,712
Damian!
Do you have your EpiPen?

175
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,671
Do you have it with you?
He can't breathe!

176
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:46,031
ETA five minutes.
Huh?

177
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:48,871
Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale?

178
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,632
The good news is you're not
going into anaphylactic shock.

179
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:54,710
You just feel like you are.

180
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:59,191
The bad news is
your body needs to arrive DOA

181
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,191
at Tulane Hospital
in about 20 minutes.

182
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,789
Open your mouth, please.

183
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,788
Have all your fillings been removed?
DAMIAN I What?

184
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,390
Have all your metal fillings
been removed, sir? Yeah.

185
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,629
The machine is a giant magnet.

186
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,789
Any metal will
disrupt the process.

187
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:27,442
So you're sure we're
not missing anything?

188
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:28,869
Good.

189
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,789
One, two...

190
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:50,508
What's that?

191
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:55,493
It's something to
stop your heart.

192
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,028
What?

193
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,829
I said it's something
to stop your heart.

194
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,865
It didn't work.

195
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:03,825
It didn't work.
What's your name?

196
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:04,865
It didn't...

197
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,624
It didn't work.

198
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,704
What's your name?

199
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:12,104
Damian.

200
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:16,703
Damian.

201
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,741
It will take a few days,
but it gets easier.

202
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:18,381
It has that new body smell.

203
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,060
Damian.

204
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,739
Damian?

205
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,821
Yeah.

206
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,940
Are you all right?

207
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,099
Yes.

208
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,059
Death has some side effects.

209
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,259
Here. The paper of record.

210
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,019
We can arrange
a visit to the plot

211
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,779
in a few months if it
holds any significance.

212
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,818
But right now...

213
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,338
Get some rest if you can.

214
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,538
Tomorrow's your
first day of school.

215
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,335
So, how are you feeling?

216
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:30,174
Terrific. I have the physical
dexterity of a toddler.

217
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,214
Two hundred and
fifty million well spent.

218
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,735
A sense
of humor. Good.

219
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,974
It's important actually.
Helps to fend off despair.

220
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:41,734
Is that why I'm only
allowed plastic knives?

221
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,334
Suicidal thoughts
are not uncommon.

222
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,574
Inhabiting a body the mind regards
as alien can be pretty overwhelming.

223
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,453
And what is that? Prozac?

224
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,054
No, not exactly. No.

225
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,533
The "glitches" that
you've described to me?

226
00:18:57,613 --> 00:19:00,653
That's your mind adjusting
to its new neural structure.

227
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:04,134
And you can expect occasional, mild
hallucinations for the first year.

228
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:05,734
Jesus. There's nothing
to worry about.

229
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,132
Think of it as
the anti-rejection drug

230
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:10,573
that you'd take
after any transplant.

231
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,573
And what does
rejection look like?

232
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,492
Well, migraine, nausea,
disorientation, and then...

233
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:17,892
Well, death.

234
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:18,933
Oh.

235
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:22,292
Is that all?
An irrelevant hypothetical.

236
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:23,447
One a day for the time being.

237
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:24,492
Hell yes.

238
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:33,012
I was born on September 20, 1980.
Phoenix, Arizona.

239
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:36,772
My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash.

240
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,931
My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash

241
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,451
when I was 10 years old.

242
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,451
I was home with a stomach ache
because I snuck in the kitchen

243
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,091
and ate a whole tub of chocolate ice cream.
I was born September 20, 1980.

244
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,251
I was born September 20, 1980.

245
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:54,090
I was born on September 20, 1980.
Phoenix, Arizona.

246
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,358
My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash.

247
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,890
I was home with a stomach ache
because I snuck in the kitchen

248
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:00,731
and ate a whole tub
of chocolate ice cream.

249
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,570
I haven't eaten chocolate since.

250
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,410
My Uncle Frank
raised me in Chicago.

251
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,330
I went to Northwestern, where I
majored in Computer Science.

252
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,731
I never married.

253
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,890
I have no children.

254
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,610
I have never married.
I have no children.

255
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,530
My name is Edward Kidner.

256
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,529
My name is Edward Kidner.

257
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,129
My name is Edward Kidner.

258
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,888
Mmm. What's this?

259
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:45,448
This is a graduation present.

260
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,386
You'll live locally
for the time being,

261
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:49,928
just until you
get your bearings.

262
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,608
We've arranged
a house and car for you

263
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,027
and placed the money that you put
aside in a new bank account.

264
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,840
Not many in there, are there?

265
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,928
Seven.

266
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,927
You'll get refills at
our weekly meetings.

267
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:08,928
No. A leash wasn't
part of the deal.

268
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,886
I'm sorry. I admit
it's an inconvenience.

269
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,727
But with so few
undergoing the procedure,

270
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,647
every one of our patients
is a learning process.

271
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,487
It's just for now.
All right?

272
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,206
And how do I
get in touch with you?

273
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,966
You don't.
I come to you.

274
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:25,887
My privacy is very important
to me for obvious reasons.

275
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,567
Fair enough.

276
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,206
I'll tell you what.
In a couple of months,

277
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,926
we can talk about wherever it is

278
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,646
that you want to be
relocated. All right?

279
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:38,645
But in the meantime, why don't you
just relax and have some fun.

280
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:42,526
After all, at your age,
I'd say you've earned it.

281
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:00,561
Whoo!

282
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:04,123
Oh!

283
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,121
Move, move, move!

284
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,121
What's up, man?

285
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,481
Way to go.

286
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,760
Hey, NBA.

287
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,800
You see any scouts watching?

288
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,159
Uh-uh. I like to win.
Hmm.

289
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:55,584
Come back,
you'll be disappointed.

290
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,599
You're not from
around here, are you?

291
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,799
How'd you guess?
The locals prefer sucking?

292
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,359
I like that.
That's funny.

293
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:07,518
Gonna get a local
ass-whooping. I'm Anton.

294
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,878
Edward.

295
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,879
How's the wrist?

296
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:13,918
My kids can dish
out more than that.

297
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:14,958
You got kids?

298
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,278
Yeah, buddy.
Let me show you my beauties.

299
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:21,318
Look at that. The oldest,
she just turned seven.

300
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:22,918
Ah.
They're cute at that age.

301
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:25,638
Before they grow claws and
sharp-pointed teeth.

302
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,237
So what's your story, Eddie?

303
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,638
What do you mean?

304
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,677
You know. You in town to catch
some jazz, chase the ladies?

305
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:35,517
No, no, no. I'm actually renting an
apartment about two blocks up there.

306
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:37,638
No shit. I'm just
around the corner.

307
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:38,718
Yeah? No shit.

308
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,676
Yeah, I'm right here.

309
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:42,308
Anton.
It was nice meeting you.

310
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,436
Sure.

311
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:45,997
Hey, I'm gonna take you out.

312
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,237
Something like a little
welcome to the neighborhood.

313
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:49,966
I appreciate that,
but you got kids at home.

314
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:51,637
Yeah, but they live
with their mother.

315
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:54,036
I get to see them like once a month.
You know how it is.

316
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,556
Come on.
You'd rather drink alone?

317
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,835
No. No, I wouldn't.
You're on.

318
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,596
There you go.
Thank you.

319
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,073
What is he wearing?

320
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:18,755
Really?
Ew.

321
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:23,955
Are you in line?
Thanks.

322
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,115
After you.

323
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:41,874
Eddie! What's going on?

324
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,034
How are you?
I'm Edward.

325
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:44,194
Please meet Leah.

326
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:45,874
Leah? Nice to meet you.
How are you?

327
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:46,913
This is Andrea.

328
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:47,954
Andrea. Pleasure.
How are you?

329
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,234
You have very nice
taste in friends, Anton.

330
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,954
Well done.
Thank you very much.

331
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,914
Now, what were we talking about?

332
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:55,794
They were asking me what
you do besides trying to play ball.

333
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:58,193
Nothing. I'm retired.

334
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:00,233
How old are you?

335
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,794
I was born September 20, 1980,
in Phoenix, Arizona.

336
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:04,834
That's specific.

337
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:07,033
That's specific.
Very specific.

338
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,836
Actually, I started a company, and
then I sold it later. Doesn't matter.

339
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,253
Are they giving something away in there?
What's with the line?

340
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:21,952
I love this song.

341
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,473
I love this song.

342
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,591
She's incredible.

343
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,352
She's a guy, isn't she?
Yeah.

344
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:54,111
Are you okay?
I am. I'm fine.

345
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,351
I just haven't seen anything
like that in about 52 years.

346
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,910
You're weird.

347
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:45,308
Gorgeous.

348
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:10,504
Where are you going?

349
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:46,622
Hello.

350
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,661
Hello, Claire?

351
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,022
Yes, this is Claire.

352
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:51,702
Hello?

353
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:54,902
Who is this?

354
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,181
You like it when
Daddy's home? Me, too.

355
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,340
Hey, baby.

356
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,140
She's sleeping.

357
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,019
Daddy...

358
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,619
I see this little girl. She
can't be more than five or six.

359
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:06,099
And somehow I know that she's
the daughter of this woman.

360
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:13,378
Something's wrong.
She's sick.

361
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:16,338
She's expecting me to help her.

362
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:20,298
Well, you mentioned that you
missed taking your medication.

363
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,457
Once.

364
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:22,777
Just one?
Yes.

365
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:25,898
Well, that would account for the
intensity of your hallucination.

366
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:28,937
No, this wasn't a hallucination.
I knew her.

367
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:30,858
Oh, yes, I understand that
it might seem that way

368
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:33,737
given your unresolved feelings
for your own daughter,

369
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:36,937
but what you're
experiencing is simply

370
00:31:37,057 --> 00:31:38,857
a confused composite
of old memories

371
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:40,776
fueled by your own
very real emotions.

372
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:43,177
Now, for example,
this town with the water tower

373
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:44,777
with the pumpkin painted on it

374
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:47,297
is likely someplace
that you visited as a child.

375
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:49,137
And this Latina woman?

376
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:52,936
Well, a one-night stand long
since forgotten, I'm sure.

377
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:54,296
I never said she was Latina.

378
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,377
Hmm?

379
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:57,776
I never said she was Latina.

380
00:31:59,016 --> 00:31:59,976
Hmm.

381
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,376
Here.

382
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,696
What is this?

383
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:08,496
Hawaii.
A change of scenery.

384
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:13,695
Yes, I'm afraid I've kept you
cooped up in here for far too long,

385
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:14,895
and I'm sorry about that.

386
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,976
But for the week
that you're gone,

387
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:22,375
I'm doubling your
dose of medication.

388
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:25,055
Now you remember to take it,
and I assure you

389
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:27,215
these unpleasant episodes
will soon be behind you.

390
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,534
All right?

391
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:30,934
All right.

392
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,132
Heavenly Father, we
thank you for the glorious hope

393
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,853
and for the great consolation.

394
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:16,012
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

395
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,412
Morning, Mr. Kidner.
May I?

396
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:44,450
Hi.

397
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:20,649
Come on.

398
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,089
Come on.

399
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:39,968
Hey.
Hi. How can I help you?

400
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,248
Change of plans. When's the
next flight to St. Louis?

401
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,088
St. Louis.

402
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:52,008
Destination 200
yards on the left.

403
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:56,808
Destination 100
yards on the left.

404
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:28,803
Hello?

405
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:23,598
Put it down and get out, now.

406
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,678
If you're looking for insurance
money, you're not gonna find any.

407
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:29,238
I don't want your money.

408
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,037
I'm gonna turn around now.

409
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,317
Please don't move. Please
just take a deep breath.

410
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:42,276
I'm gonna turn around. Okay?
Please try and relax.

411
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,236
Take your finger off the trigger.
Okay? Is that you?

412
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:45,813
Please take your
finger off the trigger.

413
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:52,796
It's okay.

414
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:56,716
It's okay.

415
00:38:58,037 --> 00:38:59,475
Oh, my God!
How is this possible?

416
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:00,996
Try to breathe.
Take a deep breath.

417
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:02,796
How is this possible?
Put the gun down.

418
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,716
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't
know what you're talking about.

419
00:39:04,796 --> 00:39:06,476
Try to breathe, it's okay.
Mark.

420
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,316
Oh, my God. It's okay.
Just try to take a breath.

421
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,675
Oh, my God. It's you.

422
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:11,075
It's all right.
It's all right.

423
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:12,556
How is that possible?
I don't know.

424
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,396
Hey! Are you
expecting somebody?

425
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,756
Did you bring somebody back to
the house with you?

426
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:18,794
No. No.

427
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,554
Did you bring anybody back?
What are you talking about?

428
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:21,995
- No! I don't... What are you...
- Mr. Kidner?

429
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,115
Okay, just...
What's happening?

430
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,355
Shh! Quiet.
Wait, Mark!

431
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:26,435
Mr. Kidner?
Shh, shh.

432
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,675
Mr. Kidner?
Open the door, please.

433
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,234
Mr. Kidner.
Could you open the door?

434
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:37,594
Whoa.

435
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:40,114
Mr. Kidner!
Put the gun down. Okay?

436
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:41,793
I'm just here to help you.
No.

437
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,713
Argh! Get your hands off me!
Hands off me. Calm down!

438
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:51,673
Calm down.

439
00:39:54,313 --> 00:39:57,353
Eddie. Hey, it's okay, man.

440
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:58,993
Let him go.

441
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:05,273
You work for Albright?

442
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,273
I'm still your friend.

443
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:09,433
Albright, me, we just want
what's best for you.

444
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:11,032
This woman thinks
her husband's dead.

445
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:12,993
They told me
the body was grown in a lab.

446
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:14,233
Why don't you sit down?

447
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,152
Please.

448
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:19,032
That was his choice.

449
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:22,552
It was the only way
to save his kid's life.

450
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:24,792
You gave them money?
Come on, man.

451
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:28,112
Insurance wouldn't step up,
so we took care of things.

452
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:31,512
It was the only way to get the
little girl back on her feet again.

453
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:33,872
You shouldn't have
come here, Eddie.

454
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:36,951
This doesn't concern you. Like hell
it doesn't! You took a man's life!

455
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,351
Hey, nobody took anything.

456
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,752
You're a businessman. Right?
You understand that.

457
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,151
The kid, Anna,
she's alive thanks to you.

458
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,191
That's bullshit.

459
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:52,711
I could have cut
that guy a check.

460
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,391
Really? But would you have?

461
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:03,231
Eddie, I get that
you're disappointed.

462
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,729
You thought you
were buying a new car,

463
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,389
and it turns out it
had a few miles on it.

464
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,470
How can you be so glib,
like nothing happened?

465
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,589
"A few miles on it."

466
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,189
You know that the Doc says

467
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,469
each patient is
critical to the program.

468
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,869
Yeah. Fuck him.

469
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,748
You don't exist without us.

470
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,149
You took a leap without a net.

471
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:30,149
You really believe that, Anton?

472
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:33,269
I warned you.

473
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:34,468
You know who I used to be?

474
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:37,828
You like to win. You're
gonna be very disappointed.

475
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:41,069
There's a car outside.
I suggest you get in it.

476
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:46,708
The woman?

477
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:49,108
She's not your problem.

478
00:41:49,828 --> 00:41:51,667
It'll look like an accident.

479
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,107
You okay?
I need to take the medicine.

480
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,627
Just relax.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

481
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,424
That's enough.

482
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:20,463
Hey, Gary.

483
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:31,463
Ahhh!

484
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:39,502
No! Put the gun down!
Put that down. Put that down.

485
00:43:39,823 --> 00:43:41,542
He shot me!

486
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,343
The Doc wants him alive, okay?

487
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,861
Go to the front.
Go in the front.

488
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:52,582
Hey, Eddie! Eddie,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

489
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,702
Eddie? Don't shoot, man.

490
00:43:57,382 --> 00:43:59,182
Eddie, I'm putting my gun down.

491
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,267
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm gonna come in.

492
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:11,352
I'm coming in. It's just me. I'm
gonna show you my hands. All right?

493
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:12,781
Touching the knob.

494
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:15,420
Look, look.

495
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:17,501
Do not shoot.

496
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:22,621
Eddie.

497
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,980
See, look.

498
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,260
You didn't have to do that.
We were on the same team.

499
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,660
Ahhh!

500
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:09,578
Shoot him!

501
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:23,258
Light him up!

502
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:31,496
Hey, hey, hey.

503
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:32,537
Wake up! Wake up!

504
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:45,457
Damian!

505
00:45:46,217 --> 00:45:47,457
We're gonna burn you!

506
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,416
Burn them up!

507
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:13,375
Okay, okay.

508
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:17,095
Come on.

509
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,254
Ahhh!

510
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:47,734
Ahhh!

511
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:06,532
Mark, can you just stop?

512
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:08,772
Wait.

513
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:10,132
Mark, just stop!

514
00:47:10,252 --> 00:47:11,533
Madeline, not now.

515
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,932
Madeline? What
happened to Maddie?

516
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,828
I don't feel well, we gotta
keep moving.

517
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:19,132
Mark, you were just dead.
They told me you drowned.

518
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,292
What happened? Mark, we
need to call the police.

519
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,172
No! No. No police.

520
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:28,211
I made a deal for Anna.

521
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,006
Disappearing was part of it.

522
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:31,052
Why?

523
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:34,931
In exchange for the money,
I agreed to do things.

524
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,531
Things only a dead
man could get away with.

525
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,571
Okay, we gotta keep moving.
What?

526
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:38,612
Let's go. Come on.
No.

527
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:40,571
You bastard! How can
you do that to me?

528
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:43,091
Hey! Just stop! No, I
thought you were dead!

529
00:47:43,171 --> 00:47:44,411
Hey, Maddie! Hey!

530
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,010
I didn't want you to
have to make that choice.

531
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:52,724
At least I don't think I did,

532
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:56,250
between your husband
and your daughter.

533
00:47:58,970 --> 00:47:59,930
Okay?

534
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:05,249
You bastard.

535
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,170
I thought you were dead.

536
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:18,370
Oh, my God! Anna.
What?

537
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:20,130
Anna's in school, Mark.

538
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:24,489
Mark!

539
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:16,927
I hope she's strong
enough to blow them out.

540
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:40,845
You can do it, Pumpkin.

541
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:46,784
Did you make a wish, Pumpkin?

542
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:49,805
I wished for Daddy to
teach me how to swim.

543
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,604
You're not supposed to say.
Now it won't come true.

544
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,124
Hey, that's not nice.

545
00:49:54,685 --> 00:49:56,444
Is that true?

546
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:58,324
No, Pumpkin. Of course not.

547
00:49:58,404 --> 00:50:00,405
I'll teach you as
soon as you get better.

548
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:22,324
Shit!

549
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:25,003
He didn't.

550
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:28,122
Daddy! I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

551
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:32,843
Oh!

552
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:39,402
Mom was crying every night,
and I told her not to worry.

553
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:41,042
I told her you'd come back.

554
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:44,123
I love you, Daddy.

555
00:50:45,163 --> 00:50:46,921
I love you, too, Pumpkin.

556
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,881
Okay, hey!
Time to go. Come on.

557
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,521
Daddy? Do you
like my hair?

558
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:15,252
Hey. Get in
here and spit it out.

559
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,640
You don't talk
with your mouth full.

560
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Daddy?

561
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,920
What? Yes, sweetie.

562
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,120
Do you like my hair?

563
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,320
What?

564
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:34,480
Do you like my hair?
It grew longer.

565
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,039
It's beautiful.

566
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,519
Come on. Go get ready for bed.

567
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,559
What's with all
these nice clothes?

568
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,439
They made me remove it.

569
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:58,839
Listen, tomorrow morning,
you and Anna...

570
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:00,999
Is there someplace that I can take you?
A friend's house?

571
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,838
If you think I'm letting
my eyes off you... Mark?

572
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:05,958
What are you looking for?

573
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:06,998
Shit!
Mark!

574
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:08,879
Sorry.

575
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:09,959
Just tell me
what's the matter...

576
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:11,266
I just need a gulp of fresh air!

577
00:52:34,437 --> 00:52:35,397
Come on.

578
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,636
This guy...

579
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:56,156
I am talking about a future where the
aged and infirm can shed their prisons.

580
00:52:58,996 --> 00:53:02,035
A future where
the fate of a healthy mind...

581
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,515
Son of a bitch!

582
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,675
This guy...

583
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:20,114
...failing body.

584
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,915
Yeah, Professor Jensen, do you
really think that old people...

585
00:53:33,554 --> 00:53:34,755
This guy-

586
00:53:44,114 --> 00:53:45,914
Hold on there, Mark.

587
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:55,473
Pumpkin.

588
00:53:55,994 --> 00:53:57,272
You wanna say bye to Daddy?

589
00:53:57,353 --> 00:53:59,312
Did I tell you what
Anna said to me today?

590
00:54:00,552 --> 00:54:01,912
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bitwell.

591
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,353
Hello, Mark.
Mark! Wake up.

592
00:54:04,433 --> 00:54:05,953
Lie down, please.
Comfortable?

593
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,152
Mark!

594
00:54:07,793 --> 00:54:09,033
Mark! Wake up.

595
00:54:10,192 --> 00:54:11,233
Hey.
I'm fine.

596
00:54:11,312 --> 00:54:12,272
You were on the ground.

597
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:13,273
I know. I'm fine.

598
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:14,952
Do you need a doctor?
No.

599
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:16,591
No.

600
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:20,792
It's over. It's over.

601
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:22,232
What's over?

602
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:23,392
Nothing.

603
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:24,952
Mark!

604
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:27,471
Please! Talk to me!

605
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:30,272
What's going on?

606
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:35,311
I'm sorry.

607
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:39,951
So sorry.

608
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:44,511
I know you don't
have any reason to,

609
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,390
but you have to
trust me right now.

610
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,711
Okay?

611
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:54,270
Just...

612
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,790
Where are we running to?

613
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,950
I need to get medicine.

614
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,429
I've gotta make
a stop in New Orleans.

615
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:24,908
Daddy?

616
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:27,789
Daddy?

617
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:30,309
You need to go to the bathroom?

618
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,508
Mmm-mmm.
No?

619
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,428
Are you feeling sick?

620
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:39,549
No.

621
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:42,108
Of course not. No, why?

622
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:43,788
Then why are we
going to the doctor?

623
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,508
Is it for me again?

624
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:48,428
Oh...

625
00:55:50,148 --> 00:55:52,067
No, sweetie, it's not for you.

626
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,507
We're actually going to go
see the doctor's wife.

627
00:55:54,587 --> 00:55:56,268
Daddy needs to talk to her.

628
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,148
You're okay.

629
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:01,786
Go back to sleep.
All right?

630
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:03,347
Okay.

631
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:41,145
Mrs. Jensen will
see you now.

632
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:42,545
Thank you.

633
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:47,505
Up the stairs.

634
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,424
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen.
- Come in.

635
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:50,665
Thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you.

636
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,104
No, you're not.
Please, sit down.

637
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:53,545
I was a student
of your husband's.

638
00:56:54,184 --> 00:56:55,705
Oh... Please.

639
00:56:56,065 --> 00:56:57,305
You were a student?

640
00:56:57,425 --> 00:56:58,704
I was, yes.
Oh.

641
00:56:58,984 --> 00:57:00,064
A student!

642
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:01,264
Mrs. Jensen, um...

643
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:04,664
I was wondering
if there was any way

644
00:57:04,744 --> 00:57:06,264
I could gain access to
your husband's research.

645
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:07,864
I'm trying to
follow up on his work.

646
00:57:07,944 --> 00:57:11,424
Oh. That's wonderful. That's
wonderful you would follow up.

647
00:57:11,504 --> 00:57:15,664
Because that's what I told them.
I said follow up. Follow up!

648
00:57:15,744 --> 00:57:19,143
But the university acts
like he never even existed.

649
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:23,464
They put his
research into boxes.

650
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:26,143
Boxed up his research? Is it
stored somewhere? Is it...

651
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:30,423
ls there any way that I
could maybe get to it?

652
00:57:31,303 --> 00:57:33,463
Did Francis ever
tell you how we met?

653
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:37,862
No.

654
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:39,182
He was such a romantic.

655
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:43,463
You know, you and the other one.
You're both so handsome.

656
00:57:45,223 --> 00:57:49,342
He was another student.
I think he's a doctor now though.

657
00:57:50,022 --> 00:57:51,862
He comes every Wednesday

658
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:56,021
and brings my
favorite butterscotch candy.

659
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:59,301
His name is Albright.

660
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,102
Maybe I have some...
Mrs. Jensen?

661
00:58:02,181 --> 00:58:04,142
Hey, Mrs. Jensen,
look at me.

662
00:58:05,141 --> 00:58:06,741
Do you know where
I can find Albright?

663
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:08,901
No.

664
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:10,101
Please, think.

665
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,582
No. Of course not.

666
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:18,181
But his number's
right by the telephone.

667
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:26,180
Phyllis.

668
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,180
Boxed up all of his
papers in such a hurry.

669
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,700
All right, Phyllis.
I'll be right over.

670
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:04,794
Now, Phyllis, dear,
what was all this...

671
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:06,339
Close the door.

672
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:12,137
Did you hurt her?

673
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:14,778
Your wife?

674
00:59:15,538 --> 00:59:17,858
No. She's fine.

675
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:20,098
Now close the door.

676
00:59:25,697 --> 00:59:26,977
I need pills.

677
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,218
Enough to last.

678
00:59:30,018 --> 00:59:31,137
You shouldn't have come here.

679
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:32,448
You shouldn't have lied to me.

680
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,457
I gave you what you wanted.

681
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:41,616
I never wanted others to suffer.

682
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:44,977
You failed to mention that...
I'm trying to ease suffering.

683
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:49,696
Just think of all the great
minds that this world has lost

684
00:59:49,777 --> 00:59:52,896
simply because their
bodies were failing.

685
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:56,736
Edison, Einstein, Steve Jobs.

686
00:59:57,936 --> 00:59:59,376
Yes, what he could
have accomplished

687
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:02,816
with another 50
years on this planet...

688
01:00:03,776 --> 01:00:04,896
My wife.

689
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:09,535
My wife was an incredibly kind
and decent woman,

690
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:11,655
and she could
still be by my side.

691
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,615
But thanks to the Alzheimer's,
there's no mind left to salvage.

692
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:18,336
And that's it?

693
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:21,775
That's your bullshit paper-thin excuse?
That's why you justify murder?

694
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:24,095
How do you justify
taking the pills?

695
01:00:24,694 --> 01:00:25,655
Hmm?

696
01:00:31,014 --> 01:00:32,494
What do you think they do?

697
01:00:34,574 --> 01:00:35,615
No?

698
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:43,294
Stop taking the medication, and
your mind fades into oblivion.

699
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,534
Madeline can have
her husband back.

700
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:50,533
But keep going, push on,

701
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:54,814
and each dose that you take
erases a little more of Mark.

702
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:59,453
His army training,
his instincts.

703
01:01:01,093 --> 01:01:03,773
After a year or so,
they'll be gone forever.

704
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:10,412
You never asked
the right questions, Damian.

705
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:15,132
What do you want to do now
that you have all the answers?

706
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:22,412
Let's go to the lab.

707
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,531
Hey, pop!

708
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:44,651
Easy.

709
01:01:44,731 --> 01:01:47,410
Shh. Not here.
Take him to the car.

710
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:49,290
I need a word
with Mrs. Jensen.

711
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,770
Easy, friend.

712
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,450
Come on.

713
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:16,409
What's he doing here?

714
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:18,650
Pop the trunk.

715
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,769
Mark? Is everything okay?

716
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:26,848
Ahhh!

717
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,327
Stop it!

718
01:02:48,128 --> 01:02:49,848
I said stop it!

719
01:02:51,847 --> 01:02:52,847
Let him go!

720
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,487
Ahhh!

721
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:57,767
Damn it, Eddie!

722
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:07,767
Anton.

723
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:14,646
First time I take it for a
spin, I get a scratch on it.

724
01:03:14,726 --> 01:03:15,927
That takes weeks.

725
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:17,206
First one's the hardest.

726
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:20,365
After a few sheddings, you're
back on your feet in no time.

727
01:03:20,446 --> 01:03:21,926
Your pills.
Give me your pills.

728
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,080
When are you gonna tell her?

729
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:24,646
Shut up!

730
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:26,926
Why don't you
ask your husband...

731
01:03:27,006 --> 01:03:28,007
Shut up!

732
01:03:28,126 --> 01:03:29,126
...when your
daughter's birthday is?

733
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:30,485
Or when you two love birds...

734
01:03:30,565 --> 01:03:31,525
Ahhh!

735
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:41,125
What is he talking about?

736
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:43,485
Mark, what's going on?

737
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:44,885
Come on! Let's just go!

738
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,604
Up here. Pull over!
No. Not yet.

739
01:04:05,685 --> 01:04:06,925
No.
I said pull over!

740
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:21,523
Get out.

741
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:27,643
Stay here, Pumpkin. Okay?
Daddy and Mommy need a minute.

742
01:04:34,643 --> 01:04:37,042
Okay. So when's
Anna's birthday?

743
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,242
Can you answer that?

744
01:04:42,362 --> 01:04:44,083
The hotel where we got married?

745
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:46,802
Anything?

746
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:51,922
What I'm about to tell you is not
gonna sound very reasonable.

747
01:04:52,002 --> 01:04:54,162
I was sick. I
was a very sick man. I was dying.

748
01:04:54,242 --> 01:04:56,241
And I took part in a procedure
that saved my life.

749
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:01,441
I was told something else.
I was told that it wasn't.

750
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,482
It took Mark.

751
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:05,082
Oh, my God, no.
I can't do this again.

752
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:07,681
I didn't know.

753
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,801
Your husband's dead,
and I'm sorry.

754
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:15,641
How do you mean, you don't know?

755
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,240
How do you not know
where a body comes from?

756
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,320
I didn't know!

757
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,887
How do you mean you don't know?
I didn't know.

758
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,560
How do you not know?
I had no idea.

759
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:23,601
Mom?

760
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,200
Are you okay?

761
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,600
I'm okay, honey, all right?

762
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,560
Daddy just forgot my birthday.

763
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,600
Will you go back inside, honey,

764
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,280
and just wait in the car for me?

765
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,960
No! Can Daddy come with me?

766
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,159
All right, look,
Daddy's not feeling well.

767
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,920
If you need anything,
you ask Mommy, okay?

768
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,439
All right, you know what, why
don't you go play on the horsey?

769
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,719
So, I mean, what do I call you?

770
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,759
Who are you?

771
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:54,238
My name is Damian.

772
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:57,918
And I'm so sorry.

773
01:06:03,478 --> 01:06:04,798
I want to help you.

774
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:06,238
Help me? Really?

775
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:07,479
You want to help me?

776
01:06:07,598 --> 01:06:08,559
Yeah.

777
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:10,798
Huh? Why don't you start off
by bringing back my husband?

778
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,557
Okay, 'cause
the only help that I need

779
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:15,597
is to tell a six-year-old
and explain to her

780
01:06:15,678 --> 01:06:17,918
that the man who looks and
sounds like her father, isn't.

781
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:21,238
How am I supposed to
go through it all over again?

782
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:22,877
I don't know.
I don't know.

783
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:25,117
I do know that if you push
me away, you won't survive.

784
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:26,157
They'll kill you both.

785
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,677
You manipulative asshole.

786
01:06:39,597 --> 01:06:40,597
I know.

787
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:42,796
I've heard that before.

788
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:46,117
Look, if there's one thing I understand
in life, it's the bottom line.

789
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:48,077
And these people,
I know how they think.

790
01:06:48,157 --> 01:06:49,597
They've built something,
and they won't let it go.

791
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:50,835
They'll spend
whatever they need to,

792
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:51,955
eliminate whoever they have to.

793
01:06:52,036 --> 01:06:53,035
They'll just keep coming.

794
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,036
Now I'm not asking you to
understand all of this.

795
01:06:55,116 --> 01:06:59,276
But I am asking you to grab your
daughter and get in the car.

796
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:07,315
<i>I can take you some place.</i>

797
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,995
Safe. Where you
can start over.

798
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:15,115
My friend has a plane, and he
can get us out of the country.

799
01:07:16,555 --> 01:07:19,195
There's an account in Geneva.
It's untraceable.

800
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:20,555
With more than enough money.

801
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:24,434
And Anna?
She can't know the truth.

802
01:07:25,434 --> 01:07:27,154
When it's over,
I'm gonna disappear.

803
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:30,034
You can tell her
whatever you want to.

804
01:07:39,914 --> 01:07:41,473
Hello?
Mr. O'Neill?

805
01:07:42,033 --> 01:07:43,034
Yes?

806
01:07:43,113 --> 01:07:45,914
I have a message from Damian Hale.
I think you'll wanna hear it.

807
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:55,193
I saw him die with my own eyes.

808
01:07:55,514 --> 01:07:56,953
You saw what they wanted you to.

809
01:07:59,513 --> 01:08:03,953
And this woman? Are you gonna tell
me she's my great-grandmother?

810
01:08:04,273 --> 01:08:06,553
She's just a friend, Martin.
Somebody I need to help now.

811
01:08:06,632 --> 01:08:09,393
What you're claiming
is simply impossible.

812
01:08:11,912 --> 01:08:14,713
Do you remember in New York, when
I asked you about "shedding"?

813
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,831
What?

814
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:17,992
I have never met you.

815
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:19,151
Me. Damian.

816
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:22,192
I don't know what kind
of con you're running,

817
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,432
but I'm not biting.

818
01:08:23,512 --> 01:08:24,872
That's it. I'm
calling the police.

819
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:26,991
Anna?

820
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:28,791
We need to go, Pumpkin.

821
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:29,832
Judy, please put
the telephone down.

822
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:32,021
I'm starting to understand
why your maids keep quitting.

823
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:36,551
Where?

824
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:38,671
Where did you get this?

825
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:40,991
What is it?

826
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:46,711
The original deed to
144 Plympton Street.

827
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,830
The first building we
ever bought together.

828
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,311
Do you remember the night
we signed the papers?

829
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:54,990
We went to Charlie's Kitchen.

830
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,410
There's a brunette sitting in the corner.
I wanna talk to her.

831
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,750
She's been staring
at me all night.

832
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,830
But you stopped me.

833
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,229
"You already closed
one deal tonight."

834
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,309
"Don't get greedy."

835
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:16,109
Turns out, she's the dean's
17-year-old daughter.

836
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:18,789
How'd you know
to put this aside?

837
01:09:19,469 --> 01:09:20,710
It's me, Martin.

838
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:24,549
I never do anything
without insurance.

839
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:37,589
Damian.

840
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,388
It's done. But it could
take some time

841
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:42,788
to gas up the plane,
file a flight plan.

842
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:45,388
Thank you, Martin.

843
01:10:13,306 --> 01:10:14,666
It's March 22nd.

844
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,827
Mom's birthday.

845
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:23,986
Try to remember next time.

846
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:25,306
Yeah.

847
01:10:28,386 --> 01:10:31,265
All this will be over soon.
This running around.

848
01:10:31,346 --> 01:10:33,025
You're gonna have a new house.

849
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,825
A new school. New friends.
Maybe a new school uniform.

850
01:10:39,464 --> 01:10:40,905
Would you like that?

851
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,025
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

852
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:45,505
How does the water feel?

853
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,985
About room temperature.

854
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:51,465
Really?

855
01:10:53,945 --> 01:10:55,025
Room temperature.

856
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:57,745
I never got around to
teaching you, did I?

857
01:10:57,824 --> 01:10:59,624
You left before I got better.

858
01:10:59,743 --> 01:11:01,504
You're feeling
better now, aren't you?

859
01:11:07,424 --> 01:11:08,863
You want to come this way?

860
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:11,183
You know how hard it would be to
swim with those on your feet?

861
01:11:11,263 --> 01:11:12,783
Uh...
There you go.

862
01:11:12,864 --> 01:11:14,624
They make me
look like a chicken.

863
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,304
Kick hard!
Kick hard! Kick hard!

864
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:19,743
Look out Olympics 2020, right here.
And she's on her own!

865
01:11:20,223 --> 01:11:22,663
And when did you start
professionally whistling?

866
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:23,703
When did you go on tour?

867
01:11:23,783 --> 01:11:25,463
Fast as you can!
Kick, kick, kick, kick!

868
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:26,744
I didn't go on tour.

869
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:28,383
I was just walking into my room,

870
01:11:28,503 --> 01:11:30,114
and I really wanted
to know how to whistle.

871
01:11:30,143 --> 01:11:31,702
There you go, there you go!

872
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:33,703
So then I started off like this.

873
01:11:35,463 --> 01:11:36,463
Fast as you can!
Fast as you can!

874
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:38,942
That's good. Kicking me in the face.
That'll do.

875
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:41,040
All right.
How fast can you go?

876
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:43,422
Okay, watch out, Michael Phelps.

877
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:46,862
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

878
01:11:47,022 --> 01:11:49,182
You're not old yet. When you get
old, that's when you get soared.

879
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:51,142
Then I started like this.

880
01:11:51,581 --> 01:11:53,342
Go all the way.
You can do it.

881
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:56,181
Then I started like this.

882
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:57,301
And you're whistling.

883
01:11:59,141 --> 01:12:00,862
I love you, Daddy.

884
01:12:05,661 --> 01:12:07,100
Slow down, okay?

885
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,860
Do you need help, baby?

886
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:10,181
I'm not a baby!

887
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,341
You okay?

888
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,340
Just let me listen.

889
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,460
Are you okay?

890
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,018
Well, you're not a bad kisser.

891
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:15,738
Well, I was aiming for mediocre.

892
01:13:15,817 --> 01:13:17,857
That's not what I meant.

893
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:20,058
I know. I know.

894
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:21,658
Come on. I just...

895
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:24,857
I want to know who you were.

896
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:27,657
I just need something, anything,

897
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:30,298
to remind me that
you're not my husband.

898
01:13:30,377 --> 01:13:32,977
For starters, you should be
thankful that I'm not your husband.

899
01:13:34,856 --> 01:13:35,977
I wasn't much of
a father either.

900
01:13:36,096 --> 01:13:37,176
You had children?

901
01:13:37,257 --> 01:13:40,377
I do. I have one. I have
a girl called Claire.

902
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:43,616
And?

903
01:13:43,896 --> 01:13:47,096
Uh... When she was little,
I wasn't around much.

904
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:49,177
When she was big,
I was never around.

905
01:13:51,096 --> 01:13:52,535
She turned out okay though.

906
01:13:56,536 --> 01:13:57,736
She runs a non-profit now.

907
01:13:58,456 --> 01:13:59,776
That's something to be proud of.

908
01:13:59,895 --> 01:14:01,255
Depends who you ask.

909
01:14:02,536 --> 01:14:03,648
Is she good at what she does?

910
01:14:03,736 --> 01:14:04,856
She's great.

911
01:14:04,935 --> 01:14:07,576
She's really great.

912
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:11,375
Did you ever tell her that?

913
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:18,735
Do you know where
you'll go with Anna?

914
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:27,175
I've never really
been anywhere before.

915
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:32,054
I mean, yeah, Mark and I used
to fantasize about hiding away

916
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,734
in some Caribbean
island somewhere.

917
01:14:33,814 --> 01:14:35,014
Sure, yeah.

918
01:14:35,094 --> 01:14:36,174
Turquoise water...

919
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:37,974
Hello?

920
01:14:38,294 --> 01:14:39,254
White sand beaches.

921
01:14:39,373 --> 01:14:41,854
With this money, you'll
be able to do that,

922
01:14:43,534 --> 01:14:44,653
and then some.

923
01:14:46,573 --> 01:14:47,533
Yeah, I guess.

924
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:55,054
I guess I just never
imagined going without him.

925
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,452
No. I imagine not.

926
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:03,893
What is that?

927
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:06,293
It's nothing.

928
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,252
Be right back.

929
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:13,133
Hello?

930
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:18,732
Hello?

931
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,690
Where's Anna?

932
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,010
What's the matter?

933
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:09,250
Is everything okay?

934
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,289
Anna.

935
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:26,848
Anna?

936
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:31,009
Anna? Anna!

937
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:34,688
Oh, man! It just pulled over
to the side of the road.

938
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:39,328
I'm winning! Yes!

939
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,169
Who is this, Pumpkin?

940
01:16:42,207 --> 01:16:44,087
This is Tony. He lives here.

941
01:16:46,888 --> 01:16:48,608
Anna. It's time to go.

942
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:49,727
Say goodbye to your friend. Why?

943
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:50,928
Come on. Let's go.

944
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:52,167
What's the matter?

945
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:53,407
That's Martin and Judy's son.

946
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:54,447
So?

947
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:56,767
He died two years ago.

948
01:16:57,648 --> 01:16:58,608
Who died?

949
01:16:58,728 --> 01:16:59,727
Nobody.

950
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:01,287
Anna!

951
01:17:03,326 --> 01:17:04,367
Mommy!

952
01:17:06,726 --> 01:17:07,887
Mommy!

953
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,767
Put the gun down.
You'll hurt someone.

954
01:17:09,847 --> 01:17:11,406
Take Tony to our
room until this is over.

955
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,366
How much time do we have? What?

956
01:17:13,446 --> 01:17:14,406
How much time do we have?

957
01:17:14,486 --> 01:17:15,806
You have to understand.
I owe them everything.

958
01:17:15,887 --> 01:17:17,114
How much time do
we have, Martin?

959
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,286
Mommy!

960
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:21,246
The minute you
step off the property.

961
01:17:22,446 --> 01:17:24,526
They called an hour
before you got here.

962
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:26,846
How could you do
that to a child?

963
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:28,926
What?
We saved his life!

964
01:17:29,006 --> 01:17:30,765
You wouldn't have done the
same for your own daughter?

965
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,925
No. Not like that.

966
01:17:33,005 --> 01:17:35,366
One day, he won't even remember
what he used to look like.

967
01:17:35,445 --> 01:17:36,726
That he was ever
sick to begin with.

968
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:38,246
What about the other family?

969
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:41,164
What other family?

970
01:17:41,805 --> 01:17:42,805
He doesn't know.

971
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:44,365
How do you not know
where a body comes from?

972
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:45,845
A lab!

973
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:51,644
Genetically engineered.
Grown in a test tube.

974
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:55,805
That's somebody else's
son up there, Martin.

975
01:17:58,764 --> 01:18:00,364
A son they thought they buried.

976
01:18:04,324 --> 01:18:05,284
No.

977
01:18:12,204 --> 01:18:13,724
God damn it.

978
01:18:17,004 --> 01:18:19,003
The garage. I can get
to it from the inside?

979
01:18:22,043 --> 01:18:23,003
Okay.

980
01:18:24,523 --> 01:18:25,763
You're gonna take Anna.

981
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:27,044
- Wait, wait. What?
- You're gonna head through the fields

982
01:18:27,123 --> 01:18:28,403
until you get to the highway,
and you don't stop.

983
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:29,556
And what are you going to do?

984
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:30,562
Are you listening to me?

985
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:32,830
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You got a car that I can use?

986
01:18:33,603 --> 01:18:36,682
Take the SUV.
The windows are tinted.

987
01:18:38,842 --> 01:18:41,082
I'll take them. Through the
woods, there's a path.

988
01:18:41,162 --> 01:18:42,122
I'll show you.

989
01:18:42,602 --> 01:18:43,962
- Go. He's gonna help you.
- What? Mark?

990
01:18:44,043 --> 01:18:45,882
Why do we trust him now?
We don't have a choice.

991
01:18:45,963 --> 01:18:47,611
What? Why?
We don't have a choice.

992
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:53,082
There's a truck stop off 180. If you
make it, we'll be there till midnight.

993
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:57,561
Thank you.

994
01:18:58,602 --> 01:18:59,721
Thank you.

995
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,000
They're heading your way.

996
01:20:44,477 --> 01:20:45,516
I've got a visual.

997
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:51,515
He's alone!
There's no one in the car.

998
01:20:52,116 --> 01:20:53,343
Go check the back of that house.

999
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:49,030
There's a car!

1000
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,270
What?

1001
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:52,310
No! No, wait!

1002
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:02,110
Wait!

1003
01:23:03,671 --> 01:23:04,630
Stop!

1004
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:11,269
Anna!

1005
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,590
Mommy! Mommy!

1006
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:13,949
No!

1007
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:16,429
No! Anna! Anna!

1008
01:24:19,787 --> 01:24:21,065
Where are they, Martin?

1009
01:24:21,146 --> 01:24:22,985
I fell behind...
Where are they?

1010
01:24:23,066 --> 01:24:25,546
She and the girl rushed
ahead to flag down a ride,

1011
01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:26,626
and they ran right into them.

1012
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:27,946
He'll kill them both. He
won't think twice about it.

1013
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:30,265
It was over before I could do anything.
I did everything...

1014
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:31,505
How could you let them go?

1015
01:24:31,585 --> 01:24:32,666
So sorry.

1016
01:24:32,745 --> 01:24:33,825
Martin.

1017
01:24:42,905 --> 01:24:44,665
Are you okay?

1018
01:24:49,704 --> 01:24:50,704
Albright's card.

1019
01:24:52,584 --> 01:24:54,345
"They can help you."
That was you.

1020
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:56,945
Wasn't it?
Yes.

1021
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,504
Why?

1022
01:24:58,585 --> 01:24:59,904
I rode your coattails
for 40 years.

1023
01:24:59,983 --> 01:25:03,544
I thought I was repaying you
for the life you've given me.

1024
01:25:05,064 --> 01:25:06,264
I should never have sent it.

1025
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,103
I should never have said yes.

1026
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:16,303
So much for the
wisdom of experience.

1027
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:19,783
God damn it.

1028
01:25:20,743 --> 01:25:22,663
How are the seizures?

1029
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:29,942
Tony used to get those, too.

1030
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:36,263
This should be enough
to hold you over.

1031
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:42,343
Until when?

1032
01:25:43,382 --> 01:25:46,382
I had the pills
reverse-engineered.

1033
01:25:47,662 --> 01:25:49,221
Jesus.

1034
01:25:49,341 --> 01:25:50,902
Judy was scared we'd run out,

1035
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:56,021
and I couldn't stand the idea of
Albright having so much control over us.

1036
01:25:57,261 --> 01:25:58,541
A day and a half to Mexico.

1037
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:02,421
A few grand for a pharma plant
to make you a six-month supply.

1038
01:26:02,902 --> 01:26:06,581
And you're home free, Damian.
A new beginning.

1039
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:10,060
That little girl...

1040
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:17,740
She's the same age as Claire
was when I moved out.

1041
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,220
We have no idea
where Albright operates.

1042
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:30,060
Even if you wanted to,
you'll never find them.

1043
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,099
Twelve hours.

1044
01:26:40,019 --> 01:26:41,379
No pills.

1045
01:26:44,618 --> 01:26:47,139
No matter how bad it looks,
I need to stay under.

1046
01:26:51,299 --> 01:26:53,779
When Albright brought
Mark to his facility,

1047
01:26:54,739 --> 01:26:56,298
he brought him there to die.

1048
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:58,738
No reason to hide it.

1049
01:26:59,139 --> 01:27:00,658
If I do this,

1050
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:06,578
maybe I get a glimpse of
something, anything, important.

1051
01:27:08,018 --> 01:27:09,579
Bye, baby.
Blow Daddy a kiss...

1052
01:27:14,058 --> 01:27:16,321
Are you just gonna stand there,
or are you going to help me?

1053
01:27:38,577 --> 01:27:39,857
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bitwell.

1054
01:27:42,976 --> 01:27:44,971
We must have you
lying down, please, sir.

1055
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:06,215
We're looking for an abandoned warehouse.

1056
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:08,455
Really?
Yeah.

1057
01:28:08,896 --> 01:28:11,615
You have any idea how many of
those there are in New Orleans?

1058
01:28:11,775 --> 01:28:12,735
Yeah.

1059
01:28:16,455 --> 01:28:19,135
But how many of them
store Mardi Gras floats?

1060
01:28:24,094 --> 01:28:26,014
You still have the boat?

1061
01:29:06,853 --> 01:29:08,892
Leonard, where are you at?
We need you inside, man.

1062
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,652
Copy that. I'm heading
inside right now.

1063
01:31:02,486 --> 01:31:04,596
You should have
seen him when I first met him.

1064
01:31:12,646 --> 01:31:15,926
He was torn to
pieces in a Russian prison riot.

1065
01:31:16,807 --> 01:31:19,407
I could have let him die,
but I saved him.

1066
01:31:19,486 --> 01:31:21,405
And I've resurrected him
three times since then.

1067
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:23,965
And each time, he's more loyal.

1068
01:31:24,486 --> 01:31:26,406
More grateful.

1069
01:31:26,806 --> 01:31:27,846
Where are they?

1070
01:31:28,926 --> 01:31:34,285
Well, we have a client that
Madeline is a perfect match for.

1071
01:31:34,885 --> 01:31:38,005
And the girl's
organs will not be wasted.

1072
01:31:42,405 --> 01:31:45,685
Yes, it was built to withstand
500,000 milligray of radiation.

1073
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:47,404
It's quite bulletproof.

1074
01:31:48,005 --> 01:31:51,804
You know, Damian, every
medical advance has a cost.

1075
01:31:53,044 --> 01:31:54,804
These choices that you're
making and what you're doing,

1076
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,803
they don't make you a savior.
You know that, right?

1077
01:31:58,085 --> 01:31:59,363
They make you a psychopath.

1078
01:32:00,804 --> 01:32:02,884
I understand that
you feel that way.

1079
01:32:04,404 --> 01:32:08,204
Initially, I tried for years to
grow the vessels. Of course I did.

1080
01:32:09,443 --> 01:32:12,484
But my failure
held everything up.

1081
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:14,323
Eventually, I'll succeed.

1082
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,900
And all this unpleasantness
will be seen

1083
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:18,962
as nothing more than
birth pangs, I'm sure.

1084
01:32:20,403 --> 01:32:23,003
Now, as you can see, we had
prepped the body

1085
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,683
of a 40-year-old
accountant for Anton.

1086
01:32:24,763 --> 01:32:27,802
But it seems that
Mark's comes hard-wired

1087
01:32:27,882 --> 01:32:29,682
with some very useful instincts.

1088
01:32:29,763 --> 01:32:31,683
I'm sorry, Damian, I really am.

1089
01:32:33,242 --> 01:32:36,083
But it's about time that
someone worthy made use of it.

1090
01:32:39,282 --> 01:32:40,242
Please, don't struggle.

1091
01:32:40,402 --> 01:32:42,402
As you can hear, Anton
doesn't have much time.

1092
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:43,763
Clear!

1093
01:33:44,278 --> 01:33:45,319
Hello.

1094
01:33:46,759 --> 01:33:48,079
Can you hear me?

1095
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:53,359
Can you tell me your name?

1096
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,238
What's your name?

1097
01:33:56,638 --> 01:33:57,919
Anton.

1098
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:04,518
How many children do you have?

1099
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:13,038
None.

1100
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:17,197
Just a couple of pictures I
downloaded from the Internet.

1101
01:34:21,118 --> 01:34:22,157
Carry on.

1102
01:34:26,677 --> 01:34:29,197
The woman? Where is she?

1103
01:34:31,317 --> 01:34:32,996
She's down the hall in storage.

1104
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:35,996
Good.

1105
01:34:36,516 --> 01:34:37,876
Give me your gun.

1106
01:34:37,997 --> 01:34:39,317
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1107
01:34:40,397 --> 01:34:42,956
I've had my legs torn off
and I've been burned alive.

1108
01:34:43,556 --> 01:34:46,316
Give me your gun.
Come on. Let's go.

1109
01:35:19,954 --> 01:35:21,234
Daddy?

1110
01:35:22,275 --> 01:35:23,354
Damian.

1111
01:35:32,634 --> 01:35:34,074
No, no! Please!

1112
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:35,554
Hey. It's okay.

1113
01:35:36,034 --> 01:35:37,034
It's okay.

1114
01:35:39,753 --> 01:35:40,789
It's okay. It's time to go.

1115
01:35:40,913 --> 01:35:42,273
Damian?
Yeah. Come on.

1116
01:35:43,713 --> 01:35:45,034
Who's Damian?

1117
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:53,553
Hey, I'm just a technician.

1118
01:35:54,393 --> 01:35:55,393
Go.

1119
01:36:29,071 --> 01:36:32,151
Baby.
Okay. It's okay.

1120
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:41,631
No metal.

1121
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:45,310
You see, sometimes I do listen
to the doctor's orders.

1122
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:49,030
Well played.

1123
01:36:51,551 --> 01:36:52,750
But...

1124
01:36:55,230 --> 01:37:00,030
If you kill me,
you commit suicide.

1125
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:03,110
Because without
the full course of

1126
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:05,909
those pills, well, you relapse.

1127
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:08,309
You relapse.

1128
01:37:09,629 --> 01:37:12,749
And we both know who
takes over, don't we?

1129
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:19,389
You see, I'm the only one
with the answers, Damian.

1130
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:23,029
You need me.

1131
01:37:26,428 --> 01:37:30,428
I'm the only one
standing between you

1132
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:32,789
and oblivion.

1133
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:57,027
25% promazine,

1134
01:37:58,267 --> 01:37:59,467
30% olanzapine,

1135
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:01,107
15% Trileptal,

1136
01:38:01,467 --> 01:38:06,107
15% valproic acid,
and 5% phenobarbital.

1137
01:38:39,105 --> 01:38:40,184
Okay.

1138
01:38:41,785 --> 01:38:42,745
Hey.

1139
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:46,224
Guess what?
Do you like boats?

1140
01:38:46,385 --> 01:38:48,345
Mmm-hmm. About a half
a mile down that way,

1141
01:38:48,425 --> 01:38:49,704
there's a boat waiting for you.

1142
01:38:49,784 --> 01:38:53,024
White sandy beaches
and turquoise water await.

1143
01:38:53,944 --> 01:38:55,424
Aren't you
coming with us, Daddy?

1144
01:39:04,024 --> 01:39:05,143
I don't think so, Pumpkin.

1145
01:39:07,304 --> 01:39:08,264
Why?

1146
01:39:08,704 --> 01:39:10,143
Come here, baby.

1147
01:39:10,263 --> 01:39:11,704
Why, Mommy?

1148
01:39:12,983 --> 01:39:14,063
It's okay.

1149
01:39:18,103 --> 01:39:19,863
Why isn't Daddy coming?

1150
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:23,143
Are you still mad at him?

1151
01:39:23,382 --> 01:39:27,503
He knows your birthday, Mommy.
Ask him. Ask him.

1152
01:39:42,262 --> 01:39:43,502
If you're looking to volunteer,

1153
01:39:43,622 --> 01:39:44,965
there's a sign-up
sheet by the door.

1154
01:39:45,502 --> 01:39:46,462
Thanks.

1155
01:39:58,421 --> 01:39:59,461
Hello.

1156
01:40:00,981 --> 01:40:02,261
I'm Ed Kidner.

1157
01:40:02,781 --> 01:40:04,502
I was a friend of your father's.

1158
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:09,141
May I sit?

1159
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,741
Sure.

1160
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:21,300
I spent a lot of time with him.

1161
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,740
At the end, in particular.

1162
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,739
I know that you two,
you weren't always close.

1163
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,539
If you could hear him
talk about you, he was

1164
01:40:34,859 --> 01:40:36,019
proud.

1165
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,578
Um, I have something for you.

1166
01:40:51,219 --> 01:40:52,619
It's just, uh...

1167
01:40:54,218 --> 01:40:56,658
I think he regretted not being
around when you were growing up.

1168
01:40:56,738 --> 01:40:58,539
He knows that he could never

1169
01:41:00,618 --> 01:41:01,979
make that right.

1170
01:41:02,659 --> 01:41:05,058
Sometimes I think
he made the mistake

1171
01:41:05,137 --> 01:41:07,218
of thinking his checkbook
could solve everything.

1172
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:13,417
This is a letter.

1173
01:41:15,297 --> 01:41:17,178
Some things that he should have

1174
01:41:17,257 --> 01:41:18,897
said to you while he was alive.

1175
01:41:20,058 --> 01:41:21,337
To read, um,

1176
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:24,537
whenever.

1177
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:27,697
Whenever you like.

1178
01:41:31,696 --> 01:41:33,056
Thank you.

1179
01:41:39,217 --> 01:41:42,016
Listen, I need to
get back to work.

1180
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,136
Of course. You have
important work to do.

1181
01:41:47,216 --> 01:41:48,256
I should be going, too.

1182
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:51,695
Claire.

1183
01:41:52,576 --> 01:41:53,855
Good luck.

1184
01:43:41,931 --> 01:43:44,650
Hi, Mark.
Welcome to the Caribbean.

1185
01:43:45,171 --> 01:43:46,490
My name is Damian Hale.

1186
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:48,450
And I'm the guy
who bought your body.

1187
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:52,730
<i>A let's happened
since you've been gone.</i>

1188
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:54,810
And you're gonna
find that out in time.

1189
01:43:54,891 --> 01:43:56,289
But I just want to thank you for

1190
01:43:56,449 --> 01:43:57,849
these months that
you've given me.

1191
01:44:05,849 --> 01:44:07,769
I haven't taken
one of those in days.

1192
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:11,449
I've been going through
withdrawals on that bed.

1193
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,128
Behind you. Waiting.

1194
01:44:14,968 --> 01:44:17,209
Waiting. Waiting for
you to take over.

1195
01:44:17,848 --> 01:44:19,888
And I can already
feel myself fading.

1196
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:23,369
And soon, I'll be gone.

1197
01:44:32,569 --> 01:44:33,727
Welcome back, Mark.

1198
01:44:38,128 --> 01:44:40,488
You take good care
of Maddie and Anna.

1199
01:45:06,526 --> 01:45:07,527
Damian?

1200
01:45:12,646 --> 01:45:13,765
Hey.

1201
01:45:22,485 --> 01:45:23,486
Mark?

1202
01:45:25,205 --> 01:45:27,046
Yeah. Yeah.

1203
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:32,165
It's you? Yes?

1204
01:45:34,885 --> 01:45:36,005
Anna!

1205
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:37,285
Daddy!
