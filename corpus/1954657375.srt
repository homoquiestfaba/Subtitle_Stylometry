1
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,300
my poor boy.

2
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,660


3
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,360


4
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,670
look here, love.

5
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,840
this ring was my mother's.

6
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,780
take it, heart.

7
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,750
but keep it till you
woo another wife,
when imogen is dead.

8
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,520
how?

9
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,690
how another?
give me but this.

10
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,360
i have.

11
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,060
remain.

12
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,800
remain thou here,
while sense can keep it on.

13
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,640
for my sake...

14
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,440
wear this.

15
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,910


16
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,630
thou basest thing,
avoid hence, from my sight.

17
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,340
if after this command
thou fraught the court
with thy unworthiness,

18
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,550
thou diest.

19
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,650
away.

20
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,590
thou art poison to my blood.

21
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,500
disloyal thing
that shouldst repair my youth,

22
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,570
thou heapst
a year's age on me.

23
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,640
- i chose an eagle.
- thou took'st a beggar,

24
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,480
wouldst have made
my throne a seat
of baseness.

25
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,550
it is your fault
that i have loved posthumus.

26
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,020
you bred him
as my playfellow.

27
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,590
what, art thou mad?

28
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,460
hmm...

29
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,430
almost.

30
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,440
thou foolish thing.

31
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,460
they were again together.

32
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,600
you have not done
after our command.

33
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,900
away with her
and pen her up.

34
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,780
leave us to ourselves,

35
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,780
and make yourself some comfort
out of your best advice.

36
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,450
let her languish
a drop of blood a day,

37
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,460
and, being aged,
die of this folly.

38
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,230


39
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,250


40
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,660
no, be assured

41
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,490
you shall not find me,

42
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,060
after the slander
of most stepmothers,

43
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,730
evil-eyed unto you.

44
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,170
you are my prisoner,

45
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,540
but the jailer
shall deliver you the key.

46
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,820


47
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,240
that she should love
this fellow and refuse me.

48
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,280
she is damned.

49
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,650
her brains and her beauty
go not together.

50
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,090
she shines not upon fools.

51
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,860
he hath been
your faithful servant.

52
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,330
i dare lay my honor
he will remain so.

53
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,290
i beseech you, be better
known to this gentleman,

54
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,400
whom i commend to you
as a noble friend of mine.

55
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
his father and i were
soldiers together.

56
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,230
sir, we have known
each other in orleans.

57
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,740
by your pardon, i was
then a young traveler.

58
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,410
but upon my mended judgment,
if i offend not
to say it is mended,

59
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,940
my quarrel was not
altogether slight.

60
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,980
can we with manners
ask what was the difference?

61
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,850
safely, i think.
it was a contention in public.

62
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,950
where each of us fell in praise
of our country mistresses,

63
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,420
this gentlemen
at that time vouching...

64
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,360
and upon warrant
of bloody affirmation...

65
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,300
his to be more fair,
virtuous, wise,

66
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,200
chaste, constant,
qualified,

67
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,000
and less attemptable
than any of the rarest
of the ladies in france.

68
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,470
that lady is not now living,

69
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,280
or that gentleman's opinion
by this worn out.

70
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,110
she holds her virtue still,
and i my mind.

71
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,180
if she went before
others i have seen,

72
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,120
as that diamond of yours
outlusters many i have beheld,

73
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,150
i could not but believe
she excelled many.

74
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,390
but i have not seen the most
precious diamond that is,

75
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,930
- nor you the lady.
- i praised her as i rated her.

76
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,860
- so do i my stone.
- what do you esteem it at?

77
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,500

more than the world enjoys.

78
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,100
mm. your mistress
is now either dead

79
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,310
or out-prized by a trifle.

80
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,340
you are mistaken.

81
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,950
the ring may be sold or given.

82
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,750
the other is not
a thing for sale,

83
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,020
and only a gift of the gods.

84
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,860
which the gods
have given you?

85
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,490
posthumus: which,
by their graces, i will keep.

86
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,760
you may wear her
in title yours,

87
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,100
but you know strange fowl
light on neighboring ponds.

88
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,170
let us leave here, gentleman.

89
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,240
iachimo: no, no, no.

90
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,810
i dare pawn my estate
to your ring,

91
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,210
which in my opinion
overvalues it something.

92
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,510
but i make my wager rather
against your confidence

93
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,850
than her reputation.

94
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,820
what lady would
you choose to assail?

95
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,220
yours, whom in constancy
you think so safe.

96
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,260
i lay ten thousand
to your ring

97
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,860
that, commend me to the
court where your lady is,

98
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,100
with no more advantage
than opportunity
for a second conference,

99
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,870
and i will take that honor
of hers from thence

100
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,010
which you imagine so reserved.

101
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,080
even if you buy ladies'
flesh at a million a dram,

102
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,550
you cannot prevent it
from tainting.

103
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,820
i dare you to this match.
here is my ring.

104
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,030
if i bring you no sufficient
testimony that i have enjoyed

105
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,400
the dearest bodily part
of your mistress,

106
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,170
my ten thousand are yours,
and so your ring.

107
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,440
enough of this.
let it die as it were born.

108
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
i embrace these conditions.
let us have articles betwixt us.

109
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,080


110
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,150
posthumus: if you
make your voyage upon her

111
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,920
and give to me directly
you have prevailed,

112
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,520
i am no further your enemy.
she is not worth the debate.

113
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,590
if she remains unseduced,
for your ill opinion

114
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,860
and the assault you have made
to her chastity...

115
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,270
you will answer my sword.

116
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,310
your hand, a covenant.

117
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,660


118
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,930
master doctor.

119
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,100
have you brought
those drugs?

120
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,670
pleaseth your highness, ay.

121
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,020
here they are, madam.

122
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,030
but i beseech your grace,
my conscience bids me ask,

123
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,260
wherefore you
have commanded of me

124
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,470
these most
poisonous compounds,

125
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,000
which are the movers
of a languishing death,

126
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,410
but though slow, deadly.

127
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,710
i will test the forces
of these thy compounds

128
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,410
on such creatures as we
count not worth the hanging,

129
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,480
but none human.

130
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,450


131
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,200
no further service, doctor,
until i send for thee.

132
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,740
good morrow to your majesty.

133
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,170
ambassador's from rome.

134
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,210
caius lucius.

135
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,210
a most worthy fellow.

136
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,480
albeit he comes
on angry purpose now.

137
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,720
but that's no fault of his.

138
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,120
we must receive him according
to the honor of his sender.

139
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,530
our dear son,
we will have need to employ you

140
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,130
towards this roman.

141
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,740


142
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,710
why should we pay tribute?

143
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,780
if caesar can hide the sun
from us with a blanket

144
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,320
or put the moon
in his pocket,

145
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,760
we will pay him tribute
for light.

146
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,290
else, sir,
no more tribute.

147
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,400
you must know,
till the injurious romans

148
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,110
did extort this tribute
from us, we were free.

149
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,110
caesar's ambition,
which swelled so much

150
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,540
it almost stretched
the sides of the world,

151
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,250
against all color here
did put the yoke upon us,

152
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,720
which to shake off
becomes a warlike people.

153
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,320
whom we reckon
ourselves to be.

154
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,530
i am sorry, cymbeline,
that i am to pronounce

155
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,800
augustus caesar thine enemy.

156
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,100
our subjects, sir,
will not endure his yoke,

157
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,870
and for ourself to show
less sovereignty than they

158
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,570
must needs appear un-kinglike.

159
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,680
receive it from me, then:
war and confusion.

160
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,850
fury not to be resisted.

161
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,150
the event is yet
to name the winner.

162
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,190
fare thee well.

163
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,900
we will nothing pay
for wearing our noses.

164
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,610
he goes hence frowning,

165
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,190
but it honors us that
we have given him cause.

166
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,310


167
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,610
imogen: o, that husband,

168
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,610
my supreme crown of grief.

169
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,360


170
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,710
amy: a noble gentleman
of rome comes from
my lord with letters.

171
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,280
the worthy posthumus
is in safety

172
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,350
and greets
your highness dearly.

173
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,990
thanks, good sir.

174
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,560
you're kindly welcome.

175
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,040
- his health, beseech you?
- well, madam.

176
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,310
is he disposed to mirth?
i hope he is.

177
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,720
there's none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome.

178
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,020
he is called the reveler.

179
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,760
when he was here
he did incline to sadness,

180
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,090
and ofttimes not knowing why.

181
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
i never saw him sad.

182
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,400
you look on me.

183
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,970
what wrack discern you
in me deserves your pity?

184
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,570


185
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,810
lamentable.

186
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,780
- why do you pity me?
- that others do.

187
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,360
i was about to say, enjoy...

188
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,890
but it is an office of the gods
to avenge it, not mine
to speak on it.

189
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,000
you do seem
to know something of me,

190
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,070
or what concerns me.

191
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,570
pray you, since
fearing things go ill

192
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,410
often hurts more
than to be sure they do,

193
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,110
for certainties are either past
remedies or timely knowing,

194
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,440
the remedy then born, just...

195
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,980
discover to me what
you both spur and stop.

196
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,890
had i this cheek
to bathe my lips upon;

197
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,430
this hand, whose touch,
whose every touch,

198
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,070
would force the feeler's
soul to the oath of loyalty;

199
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,840
this object which takes prisoner
the wild motions of mine eye,

200
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,110
and fixes it only here,
should i, damned then,

201
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,470
slaver with lips...

202
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
as common as stairs
that mount the capital,

203
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
it were fit all
the plagues of hell

204
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,180
should at one time
encounter such revolt.

205
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,990
o dearest soul,
thy cause doth strike

206
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,760
my heart with a pity
that makes me sick.

207
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,460
a lady, so fair,
and fastened to an empery

208
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,830
that would
the greatest king double,

209
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,560
to be partnered
with... with tomboys...

210
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,640
diseased ventures

211
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,980
and such boiled stuff
as might well poison poison.

212
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,780
be revenged,

213
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,950
or she that bore you
was no queen,

214
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,590
and you recoil
from your great stock.

215
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,520


216
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,720
revenged?

217
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,030
how should i be revenged?

218
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,600
if this be true,
how should i be revenged?

219
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,530
i dedicate myself
to your sweet pleasure.

220
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,670
more noble than that
renegade from your bed.

221
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,680
and will continue fast to your
affection still close as sure.

222
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,550
let me my service tender

223
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,910
on your lips.

224
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,770
i do condemn mine ears that
hath attended thee so long.

225
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,540
pisanio.

226
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,280
the king my father shall be
made acquainted of thy assault.

227
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,750
and if he shall think it fit
a saucy stranger in his court

228
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,550
to expound his
beastly mind to us,

229
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,920
then he hath a court he little
cares for and a daughter

230
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,860
who he not respects at all.

231
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
give me your pardon.

232
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,270
i... i spoke this to know

233
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,300
if your affiance
were deeply rooted,

234
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,940
and shall make your lord
that which he is, new o'er.

235
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,310
he is one
of the truest mannered,

236
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,680
he... 

237
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,780
such a holy witch

238
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,920
as might enchants
societies unto him.

239
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,790
half all men's
hearts are his.

240
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,730
he sits among men
like a descended god.

241
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,070
he hath a... a kind
of honor about him,

242
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,640
sets him off more
than a mortal seeming.

243
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,670
be not angry,
most mighty princess,

244
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,040
that i have adventured your
taking of a false report.

245
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,110
the love i bear him

246
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,820
made me to fan you thus.

247
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,890


248
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,870
but the gods made you,
unlike all the others.

249
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,740
pray, your pardon.

250
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,610
all's well, sir.

251
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,190
take my power
in the court of yours.

252
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,800
uh, i had but...

253
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,630
i almost forgot, uh...

254
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,200
what is it?

255
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,240
some dozen of us and your lord,

256
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,410
the best feather in our wing,

257
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,940
have mingled sums
to buy a present.

258
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,250
and i am somewhat curious
to have safe storage.

259
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,850
may it please you
to take it in protection?

260
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,350
for this night only.
i must aboard tomorrow.

261
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,420
willingly.

262
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,430


263
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,810
oh, the gentlemen
are talking

264
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,710
and the midnight moon
is on the riverside

265
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
they're drinking up

266
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,750
and walking

267
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,290
and it is time

268
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,330
for me to slide

269
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:26,330
i live in another world

270
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,400
where life
and death are memorized

271
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,010
where the earth is strung

272
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,040
with lovers' pearls

273
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,780
and all i see

274
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,020
are dark eyes

275
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,760
i do not like her.

276
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,830
she doth think
she has strange,

277
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,770
lingering poisons.

278
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:05,370
i do know her spirit,
and will not trust

279
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,510
one of her malice.

280
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,810
they tell me...

281
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,410
with a drug
of such damned nature.

282
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,750
where they stand
i'm sure it is

283
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,820
but i feel nothing

284
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,090
for their game

285
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,260
where beauty
goes unrecognized

286
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,130
all i feel

287
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,300
is heat and flame

288
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,010
and all i see

289
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,180
are dark eyes

290
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,850


291
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,150


292
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,890
the french girl

293
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,890
she's in paradise

294
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,530
and a drunken man

295
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,570
is at the wheel

296
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,500
hunger pays

297
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,810
a heavy price

298
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,840
to the fallen gods

299
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,210
of speed and steel

300
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,150
the time is short

301
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,280
and the days are sweet

302
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,120
and passion rules

303
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,590
the arrow that flies

304
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,130
a million faces

305
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,860
at my feet

306
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,830
but all i see

307
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,270
are dark

308
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,010
eyes

309
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,980


310
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,470
iachimo: the crickets sing,

311
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,100
and man's over-labored sense

312
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,910
repairs itself by rest.

313
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,140
our tarquin thus

314
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,210
did softly press the rushes,

315
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,920
ere he wakened
the chastity he wounded.

316
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,220
how bravely thou becomest
thy bed, fresh lily,

317
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,690
and whiter than the sheets,

318
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,660
that i might touch.

319
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,100

320
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,570
but kiss; one kiss.

321
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,700
mmm...

322
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,170
but my design,

323
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,310
come off... come off...

324
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,070
on her left breast,
a mole cinque-spotted,

325
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,770
like the crimson drops
in the bottom of a cowslip:

326
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,740
here's a voucher, stronger
than ever law could make:

327
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,080
this secret will force him
think i have pick'd the lock

328
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,710
and taken the treasure.

329
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,020
no more.

330
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,420
to what end?

331
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,420
i have enough.

332
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,260
i live in fear.

333
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,030
though this a heavenly angel...

334
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,570
hell is here.

335
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,140


336
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,090
i do think i saw it
this morning.

337
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,460
confident i am.

338
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,260
last night 'twas on mine arm.
i kissed it.

339
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,760
twill not be lost.

340
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,570
good morrow, fairest...

341
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,470
sister.
your sweet hand.

342
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,770
still i swear i love you.

343
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,110
i pray you, spare me.

344
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:50,080
i will unfold equal discourtesy
to your best kindness.

345
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,190
- to leave you in your madness
'twere my sin.
- stop!

346
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,390
i shall not.

347
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,160
fools cure not mad folks.

348
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,160
your lady is one of the fairest
i have looked upon.

349
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,600
for you.

350
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,200
was caius lucius in the court
when you were there?

351
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,210
he was expected,
but not approached.

352
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,880
i'll make a journey twice as far
to enjoy a second night

353
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,150
of such sweet shortness
which was mine.

354
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,250
for the ring is won.

355
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,190
your lady being so easy.

356
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,190
uh, if you can
make it apparent

357
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,360
that you have
tasted her in bed,

358
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,370
my hand and ring
are yours.

359
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,540
if not, the foul opinion
you had of her pure honor

360
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,170
gains or loses,
your sword or mine.

361
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,540
first, her bedchamber,

362
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,680
where i confess i slept not,

363
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,750
but profess had that

364
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,780
which was well worth watching.

365
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,960
let it be granted
you have seen all this,

366
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,830
the description of
what is in her chamber

367
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,200
nothing saves
the wager you have laid.

368
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,440
uh...

369
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,810
see.

370
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,940
this must be married
to your diamond.

371
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,450
let me behold it.

372
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,250
is it that which
i left with her?

373
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,320
she gave it me,
she said she prized it once.

374
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,930
maybe she plucked it off
to send to me.

375
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,390
hm...

376
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
she writes you so,
doth she?

377
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,240


378
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,770
no.

379
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,910


380
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
'tis true.

381
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,390
here.

382
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,690
take this too.

383
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,290
it kills me to look on it.

384
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,330
let there be no... honor

385
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,300
where semblance, truth,

386
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,340
where beauty, love,

387
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,770
where there's another man.
the vows of women...

388
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,340
take your ring again.

389
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,710
'tis not yet won.

390
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,620
it may be probable
that she has lost it

391
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,320
or, who knows,
if one of her women,

392
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,020
being corrupted,
hath stolen it from her.

393
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,820
very true.

394
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,360
she would not lose it.

395
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,470
all of her attendants
are sworn and honorable.

396
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,440
they induced to steal it,
and by a stranger?

397
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,040
no!

398
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,970
he hath enjoyed her.

399
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,910
she hath bought the name
of whore thus dearly.

400
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,910
if you desire further
satisfaction,

401
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,950
under her breast,
worthy the pressing,

402
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,690
lies there a mole, right proud
of that most delicate lodging.

403
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,960
by my life i swear...

404
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,090
i kissed it,

405
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,730
and though full it gave me
present hunger to feed again.

406
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,500
do you do remember
this stain upon her?

407
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,370
ay.

408
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,340
and it doth confirm
another stain

409
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,350
as big as hell can hold.

410
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,410
shall you hear more?

411
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,520


412
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,790
o, that i had her here,

413
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,660
to tear her limbmeal.

414
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,900
i will go there,

415
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,870
then do it in the court
before her father!

416
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,870
from posthumus.

417
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,810
"justice
and your father's wrath,

418
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,650
should he take me
in his dominion,

419
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,450
could not be so cruel to me
as you, o dearest of creatures,

420
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,420
would even renew me
with your eyes.

421
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,560
take notice that
i am at milford haven.

422
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,530
what your own love will out
of this advise you, follow.

423
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,930
so he wishes you all happiness,
that remains loyal to his vow,

424
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,540
and your increasing love."

425
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,740


426
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,940
o, for a horse with wings!

427
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,210
hear'st thou?

428
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,520
he is at milford haven.


429
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,220
read, and tell me how far it is.

430
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,890
and how may we steal from hence,
and for the gap and our return,
to excuse.

431
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,700
but first, how get hence?

432
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,770
speak. how many miles?

433
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,870
twenty miles 'twixt
sun and sun, madam.

434
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,240
it's enough for you
and too much too.

435
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,020
arviragus: we have seen nothing;
we are beastly.

436
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,520
belarius: how you speak.

437
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,660
o boys, this story
the world may read in me:

438
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,570
my body's marked
with roman swords.

439
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,770
my report was once first
with the best of note:

440
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,850
cymbeline loved me,

441
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,680
and when a soldier
was the theme,

442
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,520
my name was not far off:
then was i as a tree.

443
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,530
belarius: villains,
whose false oaths prevailed

444
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,270
before my perfect honor,

445
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:25,200
swore to cymbeline i was
confederate with the romans:

446
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,140
o cymbeline! heaven
and my conscience knows

447
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,840
thou didst unjustly banish me:

448
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,310
whereon, at three and two years
old, i stole these boys.

449
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,020
and this twenty years
this rock has been my world;

450
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,550
where i have lived
at honest freedom,

451
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,320
paid more pious debts
to heaven

452
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,130
than in all
the fore-end of my time.

453
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,130
these boys know little
they are sons to the king;

454
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,970
nor cymbeline dreams
that they are alive.

455
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:00,240
they think they are mine; and
though trained up thus meanly

456
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,580
their thoughts do hit
the roofs of palaces.

457
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,330
posthumus: o, vengeance,
vengeance.

458
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,660
could i find out
the woman's part in me...

459
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,670
for there's no motion
that tends to vice in man,

460
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,730
but i affirm it
is the woman's part.

461
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,780
be it lying, note it,

462
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,250
the woman's; flattering, hers;

463
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,950
deceiving, hers;

464
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,230
lust and rank thoughts,
hers, hers;

465
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,730
revenges, hers.

466
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,300
ambitions, covetings,

467
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,670
change of prides, disdain,

468
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,640
slanders, mutability.

469
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,750
all faults that
have a name, hers.

470
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,820
detest them,

471
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,980
curse them.

472
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,260
where is posthumus?

473
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,860
what is in thy mind,
that thee stare thus?

474
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,950
imogen: "thy mistress
hath played the strumpet
in my bed...

475
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,980
the testimonies whereof
lie bleeding in me.

476
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,450
i speak not out of weak surmise
but from proof as strong

477
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,260
as my grief and as certain
as i expect my revenge.

478
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,160
that part, thou, pisanio,

479
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,760
you must act for me."

480
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,840
"if thy faith be not tainted
with the breach of hers,

481
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,840
let thine own hand
take away her life.

482
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,710
if thou fear to strike and
to make me certain it is done,

483
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,050
thou art the pander
to her dishonor

484
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,050
and equally to me disloyal."

485
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,100
false to his bed?

486
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,070
what is it to be false?

487
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,310
to lie there in watch
and to think on him?

488
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,480
no... no, no. on my life.

489
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,180
where's thy knife? where?!

490
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,290
thou art too slow
to do thy master's bidding
when i desire it too.

491
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,190


492
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,470
since i received command
to do this business,

493
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,110
i have not slept one wink.

494
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,880
well, do it, and to bed, then.

495
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,380
i'll wake mine
eyeballs blind first.

496
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,520
why?

497
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,920
why has thou abused so many
miles with a pretense?

498
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,990
this place?
bring me here to kill me?

499
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,530
but to win time.

500
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,330
i have considered a course.
hear me. hear me with patience.

501
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,130
it cannot be but
that my master is abused.

502
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,000
some villain, ay,
and singular in his art,

503
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,380
hath done you both this...
this cursed injury.

504
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,340
i'll give but notice
you are dead,

505
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,280
and send him
some bloody sign of it,

506
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,350
for 'tis commanded
i should do so.

507
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,490
you shall be missed at court,

508
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,020
and that will well confirm it.

509
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,160
now, here's the point:

510
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,600
if you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is,

511
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,900
forget to be a woman.

512
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,570
change.

513
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,890
i see into thy end...

514
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,990
and am almost a man already.

515
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,110


516
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,150


517
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,420


518
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,130
this attempt...
i am soldier to,

519
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,670
and will abide it
with a prince's courage.

520
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,290
from the queen.
what's in't is precious.

521
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,330
a dram of this will
drive away distemper.

522
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,970
we must take a short farewell
lest being missed,

523
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,400
i be suspected of your
carriage from the court.

524
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,940
away, i prithee.

525
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,970
where is our daughter?

526
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,350


527
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,190
call her before us.

528
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,720
since the exile of posthumus,

529
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,190
most retired hath
her life been,

530
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,100
the cure whereof, my lord,
'tis time must do.

531
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,400
where is she?

532
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,040
how can her contempt
be answered?

533
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,140
that man of hers, pisanio,
her old servant,

534
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,540
i have not seen
these two days.

535
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,420
go, look after.

536
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:45,100


537
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,680
pisanio!

538
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,250
come hither! villain.

539
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:07,290
she said upon a time

540
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,400
the bitterness of it
i now belch from my heart...

541
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:17,100
that she held the very garment

542
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,570
of posthumus

543
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:24,540
in more respect
than my noble

544
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,680
and natural person.

545
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,460


546
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,670
where is she?

547
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,870
i will not ask again.

548
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,380
this is the history of my
knowledge touching her flight.

549
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,720
is she with posthumus?

550
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,190
as i think.

551
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,260
how long is't she went
to milford haven?

552
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,900
she can scarce
be there yet.

553
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,340
give me thy hand.

554
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:30,270
hast any of thy master's
garments in thy possession?

555
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,580
the same suit he wore
when he took leave.

556
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,150
fetch that suit hither.

557
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,150
be a voluntary mute
to my design.

558
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,930
go.

559
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,610
with the suit upon my back,

560
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,970
i will ravish her.

561
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,980
first, kill posthumus,

562
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,950
and in her eyes.

563
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,450
there shall she see my valor,

564
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:52,220
which will then be a torment

565
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,260
to her contempt.

566
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,770


567
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,310
cloten: he on the ground,

568
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,680
my speech an insultment

569
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,280
ended on his dead body,

570
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,820
and once my lust hath dined,

571
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,950
which as i say to vex her

572
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:26,590
i will execute in the clothes
that she so praised.

573
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,630
to the court
i'll knock her back.

574
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,880


575
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,510
who's there?

576
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
mm...

577
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,490


578
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,770
an angel here.
no elder than a boy.

579
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:22,640
good masters, harm me not.

580
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,710
before i entered here,
i thought to have begged

581
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,680
or bought what i took.

582
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,910
here's money.

583
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,520
i would have left it
on the board as soon
as i had made my meal

584
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,750
and parted with prayers
for the provider.

585
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,060
money?

586
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,960
all gold and silver
rather turn to dirt.

587
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,830
as 'tis no better reckoned but
of those who worship dirty gods.

588
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,440
i see you're angry.

589
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,970
what's your name?

590
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,610


591
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,990
fidel, sir.

592
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,190
wither bound?

593
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:17,460
to milford haven.

594
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,130
'tis almost night.

595
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,200
you shall have better cheer
ere you depart,

596
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,000
and thanks to sit and eat.

597
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,500
boys, bid him welcome.

598
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,480
i'll love him as a brother.

599
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:50,090

629
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,720
posthumus...

630
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,630
what's thy name?

631
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,640
i am son to the queen.

632
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,280
i am sorry for it,

633
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,820
not seeming
so worthy as thy birth.

634
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,860
art not afeard?

635
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,330
those that i reverence,
those i fear, the wise.

636
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,700
at fools i laugh,
not fear them.

637
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,870


638
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,750


639
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,420
die thy death!

640
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,950


641
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,440
imogen: i am sick.

642
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,170
heartsick.

643
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,110
pisanio,
i'll now taste of thy drug.

644
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,750
what hast thou done?

645
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,480


646
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,390
with his own sword which
he did wave against my throat,

647
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,990
i have taken his head
from him.

648
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:17,930
i'll throw it into
the creek behind our rock,
and let it into the sea.

649
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:21,400
and tell the fishes
he's the queen's son.

650
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,740
he must have
some attendants.

651
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,840
well, 'tis done.

652
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,510


653
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,780
i do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head.

654
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,500
fidel!

655
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,490
thou blessed thing.

656
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:53,490
jove knows what man thou
might'st have made.

657
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,260
why, he but sleeps.

658
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,860
let us bury him.

659
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,340
fear no more

660
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:10,910
the heat o' the sun

661
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,610
nor the furious

662
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:18,280
winter rages

663
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,450
thou thy worldly task

664
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,320
hast done

665
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,360
home art gone

666
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:36,430
and ta'en thy wages

667
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,070
golden lads and girls

668
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,440
all must

669
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,950
as chimney sweepers

670
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:54,550
come to dust

671
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,630
cymbeline: imogen.

672
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:10,000
the prized part
of my comfort, gone,

673
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,670
my queen upon
a desperate bed,

674
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,540
and in a time when
fearful wars point on me.

675
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,620
but for thee, fellow,

676
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,120
who needs must
know of her departure

677
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,930
and dost seem so ignorant.

678
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,350


679
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,720
i beseech your highness,

680
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,150
hold me your loyal servant.

681
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,690
fu manchu: the day that she
went missing, he was here.

682
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,430
i dare be bound he's true,

683
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,960
and shall perform all parts
of his subjection loyally.

684
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,440
the time is troublesome.

685
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,070
we'll slip you for a second.

686
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,310
but our jealousy
does yet depend.

687
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,090


688
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,390


689
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,090


690
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,790


691
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,630
imogen: i hope i dream.

692
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:12,550
the dream's here still.

693
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,220
imogen: even when i wake,
it is without me as within me.

694
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:26,300
not imagined... felt.

695
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:54,760


696
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:59,400
o posthumus!

697
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,460
where is thy head?

698
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,510
where's that?

699
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,680
ay me, where's that?

700
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,480
and left this head on.

701
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,170
the king.

702
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:47,780
his daughter, whom he purposed
to his wife's sole son,

703
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:51,210
a widow that late he married...

704
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,880
hath referred herself

705
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:58,520
to a poor but...
worthy gentleman.

706
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,360
she's wedded,

707
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,790
her husband banished,
she imprisoned.

708
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,360
all is outward sorrow,
though...

709
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,400
i think the king
be touched at very heart.

710
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,440
what's his name and birth?

711
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,580
his father was
called sicilius,

712
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,680
who did join his honor
against the romans

713
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,920
and had, besides this gentleman
in question, two other sons,

714
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,220
who in the wars of the time,
died with their swords in hand.

715
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,460
for which their father,

716
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,660
then old and fond of issue,

717
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:43,270
took such sorrow
that he quit being.

718
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:46,940
and his gentle lady, big
of this gentleman our theme,

719
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,010
deceased as he was born.

720
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,980
the king...

721
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,950
he takes the babe
to his protection,

722
01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:00,850
calls him posthumus leonatus.
breeds him.

723
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:03,820
puts to him all the learnings
that his time could
make him the receiver of,

724
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:07,860
which he took as we do air,
fast as 'twas ministered,

725
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:12,000
and in it's spring
became a harvest.

726
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,900
lived in court,
which rare it is to do.

727
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,970
more praised, most loved.

728
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:24,010
to his mistress,
for whom he now is banished,

729
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,810
her own price proclaims
how she esteemed him.

730
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,350
and his virtue
by her election

731
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,350
may be truly read
what kind of man he is.

732
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,350
a banished rascal.

733
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,950
return he cannot,

734
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,320
nor continue where he is.

735
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,430
'tis strange.

736
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,430


737
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:12,360
your service
for this time is ended.

738
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,100
take your own way.

739
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:35,350
lucius: be cheerful;
wipe thine eyes.

740
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,050
some falls are means
the happier to arise.

741
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,750


742
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,790
after laughter

743
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:53,460
comes tears

744
01:12:55,730 --> 01:13:00,070
- after laughter
- after your laughter

745
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:04,510
- comes tears
- there'll be tears

746
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,410
ooh

747
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:10,950
when you're in love

748
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:15,450
you're happy

749
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,790
oh, and then

750
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,420
when you're in an arm

751
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:24,090
you gaze

752
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,460


753
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:34,170
this doesn't last always

754
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,780
- after laughter
- after your laughter

755
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:47,680
there'll be tears

756
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:51,150
my friends all say

757
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,960
- don't...
- oh!

758
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,690


759
01:13:55,690 --> 01:14:00,900


760
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,200
know how i feel

761
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,450
posthumus:
is it enough i am sorry?

762
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:26,620
for imogen's dear life,
take mine.

763
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,740
sons.

764
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,950
we'll higher
to the mountains,
there secure us.

765
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:55,180
to the king's party
there's no going.
newness of cloten's death...

766
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,490
it is not likely that they will
waste their time upon our note,
to know from whence we are.

767
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,860
i am known.

768
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,160
i and my brother
are not known.

769
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:11,130
i scarce ever look
on blood but that of
hares, goats, and venison.

770
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,800
i am ashamed to look
upon the sun,

771
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,810
to feel the benefit
of his blest beams,

772
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,180
remaining so long
a poor unknown.

773
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,780
i'll go.
if you will bless me, sir,

774
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:25,080
and give me leave,
i'll take the better care.

775
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,280
so say i. amen.

776
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:32,190
no reason i, since
of your lives you set
so slight a valuation,

777
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:35,690
should reserve my
cracked one to more care.

778
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:37,230
have with you, boys.

779
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:43,570
if in your country wars
you chance to die...

780
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,170
that is my bed, too, lads,

781
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:48,570
and there i'll lie.

782
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:46,600
good my liege,
your preparations can affront
no less than what you hear of.

783
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,770
come more,
for more you're ready.

784
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:53,140
the want is but to put
those powers in motion
that long to move.

785
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,750
he's alive.

786
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:27,870
a rout,
confusion thick.

787
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:30,170
forthwith they fly.

788
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:35,110
great the slaughter;
an old man and two boys
struck down some mortally,

789
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:39,120
some slightly touched, some
falling merely through fear.

790
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,650


791
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,750
an old man and two boys
are grown

792
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,420
the mortal bugs o' the field.

793
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,420


794
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,800
sicilius: my poor boy...

795
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,070
whose face
i've never seen...

796
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,070
i died

797
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,410
whilst in the
womb he stayed,

798
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,710
awaiting nature's law.

799
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,920
whose father then...

800
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:21,920
as men report thou
orphans' father art,

801
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,690
thou shouldn't have been,

802
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,000
shielded him

803
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,130
from this earth-vexing smart.

804
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,470


805
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:43,850
"of god we ask one favor,

806
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,080
that we may be forgiven...

807
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,290
from what,
he is presumed to know...

808
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:58,230
the crime, from us,

809
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,430
is hidden...

810
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,140
immured the whole of life

811
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:10,840
within a magic prison."

812
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,820


813
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,230


814
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:39,340


815
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:47,410


816
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:50,080


817
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:55,150


818
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,920
oh...

819
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,560
come sir,
are you ready for death?

820
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,570
i am merrier to die
than you are to live.

821
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,510


822
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,480
i tell thee, fellow,
there are none want eyes

823
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,820
to direct them
where i am going,

824
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,960
but such as wink
and will not use them.

825
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,890


826
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,590
what an infinite mock
is this,

827
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,530
that a man should
have the best use of eyes

828
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:43,200
to see the way of blindness.

829
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,450
knock off his manacles.

830
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,630
bring your prisoner
to the king.

831
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:24,440
posthumus: every good servant
does not all commands:

832
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,510
no bond but to do just ones.

833
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:32,050
gods.

834
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:35,520
if you should have ta'en
vengeance on my faults,

835
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,190
i never had lived
to put on this:

836
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:43,590
so had you saved
imogen and struck me,

837
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:47,500
wretch more worth
your vengeance.

838
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,600
for thee,

839
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,440
o imogen,

840
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:58,640
even for whom my life
is every breath a death;

841
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,640
and thus, unknown,

842
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:06,650
pitied nor hated, to the face
of peril myself i'll dedicate.

843
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:10,950


844
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:20,100
posthumus: let me make men
know more valor in me
than my habits show.

845
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,370
gods, give me the strength

846
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,940
to shame the
guise o' the world,
i will begin the fashion,

847
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,370
less without

848
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:33,010
and more within.

849
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,650
stand by my side,

850
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:48,420
you whom the gods have made
preservers of my throne.

851
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,960
knights of the battle,

852
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,430
i create you companions
to our person,

853
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:57,730
- and fit you with dignities
befitting your estates...
- 

854
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,290
why so sadly
greet you our victory?

855
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:18,090
hail, great king.

856
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,560
to sour your happiness,
i must report the queen is dead.

857
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:35,000
no!

858
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:41,040
cymbeline: how ended she?

859
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,150
cornelius: with horror,
madly dying,

860
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:46,050
like her life, which,
being cruel to the world,

861
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,750
concluded most cruel
to herself.

862
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:52,320
these her women were present
when she finished.

863
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:58,430
cornelius: first, she confessed
she never loved you,

864
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:03,430
only affected greatness
got by you, not you;

865
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,800
married your royalty,
wife to your place;
abhorred your person.

866
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,490
she alone knew this.

867
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,730
your daughter she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight,

868
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:38,830
whose life,

869
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,570
but that her flight
prevented it,

870
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,110
she had ta'en off by poison.

871
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,360
mine eyes were not in fault,
for...

872
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,630
she was beautiful.

873
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:12,130
mine ears,
that heard her flattery.

874
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,470
nor my heart, that thought
her like her seeming.

875
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:19,480


876
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,810
it had been vicious
to have mistrusted her.

877
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,480
o my daughter.

878
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,890
that it was my folly,
thou mayst say.

879
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,740
the day was yours by accident.

880
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,770
had it gone with us,
we should not,

881
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,880
when the blood was cool,
have threatened our prisoners
with the sword.

882
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,480
but let it come.

883
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:05,750
cymbeline: that diamond on your
finger, how came it yours?

884
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:10,890
by villainy i got this ring.

885
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:14,230
the good posthumus.
what can i say?

886
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,400
he were too good to be
where ill men were...

887
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,170
cymbeline: i stand on fire.
come to the matter.

888
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:22,870
your daughter's chastity. ow!
there it begins!

889
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:25,910
- cymbeline: my daughter?
- i wagered with him

890
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,480
pieces of gold against
this which then he wore

891
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,880
upon his honored finger

892
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,790
to attain in suit
the place of his bed...

893
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,420
to win this ring by hers
and mine adultery.

894
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:47,200
at court, i learned
your chaste daughter

895
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:51,300
and the wide difference
'twixt villainous and amorous.

896
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,900
yet... i returned
with proof enough

897
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,370
to make the noble
posthumus mad.

898
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:59,880
ay.

899
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,680
me, most credulous fool,

900
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,920
o, give me cord,
or knife, or poison.

901
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,220
i killed thy daughter.

902
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,830
caused a lesser villain
than myself to do it.

903
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:20,860
spit and throw stones,

904
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,730
cast mire upon me.

905
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,510
imogen.

906
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:35,240
my queen, my wife.

907
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,310
- my life...
- peace.

908
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:40,520
- o imogen...
- my lord, hear.

909
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,350
- shall's have a play of this?
- 

910
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,930
you never killed
imogen... till now.

911
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,740


912
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:14,880
get thee from my sight.
thou gavest me poison.

913
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,990
i had it from the queen...

914
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:20,060
cornelius: oh gods.

915
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:23,290
i left out one thing
the queen confessed.

916
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:26,760
the queen, sir, very often
importuned me to, um,

917
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,000
temper potions for her,

918
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,670
still pretending the
satisfaction of her knowledge

919
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:35,840
only in killing creatures vile,
cats and dogs.

920
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,510
i, dreading that her purpose
was of more danger,

921
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,710
did compound for her
a certain stuff

922
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:46,720
which being ta'en would cease
the present power of life,

923
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,520
and in short time
all offices of nature

924
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,390
should do their due function.

925
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,890
have you ta'en of it?

926
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:00,830
i must have, for i was dead.

927
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,640
hang there like fruit,
my soul,

928
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,080
till the tree die.

929
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,850
cymbeline: imogen.

930
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,560
imogen: your blessing, sir.

931
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,690
the queen's dead.

932
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,400
imogen: i'm sorry for it.

933
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,860
she was naught.

934
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,730
her son is gone,
we know not how.

935
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,970
let me end the story.

936
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,610
i slew him.

937
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:46,510
he did provoke me.

938
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:50,110
i cut off his head
and am right glad he is not
standing here to tell the tale.

939
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:54,380
mighty sir, these two young
gentlemen that call me father

940
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:58,090
and think they are my sons
are none of mine.

941
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:02,090
they are the issue
of your loins, my liege,
the blood of your begetting.

942
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:04,560
how?

943
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,530
i am belarius whom you banished.

944
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:12,170
these gentle princes,
for such and so they are,

945
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:15,440
these twenty years
have i trained up.

946
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,810
but here...

947
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,140
here are your sons again,

948
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:25,080
and i must lose two
of the sweetest companions
in the world.

949
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:30,120
guiderius upon his neck
had a... a mole,

950
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,490
a sanguine star.

951
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:36,730
this is he.

952
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,860
caius lucius.

953
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:20,500
although the victor,

954
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,570
we submit to caesar
and to the roman empire...

955
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,180
promising to pay
our wonted tribute,

956
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:31,980
from which we were dissuaded
by our wicked queen.

957
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:53,570
pardon's the word to all.
