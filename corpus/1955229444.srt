00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:29,745
Yeah, right.

184
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:35,023
(radio with
Farm Report in background)

185
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:50,435
What?

186
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,570
Where's mine?

187
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,707
I'm not your cook.

188
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,076
You want breakfast,
you make it yourself.

189
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:00,896
But I can't make anything.

190
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,049
I believe you.

191
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,584
You know, fine,
I'll just have cereal.

192
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,269
No, you won't.

193
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,389
Why not?

194
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,573
'Cause I don't have any.

195
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,808
I hate cereal.

196
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,726
Then what
am I supposed to eat?

197
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,363
What do you eat at home?

198
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,732
Hot pockets, pizza rolls, you
know, anything that can nuke.

199
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,919
Nuke. There's a microwave
right behind you.

200
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,590
Fine.
Have at it.

201
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,575
Fine.

202
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,262
Okay. Dozen eggs,

203
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:32,716
four potatoes,
chow down--

204
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,535
(microwave button beeps)

205
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,567
Ah!
(splattering)

206
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,609
All right.

207
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:13,347
Clean that up.

208
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:18,319
And when you're through,
meet me outside.

209
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,837
We got work to do.

210
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,241
(sizzling)

211
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:38,732
(chickens clucking)

212
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:46,251
What am I
supposed to do?

213
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,854
Find the fattest one
and catch it.

214
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,540
Why?

215
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,108
Dinner.

216
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:58,057
♪

217
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:34,039
This sucks!

218
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,463
Hot pockets and pizza rolls.
How they working out for you?

219
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,332
Ugh.

220
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:48,171
Mow this.

221
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,508
But I'm only here
for, like, three months.

222
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,411
Better get started, then.

223
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,474
Ah!

224
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:05,842
What are those for?

225
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:09,313
Apparently,
your grades suck.

226
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:10,781
Summer school starts

227
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,167
now.

228
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,909
(sobbing)

229
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:33,156
Here.
Blow your nose.

230
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,811
You hungry?

231
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,062
Yeah.

232
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,294
Finish that.
Then hit the sack.

233
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,213
We got
an early day tomorrow.

234
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:54,682
Were going into town.

235
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,385
Really? Why?

236
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,370
'Cause you need a friend.

237
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,600
(dogs barking)

238
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,199
I guess that one's
kind of cool.

239
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,601
(growling)

240
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,853
Sit.

241
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,807
No, not that one.

242
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,197
How about that one?

243
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:41,919
Speak!

244
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,521
No, not that one neither.

245
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:57,621
That one!

246
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,208
Why?
He's a mutt.

247
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,544
It's what's on the inside
that counts.

248
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,246
Now, this is a farm dog.

249
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,132
They've got big hearts.

250
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,618
Sit!

251
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,422
Up.

252
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:15,441
Speak.
(barking)

253
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:18,561
Come.

254
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,562
He's smart.

255
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,096
And, uh,
he'll look after you.

256
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:22,816
Thought that was
your job.

257
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,818
I'm your grandfather,
not your friend.

258
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,403
(barking)

259
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,776
But I've never
had a dog before.

260
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,096
It's okay.
He's had a boy before.

261
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:36,315
Somebody taught him.

262
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,723
Then we should try
to find his owner.

263
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:47,611
There's four million acres
of farm land in Iowa, good luck.

264
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,976
Hey, Jack.

265
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,928
Smitty.

266
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,415
Need a dog collar
and a leash.

267
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,400
(Door opening)

268
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,036
Who's that?

269
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:14,058
My Grandson, Ben.
Ben, this is Mr. Smith.

270
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,226
But my friends
call me "Smitty".

271
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:18,212
Smitty.

272
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,914
You call him
"Mr. Smith".

273
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:23,118
Mr. Smith.

274
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,961
Come here.

275
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:31,878
Give me five.

276
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,515
Whoa!
Hey, hey.

277
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:36,783
I like this kid.

278
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:38,068
There you go.

279
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,522
We'll need
a nametag too.

280
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:49,782
What you gonna name him?

281
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:51,200
Huh?

282
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:52,552
What do you want
to name him?

283
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:56,139
You know what,
I don't even want this dog.

284
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,358
You're the one
who made me get him,

285
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,325
so you should name him.

286
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:01,278
Fine.

287
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:11,790
This will be his name until you
come up with something better.

288
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,409
Dog?

289
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,278
D.O.G.

290
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,384
This straight?

291
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,568
Uh, no, no, no, no.

292
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,771
That is
a genuine antique.

293
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,307
What!

294
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,532
Pick up the stuff, kid.

295
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,504
Dog.

296
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:45,145
I think I got carpal tunnel
syndrome in the feet.

297
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:47,198
Can you get carpal tunnel
syndrome in the feet?

298
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,449
Um, no, you can't,

299
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,718
but what you got
is plantar fasciitis.

300
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,740
See there's a long flat ligament
on the bottom of the foot,

301
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,241
and when it gets
stretched improperly,

302
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,460
like from waitressing
all day,

303
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:58,712
it gets inflamed.

304
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,630
Just ice it and rest.
You'll be fine.

305
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,181
You're like
some kind of doctor.

306
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:04,751
No, I'm actually
like some kind of nurse.

307
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:06,587
Well, I will be, anyway.

308
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:09,657
What is...?

309
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,792
That is not funny.
It's not funny.

310
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:14,880
Amanda,
what is wrong with you?

311
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:17,649
I've got school, you know,
and Ben and--

312
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,668
Ben's with his
grandfather, right?

313
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:20,453
Right.
When was the last time

314
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:21,604
you've been on a date?

315
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:24,173
Let's see.

316
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:28,227
I don't know, you know.
Ben is 13, so--

317
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:30,163
BOTH:
Thirteen years?

318
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:34,752
All right, I like my life.
Ben and me were doing just fine.

319
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:38,272
(barking)

320
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,497
Stop looking at me.

321
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:47,199
You're smart, big deal.

322
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:51,671
You're not mine, I don't like
you, so stay away from me!

323
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,077
Time to get to work, Ben.

324
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:00,799
Dog, you're
his watchdog.

325
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,501
Watch him.
Don't let him slack off.

326
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,822
Keep him out of trouble.
Stick to him like glue.

327
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:07,974
All right?
Okay.

328
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,565
You can't make him follow me.
That's not fair.

329
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:17,201
Fair is at Fort Dodge.

330
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:21,438
Oh...my mom says that
all the time.

331
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,527
She does?
Really?

332
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:28,714
Yeah, it's stupid.
I don't even know what it means.

333
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:29,916
Of course you don't.

334
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,184
Let me know
when you figure it out.

335
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:33,920
Fine, he can follow me.

336
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:37,575
He's just some stupid dog.
It's not like he can tell on me.

337
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,862
Oh, he sure can.
He's a farm dog.

338
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,132
He's the eyes
in the back of my head.

339
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,316
(barking)

340
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,152
School of life, Ben.
Class is in session.

341
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,055
Whatever.

342
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,284
Did my mom have to do this
when she was my age?

343
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:04,288
Yeah, she didn't
whine about it though.

344
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:07,291
(barking)

345
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:08,510
Stupid dog.

346
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:09,795
(barking)

347
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,246
Good boy.

348
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:21,674
Did you feed Dog?

349
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:25,696
No.

350
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:26,713
Why not?

351
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:27,798
I'll tell you why.

352
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,951
'Cause I'm not his cook.

353
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:33,671
He wants food,
he can make it himself.

354
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:37,292
He's a farm dog, right?
Someone told me they were smart.

355
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,980
He's smarter
than some people I know.

356
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:45,001
But he don't have thumbs.
So make him dinner.

357
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,304
Fine.

358
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:25,264
(burping)

359
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,943
Come on, boy.

360
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:39,029
Good boy.
Good dog.

361
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,348
I got something for you.

362
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:46,020
You want it?
Oh, you know you want it.

363
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,609
If you want it,
all you gotta do is fetch.

364

Fell off.

So now, tell me, Ben,
what can I do for you?

00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,676
I want to see that guitar.

Guitar?
All right, coming right up.

405
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:55,605
Beautiful Gibson.

No.
I want to learn though.

Uh, name's on the back.

where I was?

What are you doing,
Smitty?

414
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,144
What?

415
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,931
Don't what me.
You're giving him the guitar.

416
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:20,183
I'm not gonna
just give this kid a guitar.

417
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,285
If he wants a guitar he's going
to have to pay for the guitar.

418
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,637
Kid says
he wants to see a guitar.

419
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,506
It's a good guitar.
Let him see the guitar.

420
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,324
You know
what I'm talking about.

421
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,675
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

422
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,161
But he doesn't know what
you're talking about.

423
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,063
What are you talking about?

424
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,600
No, he doesn't know
what we're talking about.

425
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,018
I don't think
much about it, either.

426
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,003
Ain't your decision.

427
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,621
Look! I want it!

428
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,293
How much you want
for the guitar?

429
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:45,146
I'll let it go
for $700.

430
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:48,999
Pretty decent.
Pay him.

431
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,185
I don't have $700.

432
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,189
Didn't your mama
leave you with some money?

433
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,541
Yeah. Twenty bucks
for the whole summer.

434
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:58,278
You're a tad light, kid.

435
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,147
But I want it!

436
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,049
So, what?

437
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,501
Buy it for me.

438
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:05,519
Why?

439
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,404
Because I want it!

440
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:12,310
(Laughing)

441
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:16,497
And you think that just because
you want something,

442
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:19,217
somebody should
give it to you?

443
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:20,286
Duh!

444
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:27,860
What kind of grandfather
are you, anyway?

445
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,596
What'd you say?

446
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:34,534
You missed 13 Christmases,
Easters, and birthdays.

447
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:37,905
I figured that adds up
to a lot more than $700.

448
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:42,911
Are you invoicing me?

449
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:44,580
Exactly.

450
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:48,767
Boy, you got a big mouth
for being such a little man.

451
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:53,139
If you want to know why
I missed 13 Christmases,

452
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:57,694
13 birthdays,
13 Easters.

453
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,631
Ask your mama.

454
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:08,491
No wonder
my mom hates you!

455
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:13,330
You're a jerk.

456
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:23,041
If I said that to my old man
when I was your age,

457
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,893
I wouldn't be able to sit down
for a week.

458
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:27,161
Lucky me,
I don't have a dad.

459
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,185
You want the guitar.

460
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:36,222
Wow, you're going to earn it.

461
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:37,907
Smitty?

462
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:39,376
I could use some help
at my place.

463
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:42,813
I could pay the kid,
uh, ten?

464
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,666
Eight?

465
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:46,818
Seven?

466
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:49,721
Five, five?

467
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:50,972
Five dollars an hour.
He can--

468
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:53,908
Hold on.
Are we talking the stump?

469
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,811
Yes, the stump.

470
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,930
Man, you ain't never gonna
get that stump out of there.

471
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,432
I'm going to finish it
this time.

472
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,902
I'm not one of those people who
never finish what they start.

473
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:05,889
All right, that's it.
Dog, take him out to the truck.

474

(Barking)

475
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:13,165
I'll see that he arrives
at your place really early.

476
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,984
I know you will.

477
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,926
Uh-oh,
your boyfriend is back.

478
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:26,112
Just ask Maureen to seat him
in your section.

479
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,582
Oh, now he's going to pretend
to look at the menus

480
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:33,037
while looking for you.

481
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,592
Uh, here comes the smile.

482
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:41,096
How did you know
he was going to do that?

483
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:42,415
He does it every time
he comes in.

484
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,133
There are, like,
50 better restaurants

485
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:47,153
within two blocks of this place,
but he's here every day.

486
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,847
You take my table, Stevie.

487
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,298
Sure, he's cute.

488
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,986
Uh, you find another guy.

489
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:02,538
Here's how it's going to go.

490
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:03,789
I'm going to order
30 minutes' worth of food.

491
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,208
Okay. Yeah.
All right?

492
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,559
That should give you
enough time

493
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,495
to work up the guts to ask out
the pretty waitress.

494
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:10,014
Your waitress
will be right over.

I would like the double stack,
please, with extra mayo,

the side of bacon cheese fries,
the personal pan pizza

with the sausage,
mushrooms, onions--

502

Never mind.

Oh, my...

510
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:58,984
Amanda.
You better say yes.

511
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:06,060
Um, are you
a professional musician?

512
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,397
Uh, no.

513
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:24,448
I'll call you.

me if I don't do my homework?

518

Just so you know,
I didn't like you,

you say "please".

When you're given something,
you say "thank you".

00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,243
Probably.
Most likely.

543
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,444
I would think so.
Yep.

544
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:34,329
You want that guitar?

545
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:35,816
That's how
you'll get it.

546
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,650
One shovel full
at a time.

547
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:39,469
(Barking)

548
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,204
Smitty.

549
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,023
Jack.

550
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,260
Dog, don't let him
slack off.

551
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:46,777
(Barking)

552
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:48,647
What time
are you picking me up?

553
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,299
I'm not.

554
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,683
But that's, like,
two miles.

555
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:53,552
Three.

556
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,171
But what if I'm tired?

557
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,023
You will be.

558
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,007
(Laughing)

559
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,612
That's it.

560
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:26,490
(Barking)

561
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:28,408
Shut up, stupid dog.

562
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,129
Should have
gone to juvie.

563
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,632
Sucks.

564
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,170
(Barking)

565
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,972
Bark all you want.

566
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,858
I'm tired
and I'm gonna take a break.

567
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,102
Stop it.

568
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:21,453
I said, "stop".

569
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:23,655
Dog's thirsty.
Cup your hands.

570
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:29,161
You just made
a friend for life.

571
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:32,781
Oh, look at that.
Dog likes you.

572
00:39:32,783 --> 00:39:35,753
Well, I don't like him.

573
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,654
What do you know
about the dog?

574
00:39:37,656 --> 00:39:41,109
Nothing.
Well, that makes you even.

575
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,912
Give the dog a break, kid.
Give him a break.

576
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,609
So, what happened
to this thing?

577
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,630
Lightning.

578
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,982
Big elm tree.

579
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:04,635
Used to have a canopy
that covered this whole yard.

580
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,841
I use to come out here

581
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:11,209
and have a big pitcher
of sweet iced tea and the chair.

582
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,895
I'd listen
to the baseball games.

583
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:13,914
It was my favorite thing.

584
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:16,916
All of a sudden, pow!

585
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:20,904
Lightning took
the whole tree down.

586
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,058
That sucks.
Yeah.

587
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:26,727
Well, you see
that tree over there?

588
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:29,463
I grew that tree
from a seed

589
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:32,267
from this tree here.

590
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,570
I'm gonna plant it right here
as soon as I get rid of this.

591
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:35,888
Your going to plant it
in the same place

592
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:37,206
the lightning
hit the big tree?

593
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:39,775
Sure, lightning never
strikes twice in the same place.

594
00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:41,511
But what if it did?

595
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:44,932
Well, that's a message
from the big man upstairs.

596
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,617
And you better listen
and do what he says,

597
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,386
because if that happens, I would
pay attention if I was you.

598
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:52,256
So, what's up with the thing
about you and my grandpa?

599
00:40:52,258 --> 00:40:54,726
You know,
about the guitar.

600
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:58,347
Well, uh, you better
ask your grandfather about that.

601
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,217
Like he's really
gonna give me an answer.

602
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,968
I mean all he ever says
is "Get to work,"

603
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:03,319
and "I'm not your cook."

604
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,670
He hates me.

605
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,423
No, no, no.
Your grandpa loves you.

606
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,443
He's just an old dog
who's set in his ways.

607
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:13,681
But I kind of feel that he's
trying to make up for something.

608
00:41:13,683 --> 00:41:15,834
What?

609
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,219
Oh, look at this.

610
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,654
It's quitting time.

at the antique shop.

what he has at his house?

Oh, he's home, man.

while Ben was working.

721
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:26,329
I'm having
fish fry tonight.

722
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,164
You're welcome to come.

723
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,650
Rain check, Smitty.

724
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,767
All right.

725
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,719
We gotta go.

726
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:37,625
Good looking out.

727
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:38,976
Power to the people.

728
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:40,546
I like this guy.

729
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:45,484
Where is Dog?

730
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:53,159
I don't know.

731
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:55,111
(Whimpering)

732
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:26,431
(Whimpering)

733
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:28,367
I can't believe
he stayed.

734
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:32,955
You told him to,
didn't you?

735
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:34,239
Yeah, but,

736
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:37,127
it's cold outside
and its raining,

737
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:39,496
and he's been here
all day.

738
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:44,968
He stayed
because he loves you.

739
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:47,204
He's your dog, Ben.

740
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:49,575
And you're his boy.

741
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:51,360
You know
what that means?

742
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:53,461
That I own him?

743
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:56,432
No.

744
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:59,586
It means
he's your responsibility.

745
00:50:59,587 --> 00:51:02,121
He'd do anything for you.

746
00:51:02,123 --> 00:51:05,091
Anything.

747
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:06,827
Now, after the way
you treated him,

748
00:51:08,247 --> 00:51:10,064
you think
you deserve that?

749
00:51:10,065 --> 00:51:12,333
No.

750
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:17,072
He would have
stayed here forever,

751
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:19,442
even if
I never came back for him.

752
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,727
Yep.

753
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:23,963
And he could have died.

754
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:25,666
Yep.

755
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:35,059
Well,

756
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:36,929
aren't you
going to say it?

757
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:43,085
I'm really,
really sorry, Dog.

758
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:47,106
I'm so, so sorry.

759
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,591
(Sobbing)

760
00:51:48,593 --> 00:51:52,313
All right, Ben, that's fine,
that's enough.

761
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:54,649
Not okay.
I'm sorry, Dog.

762
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:59,104
All right, Ben.
That's enough.

763
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:01,573
No, it's not.

764
00:52:01,574 --> 00:52:06,144
Dog, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it, I swear.

765
00:52:06,146 --> 00:52:08,614
(Barking)

766
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:11,317
Everybody makes mistakes.

767
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:13,820
It's how you make up for them
that counts.

768
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,005
Oh, yeah, right.

769
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,557
Like you've ever
done anything this bad.

770
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,129
No. I, uh, I did something
much worse.

771
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,569
And I've been paying for it
for 13 years.

772
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,188
And your mom finished
her first year in college

773
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,025
at the top of her class.

774
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:35,561
Then she, um, she met him.

775
00:52:35,562 --> 00:52:40,533
Lightning Lihtz, a musician,
like her old man.

776
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:42,670
And she threw it all away.

777
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:44,406
She ran off with him,

778
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:47,843
the same week that
your grandmother passed on.

779
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:51,830
And I couldn't find her,
for weeks.

780
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,036
She got pregnant.

781
00:52:56,037 --> 00:52:58,704
And when it came time
for her boyfriend

782
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:03,644
to choose between
family and himself,

783
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:05,562
he chose himself.

784
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:07,799
But that was her mistake.

785
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,184
Yeah.

786
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,620
My mistake was

787
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14,841
when she tried
to come back,

788
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:17,476
I took all the pain

789
00:53:17,478 --> 00:53:20,731
of losing my wife,

790
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:24,100
and my daughter
running away,

791
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,503
and I told her

792
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:29,240
that she had
ruined everything.

793
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,664
I told her I didn't want
to see her again.

794
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:40,302
I turned my back
on my own daughter.

795
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:44,057
You did that?

796
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,675
Yeah.

797
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:48,529
Dude, I'm only 13,
and I've done really bad things,

798
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,599
but that's like the worst thing
I've ever heard.

799
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,050
Really bad.

800
00:53:53,052 --> 00:53:57,155
No, no, no, no.
That's really, really bad.

801
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:00,226
I know.

802
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:03,062
I've never even done anything
half that bad.

803
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:04,698
I know.

804
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:10,237
You know,

805
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:11,856
I feel better now,

806
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:14,876
because compared to you,
I'm not so bad.

807
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:17,912
So thanks for telling me,
Grandpa.

808
00:54:17,913 --> 00:54:19,848
You're welcome.

809
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,103
All right,
get to bed.

810
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:26,339
And take your milk.

811
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:41,956
(Ringing)

812
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,819
<i>(Recording):
Hey, you've reached Amanda.
Please leave me a message.</i>

813
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,103
(Beeping)

814
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:01,179
Ben.

815
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:04,833
Yeah?

816
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,785
Get your jacket,
we need a milkshake.

817
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,144
Hi.

818
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:30,129
Hi.

819
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,765
I am so sorry.
When did you get here?

820
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:35,400
Uh, at 7:00,
like you said.

821
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:37,738
You've been waiting for me
for three hours?

822
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,740
You didn't get my text?

823
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:41,558
I left my phone
at the office.

824
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,111
Oh, God!

825
00:55:43,112 --> 00:55:46,965
Wow, that is so sweet,
or desperate.

826
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:49,567
Yeah, I guess probably
a little of both.

827
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:51,770
Wait, you brought me
ice cream?

828
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:53,972
Well, it was ice cream.

829
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:56,609
Now it's a little more like
a lab experiment.

830
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:03,299
Gee, I'm totally messing this
up, aren't I, already?

831
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:05,569
It's been a long time
since I've been on a date.

832
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,888
I bet it's been longer
for me.

833
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:08,689
No way.

834
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:10,508
How long has it been?

835
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:12,544
No.
It's too embarrassing.

836
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:14,629
Okay, we'll say it
at the same time. Ready?

837
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,647
One, two, three.

838
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:17,216
Eight months.
Thirteen years.

839
00:56:17,217 --> 00:56:18,434
That is just not true.

840
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:19,653
It is.

841
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:21,871
You?
Thirteen years?

842
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,439
No way.

843
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,759
Is that a compliment?

844
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,443
Well, yes,
it's a compliment.

845
00:56:26,444 --> 00:56:29,446
I figured guys would be
hitting on you all the time.

846
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:32,267
I don't know.
I guess I push them away.

847
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:34,485
So!
What do you do, Russell?

848
00:56:34,486 --> 00:56:35,870
(Phone ringing)
Well, actually, I--

849
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:38,339
Sorry.
Hang on a second here.

850
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:40,076
Is everything okay?

851
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,028
I missed a call.

852
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:44,815
(Ringing)

853
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,767
Everything all right?

854
00:56:49,136 --> 00:56:51,071
(Ringing)

855
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,778
My dad called.

856
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,130
Oh, that's nice.

857
00:56:58,131 --> 00:56:59,932
No. He only
would've called

858
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,283
if there were something wrong
with my son, Ben.

859
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,835
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go.

860
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,219
I'll drive you.

861
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,471
No, it's an all-night drive.

862
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:07,157
Well, I can't let you
do that by yourself.

863
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:08,624
You can't let me?

864
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,343
I didn't
mean it that way.

865
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:12,713
I'm saying it's already late,
and it's a long drive.

866
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:14,398
We'll get coffee.

867
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,534
Get to know each other
a little better.

868
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:19,203
You owe me three hours.

869
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:20,555
I guess you're right.

870
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:21,773
All right.
All right.

871
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:23,391
Come on.

872
00:57:23,392 --> 00:57:26,378
I've got my driver's license
and everything.

873
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,983
Grandpa
and the Rambling Hearts?

874
00:57:55,296 --> 00:57:57,247
(Rock music playing)

875
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,968
He could've been a star.

876
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:05,173
(Record scratching)

877
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:07,476
(Music playing loudly
over speakers)

878
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,648
Ben?
Is that you?

879
00:58:19,274 --> 00:58:20,757
What do you think?

880
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,896
(Whining)

881
00:58:24,897 --> 00:58:26,681
Everybody's a critic.

882
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:28,550
(Barking)

883
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,403
What are you doing here?

884
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:47,588
What's wrong?

885
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:49,540
What? Nothing.

886
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,309
You called me.

887
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,894
Yeah.

888
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,580
So, what's wrong?

889
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:57,833
I, um,
I just wanted to talk.

890
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,818
Where's Ben?
In the kitchen.

891
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:08,412
Awkward.

892
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,599
Ben!
Mom?

893
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,517
What are you doing here?

894
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:14,736
Are you all right?

895
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:16,538
Yeah.
I'm fine. Why?

896
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,112
Who's he?

897
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:23,229
Hi, I'm Russell.

898
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,800
Who's he?
Oh, that's my dog.

899
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:28,819
Dog.

900
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,971
(Barking)

901

That's a really cool name.

902
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:35,443
No, really.
I've heard much worse.

903
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:37,445
Anyways, are you guys
hungry?

904
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:39,030
Because I made
plenty of food.

905
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:40,648
Sure, it's been
a long drive.

906
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:42,167
Sure, honey.

907
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:49,409
This looks delicious,
honey.

908
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,860
Thanks.

909
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:51,845
You did
all this yourself?

910
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:53,397
Yeah.
Dig in.

911
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:54,447
Come on, Dog.

912
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:57,668
Hey, Ben.
Hold on.

913
00:59:57,669 --> 00:59:59,620
I was going
to do this tomorrow,

914
00:59:59,621 --> 01:00:01,523
but because
your mother is here,

915
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:03,208
we're going
to do it today.

916
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:05,111
We're going to
take a day off.

917
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:07,263
Seriously?
Yes.

918
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,264
We're gonna have some fun.

919
01:00:11,669 --> 01:00:14,304
I know
how to have fun.

920
01:00:23,132 --> 01:00:24,582
Russell?
Yeah.

921
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,718
Can you hang with Ben and Dog
for a little while?

922
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:28,370
I need
to talk with my father.

923
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:31,156
Sure, absolutely.
I can definitely do that.

924
01:00:31,158 --> 01:00:33,659
Absolutely.
Okay, thanks.

925
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,130
And, um, relax.
You're doing great.

926
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,402
Okay. Got it.
Okay.

927
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:44,005
How many tickets
do you want?

928
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:45,490
A hundred and fifty.

929
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:47,042
A hundred and fifty?
Yeah.

930
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,210
We ride everything around here
25 times if you do that.

931
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,596
Exactly.

932
01:00:59,357 --> 01:01:03,477
You know, this used to be
my favorite thing

933
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:06,664
that we would ever do
when I was a kid.

934
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:12,003
You used to take me here
one day a year for the fair.

935
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:16,308
Watch me ride all the rides
and buy me cotton candy,

936
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:19,811
and hold my hand all day.

937
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:22,866
I remember.
I do.

938
01:01:24,386 --> 01:01:27,154
I want
to ask you a question.

939
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,793
Am I a jerk?

940

941
01:01:38,835 --> 01:01:40,286
Maybe.

942
01:01:40,287 --> 01:01:42,238
A little.

943
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:46,710
You hurt me.

944
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:51,031
You really hurt me.

945
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:55,937
You see, I had this dream
about what you'd be.

946
01:01:58,408 --> 01:02:00,876
My little girl left me.

947
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,048
And when she came back,

948
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,134
I was just

949
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:10,254
so angry and sad

950
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:13,523
that I couldn't

951
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,659
look her in the face.

952
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:19,747
Dad, do you have any idea
how hard it was for me

953
01:02:19,749 --> 01:02:21,784
for those 13 years?

954
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,071
I had to do everything alone

955
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:28,441
without having you.

956
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:31,528
I know I made
a really big mistake.

957
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:34,864
I know that.
But Ben is no mistake.

958
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:37,952
He's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

959
01:02:37,953 --> 01:02:40,554
I love him with all my heart
and all my soul.

960
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,775
And Dad,

961
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,730
I love you
for helping him.

962
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:58,409
All right, then.
Okay, um...

963
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:02,096
That was a good talk.
Good.

964
01:03:02,098 --> 01:03:06,301
And, uh,
are we through here?

965
01:03:06,303 --> 01:03:08,554
Yes, Daddy.

966
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,976
Boy, I sure would like
some of that cotton candy.

967
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:15,628
I think I could
wrangle some of that up.

968

Good night, Mom! Glad
you're feeling better, Russell!

969
01:03:33,617 --> 01:03:36,152
Good work.
He puked twice.

970

Go team!

971
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:46,163
I told Ben that roller coasters
were not my thing.

972
01:03:46,164 --> 01:03:49,216
So why did you go on
so many of them?

973
01:03:49,218 --> 01:03:51,169
A shameless blackmail.

974
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:56,174
But mostly because
he wanted to.

975
01:03:58,645 --> 01:04:01,731
Thank you.

976
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,767
No problem.

977

I can tell.

And I do too.

979

Grandpa, look!
It struck twice!

1092
01:17:50,214 --> 01:17:51,232
What?

1093
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,117

in the same place twice,

He's trying

1096
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,291
You better listen.

1097
