WHAT?

1249
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,980
I WAS DEAD
BEFORE I MET YOU.

1250
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,050
IT WAS LIKE THE BEST PART
OF ME HAD DIED WITH SARA
THAT NIGHT,

1251
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:36,550
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET IT BACK AGAIN,

1252
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:37,890
NOT EVEN FOR LILY.

1253

NOT UNTIL I MET YOU.

1254
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,060
DON'T DO THIS TO ME,
MICHAEL.

1255
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,990
DON'T PUT THAT
ON ME.

1256
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,590
I CAN'T HELP IT.

YOU WOKE ME UP, FAITH.

1258
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:48,630
IT WAS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN
I REMEMBERED WHO I WAS.

1259
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,300
YOU MADE ME LAUGH,
MADE ME FEEL ALIVE AGAIN,

I CAN'T LIVE
IN YOUR HOUSE
LIKE BEFORE.

1265

01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,560
YOU AND LILY,
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

1271
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,290
SO MUCH MORE FROM ME
THAN I CAN GIVE,

1272
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,800
AND I AM NOT GOING
TO PUT MY LIFE
ON HOLD AGAIN.

1273
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:27,800
NOT FOR RICHIE,
NOT FOR LILY,
AND NOT FOR YOU.

BUT I'M NOT REALLY
SURE KIDS WILL BE
INTERESTED IN IT.
