1
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,129
Hi, I'm Michael.

2
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,832
Paul.

3
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,837
I hear you're
having some trouble.

4
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,842
It's okay.

5
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,678
It's okay.

6
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,781
I just...

7
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,751
Don't understand...

8
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,154
Why god made me like this.

9
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,223
He didn't.

10
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,292
Trust me.

11
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,395
Let me tell you something.

12
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,397
You should never
define yourself

13
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,833
by your choices
or your desires.

14
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:46,438
Gay doesn't exist.
It's a false identity.

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,542
This isn't my choice.
Why would I choose this?

16
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,245
You always have a choice.

17
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,117
You wanna go to heaven, right?

18
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,218
Yes.

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,886
If you're
a moral person,

20
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,323
then you'll choose
heterosexuality

21
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,126
in order to be with god.

22
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,895
Hey.

23
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:43,862
Hey. Hey.

24
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,930
Where you going?

25
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,299
I'm gonna make us breakfast.

26
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:47,933
No.

27
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,734
Yeah, come on.

28
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,570
Breakfast
is the most important part
of the day.

29
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,306
I'll have muffins
at my meeting.

30
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,807
Muffins?

31
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,876
Yeah, muffins.

32
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,278
Blueberry.

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,547
Mmm, blueberry.

34
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,583
Okay, then we'll
do lunch, okay?

35
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,418
Mmm, morning breath.

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,856
Oh, stop it!
Get off!

37
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,265
It's so cool
that you work at<i> XY.</i>

38
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:53,966
Yeah. Yeah, it's rad.

39
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:58,270
You guys are like
the only cool gay magazine
out there right now.

40
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,439
Oh, yeah, sort of.

41
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,433
Hey, listen up, queens.

42
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,470
<i> XY</i> magazine is taking over!

43
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,705
It's our time to shine!

44
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,902
<i> Matthew Shepard</i>
<i> was an openly gay man.</i>

45
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,306
<i> When he went to a laramie,</i>
<i> Wyoming bar last week,</i>

46
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,708
<i> these two suspects</i>
<i> lured him outside,</i>

47
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,742
<i> pretending to be gay.</i>

48
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,078
<i> Now they're charged</i>
<i> with a vicious attack</i>

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,846
<i> that left Shepard</i>
<i> hanging on this fence</i>

50
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,316
<i> for 18 hours</i>
<i> in freezing temperatures.</i>

51
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,485
<i> Shepard remained on</i>
<i> life support until this morning</i>

52
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,486
<i> when he passed away.</i>

53
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,356
<i> Shepard's family</i>
<i> is grateful for support</i>

54
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,391
<i> from around the world.</i>

55
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,470
They killed him
because they were afraid,

56
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,873
and they were afraid
because of what
their churches tell them

57
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,543
and because of what
they see in movies.

58
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,777
It's fucking ridiculous.

59
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,112
I hope they get
the death penalty.

60
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,915
You're against
the death penalty.
Not in this case.

61
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,083
That's like being
for free speech

62
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,819
until someone tells you
something that pisses you off.

63
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,619
He died a slow death

64
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,888
after being tied to a fence
and tortured.

65
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,590
Exactly, a slow death
is way more painful.

66
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,726
They should spend the rest
of their lives in prison.

67
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,695
Okay, look, we need
to move away from labels

68
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,698
because they segment
and they lead to persecution.

69
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,869
People don't wanna be
perceived as gay because...

70
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,872
They're afraid
they'll end up like Matthew.

71
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,540
But we are a gay magazine.

72
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,676
Identifying as gay
is being part of a community.

73
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,077
It's recognition,
it's progress...

74
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,948
We've been telling the kids
in the magazine to come out,
to be proud to be gay.

75
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,616
They should be proud
to be themselves.

76
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,120
Gay and straight
are just social constructs.

77
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,122
Ugh. God,
you and your queer theory.

78
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:33,859
Class is in session
with professor Michael glatze.

79
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,826
Shut up.

80
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,061
Okay, okay, look.

81
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,429
We need to put out the message

82
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,898
that being attracted
to the same sex

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,535
doesn't define who you are.

84
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,079
Hey.

85
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,916
Have you been smoking?

86
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,551
Just one.

87
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,619
Small one.

88
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,788
It was a small cigarette.

89
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,792
Busted.

90
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,061
Letters to the editor.

91
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,965
Ninety percent
are some poor teen
with religious parents.

92
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:18,870
Fucking Christian
fundamentalists
should burn in hell.

93
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,772
Uh, okay.

94
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,110
In the meantime,
there is a design competition

95
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,180
for the halifax
international airport.

96
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,481
I don't wanna move
to halifax.

97
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,018
I know, but my father
wants me to head up
the bid committee.

98
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,985
It's huge.

99
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,821
Halifax is so boring.

100
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,756
Your hometown is boring.

101
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,690
It's not.

102
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,458
Olympia?
Yeah.

103
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,528
It's all trees
and fog and coffee.

104
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,130
And the birthplace
of the riot grrrl movement

105
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,134
and where Kurt cobain
wrote most of<i> nevermind.</i>

106
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,769
Oh, well...

107
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,571
Yeah.
In that case...

108
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,206
But it's
unsustainable here,

109
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,874
unless you're in
the dot-com movement,

110
00:07:55,876 --> 00:08:00,745
and I don't wanna live
in a studio on mission street

111
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,847
when we're 50.

112
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:02,714
Well, we won't be.

113
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,985
We'll be in a big mansion
on a hill. Duh.

114
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,623
<i> May 21st, 2000.</i>

115
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,859
<i> I used to imagine myself</i>
<i> growing old</i>

116
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,195
<i> while living in a house</i>
<i> atop a hill in the Castro,</i>

117
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,663
<i> but what's more important to me</i>

118
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,933
<i> is growing old</i>
<i> with the love of my life:</i>

119
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,667
<i> Bennett.</i>

120
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,769
<i> So I'm leaving San Francisco</i>

121
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,805
<i> to live in halifax, Canada.</i>

122
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,541
<i> Although I'm sad</i>
<i> to leave</i> XY<i> magazine,</i>

123
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:32,711
<i> I'm excited to finally accept</i>
<i> the speaking offers</i>

124
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,279
<i> I've been receiving</i>
<i> this past year,</i>

125
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,682
<i> thanks to my work</i>
<i> as a writer and activist.</i>

126
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,784
What a lot of people
aren't aware of

127
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,687
is that the terms "heterosexual"
and "homosexual"

128
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,191
were only introduced
about a hundred years ago.

129
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,661
<i> As my mother</i>
<i> used to always say,</i>

130
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,829
<i> "when you help others,</i>

131
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,264
<i> you're helping yourself</i>
<i> as well."</i>

132
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,866
We often read about
more sexually...

133
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,701
<i> My goal is to thread a needle</i>

134
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,537
<i> through the fabric</i>
<i> of this country</i>

135
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:03,108
<i> and stitch together the lives</i>
<i> of gay kids everywhere.</i>

136
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,975
I know a lot of you

137
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,912
are balancing religion
and sexuality,

138
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,046
but I mean, come on,

139
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:13,618
what god would punish you
for finding love?

140
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:08,373
This is where I spread
my mom's ashes.

141
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,156
Oh, my god.

142
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,926
She's still here.

143
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,409
Mom, I'm gonna
stay here with you.

144
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,243
No.

145
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,077
Don't be stubborn.

146
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,714
You are not skipping
a semester to be with me.

147
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,216
I can help you through this.

148
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm gonna be fine.
I told you.

149
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,789
I feel better.

150
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,358
Really, Michael.

151
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,796
I am so proud of you.

152
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,899
I love you so much.

153
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,835
Hmm. I love you.

154
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,780
I should've stayed.

155
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,249
Everyone kept saying,

156
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:29,888
"don't worry, we're praying
for her, don't worry."

157
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,126
Everyone's gonna die.

158
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,832
No amount of praying
is ever gonna change that.

159
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,754
You're not getting up yet.
Five minutes more.

160
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,257
<i> I can't believe I'm approaching</i>
<i> my one-year anniversary</i>

<i> Nova Scotia, Canada.</i>

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,131
<i> The food is amazing,</i>
<i> especially the Sushi.</i>

163
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:18,369
<i> The people are friendly</i>
<i> and although the gay community</i>

164
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,904

165
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:24,843
<i> I have some big plans</i>
<i> to really make an impact.</i>

166
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,757
What's wrong with you?

167
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,191
Nothing.

168
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,928
Look, I have to find
something else to do.

169
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,899
I'm just not cut out
for administrative work.

170
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,768
Give it some time?

171
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,369
I have things
i wanna do.

172
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,072
I want my own magazine.
I want something bigger.

173
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,774
I want...
I want to influence people.

174
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,009
I can't do that here.
You're being such a shit.

175
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,345
We made the decision
to leave San Francisco together.

176
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,179
No, we didn't.

177
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,413
I mean,
you had to take this job.

178
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,883
Just like you had
to take the job
that took us to San Francisco.

179
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:10,388
Which is how you got
your job at<i> XY,</i>
so you should be thanking me.

180
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:12,924
Is this...

181
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,059
This is supposed to be
Mexican food?

182
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,996
Why don't you go to the store
and make your own food?

183
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:18,563
Maybe I will.

184
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,165
You'll have to ask me
for money, though,

185
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,468
'cause you don't have any,
remember?

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,250
Thanks.

187
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,446
Hey.

188
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,249
Hey.

189
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,484
You're Mike, right?

190
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,386
Uh, yeah.

191
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:20,225
The<i> XY</i> survivor guide
really helped me out.

192
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,427
Are you stalking me
or something?

193
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,597
Tyler.

194
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,598
Hi.

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,265
Hi.

196
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,868
I just...
I wanted you to know

197
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,636
I agree with everything
that you say

198
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,305
about gay identity
and sexuality.

199
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:39,110
I don't wanna be
put into a box
just because I'm gay.

200
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,079
You don't wanna be in a box?

201
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,348
No, I don't wanna be in a box.

202
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,585
You're so fucking cute.

203
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,454
Can I buy you a drink?

204
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,489
Don't you have a boyfriend?

205
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:56,527
Hmm...
He'll think you're cute, too.

206
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,477
It's a galaxy.

207
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,513
Uh, actually it's a spiral.

208
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,949
It's the only symbol
that means anything.

209
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,451
It's infinite,
no beginning, no end.

210
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,687
There's a beginning
and there's an end.

211
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,622
All right, well, there's
a more complicated one

212
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,957
that has no beginning
and no end,

213
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,659
but I can't do it
on my pancakes, okay?

214
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,398
How did you guys meet?

215
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,334
How did we meet?

216
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,401
Uh, San Francisco.

217
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,104
We volunteered at this
aids prevention organization.

218
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:17,642
And we both got arrested
protesting this
Christian coalition event.

219
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,212
Which is how I knew
it was true love.

220
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,381
Awesome.

221
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:27,618
How about you?
What's your deal?

222
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,587
Who are you?

223
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,588
Uh...

224
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,590
I'm a physics student.

225
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,459
Really?
Yeah.

226
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,259
Physics.
Science.

227
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:40,465
Yeah. I wanna be an astronaut,
but that's probably a long shot.

228
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:45,103
Oh, god. I'd be terrified
to go into space.

229
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,738
It's just, to me,

230
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,208
earth is just this,
like, tiny speck
in the universe.

231
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,246
And humans have only
been around for just
a speck of that timeline.

232
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,414
So it's just...

233
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:02,620
There has to be more to life
than just this, don't you think?

234
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,225
Totally.

235
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,629
Totally.

236
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,266
So Tyler
was really cute, huh?

237
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,735
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

238
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,038
It is interesting, isn't it?

239
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,772
Very interesting.

240
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,041
You know why?

241
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,810
Because I love you so much.

242
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,080
And I really feel like
we're at a place
in our relationship

243
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,083
where there's more
than enough love to go around.

244
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,585
And I know that
I'm not afraid of that

245
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,421
and I don't think
that you are either.

246
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,290
Mm-mm. Maybe I am afraid.

247
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,525
Well, you shouldn't
be afraid

248
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,195
because I'm here
to protect you.
Why?

249
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,271
Carrot thief.

250
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:59,110
Here's our very uncool
soccer mom Van.

251
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,445
Whoo!

252
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,815
Who are these guys?

253
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,350
<i> July 23rd, 2002.</i>

254
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,452
Road trip.
Road trip.

255
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,855
<i> I'm driving across America</i>
<i> with Bennett and Tyler</i>

256
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:15,426
<i> for an exciting new project</i>
<i> I'm working on.</i>

257
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,427
I guess both beds are taken.

258
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,163
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep.

259
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:23,334
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

260
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:29,207
This is the most fun
I've ever had in my whole life.

261
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,442
Really?
No.

262
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,778
<i> We are making a documentary</i>

263
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,313
<i> about queer youth in America,</i>

264
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:39,383
<i> because discrimination</i>
<i> against lgbt youth</i>

265
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,885
<i> must be eliminated.</i>

266
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:45,490
<i> I just wish people could see</i>
<i> that these kids have faces,</i>

267
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:49,293
<i> names, and voices</i>
<i> that need to be heard.</i>

268
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,398
Growing up in the church
and realizing that you're gay

269
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,833
is very difficult.

270
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,837
You know, your family
has never talked about it.

271
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,872
I mean, I'm 13

272
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,540
and it's the first time
I've heard the word.

273
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,711
And when I heard the word
and knew what it was,

274
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,281
then it was like,
"hey, I know that.

275
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,818
I understand that.
That's me."

276
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,419
My mom, she's trying.

277
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,821
She's like really in the closet
about it.

278
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,589
She won't mention it to anybody
or anything like that.

279
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,625
Like, she tries to still act
like I'm straight

280
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,928
and expects me to act like
I'm straight along with her

281
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,862
when I'm not like that.

282
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,465
And this was
probably more overwhelming

283
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,235
when I tried
to kill myself, uh...

284
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:35,439
But I felt so invisible

285
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,476
to everyone around me
who was straight.

286
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,879
There are times when I realize

287
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:48,619
that I'm just as much a creation
of god as everyone else.

288
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,491
Olympia, Washington.

289
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,892
This is kind of somber.

290
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,829
But even though I grew up here,

291
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:04,435
because both my parents
don't live anymore,

292
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,871
it feels like this place
is a part of a past

293
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,940
that doesn't exist anymore.

294
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:12,310
And I wasn't gay here.

295
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,311
I mean, you couldn't be.

296
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,780
There was this kid that everyone
just thought was gay

297
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:21,786
and he had to leave school
'cause he got picked on so much.

298
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
What's it like here?

299
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,898
Liberty is falwell territory.

300
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,370
So as you can imagine,
it's not very gay-friendly.

301
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,575
So why do you stay?

302
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,943
Uh...

303
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,680
Well, I...

304
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,881
I don't know. I, um...

305
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,484
I didn't come out
to friends and family

306
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,719
until last year.

307
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:59,590
And I have another year
before I graduate.

308
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,492
I'm a Christian.

309
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,560
So...

310
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,829
Which a lot of people
think is impossible,

311
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,897
but I think that's
just as ridiculous

312
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,368
as the anti-gay right, so...

313
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,605
Just a second.

314
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,674
Hey, sof.

315
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,510
Do you want us
to call them for you?

316
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,381
We're just gonna...
We're gonna wait with you
until he comes, okay?

317
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:28,819
Her mother just passed.
Do you mind not filming us?

318
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,553
So awful.

319
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,423
Here, let's pray.
Let's pray for her, okay?

320
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,624
All right, turn it off.

321
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,692
We just wanna ask, father,

322
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,060
that you would
just give her the strength

323
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,730
to get through this
incredibly difficult time

324
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,600
and we pray that you
would just fill us all

325
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,935
with the compassion to know
what she must be going through

326
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,606
because it would be impossible
for us to fully comprehend.

327
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,008
Just show her yourself, father,
during this time

328
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,545
and look to you right now,
father...

329
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,933
Hey.

330
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,102
Babe.

331
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,571
We gotta go.
We gotta be there at 9:30.
You ready?

332
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,774
Yeah.
All right.
See you in the car.

333
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,448
<i> I didn't come out</i>
<i> to friends and family</i>

334
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,383

<i> I'm a Christian.</i>

336
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,052
<i> So...</i>

337
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,421

338

340
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:50,034
<i> When I was young, I didn't know</i>
<i> that there were people like me.</i>

341
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,038
<i> I felt lost, alone,</i>
<i> and confused.</i>

342
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,576
<i> I never even told my mother,</i>
<i> my best friend, that I was gay</i>

343
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:01,112
<i> because I was afraid</i>
<i> she wouldn't accept me.</i>

344
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,547
<i> That's why</i>
<i> we're on this journey:</i>

345
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,752
<i> To let gay kids know</i>
<i> that they are not alone.</i>

346
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:11,489
<i> And you know what?</i>
<i> I learned a lot as well.</i>

347
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,024
<i> Because we met</i>
<i> so many amazing people</i>

348
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,860
<i> who've heard their parents</i>
<i> or pastors</i>

349
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,863

<i> to the realization</i>
<i> that they're beautiful,</i>

351
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:26,036
<i> blessed, and that god</i>
<i> loves them just as they are.</i>

352
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,541
<i> I mean, people who believe</i>
<i> that homosexuality is wrong</i>

353
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:36,680
<i> are gonna change their minds</i>
<i> thanks to this next generation.</i>

354
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,914
The sky is fucking beautiful.

355
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:49,253
What is this, babe?

356
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,754
Hmm?

357
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,690
Oh, it's stupid.

358
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,059
Just somebody gave it to me
on the street.

359
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:58,696
"Where will we go
when we die?"

360
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,165
Baby.

361
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,767
You guys,
where will we go
when we die?

362
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,705
In 2012, the world
is supposed to end.

363
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,673
Is that a real thing?

364
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,141
I hope not.

365
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,843
Everyone knows this.

366
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,013
It's what they drew
on the Mayan calendar.

367
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,516
You know,
the Mayan calendar thing.

368
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:21,919
That's what they drew.
It was the moon and the sun.

369
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,875
What? I'm curious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

370
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:21,211
We wanna know. Please.
We wanna know. Please.

371
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,281
I don't think
they wanna know.

372
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,900
Mike.

373
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,738
You guys go on.
I'll meet you at home.

374
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,707
You okay?

375
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,941
Yeah, I'm fine.

376
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,210
Where are you going?

377
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,679
Michael?

378
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,751
What's that about?
I have absolutely
no earthly idea.

379
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,828
Baby.

380
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:50,067
I was worried about you today.
What's going on?

381
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,940
It's stupid.

382
00:27:56,942 --> 00:28:00,711
Baby, nothing's stupid.
Tell me what.

383
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:09,053
Do you think when we die,

384
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:14,124
we just disappear
like we never existed?

385
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,297
No, I don't think that.

386
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,468
Because I know that
we'll always be together.

387
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,305
Baby.

388
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,380
Baby.

389
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,050
Baby, you're okay.
I'm here.

390
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,838
Let's pray for her.
Let's pray.

391
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,852
Bennett!

392
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,987
Bennett!

393
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,991
I'm really lightheaded.

394
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:26,930
It's okay. It's okay.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

395
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,278
Okay.

396
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,884
Your heartrate
seems to have returned
back to normal.

397
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,018
Can you check again?

398
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,888
Just because your father had hcm
does not mean that you have it.

399
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,360
We followed
our chest pain protocol
and there's nothing abnormal.

400
00:29:56,362 --> 00:30:00,130
You had a panic attack. Okay?

401
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,967
Where's Bennett?

402
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,902
He's in the lobby.

403
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:09,006
As soon as you're checked out,
you can see him.

404
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,541
All right?

405
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,109
Thank you.

406
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,115
<i> I was 13 years old,</i>

407
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,250
<i> walking along the beach</i>
<i> with my father,</i>

408
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,252
<i> when he suddenly collapsed</i>
<i> and died</i>

409
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,589
<i> from an unexpected</i>
<i> heart condition.</i>

410
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,327
<i> If I've inherited his disease,</i>

411
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,597
<i> the same thing</i>
<i> could happen to me.</i>

412
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,500
What's wrong, baby?

413
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,169
It's happening again.
I can feel it.

414
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,106
The tests confirmed that--
they don't know.

415
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,042
They don't care.

416
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,546
<i> Now I'm having</i>
<i> heart palpitations</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

417
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,883
<i> And contrary to what</i>
<i> the doctors keep saying,</i>

418
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,954
<i> I just know</i>
<i> they aren't panic attacks.</i>

419
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,989
<i> After months of fighting</i>
<i> with my insurance,</i>

420
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,291
<i> I was finally allowed</i>
<i> to see a specialist</i>

421
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,527
<i> who could definitively test</i>
<i> whether or not</i>

422
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,064
<i> I inherited</i>
<i> my father's condition.</i>

423
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,167
<i> Now I have to wait</i>
<i> for the results.</i>

424
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,904
Michael,
just calm down.
Calm down!

425
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,038
Do you know
what this disease means?

426
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,076
It means
i could die any minute,
just drop dead!

427
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,044
You calm down!

428
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,204
Dr. Williams?

429
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,572
Hi.

430
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,830
Thank you, god.

431
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,836
Thank you, god.

432
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,074
<i> The test confirmed</i>

433
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,310
<i> that I did not inherit</i>
<i> my father's heart condition.</i>

434
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:44,448
<i> Although it's</i>
<i> a massive sigh of relief,</i>

435
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,516
<i> I keep thinking to myself...</i>

436
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,520
<i> If I was really</i>
<i> just having panic attacks,</i>

437
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,856
<i> then what's wrong with me?</i>

438
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:55,659
<i> What am I afraid of?</i>

439
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,100
<i> All I know is that when</i>
<i> faced with your own death,</i>

440
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,702
<i> it reminds you</i>
<i> of what's important in life.</i>

441
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:10,607
<i> And for me,</i>
<i> that's helping other people.</i>

442
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,309
Okay.

443
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:16,146
<i> So I've decided</i>
<i> to start my own magazine.</i>

444
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,249
<i> I'm calling it</i> yga.

445
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,217
Young gay Americans.

446
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,254
<i> It's gonna be the biggest</i>
<i> and most sophisticated magazine</i>

447
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:28,892
<i> aimed at improving the lives</i>
<i> of lgbt youth.</i>

448
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,440
Hmm.

449
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,969
What is this?

450
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,738
What is this?

451
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,275
Oh, my god! Hi!

452
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,877
You didn't.

453
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,545
I know you
wanted one, baby.

454
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,380
Oh, my god!

455
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,755
Ooh.

456
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,558
What are we gonna call you?

457
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,527
What are we gonna call you?

458
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,898
Olly. Olly, heel.

459
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,368
I've been thinking
about the next issue of<i> yga.</i>

460
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,838
I think we need to address
this whole christianity thing.

461
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,806
What do you mean?

462
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,942
Well, people think that gays
and christians are enemies.

463
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:31,748
We've met so many people
who've managed to balance
their faith and their sexuality.

464
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,651
But we've also met
so many people whose parents

465
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,254
and churches tell them
they're gonna burn in hell.

466
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,290
Yeah, which is why
we should address it
in the magazine.

467
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:43,893
I mean, the whole "you're gay,
you're going to hell" myth

468
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:48,932
was started by mistranslations
and misinterpretations
of the Bible.

469
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:53,403
I mean, god doesn't care
what your sexual orientation is.

470
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:58,275
And the one thing
that the gay movement
doesn't understand

471
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,442
that I think christianity does

472
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:06,383
is that not everyone
wants to be a part
of the subculture.

473
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,053
I'm sorry,
what did you do
with my boyfriend?

474
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,488
Shut up.

475
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,357
I'm not gonna write like...

476
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,763
Gospel according to Michael
or something.

477
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,535
<i> It might seem strange</i>
<i> for a gay youth magazine</i>

478
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:29,339
<i> to dedicate an entire issue</i>
<i> to religion,</i>

479
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:32,776
<i> but it's too important</i>
<i> to ignore.</i>

480
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,414
<i> When my parents died,</i>
<i> I blamed god.</i>

481
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,381
<i> When I came out,</i>

482
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,319
<i> I distanced myself even further</i>
<i> from religion.</i>

483
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:47,457
<i> You see, I thought I was</i>
<i> too smart to believe in god,</i>

484
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,660
<i> that he was only</i>
<i> for the needy.</i>

485
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,662
<i> But after</i>
<i> a recent health scare,</i>

486
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:57,867
<i> I felt this nudging</i>
<i> in the back of my mind:</i>

487
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,904
<i> The presence of god.</i>

488
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,872
<i> And you know what?</i>

489
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,343
<i> I was no longer afraid.</i>

490
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,744
Aah!

491
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:10,547
<i> Some religious figures</i>
<i> spout hateful rhetoric</i>

492
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:14,451
<i> and try to force</i>
<i> a monopoly on the truth.</i>

493
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,921
<i> But the only truth is love.</i>

494
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:22,425
<i> The only sin is denying love.</i>

495
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,728
<i> Stop hating.</i>

496
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,064
<i> Start loving.</i>

497
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,142
You gonna join us?

498
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:41,778
Uh, yeah, just one second.

499
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,385
What?

500
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,688
Uh, you're really combing
through that thing,
aren't you?

501
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,893
Look, my whole life,
i thought the Bible
was full of hate...

502
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,128
And it's not.

503
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,863
There's a lot of love in here.

504
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:04,667
So your interest in the Bible
is more than just research?

505
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:09,406
Well, there's a lot
of Christian roots
in my family,

506
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,041
my mom, my aunt and...

507
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:12,776
Just curious.

508
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:16,413
Your aunts disowned you
when you came out.

509
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,047
That's not family.

510
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,949
I'm all for curiosity but--

511
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:24,120
i-i just feel like
something saved me,

512
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:27,123
shook me and woke me up.

513
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,494
And that someone is god?

514
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:38,601
Mike, he didn't save you
because you were never dying.

515
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,173
Okay.

516
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,510
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

517
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:51,815
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

518
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,786
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

519
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:02,659
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

520
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,894
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

521
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:09,532
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

522
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,108
Don't see many people
flaunting that out in the open.

523
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,143
Oh.

524
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,479
I've seen you
reading out here before

525
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:26,082
and I thought maybe you'd
wanna come to my church.

526
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:30,620
Any Sunday,
just to check it out.

527
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,224
See what the mormon religion
has to offer.

528
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:40,697
The gospel teaches us
that we are the spirit children

529
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,065
of heavenly parents.

530
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:48,905
Now, many people ask,
are we like other christians?

531
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,007
Why of course we are.

532
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,076
We believe in Jesus Christ

533
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:56,513
and we believe
in life after death.

534
00:41:56,515 --> 00:42:01,017
And everyone is welcome
at the lds church.

535
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,888
Christ's atonement
allows mankind to be saved
from their sins...

536
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,692
And to return to live with god
and their loved ones in heaven.

537
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,862
Did you grow up
with any kind of faith?

538
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,063
Not really.

539
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:14,964
My mother was Christian,

540
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,768
but she didn't really take
me or my sister to church,

541
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,138
and my father
was a Berkeley hippie,

542
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,575
kind of agnostic
or even atheist.

543
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,010
They were very good people

544
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:31,681
and I know
I'll see them again in heaven.

545
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,551
My mom passed away as well.

546
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,319
So I know how hard that is.

547
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:41,291
I was so afraid and angry,
you know?

548
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,859
Yeah, me, too.

549
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,894
It's really hard
to deal with death

550
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,031
when you don't know
where you're going.

551
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,301
But once you do,
then you have peace

552
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:54,938
and you realize
that god's not to blame.

553
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,840
Right.
Yeah.

554
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,176
Catherine.

555
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,880
It was nice to meet you.

556
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,248
You, too.

557
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,120
She's single, fyi.

558
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,889
Fyi?

559
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,657
What, you think
she likes me?

560
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,859
Yeah. Yeah,
it seemed like it.

561
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:22,332
But I mean, don't worry.
There's plenty of single ladies
looking for a husband.

562
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:26,235
I wasn't even thinking
about that kind of thing.

563
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:30,039
Oh, well, maybe it's something
you should start thinking about.

564
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,977
I can get you in touch with her
if you want.

565
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,112
Oh, um...

566
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,681
If you're interested.

567
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,751
Sure. I don't know.

568
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,387
Yeah?
Okay. Whatever.
Yeah, okay.

569
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,755
All right.
Okay, thanks.

570
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:49,025
Embarrassing me
a little bit.

571
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,018
<i> Welcome back to new beginnings</i>

572
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,221
<i> and thank you for listening</i>
<i> to our continued conversation</i>

573
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,856
<i> about the truth path to heaven.</i>

574
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,893
<i> Doctor, how would you respond</i>
<i> to other christians</i>

575
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,128
<i> who disagree with your angle?</i>

576
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,765
<i> Look, all I'm trying</i>
<i> to do is help people.</i>

577
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:32,669
<i> It just pains me so much when</i>
<i> I hear so-called christians</i>

578
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:36,205
<i> side with the left on issues</i>
<i> such as homosexuality.</i>

579
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,308
<i> Now, I'm not condoning hate.</i>

580
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,678
<i> In fact, this is about love.</i>

581
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,147
<i> Choosing a gay identity</i>
<i> will condemn you</i>

582
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,982
<i> to an eternity of suffering.</i>

583
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:48,351
<i> And I wanna save people</i>
<i> from that.</i>

584
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,120
<i> Whether it's abortion</i>
<i> or adultery</i>

585
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:55,124
<i> or accepting religions</i>
<i> other than christianity,</i>

586
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,793
<i> you must obey god's law</i>

587
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:00,997
<i> or you will not be allowed</i>
<i> into his kingdom.</i>

588
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,071
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying
that it's wrong.

589
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,241
I'm just saying
that over the course
of thousands of years,

590
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,845
people with an agenda
have made christianity
what it is today.

591
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:55,351
Yeah, but the original message
is still the same,
it's about love.

592
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,790
You know, I would've never
pegged you as a Buddhist.

593
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:01,224
Why?

594
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,260
What, 'cause I don't look
a certain way?

595
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,428
No, I...

596
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,930
I don't know why
i just said that.

597
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,899
I'm just kidding you.

598
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:10,433
Meditation.

599
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,835
People get weird in their head
about meditation.

600
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:14,237
They think it's weird
or hippie.

601
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,207
I think it's about
developing mindfulness.

602
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,109
You know, it's about
living moment to moment.

603
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:24,280
And in a deeper level,
it's about knowing yourself.

604
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:28,017
That's why I started
volunteering at
the Buddhist center.

605
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,353
They have classes on Friday.
You should come.

606
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:35,358
Oh, I have to go out of town
for this speaking thing.

607
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,293
What kind of speaking thing?

608
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,329
It's about gay youth
in America.

609
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,199
No way. That's awesome.

610
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,575
Welcome to our very first panel

611
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:28,144
on being young and gay
in America.

612
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,146
Joining us is Judy Shepard,

613
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:33,149
president of
the Matthew Shepard foundation,

614
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:35,184
dedicated to
working towards causes

615
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,855
championed by her son Matthew
during his life.

616
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,256
Thank you for joining us.

617
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,531
Michael glatze,
former editor of<i> XY</i> magazine,

618
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:53,202

00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:56,105
as well as lambda's

620
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,473

621
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:01,577
participant in the
award-winning documentary

622
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,445
<i> Jim in bold,</i>

623
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,347
and co-founder
of<i> young gay Americans,</i>

624
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,016
which is now
a full-fledged magazine.

625
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,992
What does being gay
mean to you?

626
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:21,564
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

627
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,167
<i> And it's more important now</i>
<i> than ever</i>

628
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,404
<i> to make allies</i>
<i> and make alliances</i>

629
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:33,009
<i> both inside</i>
<i> and outside the gay community.</i>

630
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:42,151
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

631
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,053
<i> It's not about--</i>

632
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,722
hey.

633
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,559
No.

634
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,730
I have to walk the dog.

635
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,137
Hey.

636
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,776
What are you doing?

637
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:18,014
I need some space.

638
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,316
Mike--
look, I just...

639
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:22,018
I need some time
to figure this out,

640
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,620
to see where this
is taking me.

641
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,557
Why can't you come to me
for help?

642
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,726
We have to talk about this
before--

643
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:32,294
look, I just...

644
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:35,531
I need to get away
from this life.

645
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,367
Our life?
Yes.

646
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:42,772
And what exactly is it
about our life that you need
to get away from, being gay?

647
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,407
I don't know.

648
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:45,508
I don't know!

649
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:50,346
Okay, uh, are you
attracted to women?

650
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,081
Because if that's the case,
then fine, go explore.

651
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:56,318
I just wanna be with my parents
in heaven. Is that so hard
to understand?

652
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,187
Can you even hear yourself
right now?

653
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,823
What happened
to the misinterpretation
of the Bible?

654
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,058
It's a fucking book, Mike!

655
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,760
I read the Bible the same way
i read anything else,

656
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,228
with an open mind
and an open heart.

657
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,263
Oh, is that what
you call this?

658
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:11,067
'Cause the way you're talking
doesn't exactly sound
very fucking open-minded.

659
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:17,406
This relationship
has just developed
into something unhealthy.

660
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,176
What does that even mean?

661
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,378
Tyler?

662
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,614
You were just as
interested in that as I was.

663
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:26,315
No.

664
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:27,483
I just wanted you
to be happy

665
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:29,418
because I was afraid
you were gonna leave.

666
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,187
I was never
gonna leave, Mike.

667
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:31,821
I've stood by you.

668
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:34,290
I've held your hand while you
were so terrified of dying

669
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:37,860
that you created illnesses
that didn't even exist.

670
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:42,264
The truth is that
i was living a lie.

671
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:47,603
The truth is that god loves us--
shut the fuck up!

672
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,875
Okay.

673
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:54,443
Wait.

674
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,387
Please don't go.

675
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,429
Where are you going?

676
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:24,673
The thing
that will really kill you...

677
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:29,445
Is repressing
who you truly are.

678
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,315
That's what you
should really be afraid of.

679
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:46,288
So he just left this here
out in the open?

680
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:37,373
<i> I have come to a decision</i>
<i> that will be shocking</i>

681
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,542
<i> to anyone I used to relate to.</i>

682
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:46,415
<i> The presence of god</i>
<i> has grown strong in my life.</i>

683
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,518
<i> He told me</i>
<i> that my panic attacks</i>

684
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,690
<i> were caused by my shallow,</i>
<i> sinful lifestyle.</i>

685
00:54:55,459 --> 00:55:00,596
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that identifying as gay</i>

686
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:05,067
<i> prevents you from finding</i>
<i> your true self within.</i>

687
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,336
<i> And we must be our true selves</i>

688
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:11,340
<i> in order to join god</i>
<i> in his kingdom.</i>

689
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,411
<i> Therefore, I,</i>
<i> Michael glatze,</i>

690
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:19,081
<i> no longer identify</i>
<i> as gay.</i>

691
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,783
Why did you do it?

692
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,222
"Gay activist goes straight"?

693
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:43,892
You gave the anti-gay right
the story of their dreams.

694
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,828
I don't know why.

695
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,930
I don't know.

696
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:49,731
Who pushed you?

697
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:50,699
No one.

698
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:53,569
I just wanted
to tell my story.

699
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,571
Look, I think
this all happened

700
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,840
because god needed
to teach me a lesson.

701
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:02,478
That's why I'm here,
to make it better.

702
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:10,486
Meditation is a way
of slowing down

703
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,689
and developing kindness
towards yourself.

704
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:19,962
Through mindfulness practice,
we develop strength of mind.

705
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:21,997
We become more present

706
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:26,068
and we learn
to appreciate our world.

707
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:34,243
<i> God works in mysterious ways.</i>

708
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:35,844
<i> He has sent me to a place</i>

709
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,680
<i> where I can get away</i>
<i> from the physical world</i>

710
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,917
<i> so that I can focus</i>
<i> on my true self--</i>

711
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:44,920
<i> a happier, healthier man,</i>

712
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,290
<i> free of unnatural desires.</i>

713
00:58:54,998 --> 00:59:00,235
<i> At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i> why god would send a Christian</i>

714
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,638
<i> to a Buddhist retreat.</i>

715
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,708
<i> But I have faith</i>
<i> in his plan for me.</i>

716
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,250
<i> Desire is powerful.</i>

717
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:18,253
<i> And god is testing me.</i>

718
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:23,725
<i> But I refuse to give in</i>
<i> to temptation.</i>

719
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,831
<i> I've come to the realization</i>

720
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,868
<i> that god wants me</i>
<i> to use meditation</i>

721
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:37,906
<i> to rid myself</i>
<i> of abnormal desires.</i>

722
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,944
God gave Buddha the light
to be Buddha.

723
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:42,344
He did.

724
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:44,646
Michael,
what are you talking about?

725
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:49,718
I just want us
to be on the right path
for our future,

726
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,321
for our health,
for the afterlife.

727
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:56,992
I am on the right path, okay?
My path.

728
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,204
Michael, i--
I'm sorry.

729
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,742
I'm sorry, Nico.

730
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,061
It's the same kind of strength

731
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,998
that you need
to-to clear your mind.

732
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,801
You know, we just, we need
to find that strength

733
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:44,773
to fight what we both know
in our hearts is wrong.

734
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,241
We just have to fight it.

735
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,876
Stop, Michael. Stop.

736
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,245
No, I mean...

737
01:00:58,688 --> 01:00:59,855
Michael, you're confused.

738
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:04,893
You're very confused
and it's at my expense.

739
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,855
<i> People have been asking</i>
<i> how I am.</i>

740
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,724
<i> Some out of support.</i>

741
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,126
<i> Others who think</i>
<i> I've reconsidered.</i>

742
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:43,298
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that Bennett represents soul,</i>

743
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:48,870
<i> Tyler represents body,</i>
<i> Nico represents mind.</i>

744
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,107
<i> Father, son, holy ghost.</i>

745
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:55,310
<i> I guess god need me</i>
<i> to complete the Trinity</i>

746
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,746
<i> in order to move on.</i>

747
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,748
<i> So I'm ready to set</i>
<i> the record straight.</i>

748
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:04,886
<i> I was a heterosexual person</i>
<i> with a homosexual problem,</i>

749
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,456
<i> and I took care</i>
<i> of that problem.</i>

750
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:11,059
<i> I have not reconsidered.</i>

751
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,830
A good number of people
have come forward

752
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:15,964
and expressed
their concern

753
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,933
about your being involved
with this organization.

754
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:21,970
This center is supposed
to accept everyone.

755
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,405
Yes, and we do.

756
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,841
We welcome people
of all beliefs,

757
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:28,744
but we don't tolerate hate.

758
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,779
I don't hate anybody.

759
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:35,817
Michael, you've written
what some would call
very hateful things.

760
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:39,955
Those are my beliefs.

761
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,390
Are you okay?

762
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:44,259
Yeah.

763
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,195
Are you okay?

764
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,431
I don't know...

765
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:54,102
I don't understand
what has changed, but I, uh...

766
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,238
Here we practice compassion.

767
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,009
And I'm just, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work out.

768
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:06,848
So, because I'm Christian
and I express my opinions...

769
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,184
I have to leave.

770
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:13,421
That's so messed up.

771
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,459
That's really everything?

772
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,429
Your whole life
is in that one bag?

773
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:57,265
Yeah.

774
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,603
Do you think
you'll stay here?

775
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:08,143
I mean, San Francisco
can't be the best place
for an...

776
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,244
Ex-gay.

777
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:15,183
I'm not an ex-gay.
I'm just me.

778
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,286
Honestly, I thought
you'd be happy.

779
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,889
I mean, you never
really approved.

780
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,390
That's not true.

781
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:26,027
Then why haven't we been close?

782
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,395
I mean, you're my sister.

783
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:31,600
We're supposed to be there
for each other.

784
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,337
We can be close now.

785
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,372
I'm glad you're here.

786
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:44,379
And I want you to be happy--
loving whomever.

787
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,481
Yeah?

788
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:47,983
Yeah.

789
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,323
I'm sorry.

790
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,691
No, I can't.
What?

791
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,426
No, I'm sorry. Uh...

792
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,462
What happened?
I can't. Um...

793
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:45,133
It's not you, it's...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

794
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:36,084
Olly, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

795
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,458
<i> Hello?</i>

796
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,168
Michael?

797
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,670
<i> Bennett.</i>

798
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,309
Where are you?

799
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,845
<i> Are you okay?</i>

800
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:07,715
<i> Michael?</i>

801
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:09,184
I have to go.

802
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:12,687
<i> Wait, why did you call me,</i>
<i> Michael?</i>

803
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:26,868
To my friends who are trapped
in homosexuality:

804
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,504
I wanna thank you
for your kind comments

805
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,807
and keen observations
regarding my story

806
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:37,779
and my revelation that
i am no longer homosexual

807
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,547
and am now heterosexual.

808
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:44,252
The gay identity has been
packaged and fed to you,

809
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:48,623
and if you identify as gay
then you have eaten it,

810
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,126
preventing you
from further growth

811
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,828
and understanding
of your true self.

812
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:58,333
<i> But it's not too late</i>
<i> to save yourself.</i>

813
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,535
<i> If you follow my lead.</i>

814
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:05,473
<i> I am confident.</i>
<i> I am blessed.</i>

815
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,808
<i> I am strong.</i>

816
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:12,180
<i> I am ready to give up</i>
<i> my life for Christ</i>

817
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:16,618
<i> in order to find</i>
<i> my true self.</i>

818
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,921
You sure you
don't want a coffee?

819
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:30,625
I don't drink coffee anymore.

820
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,864
You're well?

821
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,700
Yeah. Why?

822
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,603
Just asking.

823
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:47,842
I'm great.
I've never been better.

824
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:53,548
Well, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

825
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,852
So does Bennett.

826
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:58,987
Hmm.

827
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:02,857
I wish I could understand
what you're going through.

828
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,595
I just don't want to be
perceived as gay

829
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,531
for the rest of my experiences.

830
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:13,801
It's that simple.

831
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:19,274
Are you still
with Bennett?

832
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:20,008
No.

833
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:26,848
I'm, uh, going to Europe
to study space science.

834
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,616
That's great.

835
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,752
I'm going
to Bible school.

836
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:34,022
God told me
to become a pastor.

837
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:46,668
I don't want to open
old wounds or anything,

838
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:53,941
but I also don't know when
I'll ever see you again.

839
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,413
I want you to know
how much you meant to me.

840
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,822
I know you don't care anymore.

841
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,559
But I needed to say it.

842
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:14,662
For closure.

843
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:21,636
This whole thing...

844
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:25,506
It broke my heart.

845
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,344
Tyler...

846
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:32,680
I'm sorry.

847
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:36,784
But I need to live
for myself now.

848
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:40,955
Okay.

849
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,395
Okay.

850
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,465
Take care.

851
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:43,084
Now, sometimes somebody's
gonna ask you what you believe.

852
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,620
They're gonna say,
"you're a Christian,

853
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,455
all right,
what do you believe?"

854
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:51,626
Maybe they're an atheist
or a agnostic or a Muslim

855
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:54,896
or a Buddha, you know,
who knows what they are?

856
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:57,865
And you better be ready
to tell 'em.

857
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:00,802
We believe the Bible
is the word of god,

858
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:07,208
the supreme, final authority
in life and in our faith.

859
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,178
We believe in one god,

860
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,080
eternally existing
in three persons:

861
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,817
The father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

862
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:19,454
And we believe
the sole condition

863
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,823
for receiving
everlasting life

864
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:29,931
is belief and faith alone
in the lord Jesus Christ.

865
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,243
Thank you.

866
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,945
I'll have one
of those, please.

867
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,226
Hi, I'm Michael.

868
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:35,129
Uh, hi, I'm Rebekah.

869
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,867
Guess we like
all the same things.

870
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,771
I love it here.

871
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,940
I mean, I never though
I'd end up in Wyoming,

872
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:49,677
but I feel like I've
finally found my niche.

873
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,980
Where'd you think
you'd end up?

874
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,784
That's a good question.
I don't know.

875
01:15:56,786 --> 01:16:00,788
All I know is that I've
always wanted to help people,

876
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:04,625
because some people
struggle so much

877
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:08,095
when the solution
is actually very simple.

878
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:10,298
It's right there
in Matthew 10:

879
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:14,635
The road may not be easy,
but if we give up our lives

880
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:21,208
for Christ, then we'll find
our true selves.

881
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,117
Where did you
go to college?

882
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,586
Dartmouth.

883
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:32,620
Wow.

884
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:33,955
And you majored in music?

885
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:37,158
In creative writing
and English literature,

886
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,795
but I minored
in music theory
and composition.

887
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:44,699
That must've kept you busy.

888
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,367
What kind of stuff
did you write?

889
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:51,205
Well, my thesis
was all poetry, actually.

890
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,808
Can I read some?

891
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,343
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

892
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:59,780
My poetry
is from a different life.

893
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,348
But I, um...

894
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:05,386
I'm so interested in music now
because it transcends language.

895
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:09,323
You know, it's like people
don't have to argue about it

896
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,826
or judge it
or misinterpret it.

897
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:13,127
They can just listen.

898
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,764
You know, I just play
and they just listen.

899
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:17,264
You know?

900
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:19,667
I don't know if I do,
to be honest,

901
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:22,803
but the way you say it,
i want to.

902
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,006
I'm sorry, I'm just blabbing.
What about you?

903
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:29,343
No, don't be sorry!
You're not blabbing. Um...

904
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,911
I majored in theater.

905
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:31,946
Theater? Really?
Yeah.

906
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:36,817
Yeah, it was really fun,
but it's not like
it's a real job.

907
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:40,254
I actually stage managed
a little bit after college,

908
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:44,091
but I don't know,
i felt adrift.

909
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:49,864
So I came here,
hoping to figure out my path.

910
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:52,199
Me, too.

911
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,318
I can't believe
you've never had Sushi.

912
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,089
Who hasn't had Sushi?
It's crazy.

913
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,024
Mm.

914
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:51,225
Oh, no.

915
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:53,227
You don't like it.

916
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,028
I'm sorry.

917
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,263
Oh, I'm so sorry.

918
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:57,832
Oh...
I'm sorry.

919
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:01,202
No, I used to hate it
when my ex did that.

920
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:03,304
Always making decisions.

921
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:05,973
We can go somewhere else.
No.

922
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:08,142
No, no, no.
No, it's okay.

923
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,076
Are you sure?

924
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:13,514
Yes. Yeah.
You like it. It's fine.

925
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:22,456
Uh, how, um, how long ago
was the ex you mentioned?

926
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,993
Oh. It was a long time ago.
It was, uh...

927
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:28,529
I don't know why
i brought that up.

928
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:30,264
It was stupid.

929
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,967
Well, um, was it serious?

930
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:36,036
Were you gonna marry her?

931
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:42,543
It was serious,
but, um, no, not marriage.

932
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,380
What about you?

933
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,848
Oh, no, I've...

934
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:50,484
I've never been in
a serious relationship.

935
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:55,222
My parents are very,
very conservative.

936
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,458
Do you think
they'd approve of me?

937
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,562
The future pastor
i met at Bible school?

938
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:04,398
Yes, I think they'd approve.

939
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,203
Rebekah.

940
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,004
Hi.

941
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,273
Hi.

942
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,176
What?

943
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,344
I just...

944
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,380
Since when do you
wear shirts like that?

945
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:57,251
What? It's not inappropriate
and it's hot out.

946
01:20:57,253 --> 01:21:03,324
You're here to serve our lord,
not distract our men.

947
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:07,528
I don't think
I'm distracting anyone.

948
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,963
Is this about Michael?

949
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:13,367
We are not letting what we have
get in the way of our studies.

950
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:17,204
Besides, the lord
brought us together.

951
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:20,241
It's about his past.

952
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:22,142
What about it?

953
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,113
You really don't know?

954
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,516
Know what?

955
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,472
Rebekah.

956
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:52,606
Oh. Hi.

957
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,074
Are we still meeting?

958
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,645
Yeah, just let me finish this.
I'll be right there.

959
01:21:57,647 --> 01:22:01,415
Okay.
I'll be in the cafeteria.

960
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,417
Okay.

961
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:25,539
I have something
i have to tell you.

962
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,079
You already know,
don't you?

963
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:38,419
Are you still
attracted to men?

964
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:40,587
No.

965
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:43,991
It's in the past.

966
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:45,092
Okay, I...

967
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,593
God showed me the light.

968
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,429
He showed me the truth.

969
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:53,167
A lot of people have pasts
they're not proud of,

970
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:57,504
but god forgives, right?

971
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,608
My life has changed so much
since I've met you.

972
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,645
And my feelings for you
are real.

973
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:08,415
My feelings for you
are real, too.

974
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:15,022
But I feel like we should
just keep hanging out
and see what happens.

975
01:23:15,024 --> 01:23:19,526
Maybe not settle on
anything too specific.

976
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:22,396
If that's okay.

977
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,733
Okay.

978
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,196
Hi, I'm Michael.

979
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:36,804
Now, I wanna tell you
a little secret

980
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:41,809
about a great gift from god.

981
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,511
This gift is a human emotion

982
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:49,850
and considered destructive
by the enemies of god.

983
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,289
Fear.

984
01:24:55,291 --> 01:25:01,361
You can never, never,
never stop

985
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:04,198
fearing yourself.

986
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,302
We are our own worst enemies.

987
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:15,642
And we must fear ourselves till
the day we meet god himself.

988
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:22,249
God didn't put us here to live
our lives in constant fear.

989
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:23,150
No, of course not.

990
01:25:23,152 --> 01:25:27,154
And then he scolded me
for asking questions.

991
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:28,622
Well, that's not fair.

992
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,490
We're here to learn

993
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:30,724
and we learn in part
by asking questions.

994
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:34,128
No, we're here to serve god,
not to identify

995
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:39,399
as the exact kind of christians
they want us to be.

996
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,768
I'm sorry.

997
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:42,669
Don't be.

998
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:48,175
You know what's best
because that's god
speaking through you.

999
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,751
You wanted to see me?

1000
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,754
Now, you've been rallying
the students against us

1001
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:05,826
as though you're
being controlled
by the devil himself.

1002
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:10,831
I've learned a lot
about the Bible here,

1003
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,266
and for that I thank you.

1004
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:18,505
But I refuse to be controlled
by anyone other than god.

1005
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,806
I follow my own path.

1006
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:23,544
Yeah, and you want others
to follow you.

1007
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,947
Perhaps it's best
if we mail you your diploma

1008
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:30,817
and that you not attend
the ceremony.

1009
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,392
I don't know if i
can stay here anymore.

1010
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:40,961
Oh. Where will we go?

1011
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,464
We?

1012
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:50,470
Uh, I've been praying about it.

1013
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,839
About us.

1014
01:26:52,841 --> 01:27:00,347
I told god how I feel about you
and how much you mean to me.

1015
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:02,282
And you know what?

1016
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,921
I was consumed
with nothing but peace.

1017
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:11,258
Pure peace.

1018
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:16,797
I love you.

1019
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:19,399
I love you, too.

1020
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,468
And be not conformed
to this world:

1021
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:58,705
But be you transformed
by the renewing of your mind,

1022
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:04,511
that you may prove
that good, glorious,

1023
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:07,547
and perfect will of god.

1024
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:12,886
That you may know that good,
acceptable,

1025
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:15,622
and perfect will of god.

1026
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:51,658
- Which would you prefer to have?
- Frosted flakes or fruit loops?

1027
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,493
Well, obviously fruit loops.

1028
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,728
Why? Why obviously?

1029
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:57,497
Well, you're a fruit loop.

1030
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:18,919
There you are.

1031
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,987
Are you okay?

1032
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,524
Yeah, I'm fine.

1033
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,564
Okay, got 'em.

1034
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:35,702
You get everything?

1035
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,070
Mm-hmm.

1036
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,843
These are going to storage.

1037
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:53,120
Well, so you can have
a little more room
for your shoes?

1038
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:53,787
Shut up.

1039
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:56,823
I have never seen anyone
with more shoes than you.

1040
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:59,793
You can never have
too many shoes.

1041
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,707
Get those out of here.

1042
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:33,894
Hello?

1043
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:35,695
<i> Hi.</i>

1044
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:42,636
Hi.

1045
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,906
<i> How are you?</i>

1046
01:30:45,908 --> 01:30:48,041
Good.

1047
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:50,110
I finished school.

1048
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,947
But I'm no longer
on their path.

1049
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:59,119
<i> So what path</i>
<i> are you on now?</i>

1050
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,086
My own.

1051
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:04,558
<i> I'm going to be the pastor</i>
<i> of my own church.</i>

1052
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:11,498
Why are you calling?

1053
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,799
Um...

1054
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:15,769
I, uh...

1055
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:18,104
I got the picture
you sent of olly.

1056
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:21,174
<i> I know it was months ago,</i>
<i> but I didn't respond.</i>

1057
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:24,077
<i> So how is she?</i>

1058
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:27,514
Oh, she's getting old.

1059
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:28,849
But she's okay.

1060
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:29,649
She has this

1061
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:32,519
<i> stuffed animal that she</i>
<i> carries around with her now</i>

1062
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:35,555
<i> everywhere she goes</i>
<i> like it's her baby.</i>

1063
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,662
Bennett...

1064
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:46,800
I should tell you
before someone else does.

1065
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:48,802
I'm engaged.

1066
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,673
To a...
Really amazing woman.

1067
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,643
Now, I know
what you're thinking because

1068
01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:59,079
<i> I asked myself the same thing--</i>

1069
01:31:59,081 --> 01:32:00,514
<i> am I really in love with her</i>

1070
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:05,151
<i> or am I only doing this</i>
<i> to be right in god's eyes?</i>

1071
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:10,690
<i> And I'm truly</i>
<i> in love with her, Bennett.</i>

1072
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:15,295
God went to the root
of my same sex desires

1073
01:32:15,297 --> 01:32:16,997
and he uprooted them.

1074
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:21,001
He demonstrated
that they were abnormal.

1075
01:32:21,003 --> 01:32:21,801
<i> Michael...</i>

1076
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:26,640
<i> I'm really glad</i>
<i> you think you're happy.</i>

1077
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:29,743
And I wish you all the best.

1078
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:32,312
I really do.
I think you know that.

1079
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:36,950
<i> But I have no idea</i>
<i> why you would call me up</i>

1080
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:39,819
<i> and use words like "abnormal."</i>

1081
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:45,559
<i> I'm so sorry for the way</i>
<i> that things went down.</i>

1082
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:48,762
<i> But just because we don't</i>

1083
01:32:48,764 --> 01:32:49,663
share certain beliefs,

1084
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:54,868
it doesn't mean that
we can't still be friends.

1085
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,006
I'll always be your friend.

1086
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:05,245
<i> And I really hope</i>
<i> that this path</i>

1087
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,348
<i> takes you where you wanna go.</i>

1088
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:12,819
But I also hope that...

1089
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:15,889
As you're setting out
to help other people...

1090
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:20,594
<i> That you really take some time</i>
<i> to help yourself.</i>

1091
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:26,132
<i> I-i am. I...</i>

1092
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:29,636
<i> I'm not gonna sit here</i>
<i> and say that I know</i>

1093
01:33:29,638 --> 01:33:33,206
<i> I'll be this way</i>
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

1094
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:36,876
We're always changing, evolving.

1095
01:33:36,878 --> 01:33:40,246
And I'm open to that.

1096
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:47,253
Then...

1097
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:51,725
I guess nothing's
really changed.

1098
01:33:51,727 --> 01:33:54,928
<i> Yeah.</i>

1099
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:58,398
<i> You take care</i>
<i> of yourself, okay?</i>

1100
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:03,703
Goodbye, Michael.

1101
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:07,974
Bye.

1102
01:34:53,155 --> 01:34:55,055
Here they come.
