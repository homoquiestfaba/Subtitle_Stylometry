just because they felt like it?

183
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,850
Hey, look, you're
 an educated woman.

184
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,780
You're not going to stand here
 and tell me that you really

185
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,770
believe that your mother
 dug her way out of a grave

186
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,790
that she was lying
 in for four years?

187
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,140
No, of course not, Dominic.

188
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,000
But I saw her.

189
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,190
Look, I'll tell you what.

190
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,200
How about you let me
 take you for a drink?

191
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,910
I could use one myself.

192
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,040
It's 2:00 in the morning.

193
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,950
Where?

194
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,650
We'll go to Eddie's.

195
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,520
He's a friend of mine.

196
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
He'll open up the place.

197
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,210
Hey, Dom.

198
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,950
Eddie.

199
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,190
Katherine Roshak, Eddie Herbek.

200
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,190
Hi.

201
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,190
Hi.

202
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
Eddie?

203
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,190
Oh, yeah.

204
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,330
OK.

205
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,680
You saw your mother
 in a restaurant and--

206
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,670
I saw her again.

207
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,290
This afternoon I was
 going over some lecture

208
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,460
notes on schizophrenia
 monozygotic twins.

209
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,800
Mono what?

210
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,690
Monozygotic.

211
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,470
Identical twins-- I've been
 involved in an ongoing study

212
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,520
for a number of years now.

213
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,150
You know, it's funny.

214
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,250
There's just research
 subjects, but some of them

215
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,900
are better friends
 than my real friends.

216
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,590
Like the D twins.

217
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,670
The D twins?

218
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,660
They're part of my
 long term control group.

219
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,060
We've never actually met, but I
 talk to them four times a year.

220
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,860
So have they got
 a name or what?

221
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,650
We don't use real names.

222
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,740
And it's to protect
 their privacy.

223
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,440
We wind up talking about
 all sorts of things.

224
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,700
It's a research technique.

225
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,310
If I want them open
 up to me, then I

226
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,300
have to open up to them first.

227
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,680
Hm.

228
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,670
So you're doing
 these lecture notes,

229
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,810
your mother shows up again.

230
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,040
Anything unusual about the
 way she looked, her clothing?

231
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,620
She was wearing a blue gown.

232
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,820
Blue chiffon.

233
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,350
The one that she was buried in.

234
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:26,150
Oh, I, uh, I think
 I'm a little dizzy.

235
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,830
Eddie.

236
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,860
Who's there?

237
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,620
Hey, there Professor.

238
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,100
You better get up now.

239
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,940
It's about 1:00 o'clock
 in the afternoon.

240
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,250
I bet you slept
 good, though, huh?

241
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,560
It's the bed.

242
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,760
That mattress is a Beauty Sleep.

243
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,130
Top of the line, $700.

244
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,940
But my wife says it's worth it.

245
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,570
She always wants the best
 mattress, the best sheets.

246
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,770
She says, there's nothing
 more important in this world

247
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,020
than a good night's sleep.

248
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,820
She's in the Mayo
 Clinic right now.

249
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,840
She just goes up there
 once a year for a checkup.

250
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Where's Dominic?

251
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,490
Uh, I don't know.

252
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,540
He might be up at the cemetery.

253
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,010
He says it's a quiet
 place to think.

254
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,410
But a lot of people
 think he's crazy, the way

255
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,580
he goes up there all the time.

256
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,230
But you're a psychiatrist.

257
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,620
Do you think he's crazy?

258
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,740
He seems fairly normal to me.

259
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,320
You must be hungry.

260
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,870
I want to make you breakfast.

261
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:27,790
(SINGING) Keep cool, boy.
 -Hi.

262
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,940
There's your coffee.

263
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,820
Thank you.

264
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,360
Eddie, tell me, why does
 he go to the cemetery?

265
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,240
It's his wife, Kara.

266
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,080
She died about eight months ago.

267
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,740
It's a tumor on her spine.

268
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,240
For the last two months he
 went up to her hospital room

269
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
and he watched her die.

270
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,850
And now he goes up to her grave.

271
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,310
And he stopped
 talking to people.

272
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,550
Except me-- I mean, I'm
 almost like his best friend.

273
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,740
But, uh, he's got
 to snap out of.

274
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,100
Unresolved grief.

275
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,390
He's unable to transfer
 his emotional needs

276
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,640
to another person.

277
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Until he does--

278
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,340
Yeah, but he's a good cop.

279
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,290
I mean, he had an
 attitude, but who cared?

280
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,450
But ever since Kara, it's like
 he's looking for an excuse

281
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,810
to get fired.

282
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,880
And with that asshole
 boss he's got--

283
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,160
[PHONE RINGING]

284
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,370
Excuse me.

285
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,250
What?

286
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,750
What?

287
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,900
OK, I'll tell her.

288
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,490
Something happened to your car.

289
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,330
You had no business
 leaving this car here.

290
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,930
I'm going to have to
 repave this whole driveway.

291
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,610
Do you have any idea what
 that's going to cost?

292
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,640
Where is Dominic?

293
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,620
Dominic?

294
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,860
I wouldn't be looking
 for Dominic to help you.

295
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,080
You got a problem?

296
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,510
Call your insurance company.

297
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,750
And while you're at it, why
 don't you mention my driveway.

298
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,060
So the car just
 exploded, is that right?

299
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,640
That doesn't make any sense.

300
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,540
The car wasn't running.

301
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,800
It can't just explode.

302
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
Don't push your luck, lady.

303
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,630
Opening that grave was a
 violation of city ordinances

304
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,320
and county health laws
 and I could arrest

305
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
you right now if I wanted.

306
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,280
I can't believe this.

307
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,820
I had every right
 to do what I did

308
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,140
and now you're threatening me?

309
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,510
I am doing you a favor.

310
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,410
I am letting you off easy,
 that's what I'm doing.

311
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,050
Miller, take Ms. Roshak
 here down to the station.

312
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,150
Put her on the next
 bus to Los Angeles.

313
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,280
You can't do that.

314
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,050
Watch me.

315
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,500
JIM (ON ANSWERING MACHINE):
 Katherine, it's Jim.

316
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,160
Sorry about what happened.

317
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,640
Call me.

318
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,620
Jim again.

319
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,100
Katherine, I was
 really insensitive.

320
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,050
I'd like a chance to
 make it up to you.

321
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,530
Will you please call me?
 Katherine?

322
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,230
Where are you?

323
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,410
Hi, Jim, it's me.

324
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,790
Um, I just got home.

325
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,430
It's kind of a
 long story so call

326
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,090
me and I'll tell you about it.
 Bye.

327
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,700
DOMINIC (ON PHONE):
 Katherine, are you all right?

328
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,160
KATHERINE (ON PHONE):
 Dominic Mother was here.

329
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,060
DOMINIC (ON PHONE): What?

330
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,790
KATHERINE (ON PHONE): She
 set a fire in my bathroom.

331
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,860
DOMINIC (ON PHONE): She what?

332
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,750
KATHERINE (ON PHONE): Look,
 they don't believe me.

333
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,490
No one believes me.

334
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,110
They think I set
 the fire myself.

335
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,210
DOMINIC (ON PHONE):
 Listen to me.

336
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:12,910
You're in danger.

337
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,610
I want you out of that apartment
 now, do you understand?

338
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,640
Everything's going
 to be all right.

339
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,910
Show me.

340
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,520
You saw that same message
 before, didn't you?

341
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,430
In another bathroom
 just like this when

342
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,840
your mother committed suicide.

343
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,810
No.

344
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,470
Why didn't you tell me
 she committed suicide?

345
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,210
Stop it.

346
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,010
Why didn't you tell me?

347
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,500
Because I never believed it.

348
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,080
Mother wouldn't kill herself.

349
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,330
She never exhibited any
 self-destructive tendencies.

350
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,460
She's dead, Katherine.

351
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,570
You just can't
 accept that, can you?

352
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,010
I don't want to talk about it.

353
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,250
I know you don't.

354
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,840
The fire stayed
 right on the surface.

355
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,900
It must have been
 tremendously intense but fast.

356
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
That's what the
 arson squad said.

357
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,090
Were they able to
 determine a cause?

358
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,040
I told them Mother did it.

359
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,030

 -Are you all right?

373
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,080
Professor Roshak
 believes that this fire

374
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,910
was set by her mother.

375
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,060
It's insane, Katherine.

376
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,240
Well, somebody had to have
 started it unless you believe

 -Who are you?

378
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,970

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,810
He's with the Santa
 Paula police department.

00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,020
This is Dr. James Schneider.

381
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,940
This must have been
 a real shock for you.

382
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,920
You need to get away

You think I set
 this fire myself.

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,920
But what they see isn't real.

401
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,850
In my case it's Mother.

402
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,540
And her image seems so
 real that it feels like I

00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,260
could reach out and touch her.

404
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,190
There is one thing I was hoping
 you'd explain to me though.

What's that?

406

How in the hell does an

walk into my apartment
 and start a fire?

408
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,350

Well, there's
 40,000 graves here.

411

The cemetery is
 two square miles.

412
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,820
There's no way you
 could watch every grave.

413

And all the coffins were empty?

414
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,900
That's right.

 one thing I don't get,

417
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,060
One time it was the widow and
 another time it was the son.

418
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,730
And they came here before
 the cemetery notified them.

419
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,890
It was like they already
 knew the grave was empty.

420
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,440
They were scared.

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,540

 something I made up.

I got a call from that
 caretaker of that cemetery

573

574
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,120

 the widow of the man

They found her in the cemetery.

She'd hanged herself.

581

Her husband's body is missing

I like to consider myself
 a doctor to the dead.

593

When a regular medical
 doctor finishes his work,

594
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,870
that's where mine begins.

595
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,510
The only difference, I suppose,
 is that my patient is deceased.

596
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,430
Eye caps.

597
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,980
We cement them
 under the eyelids.

598
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,860
This keeps the lids closed
 and also gives the eyelids

599
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,470
that nice, natural shape.

600
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,930
Surgical wire.

601
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,930
I could use plain
 old copper wire

602
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,780
and nobody would
 know the difference.

603
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,840
Except me, and I like to
 use quality materials.

604
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,740
This little piece of wire
 is what gives the deceased

605
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,270
that peaceful look.

606
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,100
We pierce the jawbone,
 insert the wire,

607
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,150
twist it until the jaws come
 together and the lips meet.

608
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:21,810
The excess wire is then
 folded between the teeth.

609
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,850
Now we drain the body of blood.

610
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,000
I shall begin by making
 an incision at the groin.

611
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,950
Then I will insert the injection
 needle into the artery.

612
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,210
This will push the embalming
 fluid to the heart.

613
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,200
And I will insert the drainage
 instrument into the vein.

614
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,010
And now we can start pumping.

615
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,650
The blood is forced out
 of the body and down

616
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,880
through these channels
 here, through this tube,

617
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,090
and down the drain.

618
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,340
The embalming fluid is
 then pumped into the body.

619
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,080
It can be tinted any shade,
 you just like mixing paint.

620

 the color come back

 they were coming back to life.

I mean, I was only three
 years old at the time.

After the divorce he made
 a fortune in real estate.

There's got to be
 another explanation.

719
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,030
You think all that evidence
 he found isn't real?

720
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,510
I didn't say that.

721
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,270
Do think that this is all just
 a figment of my imagination?

You mean because of Eddie?

727
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,950
Eddie's not the one you got to
 worry about, your mother is.

728
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,340
I thought you just
 said she didn't exist.

729
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,980
What I'm saying is, there's
 someone out there who looks

730
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,320
a lot like your mother, OK?

731
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,170
You know, you are really
 starting to piss me off.

732
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,740
Now why is that, Professor?

733
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,580
Because every bit of evidence
 we get, you reject it.

734

If you don't have an
 explanation for it,

735

you pretend that
 it didn't happen.

736
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,650
Why can't you just accept
 that this is really happening?

737
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,470
I'll tell you what.

738
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:36,040
If I see your mother,
 I'll accept it then, OK?

739
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,430

00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:40,220

 -Nothing.

What's that smell?

744
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,920

745
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,270
-She was here.
 -Katherine, calm down.

No, Dominic.

 does she want?

 I promise you.

You Have a lot of books on
 the occult, on the devil,

00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,800
on satanism.

Do you believe in all of this?

752
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,130
If you believe there
 is a god you must surely

753
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,520
believe there is a devil.

754
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,290
Father, do you believe
 that a dead body

755
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,000
can rise from the grave?

756
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,480
Of course I believe that.

757
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,160
The very basis of
 our faith rests

758
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,220
on the Resurrection of Christ.

759
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,580
I'm talking about now, Father.

760
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,070
Is it possible for the
 physical body of a dead person

761
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,840
to rise from the grave?

762
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,990
I think you should tell
 me what this is about.

763
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,650
Katherine believes her mother
 has risen from the dead.

764
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,830
I saw her in Los
 Angeles last week.

765
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,030
Twice.

766
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,680
Then I came here to visit her
 grave but her grave was empty.

767
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,970
Your mother's body disappeared.

768
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,600
Yes, I know about that.

769
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,360
Then I saw her again here
 in Santa Paula in a church.

770
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,750
Are you certain it
 wasn't hallucination?

771
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,350
I'm afraid not, Father.

772
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,650
There was conclusive
 forensic evidence.

773
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,170
Something happened
 tonight, didn't it?

00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:34,930
We went into Eddie Herbek's to
 get some of Katherine's things.

775
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,130
When we came out there was--

776
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,530
There was a smell
 in Dominic's car.

777
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,700
The outline of her figure was
 burned into the front seat

778
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,440
right where I had been sitting.

779
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,940
Katherine, when you saw
 your mother in church,

780
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,980
did you notice any
 particular smell?

781
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,970
Well, there was a
 stench, a terrible odor,

782
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,770
a lot like the one that
 was in Dominic's car.

783
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,700
There was a smell
 in the grave too.

784
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,570
This smell had the odor
 of sulfur, had it not?

785
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,310
What you smell were
 the fires of hell.

786
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,950
The devil is among us.

787
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:17,720
You must be joking.

788
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,270
Oh, no, no, no it
 is the devil himself.

789
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:24,240
He announces his arrival
 through the stench of hell fire.

790
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,890
But it was Mother that I saw.

791
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,270
He could create apparitions
 that appear real.

792
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,270
Wait a minute.

00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,040

 like in the Bible?

794

This is no joking matter.

795
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:40,860
Satan is as real
 as you and I. Now

796
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:44,140
the only way to
 defeat the devil is

797
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,090
to ally yourself with the Lord.

798
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,450
Here are scapulars and they
 will afford you some protection.

799
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,840

 That's all right.

800
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,610

Don't leave her alone, Dominic.

803
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,980

 prey for the devil.

 that I reminded you of someone.

 thing she painted.

 was hospitalized?

Did she do this before she
 went into the hospital?

818

Kara was never hospitalized.

819

But Eddie said she was.

820

 after the x-rays came back,

they wanted to put
 her in a hospital

822

but she didn't want to go.

823

We had an argument
 and I had to go out.

824
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:55,250
While I was gone
 she took my gun,

825

 that, that she's at peace now.

01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,600
(TOGETHER) No one.

1069
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,500
[GASPS]

1070
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,570
See I still can't believe
 it happened the way

1071
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,140
you say it did, Professor.

1072
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,040
Look, they were twins.

1073
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:31,520
What one felt, the other one
 felt. The pain of the knife,

1074
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,420
the shock of seeing
 his brother die,

1075
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,340
sent him into cardiac arrest.

1076
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,400
I'm not talking
 about the twins.

1077
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:41,750
What I'm trying to understand
 is how you got out of the grave?

1078
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,140
I told you, Father
 Ambrose dug me out.

1079
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,010
Now you don't really expect
 me to believe that, do you?

1080
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,100
Why don't you go
 ask him yourself?

1081
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,460
I can't.

1082
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,630
He died this morning.

1083
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:56,030
See, he was dead a good 12
 hours when he was supposed to be

1084
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:59,720
digging you out of the grave.

1085
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,810
He was there, I swear.

1086
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:05,520
The letter opener-- if
 he hadn't given it to me.

1087
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,420
Whatever you say, Professor.

1088
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,520
Whatever you say.

1089
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,000
You believe me, don't you?
