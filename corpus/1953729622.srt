520
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,165
-(LAUGHS) It feels good. Huh?
-Yeah. It does.

521
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,379
You know, Curly,

522
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,382
you're the first friend I've made
in the four weeks I've been out here.

523
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,886
That's... That's a sweet thing to say.

524
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,972
I mean it.

525
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:42,726
I think everybody else
is just so intimidated by me.

526
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:47,105
You know, they don't know
how to talk to me, but I'm friendly, right?

527
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,483
I... I want friends too.

528
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,318
My mother always said to me

529
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:55,572
that one good friend is better
than a whole bunch of fake ones.

530
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,868
I guess that's true.

531
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,749
-To friends.
-To good friends.

532
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,506
You know what?
You should come over tonight.

533
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,759
Meet my mother. She'd love you.

534
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,058
Sure.

00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,030
-Get comfortable.
-(CHUCKLES) Okay.

538
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,782

-Brian, is that you?
-That's my mom.

541
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,126
Who is that there? Hello!

542
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,088
-Come on. Who is it?
-Mom, are you decent?

543
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,631
Your number one son is here.

544
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,716
Oh, Brian, I thought you were
those Taylor boys

545
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,760
come over to pick up all those franks.

546
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,763
What's one person supposed
to do with that many franks?

547
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,723
CURLY: Okay, I can handle it in the morning.

548
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,685
WOMAN: No, sir. I want those franks
out of my closet right now.

549
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,897
-Mom, I've got a friend over right now.
-I don't care. I want them gone.

550
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,692
-CURLY: I think it's time for you to go to bed.
-No! No.

551
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,610
I'll call the Taylors in the morning.

552
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,488
-Now you go to bed, okay?
-Okay. Thank you, Brian.

553
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,740
-Good night, Mom.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

554
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,202
CURLY: Boy, is she tired.

555
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,747
I swear, sometimes she's just like a clock.
You know what I mean?

556
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,499
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

557
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,002
-(CHUCKLES) Is everything all right?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

558
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,171
-I bet your mom's an old coot too, huh?
-(CHUCKLES)

559
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,048
She's okay, I guess.

560
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,843
She's like a crazy liberal, right?

561
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:44,639
Well, I thought she was, but then she wasn't.

562
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,352
We're not really on speaking terms right now.

563
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,855
That's a shame.

564
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:56,317
We're at a stalemate,
and I'm not about to be the one who budges.

565
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:02,699
Well, I'm sure she'll come around.
That's how mothers are.

566
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,535
You know, my mom,
she's like a regular three-headed monster

567
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,162
when she doesn't get her way.

568
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,914
You're not like that, are you?

569
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:15,211
You're not like a cranky old werewolf
when you don't get your way, are you?

570
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,716
Well, I usually get my way.

571
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,058
You're a clever little boy, aren't you?

572
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,810
Anybody ever say that to you?

573
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,063
No. Thank you.

574
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,985
Let's go to my room. I got a surprise for you.

575
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,570
A surprise?

576
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,865
Yeah. You gotta close your eyes.

577
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,744
-Okay.
-No peeking.

578
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:56,252
-Whoa. That's the wall?
-Careful.

579
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:59,381
-That's my mom's room, so be quiet.
-Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

580
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,424
-Hey, no peeking, no peeking. Come on.
-Sorry. Sorry.

581
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,552
-What's the surprise?
-It's not a surprise if I tell you.

582
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:05,762
DAVID: Okay. All right.

583
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,097
-(UNLOCKING DOOR)
-Oh, I hear a door.

00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,682
-Okay.
-Okay.

585
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:12,102
-Keep 'em closed, keep 'em closed.
-All right, they're closed.

586
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,354
-Sit down.
-Oh! (CHUCKLES)

587
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,565
(EXHALES)

588
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,110
Okay. Open your eyes.

589
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,250
What do you think?

590
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,548
Are those custom-made shelves?
They fit the wall so nicely.

591
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,094

00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,557
(MUMBLES) It's a big... Mmm-hmm.

594
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,352
You know, I thought you'd appreciate it
more than anybody else I knew.

595
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,104
You know, the minute I saw you,
I said to myself,

596
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,940
"There's a boy who needs a playmate."

597
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,111
Well, Charlie Brown, you wanna play?

598
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,741
(STAMMERING) Oh, Curly, look...
Look, you've been so nice to me, but I...

599
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,076
Well, we work together.

600
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:13,079
Wouldn't it be unprofessional?

601
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,999
It's just a fuckin' apple factory.

602
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,503
Come on. You've been coming on so strong.
You can't back out now.

603
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,339
DAVID: Uh, no, no, no, it's not that.
I just, uh...

604
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,215
(INHALES DEEPLY)

605
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:29,554
(STAMMERS) I was too embarrassed
to say it outside, but...

606
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,185
I have these terrible crabs,

607
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,646
and I would hate for you to catch them.

608
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,691
(SIGHS) It wouldn't be the first time.

609
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,695
-(LAUGHING)
-Oh!

610
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,697
I'm just kidding. Come here.

611
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,909
Curly will find each

612
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:52,118
-(UNZIPPING)
-...and every one of those crabs

613
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,120
and just smack the shit out of 'em.

614
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,123
Okay, whoa.
Could I just go to the bathroom first?

615
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,459
I'd like to, uh...

616
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,338
Prepare.

617
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,342
Okay. I like a clean boy.

618
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,010
-Hmm.
-Down the hall, to your right.

619
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:12,180
-Don't wake my mom up. She's sleeping.
-(SOFTLY) Okay, yeah. Thank you.

620
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,973
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

621
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,899

00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,320
(GRUNTS) Oh!

629
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,170
Where the fuck did you go, Sammy?

630
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:29,549
Don't run away! I just wanted to play some!

631
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:31,468
I wasn't gonna hurt you!

632
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:36,848
Bitch, I didn't get you that raise for nothing!

633
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:41,144
It's fine. It's fine. I know how this works.

634
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,648
I'll just...

635
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:49,152
I'll find you tomorrow at work,
and we'll settle it then.

636
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,182
DAVID:  <i>Will you tell him
I won't be coming in anymore?</i>

637
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:23,645
I got a job back home at my alma mater, Yale.

638
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:26,064
What? You're going to jail?

639
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,191
No, Yale!

640
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,859
So it looks like I'll be heading home.

641
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:32,362
I've been invited to teach some classes
back in my alma mater.

642
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,823
Probably a few advanced Japanese classes.

643
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:37,075
They're practically begging me to come back.

644
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,369
Uh-huh.

00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:45,542

Hey!

648
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:01,641
Did you take my money?

649
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:03,393
Did you take my money?

650
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:05,061
Move! Where is it?

651
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:08,565
Don't lie to me, you cheap fucking bastards!

652
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:10,650
Where is my money? Where is it?

653
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:14,070
You didn't succeed in your own country!

654
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,947
What makes you think
you could make it here, huh?

655
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:17,115
Where is it?

00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:18,616
(YELLS)

657
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,994
You don't just steal from somebody like that!

658
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,329
Not in America!

There you are. It's good to see you again.

670
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:27,560
So you're in a bit of trouble, huh?

671
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,023
I don't really have a place to stay.

672
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,858
Say no more. You've come to the right guy.

673
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:36,111
So, let's start fresh.

674
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:38,988
I'm Jonathan Comb, C.O.G.

Come on. Hop in.

680
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,962
Look, Sam, I got an idea.
Why don't you work for me for a bit?

681
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,674
By the time we reap the benefits
of all our hard work,

682
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,926
I'm sure you'll have plenty of money
for that bus ticket home.

683
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,512
What do you do?

684
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,889
I'm an artist. That's what I do.

685
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,310
-Have you ever met an artist before?
-Yeah.

686
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,771
Well, then you know we can act
a little strange sometimes,

687
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,859
but I've had all my shots,
and I've never bit anyone that I know of.

688
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:19,112
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

689
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:22,532
Yeah, I got about three weeks
until the fair and a lot to do.

690
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:24,701
You can be my apprentice till then.

691
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,704
I got a sofa you can sleep on in the meantime.

692
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,205
Thanks, Jon.

693
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:32,208
-I really appreciate it.
-No more.

694
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,919
I'm just doing the Lord's work.

695
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:40,842
(SINGING)  <i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

696
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:44,137
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

697
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,221
(SCATS)

698
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,390
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

699
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,518
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

700
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,728
Come on!

701
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,981
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

702
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:56,858
Sing with me!

703
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,236
(BOTH SINGING)<i>
I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

704
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,073
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

705
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:04,157
JON: Uh-huh!

706
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,201
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

707
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:07,285
Uh-huh!

708
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,954
<i>I'm just doing the Lord's work</i>

709
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,248
-You'll get it.
-You have a good voice.

710
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,375
Thank you.

711
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:23,301
These kind people in this house,
members of my church.

712
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,262
I told them I was looking for a studio.

713
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:27,931
They handed me the keys to the garage...

714
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:29,099
(SNAPS FINGERS) Just like that.

715
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,225
Huh.

716
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:34,979
You meet the greatest people in the world
living right here in this very town.

717
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,316
Well, I don't need to remind you of that.

718
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:41,903
You've already met one of 'em.

719
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:43,071
Who?

720
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,365
Me!

721
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,661
What do you think?

722
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,871
-It's nice.
-Yeah, it is.

723
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,297
-Good afternoon, Jon!
-Afternoon.

724
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:04,217
(CHUCKLES) How is the Lord treating you...
We haven't said Grace yet.

725
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,053
Well, this day is a gift of the Lord's.

726
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,805
As is every day.

727
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,056
Who's your friend, Jon?

728
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,851
-Oh, this is Samuel.
-Hi.

729
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,439
You better hold on to your socks,

730
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,899
'cause I'm about to knock 'em off.

731
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,778
(INHALES DEEPLY)

732
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,822
(JON HUMMING)

733
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,201
-JON: Ta-da!
-(CHUCKLES WEAKLY)

734
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,662
How are those socks treating you?

735
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,832
-What is it?
-It's jade.

736
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,460
What do you do with it?

737
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:41,087
Well, I make sculptures.

738
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:43,965
Useful ones.

739
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,593
This isn't the highest-quality jade,

740
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:50,096
but it's enough to make me
a rich man 10 times over,

741
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,516
if I don't mess up and start drinking again.

742
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,269
Ooh! Knock wood.

743
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:57,979
(TAPS)

744
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:02,192
Do you want to knock wood? Go right ahead.

745
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:05,320
-That's okay. I'll take your word for it.
-Oh, no, no.

746
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:09,532
It's not real wood. I was just pulling your leg.

747
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:11,868
(CHUCKLES)

748
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,580
Was just pulling...

749
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:17,999
-Cool.
-It's plastic.

750
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,043
It's all mine.

751
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,253
You can't have it.

752
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,014
Well, how long is he going to stay?

753
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,518
I don't know, Paul.
I think Jon's just helping the kid out.

754
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,729
Martha, our charity can only extend so far.

755
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,148
Just give him some time.

756
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:47,028
See you.

757
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,283
Hey.

758
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:53,952
Sam.

759
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,247
-Jesus, Jon.
-No, no, no, no, no.

760
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:00,250
Don't take his name in vain.

761
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,835
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

762
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,420
-What time is it?
-It's 6:00 AM.

763
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,880
We gotta get up for the morning service.

764
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:07,632
-Church?
-Yeah, come on.

765
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,593
-(SIGHS)
-Fits you well.

766
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:13,513
Oh, yeah, it does.

767
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,931
We couldn't have you showing up at church

768
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,434
wearing that old, torn-up
college sweater of yours.

769
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:18,768
Right.

770
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,146
Do you need help with that?

771
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,315
Oh, uh, yeah.

772
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:26,735
-(CHUCKLES)
-Thank you.

773
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:28,820
MARTHA: Mmm-hmm.

774
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:31,281
Your father never taught you how to tie a tie?

775
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:32,991
No, he didn't.

776
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,535
My mom just always tied mine for me.

777
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:39,456
You know, you and I
must only be a few years apart.

778
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,124
(LAUGHS)

779
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,377
-What?
-Nothing. I just...

780
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,340
I can't imagine being responsible
for anyone but myself right now.

781
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:51,092
It isn't as hard as it looks.

782
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:56,931
MAN:  <i>When you come to services,
when you read scripture,</i>

783
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:59,726
<i>everywhere you look, you are told</i>

784
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,771
that for the forgiveness of the things
that we do in our lives,

785
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:04,314
you need to repent.

786
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:07,400
-(YAWNS)
-Repentance begins with knowing,

787
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,862
being aware that you did something wrong.

788
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,656
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

789
00:51:13,698 --> 00:51:16,159
Well, wasn't that amazing?

790
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,204
-Sure. It was great.
-Yeah?

791
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:21,498
-Can we get some breakfast now?
-Yeah.

792
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,834
So, I guess you must be wondering.

793
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:28,129
-Wondering what?
-How I lost my leg.

794
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:31,591
I didn't want to ask.

795
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,303
Desert Storm. Land mine.

796
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,931
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry about what?

797
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,893
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

798
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,897
After I survived,
the army sent me back to Alaska.

799
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:49,693
So there I was, my leg was yesterday's news,

800
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:52,904
but I still had both hands,

801
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:55,865
and that's all it took to reach for the bottle.

802
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,327
I was a dried-up pill,

803
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,871
nothing to do but get drunk
and feel sorry for myself,

804
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,331
and that is exactly what I did.

805
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,961
Until I met a man

806
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:11,297
who told me

807
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:15,176
that I could stand tall

808
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,514
without a complete pair of stinking feet.

809
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,476
That man was named Jesus Christ.

810
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:30,442
He told me to sober up
and hightail it the fuck out of Alaska.

811
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:36,114
So I was an outsider just like you
when I first came here.

812
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:39,200
It didn't take me long to fit right in.

813
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:42,245
That church got me back my leg.

814
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:47,083
They had a fund-raiser... (LAUGHS)

815
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,668
Just for me.

816
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,881
That was very good of them.

817
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,759
It certainly was.

818
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:59,346
Tomorrow we get to work,

819
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:03,224
and I will show you exactly
what I can do with that jade.

820
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:06,436
Take a look at this rock.

821
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,521
That's nothing, right?

822
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:10,940
Just a dusty hunk of nothing.

823
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,360
But with a little skill and talent,

824
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:17,781
what is it?

825
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:21,785
A clock.

826
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:24,788
Of course it's a clock. What else is it though?

827
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,498
DAVID: Uh...

828
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,793
-It's Oregon, dummy.
-Oh!

829
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:31,920
I know you haven't been here long,
but that's still no excuse.

830
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:34,172
-Everyone knows the shape of Oregon.
-Ah.

831
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,465
Yeah.

832
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:41,179
Man, the yokels are gonna snatch
these babies up like it's nobody's business.

833
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:43,848
I'm charging 100 bucks a pop for them.

834
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:45,350
Jon, that seems like a lot.

835
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:47,102
Oh, that's nothing

836
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:49,437
compared to what
some of these craft fair jokers

837
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:51,523
charge for their wildlife paintings.

838
00:53:51,606 --> 00:53:53,650
-It's like...
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

839
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:55,402
Is it hard to do?

840
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,072
(SCOFFS) I started cutting and polishing
in Washington years ago.

841
00:53:59,155 --> 00:54:01,658
I've been a rock hound ever since.

842
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:05,161
I'm probably the best person out there
to teach someone like you.

843
00:54:07,205 --> 00:54:08,873
Where do we start?

844
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,667
Hey there, Lord.

845
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,544
It's me again, Jon, your old buddy.

846
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:15,338
Um, if it's not too much to ask,

847
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,009
I was wondering if you could keep an eye
on my new assistant today.

848
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:23,179
I need his help,
but I don't want him screwing up my jade.

849
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:27,267
Let me try to be patient,

850
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:30,895
and let me try to teach him about you.

851
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:35,025
And about this precious jade
that you've given me.

852
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,070
And hey, thanks for the coffee,

853
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,614
uh, but do you have any sugar? (CHUCKLING)

854
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:46,119
No, you can joke with the Lord. No, he likes it.

855
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,205
Amen.

856
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,586
-(SOFTLY) Amen. Come on.
-Amen.

857
00:54:57,922 --> 00:55:01,051
Depends on the pressure.
Yeah, the harder you push...

858
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:06,639
-(INDISTINCT)
-Huh?

859
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:08,308
-That's pretty neat.
-Yeah.

860
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:09,893
-JON: Put that in there.
-All right.

01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,924
It's not right to leave
a man out in the cold like that.

1036
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,719
(EXHALES) I showed myself to you.

1037
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:54,931
Curly, I'm sorry.

1038
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,599
Shit! Curly.

1039
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:58,351
Oh, come on.

1040
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:00,770
-Stop. Curly, stop it.
-You ticklish?

1041
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:03,606
-No. No. Curly, no. (LAUGHING)
-Huh? Huh?

1042
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,191
Oh, you wanna get fluffed like a pillow?

1043
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:06,651
-No, Curly, please!
-Huh?

1044
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:08,862
Oh, please don't... Curly, seriously!

1045
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:10,238
Stop it!

1046
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,615
We don't need the toys. It's okay.

1047
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,325
I'm sure there's a bottle
around here somewhere.

1048
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,454
-Curly.

Oh, Curly, please don't do this.

1050
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:22,125
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

Jesus, I'm so sorry.

(SOBBING) Oh, God, help me, please.

1055
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:36,639
I'm a Christian!

1056
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,185
Don't you see I can't do this with you?

1057
01:07:42,103 --> 01:07:43,646
Oh, please, God.

1058
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,358
Please make him go away. Please, God.

1059
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:49,819

Look like shit.

1067
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,698
I'm good, Jon.

Now please, everyone, keep your eyes closed.

1072
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:45,333
Like we do every week,
I'd like to ask if there's anyone out there

1073
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:49,796
who hasn't yet asked Jesus into your heart,
but you'd like to do so today.

It's okay. This is a safe place.

1075

If you're ready, now is the time.

It takes bravery to come up here.

1081
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:41,556
Have you lived a life without purpose?

1082

God will let you into his family.

1086
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:56,029
All you have to do is turn away from sin.

1087
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:57,822
Let him forgive you.

1088
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,700
Can you ask for forgiveness?

1089
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:03,787
Yes.

1090
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,914
Please forgive me.

1091
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:07,957
Don't ask me.

1092
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,876
Ask Jesus.

1093
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:11,753
Reach out to him.

1094

please forgive me
for all the sins I've committed.

They were so stupid.

1099
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:37,362
Tell him that you want a happy life,

I'm going to teach you other useful things.

-Like how to talk to women.

in town that you knew of?

-What, you're good?
-No, you're good.

1166
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:55,060
Okay. Just take a moment and, you know.

01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,650
-Amen.
-Amen.

-Yeah.

A couple dozen q-tips?

1176
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:22,504
You can't even put a deck of cards in there.

1177
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:25,256
I thought it'd be good to offer up
something different.

Who needs something like that?

everyone needs a clock.

Somebody comes to your door asking,
"Am I early?" What's he going to do?

1181
01:14:33,723 --> 01:14:35,767
He's going to look at a box on the wall?

1182
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:36,893
Of course not.

1183
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:38,853
That's ridiculous.

1184
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:41,940
The point is to make
something people need, idiot.

1185
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,110
The ability you got.

1186
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:46,569
The brains?

1187
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:48,738
Don't hold your breath.

1188
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:52,033
You have to ask the man upstairs
for help in that department.

1189
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:55,787
Hmm. Say, this coffee's good.

1190
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,082
Let's thank Jesus for giving us
the beans, shall we?

1191
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,043
Go ahead. Bow your head.

1192
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:04,212
-Now?
-Thank him.

1193
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:07,924
Thank him.

1194
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:11,928
Thank you, Lord.

1195
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,391
Okay, let's get out of here.

1196
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:17,892
Time's ticking.

1197
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:21,604
JON: Listen, you gotta charm these people.
You gotta actually talk to them.

1198
01:15:21,646 --> 01:15:24,607
They don't just throw money
at anything like they do where you're from.

1199
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:26,067
Watch.

1200
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,654
Excuse me, sir.

1201
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:31,906
I'm sorry. Do you know what time it is?

1202
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:33,241
-No.
-Well, I do.

1203
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:35,660
It's time for you to buy a clock. That's right.

1204
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,998
It's time for you to buy a clock made of jade
in the shape of Oregon.

1205
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:42,292
That's exactly what time it is.

1206
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:44,878
-Honey?
-I don't know.

1207
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:47,630
JON: Oh, just imagine that on your wall.

1208
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:49,090
Yeah?

1209
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:51,885
It looks heavy. It'll totally ruin the drywall.

1210
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:53,970
-MAN: How much?
-100 bucks.

1211
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:57,640
Mmm, we can't do it.
Oh, these are kind of cute.

1212
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:01,895
Don't you think Sandy would use
one of these for her jewelry?

1213
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,146
How much for that?

1214
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:05,482
-Uh...
-$25.

1215
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:07,067
Twenty-five.

1216
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:09,486
We'll take it.

1217
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,738
JON: Now if you'd like,
we can throw in a clock for 125.

1218
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:13,782
-Uh, no, thank you.
-No. Just the box.

1219
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:15,825
-We have clocks.
-JON: Okay.

1220
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:17,869
-You're quick.
-Thank you.

1221
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:20,080
Here you go.

1222
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,831
-WOMAN: Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1223
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:23,083
Thanks.

1224
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:24,626
(LAUGHS)

1225
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:28,630
Excuse me, ma'am? Hey.

1226
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,799
-Do you know what time it is?
-It's 9:15.

1227
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:32,842
Thank you.

1228
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:11,006
(SIGHS) Any luck?

1229
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:18,304
Hey. Oh, I didn't want to sell it to him,
but a stoner bought one of your boxes.

1230
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:22,976
All money is the same money
in the eyes of the Lord, right?

1231
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:24,394
That's right.

1232
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,398
I think I'll save this one for myself.

1233
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,941
-A keepsake.
-Good.

1234
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:33,611
We don't want to overwhelm
people here with too many options.

1235
01:17:37,073 --> 01:17:38,908
Because you seem like
a good Christian woman to me,

1236
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:40,618
I'm going to knock $10 off.

1237
01:17:41,786 --> 01:17:45,081
(CHUCKLING) What am I, nuts? I must be.
That's practically giving them away.

1238
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:47,584
But you know what, that's what you get
when you're an artist like me.

1239
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:49,085
Come on. Come on.

1240
01:17:49,252 --> 01:17:50,795
-Mmm...
-How 'bout it?

1241
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,839
I'm afraid it's a bit out of my price range.

1242
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:54,507
What do you mean "out of your price range"?

1243
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:57,594
(STAMMERS) What do you got
in the bag there?

1244
01:17:57,635 --> 01:17:59,012
Oh, this?

1245
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:01,014
Beautiful, isn't it?

1246
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:02,223
It's a stained glass tissue box.

1247
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:04,684
-What're you going to do with that?
-I'm going to put tissues in it.

1248
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,353
-Yeah, but it's ugly and useless.
-Jon.

1249
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,896
Stop it. I know what I'm doing.

1250
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:09,939
You need one of these.
You don't even realize that.

1251
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:13,401
Mister, I've already got a clock.
Anything else here?

1252
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:16,613
No. I've just got clocks.

1253
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:33,463
Jon, should we start packing up?

1254
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:00,323
Jon, what are you doing?

1255

(ENGINE STOPS)

1256
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:07,455
Let me tell you a little something.

1257
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:08,581
I don't like being used.

1258
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,836
You swish into town,

1259
01:19:12,919 --> 01:19:16,840
and you expect me to bend over backwards
and roll out the red carpet for you.

1260
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:17,966
I don't know what you're talking about.

1261
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:20,301
-Why? Because you're from New York?
-I'm from Connecticut.

1262
01:19:20,343 --> 01:19:23,221
Same thing to me, as far as I'm concerned.

1263
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:25,974
I've gone and given you a skill.

1264
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:28,226
I gave you the only thing I have.

1265
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:30,437
You use it against me?

1266
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:37,527
You know what?
There's a story I've been meaning to tell you,

1267
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,071
but I didn't think I should, up until now.

1268
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:46,119
Back in the war,

1269
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,040
one day my squad was ambushed by a...

1270
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,792
Oh, a couple of local fools.

1271
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:56,046
There was five of us and four of them,
so it was nothing serious.

1272
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,213
We took out the towelheads,

1273
01:19:57,255 --> 01:20:00,425
but not before one of them
shot one of our members in the gut.

1274
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:02,635
He was bleeding out all over me.

1275
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,971
Half of his intestines are...

1276
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,307
Are coming out, and...

1277
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,143
Nothing we could do for him.

1278
01:20:10,685 --> 01:20:12,979
I would have prayed with him,
but this was before I knew Christ,

1279
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:14,564
so I didn't do shit for his soul.

1280
01:20:15,106 --> 01:20:17,484
And so I asked him, you know,

1281
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,527
"Do you have any last requests?"

1282
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:21,905
And he looked me right in the eye,

1283
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:24,449
and he asked me if I could hold him.

1284
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,953
(SCOFFS) That's what he said to me. He goes,

1285
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:31,873
"Can you hold me?"

1286
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:40,340
(CHUCKLES)

1287
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:42,842
I had both my legs then,

1288
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:45,428
and I used them to kick the shit out of him.

1289
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,269
There are a lot of sick people
in this world, Samuel.

1290
01:20:53,353 --> 01:20:55,313
And you gotta watch out for them.

1291
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:06,616
You're that way too, aren't you?

1292
01:21:07,784 --> 01:21:10,787
You're sick like that man, aren't you?

1293
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,710
I'm as sick as they come.

1294
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:21,756
God.

1295
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:30,181
You used me. My tools, my patience,

1296
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:33,059
and now you want me to pat you
on the head like you're a good little boy.

1297
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:35,979
You know what? You're not a good boy.

1298
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:40,734
You aren't even a good girl.

1299
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:44,612
You're a user. You're a taker. You're a faggot.

1300
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:48,491
Yeah.

1301
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:50,785
Christians aren't users.

1302
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:52,704
Christians aren't takers.

1303
01:21:52,787 --> 01:21:54,998
They certainly aren't faggots.

1304
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,461
All right.

1305
01:22:01,838 --> 01:22:03,173
Here.

1306
01:22:04,507 --> 01:22:08,386

and for using my booth. (SNIFFS)

The rest of it you can use to get you
as far away from here as possible,

01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:13,850
so I don't have to see your sorry ass again.

The God part I'm not charging you for.

1310
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:19,105
-Are you serious?
-Serious as the Bible.

1311
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:20,815
But where do I go?

1312
01:22:22,525 --> 01:22:24,235
