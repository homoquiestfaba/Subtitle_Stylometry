- You don't have all the information.
- Okay.

576
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,114
So what happened, Miles was
honking the horn because...

577
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,480
- Miles.
- There was a dude

578
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,880
- that wouldn't get...
- Wait, Miles was honking?

579
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,381
He was the one who was
honking the horn.

580
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,814
- We set it up so you would be the driver.
- I was driving the truck. I know.

581
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,281
- No, I was... Nah.
- We talked about this.

Keep your head straight.
I was driving,

584
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,814
but if he reach across me

585
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:52,948
and honk the horn,
then what I'm supposed to do?

586
