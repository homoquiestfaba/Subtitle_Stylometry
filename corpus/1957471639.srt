1
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:57,812
Shit!

2
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:04,660
I am so sorry.

3
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,790
Sure, whatever it is,

4
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,390
it was so important that you
couldn't tell me over the phone

5
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,743
but not so important you
couldn't be, oh, a half hour late.

6
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:16,786
I'm getting a divorce, Julie.

7
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,990
I told him that I was leaving
and that I was taking Nicky.

8
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,873
He hit me.

9
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,013
How about Nicholas?

10
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,493
The lawyers wrote up
a temporary agreement.

11
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,590
This can't be my life, Julie.

12
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,223
It just can't.

13
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,368
Excuse me?

14
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:24,201
Yeah?

15
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,590
I'm house sitting for Migget.

16
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,450
Could you tell me what's
going on?

17
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,630
Oh, the Olsons, all of them.

18
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,190
Killed while they slept.

19
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,330
Killed?

20
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,870
Butchered, from what I hear.

21
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,180
How could something like that
happen here?

22
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,880
While we slept?

23
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,570
This is a nice neighborhood.

24
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,453
Oh, God.

25
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,140
Morning Folks.

26
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,520
You all know the Olsons?

27
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,040
Of course.

28
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,020
Who are you?

29
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,400
Detective Peters.

30
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,450
Homicide, of course.

31
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,490
Either of you hear or see anything

32
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,190
out of the ordinary last night?

33
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,500
Why yes.

34
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,020
There was a car fulL of
raving psychopaths

35
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,620
parked in front of the
house around midnight,

36
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,020
but I thought if we left
them alone, they'd just...

37
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,690
Ma'am, I need to know if you saw

38
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,070
or heard anything unusual
last night.

39
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
Don't you think I would have called

40
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,240
the police in that case?

41
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,370
Maybe, maybe not.

42
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,760
It may not have struck you as strange,

43
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,040
but maybe now, with what's happened,

44
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,573
What exactly happened?

45
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,621
Your neighbors have
been murdered, Ma'am.

46
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:26,073
I can't tell you any
more than that right now.

47
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,313
If anything comes to mind,
give me a ring huh?

48
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,650
That's all?

49
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,150
That's all the questions
you're going to ask us?

50
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,033
Sorry.

51
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,307
Did either one of you
happen to kill the Olsons?

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,203
Okay, thanks.

53
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,330
One of my guys will be
by to take your names.

54
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,533
I'm sorry, Detective,
I'm really late.

55
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,570
Here.

56
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,350
This has my name and
cell phone number on it.

57
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm house sitting here for
the next couple of weeks.

58
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,710
An artist, huh?

59
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,690
You don't much look like an artist.

60
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,980
Says Magnum P.I.

61
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,610
How long you been house sitting?

62
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,463
About four, no, five nights.

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,339
I may have to come by

64
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,660
and ask you a few questions,
Miss Blodgett.

65
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,720
Sure, I understand.

66
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:33,910
Well, it was really nice
meeting you,

67
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm really late right now though.

68
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,933
Okay, Honey.

69
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,797
Oh I'm Gale, Gale Wroten.

70
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,900
Hey, sorry I'm late.

71
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,080
You'll never believe
the morning I'm having.

72
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,100
No worries,
everything's going pretty okay.

73
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,630
Lynn!

74
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,430
Some of these new pieces
of yours are amazing!

75
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,310
You've been doing great work lately.

76
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,460
Fabulous stuff.

77
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,293
Thanks, Phil.

78
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,893
And thank you so much for all
of this.

79
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,390
It's my pleasure.

80
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,230
What do you think?

81
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,450
Should we expect a crowd tonight?

82
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,613
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

83
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,024
How on earth did you
get all these people here?

84
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,240
Www.Ihateclowns.com.

85
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,040
I posted it on their message board.

86
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,290
But, if they hate clowns,

87
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,370
then why are they here?

88
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,670
It's a love hate thing.

89
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,703
So what do you think?

90
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,370
I'm not an art critic or anything...

91
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,253
Who is?

92
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,610
I don't know what the
clown fetish is all about.

93
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,653
I think the artist has issues.

94
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,423
Oh?

95
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,690
Well, they're clowns, for chrissakes.

96
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,080
But hers are all so, scary.

97
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,080
But you're no art critic.

98
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,360
No, Tucker Reid.

99
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,830
My friends call me Tuck.

100
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,663
Lynn...

101
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,433
Blodgett, I know.

102
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,580
I saw your picture in the program.

103
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,280
I didn't want to blow your cover.

104
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,240
Not right away anyway.

105
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,973
So what do you really think?

106
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,823
They're great.

107
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,970
You've still got issues, but,

108
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,920
I think they're phenomenal.

109
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,980
So, what brought you here tonight?

110
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,460
This is the best gallery in Baltimore.

111
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,273
I've bought a couple of
pieces here.

112
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,860
Well, I hope you have a good time.

113
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,473
Can I get your autograph later?

114
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,080
Sure, hang around.

115
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,963
I'll be back.

116
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,967
Lynn, there you are.

117
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,826
What the hell are you doing here?

118
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,057
What?

119
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,240
What's the matter?

120
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,620
Who's taking care of Nicky?

121
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,700
He's in great hands, don't worry.

122
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,078
So why are you here?

123
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,870
To see your new exhibit, of course.

124
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,090
Bert, what the hell is wrong
with you?

125
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,220
We're not friends.

126
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,720
You filed for divorce.

127
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,420
Only because you were going to.

128
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,260
We're not doing this here.

129
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,390
Please leave.

130
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,680
Don't get all apoplectic on me.

131
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,610
I didn't realize you were
going to get so upset.

132
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,030
Why wouldn't I?

133
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,460
This is an important night to me.

134
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,490
Fine, I'll leave.

135
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,373
Thanks.

136
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:09,630
There she is.

137
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,933
Can I get that autograph now?

138
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,416
But that's...

139
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,530
Your new admirer has just purchased

140
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,593
your most expensive piece, My Dear.

141
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,430
That's eight thousand dollars.

142
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,120
And worth every penny.

143
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,370
Go ahead and wrap it up.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,180
I'll have her autograph it

145
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,480
once it's hanging up in my house.

146
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,360
Oh, oh, of course.

147
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,380
Do you mind if I ask what
it is that you do, Tuck?

148
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,730
You wanna see?

149
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,480
Well I guess that depends
on what it is that you do.

150
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,283
I've got to get some
tape in the other room.

151
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,200
Seriously, you want to see
what I do,

152
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,943
my office isn't very far away.

153
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,500
Okay.

154
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,520
But only because you just
paid my rent

155
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,220
for the next three months.

156
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,490
Phillip, I'll be back.

157
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,763
This is it.

158
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,830
What exactly do you do?

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,030
Look at the pictures.

160
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,180
I still don't get it.

161
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,900
My company designs roller coasters.

162
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,340
Disney, King's Dominion,
Busch Gardens, you name it.

163
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,640
I've got a coaster there.

164
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,920
How old are you?

165
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,720
How old are you?

166
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,603
Touche.

167
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,960
That's me.

168
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,470
No.

169
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,930
Every time they finish
a new coaster of mine,

170
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,150
I like to stand at the
highest point.

171
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,683
You're out of your mind.

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,673
Impressed?

173
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,349
I don't really like roller coasters.

174
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,497
How do you feel about shuffleboard?

175
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,166
Can I get you a beer?

176
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:49,626
Sure.

177
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,400
Hello?

178
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,233
Lynn?

179
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,116
Phillip?

180
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,470
What are you doing up this late?

181
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,180
You had me worried sick.

182
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,837
I've called ten times since
11 o'clock.

183
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:08,880
Why?

184
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,600
You leave the exhibit
with some strange man

185
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,353
you don't even know, and
you wonder why I'm worrying?

186
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,070
You're right.

187
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,300
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,270
Where have you been all this time?

189
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,973
Long story.

190
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,633
Long long story.

191
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,973
You'll never believe what happened.

192
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,513
What, what happened?

193
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,113
Lynn, hello?

194
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,153
Lynn?

195
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:51,451
Lynn?

196
00:15:56,695 --> 00:16:01,695
Hello, hello?

197
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:17,772
Lynn?

198
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,538
Hello, hello, hello?

199
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:29,093
Miss Blodgett, can you hear me?

200
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,621
Ma'am, can you hear me?

201
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:37,109
Ma'am, can you hear me?

202
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,610
Ma'am, can you hear me?

203
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,890
Yes.

204
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,450
Okay, are you with me now?

205
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,770
Yeah.

206
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,070
Let me help you sit up.

207
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,036
Ma'am, do you feel okay?

208
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,560
Does anything hurt?

209
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,530
No, I'm okay.

210
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,723
Tell me, did you hit
your head when you fell?

211
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,800
No, I don't think so.

212
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,860
Would you like to go to the hospital?

213
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,993
No, I'm okay.

214
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,720
Can you tell me what happened?

215
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,880
There was someone outside my
back door.

216
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,850
Right here?

217
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,990
Yes.

218
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,650
It was open when we got here.

219
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,510
We'll search the house.

220
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,353
I don't think there's anyone
here though.

221
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,100
How did you know to come?

222
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,040
A friend of yours called.

223
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,873
Said you were talking on the phone

224
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,150
and it sounded like you collapsed.

225
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,790
Can you describe the guy
that was outside your door?

226
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,050
He was dressed like a clown.

227
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,380
What?

228
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,263
A what?

229
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,833
'Scuse me a minute.

230
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:07,817
She says she's seeing
clowns outside her window.

231
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:08,700
Clowns?

232
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,238
10-96.

233
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,510
Don't you ever sleep?

234
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,543
Not so much.

235
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,090
You say you saw someone outside?

236
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,050
Yes, here was someone
standing at my back door

237
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,090
when I turned on the light.

238
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,680
And was he black or white?

239
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,053
He was a clown.

240
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,200
A clown?

241
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,083
Yes.

242
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
You're telling me you saw a clown

243
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,910
outside your window at one a.m.?

244
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,793
Yes.

245
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,703
Was he lost?

246
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,160
Wandered away from Barnum & Bailey's

247
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,633
and got trapped in suburbia?

248
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,250
This a P.R. stunt?

249
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,560
What?

250
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,440
I know what you do for
a living, Miss Blodgett.

251
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,543
You paint pictures of clowns.

252
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,250
This some kind of publicity stunt?

253
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,450
Does it look like a publicity stunt?

254
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,360
No, but looks can be deceiving.

255
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,710
That's great.

256
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,400
How profound.

257
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,460
I'd like you to leave.

258
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,960
There's no need to be rude.

259
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,090
The house is all clear.

260
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm just saying,
if this is some kind of stunt,

261
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,110
it's a serious crime to call
the police.

262
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,180
I didn't call the police.

263
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,240
I know, your friend did.

264
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,773
The one who owns the gallery
full of your clown paintings.

265
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,870
I'll be talking to you.

266
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,220
I've got a few more
questions I'd like to ask.

267
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:38,829
Night.

268
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,903
Hey, what's going on?

269
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,480
Have you ever been spanked
by a clown, Miss Blodgett?

270
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,770
Excuse me?

271
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,763
My father.

272
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,803
He used to be a clown for
neighborhood birthday parties.

273
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,080
A very strange thing.

274
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,080
This man who brings joy and
smiles to everyone around him,

275
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,460
is also the man who comes
home and spanks you.

276
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,710
Not happy to do it, mind you,

277
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,883
but doing his duty as a
father punishing a son.

278
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,263
You paint magnificently.

279
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,820
I don't like the ones with
the frightening clowns though.

280
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,950
I don't know why you waste
your time with those.

281
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,533
I want you to paint a
picture of my father.

282
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,070
Mr. Parrish, I'm sorry,
I don't do commission pieces...

283
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,730
10 thousand dollars.

284
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,123
Cash if you'd like.

285
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,820
I don't, I mean,

286
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,820
I could sell you that one for
a lot less...

287
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,980
No, I want an original
painting of my father

288
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,820
and I need it in three days.

289
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,150
That's just impossible.

290
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,627
I can recommend a number
of excellent painters...

291
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:22,050
No, it has to be you.

292
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm sorry, I just can't.

293
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,460
20 thousand dollars.

294
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,083
That's my final offer.

295
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,240
You don't understand...

296
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,763
Lynn, could I speak to you
for a moment?

297
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,763
Can you keep an eye on him
for a second?

298
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,600
I can't, Phillip.

299
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,080
I just don't have the time.

300
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,420
Make the time.

301
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,920
You can't be too busy
for that kind of money.

302
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,330
I am.

303
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,330
I'm getting divorced.

304
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,700
You've got to think this
through, Lynn.

305
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,470
Can you imagine what this is
going to mean

306
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,120
for your other paintings?

307
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,050
For your reputation?

308
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,180
You won't just be consigned
to showing your paintings

309
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,183
in my gallery,
you'll be all over the country.

310
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,070
I'm not sure I can do it.

311
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Of course you can.

312
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,213
You'll do it?

313
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,610
I can't promise you I'll get
it done.

314
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,690
Excellent.

315
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,410
My phone number is on the back.

316
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,900
Give me a call me when you're finished

317
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,100
and let me know how
you'd like the payment.

318
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,333
Good day.

319
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,283
20 thousand dollars,
that'll buy a lot of bandwidth.

320
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,590
Tres geek, huh?

321
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,870
Yeah.

322
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,510
What happened last night?

323
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,300
I called but the police
wouldn't tell me anything.

324
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,351
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,543
What? What happened?

326
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,420
You'll never believe it.

327
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,770
Get me some coffee and
I'll tell you about it.

328
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,083
I don't know why.

329
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,193
Voices?

330
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,753
No voices.

331
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,253
No more voices.

332
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:25,775
Better.

333
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:26,658
Kill her.

334
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:34,433
Pain.

335
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:35,316
Stop.

336
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,837
Kill her, I'll be cured.

337
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,320
He talks to me.

338
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,127
Wanna get better.

339
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:47,010
Get!

340
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:51,522
Better.

341
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:54,743
Get better!

342
00:23:58,674 --> 00:23:59,591
Get better!

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Get better!

344
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,460
Get better!

345
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,210
What happened when I called you?

346
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,933
I don't know.

347
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,360
I guess it all just caught up
to me.

348
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,510
I must have passed out.

349
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,870
You need to start taking it
easy, Lynn.

350
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,060
And I don't think that includes

351
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,020
leaving with strange men at night.

352
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,360
Is that you, Dad?

353
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,330
He's right.

354
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,500
You should stay away from
that guy.

355
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,490
Give me his phone number,
I'll pass him the message.

356
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,560
Anyway, I have to get going.

357
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,570
Are you sure you're okay
watching him for an hour?

358
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,570
Not a problem.

359
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,525
Great, thanks.

360
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:50,420
What exactly is supposed
to happen at this mediation?

361
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,850
I'm not sure.

362
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,460
I think we need to sit down
and discuss who gets what,

363
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,920
and what his visitation
rights are going to be.

364
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,450
Are you out of your fucking mind?

365
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,470
Mind the language please.

366
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,840
That's what we want.

367
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,000
Sole custody of Nicholas.

368
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,420
Half of the ownership of
every painting you've created

369
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,020
since you married,
or half the price

370
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,880
if you've sold them already.

371
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,910
You can keep your car.

372
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,130
Bert won't ask for any palimony,

373
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,660
but you'll have to pay child support.

374
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,523
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

375
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,630
Marty?

376
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,310
That's not going to fly, Guys.

377
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,770
Lynn gets sole custody.

378
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,450
Full alimony and child support.

379
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,317
Bert can keep his house...

380
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,620
The house was his before the marriage.

381
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,480
It's not in her name at all.

382
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,590
Our terms aren't negotiable, Marty.

383
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,310
Your client has no home,

384
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,250
very unstable for the child.

385
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,440
If she tries to buy one before
the divorce goes through,

386
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,063
we'll pursue half of it.

387
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,200
You don't want to play
hardball with me.

388
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,010
I'm short stop in the majors,

389
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,963
you're left field in the minors.

390
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,880
We just want a fair deal, Osbourne.

391
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,470
That's all we're looking for.

392
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,010
We're offering you a fair deal.

393
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,510
He wants her to pay child support?

394
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,053
He's a doctor, for god sakes.

395
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,000
He's been out of work
for over six months.

396
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,883
What?

397
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,570
What has he been doing?

398
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
It's not your business.

399
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,259
He's still my husband,
you son of a bitch...

400
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,390
Please, Miss.

401
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,900
No, I want an answer!

402
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,100
What has be been doing every
day for the past six months

403
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,710
if he wasn't going to work?

404
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,950
Let's call it a day.

405
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,833
Bullshit!

406
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,280
Let's meet on Monday once everyone's
had a chance to cool down.

407
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,810
Sounds good.

408
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,777
I'll fax our terms to your office.

409
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,300
You do have a fax machine?

410
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,033
Of course.

411
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:46,650
You really stuck it to him, Marty.

412
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,110
What, what do you mean?

413
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,380
I'm not losing Nicholas.

414
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,963
I can't lose him.

415
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,970
It'll be all right.

416
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,987
We'll get him.

417
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:10,120
(Voices)

418
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:14,792
You need to help her, watch her.

419
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,814
No more pain.

420
00:27:17,864 --> 00:27:18,697
No more.

421
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:24,713
You are getting better.

422
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:29,762
You want to get better, don't you?

423
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:32,844
You are getting better.

424
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,753
Not much longer and you'll
be completely cured.

425
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,060
But first, take the van.

426
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,693
The murder van?

427
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,413
Do not kill her.

428
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,320
Follow her.

429
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,573
Frighten her.

430
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,457
Make her doubt her sanity.

431
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:59,013
But do not harm her yet.

432
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,397
Let no one else see you.

433
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,708
Go.

434
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm telling you, he's going
for full custody, Julie.

435
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,711
He wants me to pay him.

436
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:14,594
That bastard.

437
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,410
God, I feel like I'm
having a nervous breakdown.

438
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,690
I'm telling you, there was a clown

439
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,390
outside my door last night.

440
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
You said that.

441
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,060
You were probably just exhausted.

442
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,590
I feel like I'm living in a nightmare.

443
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,613
Just take some deep breaths.

444
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,320
So what are you gonna do?

445
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,413
I'm going to paint that
picture for Mr. Parrish.

446
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:37,860
Then I'm going to use that money

447
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,760
to hire the best attorney in
town to kick his lawyer's ass!

448
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,763
That a girl!

449
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,653
Hey, I got someone calling on
the other line, could be my lawyer.

450
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,503
Can I call you back?

451
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,420
All right, talk to you soon.

452
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,303
Bye.

453
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,350
Hello?

454
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,680
Lynn, it's Tuck.

455
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,760
Hi, how are you?

456
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,660
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

457
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,990
I'm okay.

458
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,350
It's just that, about last night,

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,650
there's just, there's other things.

460
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,160
Wanna do something strange?

461
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,060
Grab your camera.

462
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,016
So where are you taking me?

463
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:25,849
You'll see.

464
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,283
Where are we?

465
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,283
It's called The Land Of Myth.

466
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,810
They closed it down
about fifteen years ago.

467
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,200
My God, I've been here before.

468
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,840
As a kid.

469
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,723
Yeah me too.

470
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,313
It was popular for a while.

471
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,050
Kind of creepy now, isn't it?

472
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,323
To tell you the truth,

473
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,473
I thought it was kind of
creepy back then.

474
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,847
Listen, I have to level with you.

475
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,760
My life is kind of a
train wreck right now.

476
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,860
What's the problem?

477
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,140
It's really complicated.

478
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,490
You're getting divorced.

479
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,763
What's complicated?

480
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,133
You asked for it.

481
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,240
And he's trying to take
my son away from me.

482
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,513
I need some time before
I can even, you know.

483
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,830
I should have known,
he was a man with a cat.

484
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,260
Single men with cats are bad news.

485
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,653
At least,
that's what the magazines say.

486
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,318
Miss Blodgett?

487
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,553
How you doing?

488
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,333
Fine.

489
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,860
Detective Peters, Homicide.

490
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,743
Homicide?

491
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,593
Yeah, that's when somebody dies.

492
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,640
Thanks.

493
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,020
There was a murder two doors
down a couple of nights ago

494
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,093
and now Miss Blodgett is
seeing clowns in her backyard.

495
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,450
Takes a clown to catch a clown, huh?

496
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,563
Nice ride.

497
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,670
What is it you do, Mister?

498
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,233
Ah, a little of this,
a little of that.

499
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,450
Yeah, so where were you two
nights ago?

500
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,670
You know, why don't you
give my secretary a call

501
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,670
and have her check my
schedule for you?

502
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,915
Who's your friend?

503
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:37,245
Can I help you with something?

504
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:40,311
I don't know yet.

505
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,533
So why are you here?

506
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,053
I'm a detective, I'm detecting.

507
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,010
And what are you detecting?

508
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,810
I have a funny feeling
about you, Miss Blodgett.

509
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,693
Well.

510
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,640
Try and keep it in your pants,
would you?

511
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,139
For God's sake,

512
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:11,992
Whoa.

513
00:35:18,174 --> 00:35:19,007
Whoa.

514
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:39,699
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

515
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,520
Better.

516
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:53,923
Ugh!

517
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:34,101
Ow!

518
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:46,525
No, please!

519
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:01,912
No!

520
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:10,268
Hi.

521
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:11,910
You're probably getting
sick of me, aren't you?

522
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,290
Well, now that you mention it.

523
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,630
I called earlier,

524
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,451
Yeah, I was taking
Nicky to his father's.

525
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,567
Oh.

526
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,019
Well, did you want to do lunch?

527
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:21,902
Where?

528
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:23,870
At La Casa Tucker.

529
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,233
I should be painting,
and do you really have a job?

530
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,203
Come on, best food in the state.

531
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,010
All right,
I can spare an hour or so.

532
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,013
Excellent.

533
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,163
I got a good deal.

534
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,843
Uh huh.

535
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,090
What's your pleasure?

536
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,653
Chinese, Italian, you name it.

537
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,310
Is your maid gonna cook it?

538
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,503
I don't have a maid.

539
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,803
Hey Tiggs, we have a guest.

540
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,940
Do you have a bathroom?

541
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,490
I need to pull my foot out of
my mouth.

542
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,991
It's okay.

543
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,790
Tiggs is no ordinary cat.

544
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,100
So what would you like to see
on the menu?

545
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,698
Surprise me.

546
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,500
Go check for broken windows.

547
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,274
Dispatch, this is Bureau 15.

548
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,251
Go Bureau 15.

549
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,880
I need information
on a 322 that occurred

550
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,623
in Queen Anne's County
two nights ago, over.

551
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,413
Copy.

552
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:55,360
Well, I must say, I'm surprised.

553
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,575
Why?

554
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,770
You don't strike me as the
kind of guy who can cook.

555
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,653
Ouch.

556
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,750
Do I strike you as the
kind who can wash dishes?

557
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,143
Maybe with a dishwasher.

558
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,773
Make yourself at home while
I clean up.

559
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:22,540
You said you should be painting.

560
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,920
What are you working on?

561
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,400
Wait, let me guess.

562
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,283
A clown?

563
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,673
Ha ha.

564
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:33,960
I've got a commission piece
to do.

565
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,770
Has to be done in, well, two days now.

566
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,370
Not much time for a painting.

567
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:42,719
The money's supposed to make
up for it.

568
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,690
Can I ask what your going
rate is?

569
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,420
For this one, I'm getting 20 thousand.

570
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,250
See, I told you that painting
I bought from you was a steal.

571
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,133
We'll see.

572
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:56,162
I'm not sure I can do what
he's asking.

573
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,190
What's he asking?

574
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,083
He wants a picture of his father.

575
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,890
Doesn't sound that tough.

576
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,960
His father was a clown

577
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,923
and he wants him to look a
certain way.

578
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:20,011
Yeah I meant to ask you.

579
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,670
Lynn Blodgett here?

580
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,590
Yeah.

581
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,680
What is it, Detective?

582
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,320
Could you come with me please?

583
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,390
What's going on?

584
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,290
I need to speak with Miss Blodgett.

585
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,550
Let's go to your house.

586
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,870
What's going on?

587
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,200
It's okay.

588
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,710
I take it this is important?

589
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,593
Very.

590
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,253
Thanks for lunch.

591
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,120
My pleasure.

592
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,470
Give me a call later, huh?

593
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,553
I will.

594
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,340
Can you tell me what's going on?

595
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,820
Not here.

596
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,150
Nicholas, my son, nothing's...

597
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,463
It's not about your son.

598
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,983
Please just get in the car.

599
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:41,076
Well?

600
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,533
Amanda Greene was murdered
last night.

601
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,750
What?

602
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,633
I'm sorry.

603
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,790
I know she worked for you.

604
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,763
She was my friend.

605
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,253
There's more.

606
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,063
What?

607
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,100
I think the person
who killed your friend

608
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,230
is the same person that
slaughtered that family

609
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,583
three doors down from you.

610
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,710
What?

611
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,230
I don't think it's a coincidence.

612
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,910
I think someone is zeroing in
on you.

613
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,133
Amanda fought back against
her killer.

614
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,180
We recovered tissue and blood

615
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,063
from underneath her fingernails.

616
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,963
And grease paint.

617
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,860
Paint?

618
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,570
Grease paint.

619
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,503
The kind you'd buy in a
Halloween or costume shop.

620
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,683
I'm sorry, I don't,

621
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:41,698
I don't know what you're
trying to tell me.

622
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,493
This is the window that he
entered from.

623
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,780
I admit that I didn't take
you seriously

624
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,400
with your clown story the
other night.

625
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,950
To tell you the truth,
I'd thought it was shock.

626
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,230
Well, you have my assurance

627
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,323
that I'm taking you deadly
serious now.

628
00:46:41,535 --> 00:46:42,490
Thank you.

629
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,530
This what he looked
like when you saw him?

630
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,790
Yes.

631
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,130
His eyes are black like that?

632
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,715
Yes.

633
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,598
Hmmm.

634
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,723
Can I have this?

635
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,310
Yeah.

636
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,210
Whoever this guy is,
we'll get him.

637
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,660
But until we do you'll
have to watch yourself.

638
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,423
I'll have someone out in front
of your house at all times.

639
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,760
I'll call you if I come
up with anything else.

640
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,110
What the hell is taking so long?

641
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,700
You don't want to
take that tone with me.

642
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,750
It's just, you were supposed
to have done it by now.

643
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,710
Clearly, there's been a problem.

644
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,060
And what's that?

645
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,670
First, the guy she's
been hanging out with.

646
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,530
I could go around that.

647
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,400
Other problem, well, it's a clown.

648
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,490
What?

649
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,390
There's a clown been following her.

650
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,250
A clown?

651
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,250
For a shrink,
you don't hear so good.

652
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,360
Tell me about this clown.

653
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,533
Only saw him once.

654
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,380
Your wife and her new
beau went sightseeing

655
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,530
at an abandoned amusement park.

656
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,780
The clown followed them.

657
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,460
What's he look like?

658
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,930
He looks like a clown.

659
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,163
Face paint,
frizzy thing around the neck.

660
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,000
So what's the problem?

661
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,470
People are getting killed
all around your soon to be ex.

662
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,390
The cops are swarming.

663
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,460
What are you talking about?

664
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,780
A family, couple doors down.

665
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,980
Then last night,
a girl that works for her.

666
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,260
Amanda?

667
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,143
Whatever.

668
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,270
My source in the department
says they got grease paint

669
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,660
off the window the perp came in.

670
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,773
Like clown makeup.

671
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,990
This is gonna take more money.

672
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,650
I don't think so.

673
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,563
Your choice.

674
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,370
I'll just keep what you've
given me

675
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,370
as a deposit for services rendered.

676
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,700
Have a nice life.

677
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,583
Wait!

678
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,823
How much more?

679
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,350
Hmmmm, psychotic clowns, cops galore.

680
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,233
Another 10.

681
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,610
All right, but that's it.

682
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,750
I can't pay you any more.

683
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,710
The whole make it look like
a mugging thing is out.

684
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,163
Get your alibi ready, Doc.

685
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,770
They're gonna question you.

686
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,993
She's as good as dead.

687
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:43,724
Oh Lynn, I'm so sorry.

688
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:49,023
I'm okay.

689
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:49,990
You sure?

690
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:52,510
When did you find out?

691
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,090
About an hour ago.

692
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,480
Some detective came by asking questions.

693
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,040
Detective Peters?

694
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,243
Yes, that was him.

695
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:02,768
I think he's following me.

696
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,403
Oh, hey.

697
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,070
I didn't give this to the detective.

698
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,923
I hope I won't get in any trouble.

699
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,970
Amanda sent us all an email
last night.

700
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,210
It's about Mr. Parrish.

701
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,230
His father wasn't just a clown.

702
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,223
He was a convicted child molester.

703
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,300
One of the children disappeared,

704
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,255
but they were never able to prove
he had anything to do with it.

705
00:50:29,305 --> 00:50:30,840
Oh my God.

706
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,283
The second page has some pictures.

707
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,030
I have to give this to the police.

708
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,703
Amanda sent this to us
last night sometime before,

709
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,080
I have to give this to the detective.

710
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,893
Lynn, if you don't want to
paint for him, I understand.

711
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:54,113
Flinner Gallery.

712
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,683
Oh, hello Mr. Reid.

713
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,123
No, I haven't seen her today.

714
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:04,120
I'll tell her when I see her.

715
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,003
Bye bye.

716
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,490
What was that all about?

717
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,530
Nothing, I just,
I don't feel like talking

718
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,580
to anyone right now.

719
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,523
Has he ever bought anything
from the gallery before?

720
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,936
Well, I don't think so.

721
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,599
Hello.

722
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,003
Hey, there you are.

723
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,870
I tried to reach you at
home and at the gallery.

724
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,420
Yeah, I've been running around.

725
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,170
So, is everything okay?

726
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,763
What did that detective want?

727
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:47,883
Amanda, my assistant,
she was murdered last night.

728
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,293
What?

729
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,020
Someone attacked her in her house.

730
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:58,973
My God.

731
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,210
Did they catch whoever did it?

732
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,093
No.

733
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,270
Is there anything I can do?

734
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,343
Do you need anything?

735
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:12,130
No, no.

736
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,113
Jesus.

737
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,960
Do you want me to come by?

738
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,483
Listen, Tuck.

739
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,093
I need some time to deal
with all of this, alone.

740
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,283
Sure, I understand.

741
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,353
I'm here for you, okay?

742
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,323
Thanks.

743
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,670
You watch yourself, huh?

744
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,673
Where are you now?

745
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:49,610
I'm in front of the police station.

746
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,330
Okay.

747
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,409
Well give me a call if you
need anything.

748
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:55,000
Anything at all.

749
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,070
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

750
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,020
Okay, bye.

751
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:06,672
What are you doing, Doug?

752
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:11,794
Shivers the Clown.

753
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,033
Doctor?

754
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,823
Yes.

755
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,313
What are you doing?

756
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,053
What you told me to.

757
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,640
Getting better.

758
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,523
What?

759
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:41,853
No, Amanda had nothing to
do with getting better.

760
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,990
Amanda?

761
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,593
Yes, the girl you killed.

762
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,033
This, what you're doing,

763
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,550
I thought we'd talked about it.

764
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,663
You've got to stop this.

765
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,523
You should come back and
start therapy with me again.

766
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:13,313
You're not hearing voices
again, are you Doug?

767
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:18,070
You're confusing me.

768
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,953
Wait.

769
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,783
I'll call you.

770
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,420
I'll help you.

771
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,833
To get better?

772
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,833
Yes.

773
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,237
Just wait for me.

774
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:34,168
Okay?

775
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:36,538
Yes.

776
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,560
Hey you, stop where you are!

777
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,543
Whoa, what the hell?

778
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,590
Turn around,
Hey, it's okay,

779
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,190
it's all right.
Turn around.

780
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:17,850
Get on your knees!

781
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:23,850
Lean forward to the ground,
put your arms out to the side.

782
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,923
Palms up, turn your head to
the left.

783
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,450
Don't move.

784
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,600
I didn't do nothin',
I was called out here...

785
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,603
Yeah sure, Pal.

786
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,089
You got ID on you?

787
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,738
Yeah, inside the suit.

788
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:07,955
You gotta reach inside the
suit in my back pocket.

789
01:03:35,366 --> 01:03:35,966
Hey.

790
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,833
Nothing personal, Lady.

791
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,900
Just delivering a message
from your husband.

792
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,040
He says goodbye.

793
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:46,835
Lady, you don't know how to
use that.

794
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,442
Wait just a minute.

795
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:34,487
No!

796
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:41,020
Hey.

797
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:46,023
Listen, I wanted to explain
about the magazines.

798
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,120
I've been an art fan for years.

799
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,153
I first noticed your art in
those mags.

800
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,133
When I heard about the
showing downtown,

801
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,590
I thought it would be neat to see

802
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,240
some of your paintings up close.

803
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,020
I thought you said you saw
my picture in the program.

804
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:07,903
I did.

805
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,770
That's just not the only
place I saw it.

806
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,470
I didn't want you to flip out
and think I was a stalker,

807
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,753
which is probably what you're
thinking right about now.

808
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:24,487
Anyway, I'll talk to you
about it later.

809
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:36,990
Well.

810
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,200
Helluva shot, Miss Blodgett.

811
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,570
He's pretty dead.

812
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,403
Good.

813
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:43,223
Remorse, I like that.

814
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,580
It seems your husband
hired that guy to kill you.

815
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,880
Why would Bert do that?

816
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,773
He's divorcing me.

817
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,220
He's taking everything.

818
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,830
Well I'm gonna take a wild guess

819
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,320
and say that he's probably
taken out a sizeable

820
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,940
life insurance policy on you.

821
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:03,550
Oh, God.

822
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,660
Yeah, we found a tape
recorder in Mr. Hitman's car.

823
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,820
It seems he taped a few
conversations with your husband,

824
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,620
conversations where your
husband hired him to kill you.

825
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,763
No.

826
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:15,793
Plain old greed.

827
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,950
I guess getting the guy
to dress up like a clown

828
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,120
was just his way of being creative.

829
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,020
Hell, it's as good a disguise
as any.

830
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,780
He wasn't the clown that I saw.

831
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,430
He probably changed outfits.

832
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,020
No, I don't think so.

833
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,020
Are you positive?

834
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,620
He was wearing makeup.

835
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,800
Probably figured a
mask was much less work.

836
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:43,963
Easier to take off.

837
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,440
Why didn't he kill me that night?

838
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,780
Maybe he got scared.

839
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,310
Scared off by your friend's
phone call.

840
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,173
We'll never really know for sure.

841
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,783
You just take it easy.

842
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,700
We're looking for your
husband now.

843
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,000
We think he's on the run.

844
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,463
We haven't seen any sign
of him at his house.

845
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,160
Don't you worry about it, we'll
get him, we'll get him soon.

846
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,690
Whatever you were asking for in
this divorce thing, ask for more.

847
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,573
You'll get it.

848
01:09:13,293 --> 01:09:15,757
If you have any other
questions, give me a call.

849
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,893
Okay.

850
01:10:35,093 --> 01:10:37,693
It's amazing, simply amazing.

851
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,543
It's even better than
I could have imagined.

852
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,923
I can't thank you enough.

853
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,110
Please, wrap it up.

854
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,020
What was the final price
agreed upon?

855
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:57,853
20 thousand.

856
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:03,900
I'll spread the word about
your talent, Miss Blodgett.

857
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,780
You have quite a future
before you.

858
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,309
Thank you.

859
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:08,276
Good day.

860
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:15,685
Thank you.

861
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,650
Wow.

862
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,040
Home run, Lynn.

863
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,940
I can sure put this to, oh my God.

864
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,823
What?

865
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,543
This check is made out
for a hundred thousand.

866
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,032
He gave me a hundred grand.

867
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,300
Flinner Gallery.

868
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:40,433
Mr. Reid.

869
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,550
Hold on a moment.

870
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,413
Hello?

871
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:49,200
Pretty good actually.

872
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,063
A hundred thousand dollars good.

873
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,443
I'll tell you later.

874
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,023
Well, convince me.

875
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:07,680
Nice theater.

876
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:08,513
Hey Tuck!

877
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:10,130
I'm about ready.

878
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,750
You're gonna be in theater eight.

879
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,600
Great, thanks.

880
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,110
We're gonna grab some concessions.

881
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,750
I can send Bobby to do that.

882
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,700
Nah, it's all right.

883
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,110
I know where everything is.

884
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:19,993
Help yourself.

885
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,453
You're like an expert.

886
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,160
If I didn't know better, I'd
swear you've done this before.

887
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,370
Burger King when I was in
high school.

888
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,750
It's a lost art.

889
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,720
You know, I worked in a theater
when I was in high school.

890
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:11,923
Didn't last a month.

891
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,660
So what are we seeing?

892
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,580
I was thinking some scary
horror movie

893
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,040
where you'd have to snuggle
close to me,

894
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,120
but given the past couple of days,

895
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,760
I opted for a sappy love
movie instead.

896
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,643
Good choice.

897
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,470
I'm gonna make sure
everything's locked up.

898
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,353
Okay!

899
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,622
Hey!

900
01:16:20,672 --> 01:16:21,972
Scared the shit out of me.

901
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,380
Did Bobby put you up to this?

902
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,760
This ain't cool, Man.

903
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,510
You're not supposed to be up here.

904
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,947
I'll go get Bobby for you.

905
01:17:41,177 --> 01:17:42,700
I think he's getting ready to
start it.

906
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,560
Good, this is a little past
my bedtime.

907
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:46,810
I'm glad you came out.

908
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,690
I wasn't sure you would, you know...

909
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,860
Yeah, I think a movie might
be good,

910
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:56,590
get my mind off for a couple
of hours.

911
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,040
That's the right attitude.

912
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,450
Who's watching Nicholas?

913
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,320
Julie.

914
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,433
She's been dying to take
him for some time now.

915
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:09,710
If this takes much longer,
I'm gonna demand my money back.

916
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,543
What do you think the hold up is?

917
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,843
What's he doing now?

918
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,350
I'm gonna have to speak to a manager

919
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,150
if you don't start the movie, Jeff!

920
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:09,128
You are gonna pay.

921
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:51,583
Move down.

922
01:22:15,551 --> 01:22:16,384
Run!

923
01:22:24,682 --> 01:22:26,265
No, they're locked!

924
01:22:55,077 --> 01:22:56,960
Knock on it.

925
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:57,843
Too loud.

926
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:32,267
♪ The clowns will move
in on your perfect sky ♪

927
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:38,301
♪ The villains emerge from
the wounds ♪

928
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:43,995
♪ Crossing bells rolling the
perfect lie ♪

929
01:23:44,379 --> 01:23:45,379
Thrill me!

930
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,840
Vic, it's Peters.

931
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:16,790
Yeah, I'm up late.

932
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,830
Look, we got a problem.

933
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,800
That blood sample from
the girl's fingertips

934
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:24,259
came back a match to a DOJ
sex offender

935
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:25,673
by the name of Doug Richardson.

936
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,940
Yeah, not Heston.

937
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:29,943
Oh and get this,

938
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,080
He's got Leber's congenital amaurosis

939
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,987
and no I didn't make that up.

940
01:24:35,037 --> 01:24:37,320
It's a rare disease,
normally causes blindness,

941
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,440
but in some cases it causes
the sclera of the eye

942
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,627
to turn completely black.

943
01:24:40,677 --> 01:24:42,470
And to top it off,
this guy's a psych case

944
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,803
out of Roundsville.

945
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,550
You'll never guess who his
doctor was.

946
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,050
That's right.

947
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,350
I think he had two people
trying to kill her.

948
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,030
Send some uniforms over to
her house,

949
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,359
have them wake her up and
secure it.

950
01:24:57,409 --> 01:24:59,009
And call me when that's done,
all right?

951
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,730
Right.

952
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,180
We gotta get this other guy.

953
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:05,908
He's coming!

954
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:13,654
He's here.

955
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,213
Jeff!

956
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,520
He may be on the second level.

957
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:08,363
Call the police.

958
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:11,143
I'll go find him.

959
01:28:23,964 --> 01:28:25,420
Bureau 15.

960
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:26,253
Peters.

961
01:28:26,303 --> 01:28:27,750
She's not at the house.

962
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,633
It's empty.

963
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,150
Any sign of a break in?

964
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,940
Nope, however,
dispatch just got a 911

965
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:38,770
from a woman who says she's
being chased by a killer clown.

966
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,360
At the Columbia Golden Arts theater.

967
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:42,130
They have units on the way?

968
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,013
Yeah.

969
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,727
Tell the Supervising
Sergeant I'm 10 minutes away.

970
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,593
Did you get through?

971
01:29:01,643 --> 01:29:03,010
Yeah, I'm gonna leave
the phone off the hook.

972
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,330
They said they'd be here any second.

973
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:08,793
Good, Jeff isn't up there.

974
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,973
Come on, let's see if
the back door's open.

975
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:26,992
Wait here.

976
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:27,875
What?

977
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:30,680
He's been here.

978
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:04,047
Is it open?

979
01:30:46,938 --> 01:30:48,903
What are you doing?

980
01:30:48,953 --> 01:30:50,453
Looking for keys.

981
01:30:57,027 --> 01:30:57,860
Nothing?

982
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,220
Detective Peters, Homicide.

983
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:26,650
Where's your Sarge?

984
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,960
Hasn't shown up yet.

985
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:30,910
All the doors are locked, we got
guys on perimeter around the building.

986
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,030
Why haven't you gone in yet?

987
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,330
There's a woman trapped in
there with, well, a murderer.

988
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,630
Can't go in.

989
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,513
Why not?

990
01:31:50,531 --> 01:31:53,890
I've called in the Tac Team.

991
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,590
This guy's not taking hostages.

992
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,860
Tell them we're still trapped
in the projection room.

993
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,873
Hello?

994
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,333
Hello?

995
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,093
Hello?

996
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:22,773
The line's dead.

997
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,633
You have your cell phone?

998
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,270
I left it in my car.

999
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,360
You?

1000
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:31,613
I didn't want anyone to
get in touch with me tonight.

1001
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,833
Okay, no problem.

1002
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,550
We can wait it out here.

1003
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:41,133
The cops will be here any minute.

1004
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:44,763
We'll just wait.

1005
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:59,540
Oh shit.

1006
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:00,710
He can reach the projection windows

1007
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,800
from the smaller theaters.

1008
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:04,259
Can he get through?

1009
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:08,733
I don't know.

1010
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,113
Oh shit.

1011
01:35:15,301 --> 01:35:16,510
I'll distract him.

1012
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,200
You get Nicky out of there.

1013
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,083
No.

1014
01:35:20,163 --> 01:35:21,253
He'll kill you.

1015
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:27,960
Hey, I'm not gonna let anything
happen to either of you.

1016
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:28,843
I'm okay.

1017
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:34,123
I'm okay.

1018
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,570
I'm going out there but I need
you to do something for me.

1019
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,453
You're what?

1020
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,123
I'm tired.

1021
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:47,963
I'm tired of being scared.

1022
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,163
And I won't let him hurt my son.

1023
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,653
Now listen to me.

1024
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:09,483
All right.

1025
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:13,267
I'm here.

1026
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,343
Now let him go.

1027
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:21,023
Nicholas.

1028
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,970
I want you to go wait
outside for me, okay?

1029
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:34,853
Go on.

1030
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,393
Wait!

1031
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,393
Why are you doing this?

1032
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,657
To get better.

1033
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:12,463
Why me?

1034
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,727
Kill her, I'll be cured.

1035
01:37:31,368 --> 01:37:32,201
Look!

1036
01:38:30,356 --> 01:38:31,189
Hey.

1037
01:38:56,687 --> 01:38:58,770
Drop it or you're dead!

1038
01:39:08,421 --> 01:39:09,254
Don't!

1039
01:40:29,926 --> 01:40:31,843
That's the biggest fucking
clown I've ever seen.

1040
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,090
How you holding up?

1041
01:40:45,376 --> 01:40:46,570
We're okay.

1042
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,623
How about Julie?

1043
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,363
She's dead.

1044
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,093
I'm sorry.

1045
01:40:59,956 --> 01:41:03,730
The paramedics have to take Nicholas
to the hospital for a while.

1046
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:05,233
Just to do a few tests.

1047
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:08,513
You can ride in the ambulance
if you want.

1048
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:40,793
Hello?

1049
01:41:40,843 --> 01:41:41,800
Lynn?

1050
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:42,810
Thank God you answered.

1051
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,502
I don't want you to panic.

1052
01:41:44,552 --> 01:41:46,100
What, what's happened?

1053
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,300
Look, I've got men on the way,

1054
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,910
they'll be there any second.

1055
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,890
What is it?

1056
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:54,000
Doug Richardson, the clown,
he escaped from prison.

1057
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:56,300
I'm sure he's headed out of
state as fast as he can go,

1058
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,058
but I'm sending men over
there just to be safe.

1059
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:00,160
When?

1060
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:03,130
We're not sure,
we think about an hour ago.

1061
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:06,370
He injured two guards and
took a car.

1062
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,543
He's probably a state away
by now.
