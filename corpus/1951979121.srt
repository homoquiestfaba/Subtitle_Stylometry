1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,100
It's going to be triple digits here today.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,800
Along the Arizona-California border,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,600
so keep those pets inside.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,500
I think we gotta pull over, Brody.

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Again?

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,100
Craig, you've been shitting across America.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,700
Seriously, I want to get there, man.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Come on, guys.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,300
The cigar's hanging off the lip.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not going to make it.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,900
I'm not going to make it.
I'm not going to make it!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,300
Make sure you empty the tank,

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,200
because this is the last time we're stopping.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,900
And don't forget to bury it!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
This is so bad for the environment.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Gentlemen, according to my calculations,

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,000
it's only 1,300 miles to Los Angeles.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,200
Remind me again why we didn't just fly.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,400
Don't you remember?

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,500
We all decided we wanted to see America.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Over it.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Tunnel!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
- Oh, no.
- What?

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,300
Did anyone remember to pack
our Gilmore Girls box set?

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
Well, we didn't forget it
back home, did we?

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,000
You guys, don't worry.

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,500
It's cool. It's cool.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
I packed it in the gray suitcase.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,600
Thank God.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
- Rory.
- Lorelai.

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,100
Grandma!

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Oh, man, I love gridlock.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Yeah, check out all the hot chicks
in fancy cars.

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,200
Maybe we could invite them all
over to our new pad.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Here it is!

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
On the right!
On the right!

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,600
This can't be right.

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,500
It's even better than I expected.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Do you guys think any stars live here?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Looks like Italy.

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,600
Mort. Mort. Mort.

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,900
- Skip the sermon.
- Ballsy! Come on!

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
- And write it down this time.
- Come on, Ballsy!

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,200
I have to go.

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,200
I have gentlemen callers.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
May I help you?

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,000
We were just looking for Marge the manager.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,400
You from the casino?

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,400
No.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
IRS?

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

53
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,900
Bed, Bath & Beyond?

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,700
No.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Well, I'm Marge.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm Brody.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm Craig.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm Doug.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,200
We actually talked to you last week
about the fully-furnished

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
and spacious efficiency apartments
with breath-taking views.

61
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
Complimentary cable, including Skinimax.

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,800
Deluxe kitchenette.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
And free unlimited street parking.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
When available.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
We just rolled into town.

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
We're kind of wondering
if we can move in immediately.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Where?

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Here.

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
We sent you our deposit?

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,100
We have a no-pet policy.

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
You know, the ca-ca and all?

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
You're talking about Ballsy.

74
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,600
Ballsy's not a pet.

75
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,600
He's one of us.
He's family.

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,100
He's very well-behaved.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah, you won't even know he's here.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,200
So... what kind of house you look for?

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,100
Little house, medium house,

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,300
big house, condominium?

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Well, basically, I guess we're just looking

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,900
for something, you know, with a roof.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You know, indoor plumbing,
maybe a couple of walls.

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,200
Spacious enough to entertain friends.

85
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
Yeah, and impressive enough
that it makes women

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,300
want to have sex with us.

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,700
Ridiculous.

88
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
That going to cost you.

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Well, yeah, I mean, that's what we figured.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
But it's cool.
We got it covered.

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,600
Yeah, you know...

92
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,000
See, as luck would have it, our dog "Ballsy"

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
suffered a minor maiming at the groomer's.

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,300
A... medical faux pas, if you will.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,900
Like, you go to a drug store
to buy some shampoo...

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
And instead, they cut off your balls.

97
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,800
Sorry.

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
I guess, on the bright side,
the tragedy afforded us all

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
the opportunity to move
out of our parents' house.

100
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh, I see.
You boys real driven.

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,100
Winnie, we have come halfway
across the country to start our lives.

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,100
We can't just turn around and go home.

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,800
My dad walks around
the house naked with his...

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,600
And my nana's cookware is a joke.

105
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,400
Listen, um... Kwang-fu.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,800
You can call me Winnie.

107
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
How old are you?

109
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,700
Twenty-three.

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,700
You look soft.

111
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
Bring me the red file.

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Here. Red file.

113
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,600
Softie.

114
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,000
He's hot.

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,700
I found you boys the perfect house.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Furnished estate?

117
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,800
- Hollywood Hills.
- They're cheap!

118
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,200
We'll take it!

119
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,500
Congratulations!

120
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,100
Where are we?

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
I don't know.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
I wish there were someone
we could ask for directions.

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
What kind of crazed psycho

124
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
would be out here at this time of night?

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,700
What?

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,700
Lock the door!

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,900
Wait!

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
I think it's just a Mexican.

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
Maybe we can ask him directions.

130
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
Hola, Mexican.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm really sorry to bother you,

132
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,200
but we're a little lost.

133
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,600
See, we're looking
for our new el housio.

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,100
I'm sorry?

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,500
He keeps saying something
about el diablo.

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
El diablo?

137
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
Oh, my God.

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,100
El diablo?

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,600
Isn't that that super
hot, hot, hot, hot sauce?

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
Yes, dude! Yes!

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
He's probably just hungry.

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
What do we got?

143
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
Here. Here.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
You are in luck, my Latino friend.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Offer him some ketchup.

146
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,700
It's like white people hot sauce.

147
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
We don't have any hot sauce,

148
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,600
but we do have some ketchup.

149
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, and it won't burn your cheerio
like that el diablo stuff.

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,300
- Yeah, all right.
- No, no, no!

151
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,100
Aquíl

152
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
Jesus, this guy's got a one-track mind.

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,900
We're just going to have to
figure this out on our own.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,300
But good luck to you, friend.

155
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Yeah, and don't be such a food snob.

156
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, give ketchup a chance!

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,900
El diablol

158
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,400
I think this is it.

159
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Wow, I got goosebumps.

160
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Gentlemen, we're home.

161
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,800
Wow...

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
Killer pad.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Doug, damn...

164
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Brody, you're hitting me.
You're hitting me!

166
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
Hey, how's your book?

167
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,700
Real page-turner, man.

168
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,100
Real page-turner.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,700
It's home.

170
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Wow.

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,900
You know, I think we should be
really proud of ourselves, guys.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,200
I mean, we did it!
You know?

173
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,200
We finally moved out of our parents' house
and into our own place.

174
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,800
Sure beats the view of my dad's balls.

175
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,400
You know what I love most about this house?

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,900
Lts functional floor plan?

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Self-cleaning ovens?

178
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,600
I love... that it's going
to help us score with hot babes

179
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,900
way out of our league.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
This house is perfect.

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,900
Did you guys hear something?

182
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,900
I didn't even know this room was down here.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
Sounds like it's coming from down here.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
Oh, Jesus!

185
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
Previous owners must have had a lot of pets.

186
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
That's actual the skull
of the Turkish dairy goat.

187
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,900
Guys. Guys, over here.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,100
What is it, Brody?

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,500
What'd you find?

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Looks like we got an open sewer line here.

191
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,600
Now, there's an accident waiting to happen.

192
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,100
Hey, it's warm.

193
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

194
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,800
Oh, yeah.

195
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,900
Hey, look, a coyote.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,900
He's kinda cute.

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,600
- You are.
- Yeah, maybe he can hang out.

198
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,800
And him and Ballsy could have a play date.

199
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Or not.

200
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,500
He must have come in
from the hills through that hole.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,200
Maybe if we scare him,
he'll just run out the way he came in.

202
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,100
Now, I'm going to count to three.

203
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,100
And we're going to take him.

204
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
All right.

205
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,200
One... two...

206
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
Then again, there is another option.

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
I got another one.

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,400
Okay, wait.

210
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,900
Who am I?

211
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,600
You're a Turkish dairy goat.

212
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,900
Guys, wouldn't it be funny if that coyote

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,100
was some kind of demon and this...

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,600
and that open sewer
was actually some kind of portal to hell,

215
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,300
and the longer we stayed in this house,

216
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,200
the greater chance there was
of us being brutally murdered

217
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,200
and sacrificed to the devil?

218
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,600
That would be...

219
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,400
awesome!

220
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Oh, Beyoncé.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Were you spooning me?

222
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Why, hello.

223
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,100
Welcome to our humble abode.

224
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Would you like to come in?

225
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, we live here.

226
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, thank you.

227
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,300
Hi.

228
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm Lucy, from next door.

229
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Next door?

230
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,800
It seemed like we were all alone
up on this hill.

231
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,400
We're actually from down quite a ways.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
We?

233
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm a volunteer at Hope House.

234
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
That's great.

235
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
What's that?

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, it's a place where people can go

237
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,600
when they're sick and don't have any money

238
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400
or friends or family or resources.

239
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
Yeah, sounds a lot like Craig's house.

240
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,200
Yeah, Craig's dad walks around naked.

241
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
What?

242
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,300
No.

243
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,700
Oh, I made you a cake.

244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
It's angel food.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,100
Thank you very much.

246
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
She's hot and she bakes.

247
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,700
Can I cut you piece or something?

248
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Oh, no, no.

249
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,400
I never eat angel food.

250
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,400
I just wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,300
Yeah, nobody takes
the time anymore, you know?

252
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,500
All the homes are so private and secluded.

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
That's pretty much the only drawback
to this place, right?

254
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,700
Maybe you could have
a housewarming or something.

255
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
Hey, that's a great idea!

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Like a huge party!

257
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,900
Well, I should be getting back.

258
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,900
If we were to have a party...

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
would you come?

261
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,500
Well, if you're inviting me...

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,700
I'd love to.

263
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,000
Bye, now.

264
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
We have got great neighbors!

265
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Wow.

266
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,700
You guys, we can't throw a party.

267
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,700
What? Why not?

268
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,700
Because who are we going to invite?

269
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Man, Doug's right.

270
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,700
We don't know anybody around here.

271
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Except Lucy.

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,500
And that ungrateful Mexican.

273
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Doug. Ungrateful Latino.

274
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,400
Whatever.
Ungrateful nevertheless.

275
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't worry, guys.

276
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
I've got an idea.

277
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,300
Brody, this is magnificent.

278
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
Thank you.

279
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,500
Now all we gotta do is decide who to invite.

280
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,500
Well, that's easy.

281
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
Chicks under 20 who enjoy getting wasted.

282
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,900
And have a history of poor judgment.

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Or either naive or insecure.

284
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I would do just about
anything for free copies.

285
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,500
Sorry, guys.

286
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
I got a little excited.

287
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,500
I don't get out much.

288
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,800
I still live at home.

289
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,800
My dad walks around the house naked.

290
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Hey, kid.

291
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,100
You're partying with us.

292
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,800
Really?

293
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,300
Thank you.

294
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Thank you so much.

295
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Hey! Hey!
What are you doin' there?

296
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, shit! Run!

297
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
I'll call the cops!

298
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,100
- Get back here!
- Go! Go! Go!

299
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Forgive me, Father... for I have sinned.

300
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,300
- Wow, hi.
- Please come. Please.

301
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
Hey, you wanna...

302
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Hi.

303
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,900
Thank you.
What is this?

304
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
We're having a party.

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Give it to me. It's mine.

306
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,600
That's a wrap!

307
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Hi. Please come to my party.

308
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Take mine.
Take mine.

309
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Hey, we're throwing this party,
if you wanna...

310
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,200
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Give me this.

311
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,500
- Get out of here.
- Give me this.

312
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
This is for the...

313
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,300
Get out... Give me the...

314
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
What's the matter with Ballsy?

315
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,500
Really hot in here.

316
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,200
Kinda smells like eggs.

317
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey, guys.

318
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,100
What the hell happened here?

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,800
Somebody broke into our house.

320
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,800
Oh, my toaster.

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
You guys, lookit.

322
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
It all makes sense.

323
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,100
How could we have been so blind?

324
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
What?

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,800
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't you see?

327
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,500
The hellacious stench?

328
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
The ungodly heat?

329
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
The forbidden fruit?

330
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
I know what did this.

331
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,500
It was a bunch of God damned squatters!

332
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
You think weightlifters did this?

333
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
No, vagrants.
You know, transients.

334
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
Squatters?

335
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,700
What if the squatters broke in
through that open sewer,

336
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,900
just like that coyote,

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and have been living
secretly in our basement for months?

338
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,100
So... you're saying that

339
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,500
a bunch of apple-eatin'
homeless people

340
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
living in our basement

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,700
are doing all this freaky stuff

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,000
just to scare us off?

343
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,000
That is exactly what I think.

344
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Oh, you're good.

345
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,900
But I'll tell you what.

346
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,300
This is our house now.

347
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,700
And come hell or come high water,
we are staying put!

348
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,700
Yes!

349
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
But what if they're still here?

350
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,300
Oh, God!

351
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
Just disgusting.

352
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,200
It's all kinds of nasty.

353
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,600
Rude.

354
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
It's a squatter!

355
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,700
He still wants el diablo.

356
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,300
Again with the el diablo.

357
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,200
Look, ese...

358
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
No el diablo.

359
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,100
No hablo espanolo.

360
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
Oh, my God!

361
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
- What!
- No!

362
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,000
What?

363
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
Whoa!

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Where did he go?

365
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
That guy just ripped out his own heart.

366
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
And tracked mud all in the house.

367
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,100
You guys?

368
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
These squatters are crazy.

369
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I know.

370
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,600
They'll try anything to get us out.

371
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,100
Well, the only way we're getting out

372
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,400
is in three bloody body bags.

373
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,900
Yeah.

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They're not gonna scare us off
with their cheap carnival tricks.

375
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,000
They must think we're a bunch of pussies.

376
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,300
- Yeah.
- Oh, boys!

377
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,700
Is everything okay here?

378
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,900
We're chillin'.
It's Lucy.

379
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500
- Oh, we're totally fine.
- Oh, yeah.

380
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,500
These are my friends:

381
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,500
Delilah...

382
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
What's up?

383
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,400
...and Jezebel.

384
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,000
Hey.

385
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,000
I was looking for that.

386
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,800
Hey, little pootchie,
pootchie, pootchie-kins.

387
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,300
Here you go, boy.
Fetch. Here you go.

388
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,600
They were wondering if it would be okay
if they came to your party.

389
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
- Absolutely.
- Indeed.

390
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,400
- Please do.
- Great!

391
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
Oh, and we brought something
for you to listen to.

392
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
- Absolutely.
- Indeed.

393
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,000
Please do.

394
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,400
What do you think?

395
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,800
I don't know.

396
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,300
You know, it's a little...

397
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,700
They're called Demon Semen.

398
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
I think they'd be perfect for your party.

399
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,300
I think we're looking for something
with a little more woodwind.

400
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,800
Yeah, you know,
maybe something, like,

401
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,200
just a little bit less terrifying.

402
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah, they sound really creepy.

403
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,900
It totally makes us wanna do
all kinds of, like, bad things.

404
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,600
Things that we would
normally never, ever, ever do.

405
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,700
Like what?

406
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Like this.

407
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,900
Like what?

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
Like what?

409
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,500
I think I released some Demon Semen.

410
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,900
Your tongue tastes so good.

411
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
Like what?

412
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,400
I've got so much food
for the party tonight.

413
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,800
I've got so much food
for the party tonight.

414
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,600
I've been baking this since noon.

415
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,100
- Nana's recipe.
- Oh, boy.

416
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,000
- Oh, boy.
- Try one.

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Good.
All right.

418
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,400
And?

419
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,200
You can bake.

420
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,800
You can bake!

421
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,700
And you are the best sous-chef ever.

422
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Wait, what's a sous-chef?

423
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,800
The chopper-upper.

424
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Oh, then yes.

425
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I gotta tell you guys,

426
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
these Saudi-built detectors
just don't cut the mustard.

427
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,300
Now, I'm afraid,
if you want a party permit,

428
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
you're gonna have to bring
this building up to code.

429
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,800
Of course...

430
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,800
Well, there is one other option.

431
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,400
- There is?
- Tell us. We'll do anything.

432
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, now, this is gonna
be a big party, right?

433
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,300
Refreshments and dancing and a lot
of interesting people to talk to?

434
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Oh, yeah. There's gonna be chicks
and booze everywhere.

435
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah, and my famous
butterscotch bunnies.

436
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
Thanks, no.

437
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,300
Mind if I smoke?

438
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,300
- Well, now...
- No.

439
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Let's say...

440
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,300
you can get a trained
professional to be on hand?

441
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I don't know.

442
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,600
What do you think, Doug?

443
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,600
Sounds expensive.

444
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,300
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure you could find

445
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
someone who would donate
their time, you know?

446
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,700
Someone who's lost direction.

447
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Someone who's never been comfortable

448
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,300
with the whole on-line dating scene

449
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
but still thinks there's an outside chance

450
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,900
that there's someone
out there that's just right for him.

451
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, I don't know.

452
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,700
I don't know how I'd feel

453
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,300
about having some poor
bastard work for free.

454
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200
It's un-American.

455
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,800
No, no.
You gotta trust me on this one.

456
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,100
I mean, he wouldn't mind.

457
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,900
I mean, not like
when his wife of 17 years,

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,500
who he treated like a goddess,

459
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
left him for Tom at MySpace. Com.

460
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,500
It kinda sounds like
your friend might be...

461
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
be gay.

462
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,200
Why?
You gay?

463
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,700
Nice apron.

464
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,200
Anyway, that's beside the point.

465
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,000
What do you say
you just help a firefighter out?

466
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
He's a very close, dear friend of mine,

467
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
although he's not gay.

468
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,500
Look, Mr. Fire Marshal.

469
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
Let's just say we replace

470
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,700
all the smoke detectors
in the entire house,

471
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,100
what are the chances that
we pass inspection then?

472
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,700
Hmm, well, I'd have to say
slim and none.

473
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
We're saving those.

474
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Oh, for the party?

475
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,000
Hey, you guys,

476
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,000
I got the most awesome idea
for the party, okay?

477
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,500
- What's wrong with you two?
- Dude, the party's over, man.

478
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,100
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Fire Marshal.

479
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Fire Marshal?
What fire marshal?

480
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,600
The one that said the
house wasn't up to code.

481
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,400
Yeah, so, unless
we can pull a trained fire professional

482
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
who will work for free
right out of our asses,

483
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,000
which is practically impossible...

484
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,300
How did he know we were having a party?

485
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,200
His "friend" found this at a strip club.

486
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
You guys let a fire marshal in here?

487
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,100
What a hell hole.

488
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
What the hell?

489
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Oh, yeah, this gotta be
a code-eight violation.

490
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,300
You let him go down
in the basement?

491
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,900
With all those violations?

492
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,100
Now we gotta bribe him!

493
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,500
Hello?

494
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
Baloney.

495
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,500
Ice cold beverage.

496
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Mr. Fire Marshal?

497
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,800
Salami.

498
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,500
Oh, my God.

499
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,800
What is it?

500
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,400
We passed!

501
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes!

502
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,700
Well, looks like
this place is missing just one thing.

503
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,200
I cannot believe you found Backwater!

504
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
I cannot believe you found Backwater!

505
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,600
I know.

506
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,300
Last I heard, he was in a full body cast

507
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,500
from doing a flying squirrel
into a pool with no water.

508
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,800
Do you guys remember

509
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,400
the time that he ran
out of beer and he drank his own pee?

510
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,100
Yeah, that pee got him wasted.

511
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,800
I know.
Me, too.

512
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
Here he is, guys.
Here he is.

513
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,200
- That's not Backwater.
- Yeah, who's the rabbi?

514
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,400
Asshole!

515
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,800
Backwater?

516
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Wow, I can actually see
the whites of your eyes.

517
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Did you bring your laminated name tag,

518
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,300
just in case you get
so wasted you forget your name

519
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,200
and end up in Mexico again?

520
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Remember that?

521
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,100
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen
again this year, boys.

522
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,500
What, you pass out?
No way.

523
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,500
Drugs and alcohol
were a crutch for me.

524
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,700
But since I found the Lord,

525
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,300
I realize I no longer need them.

526
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,600
Are you joking?

527
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,200
No.

528
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,200
I get it.
You're stoned right now.

529
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,300
Me, too.

530
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,300
Okay, look, guys, the truth is
I'm here for me.

531
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
For the first time since I was six,

532
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,600
I am completely drug and alcohol free.

533
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,700
And let me tell you, it feels great.

534
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,500
In a few weeks, I'll be joining the order.

535
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,900
So I figured your party
would be the ultimate test

536
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,400
of my spiritual fortitude.

537
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,200
I've come to face my demons, boys.

538
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
- Band room.
- Check.

539
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,200
- Catering.
- Check.

540
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,800
- Check.
- Check.

541
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,700
- Check.
- Let's do this.

542
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,800
All right, boys and girls.

543
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,400
Showtime.

544
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,400
Welcome to our pad.

545
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,100
I think I speak for all of us

546
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
when I say we were really touched

547
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,100
by your work in Indiana Bones.

548
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,900
And Position: Lmpossible.

549
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,100
I saw Meet the Knockers

550
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,100
37... 38 times.

551
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
That's my favorite.

552
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,500
Mine, too.

553
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,200
I love your necklace.

554
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean every letter of it.

555
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,100
Whoa!
You got a flyer?

556
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Great job on the bouncers.

557
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,800
Yeah, where'd you get these guys?

558
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,300
Food court.

559
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,500
You see this party?

560
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
This is what you're missing tonight.

561
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,800
Now get out.

562
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,100
Girls with chains and spikes.

563
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
- That was you, wasn't it.
- Yeah.

564
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,600
Handsome woman.

565
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,300
- Pretty man.
- Indeed.

566
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,900
Whoa. Whoa.

567
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,500
Hold on.

568
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry, but there's going
to be a lot of sex

569
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,000
and booze and
hardcore perversion at this party

570
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm afraid I'm gonna
need to see some IDs.

571
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,900
But these say you're all only 16.

572
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,500
Is that a problem?

573
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,900
These things better not be bogus.

574
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,600
Wow, you girls look great.

575
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,700
Thanks, so do you.

576
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,300
Almost good enough to eat.

577
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,600
And we are totally starving.

578
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,400
So we'll see you inside.

579
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,700
This is gonna be one hell of a party.

580
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
I hope so.

581
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,500
Excuse me.
Attention.

582
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
You gotta turn it on, man.

583
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,500
If I could just have
everyone's attention, please.

584
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,800
Just for a second.

585
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,100
My name is Brody,

586
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,500
and these are my two
best friends in the whole world,

587
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,500
Doug and Craig.

588
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,300
And we'd just like to welcome you our...

589
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,500
new den of debauchery!

590
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
And now without further ado,

591
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
I'd like you guys
to give a warm welcome

592
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
to our house band,

593
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,700
Demon Semen!

594
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,400
Bitch.

595
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,900
Who's ready to raise hell tonight?

596
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,700
God damn men.

597
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,000
Hurry up in there.

598
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,800
No!

599
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Looks like someone clogged the toilet.

600
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,500
Looks like they had Coney's.

601
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,100
Oh, man, I love Coney's.

602
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,900
Yeah, me, too.

603
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
It's so good.

604
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,900
Delicious.

605
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,900
Wow, that turd is really wedged in there.

606
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,800
Yeah, it's huge.

607
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,200
It kinda looks like a human head.

608
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,100
I mean, check it out.
It's even got eyes.

609
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,800
Oh, yeah.
That's staring right up at us.

610
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
It's starting to freak me out.

611
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,300
Yeah... me, too.

612
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,600
Stop staring at me, turd!
You're freaking me out!

613
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,400
Turn your head, turd.

614
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,400
All right, give me the plunger.

615
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,400
Stand back.

616
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,700
Wait!
Craig, wait!

617
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,100
- What?
- We should take a picture of this.

618
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,600
We could send it in to ratemypoo. Com

619
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,400
Oh, yeah.
Yes, we could win 50 bucks.

620
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
We gotta say you did it.
It's more impressive.

621
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,700
Right.

622
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,900
Say feces!

623
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Can you hear me now?

624
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
Can you hear me now?

625
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,200
I hate cell phones.

626
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,700
Heidi, listen,
you sent me to the wrong place.

627
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,300
What?
No.

628
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,900
Keep quiet.
I'm gonna probably lose you any minute.

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,400
Listen to me.

630
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,100
I hired you to get me
to the places I need to get to.

631
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
You sent me to the wrong place, Heidi.

632
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,400
What? No.
No, I'm not at Tobey's house, Heidi.

633
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,600
What? No.

634
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,900
No, not Moby. Tobey.

635
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
Heidi, I don't even know Moby.

636
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,800
I'm a big fan of his music, too.

637
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,400
Listen to me.
Just keep quiet.

638
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,400
Look, look...

639
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,200
I need you to get me to Tobey's house.

640
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,800
Because right now
I am stuck in the middle of this...

641
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,600
this very weird,
very strange house party.

642
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,800
What?

643
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,800
I don't know if there are
any other celebrities here, Heidi,

644
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
and I don't care.

645
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,000
I just... Listen to me.

646
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,800
Heidi! Look, I...

647
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,900
Hello? Hello?

648
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Hello.

649
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
You know, you're never going
to find what you're looking for

650
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,700
at the bottom of that glass.

651
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
What?

652
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,200
What's your name?

653
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,700
- Joe.
- Joe, take a look around.

654
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,900
I'll tell you what I see.

655
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,100
I see you and your friends
heading down a path,

656
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
a path to ruin.

657
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,000
What are you talking about?

658
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,700
I'm talking about that right there.

659
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,000
Whaddaya got?
Punch?

660
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,100
It's not punch, Joe.
It's poison.

661
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,400
And the more of that poison
that you put into those veins,

662
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,000
the further you fall into a pit.

663
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,700
A pit... of despair.

664
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
Are you kidding me?
I don't even...

665
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
I don't even know any of these people.

666
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm not even supposed to be here right now.

667
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,300
You know where
I'm supposed to be?

668
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,300
I'm supposed to be
at Tobey Maguire's house...

669
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
that's right...
to play poker tonight.

670
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I don't know who that is.

671
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,200
- Spider-Man?
- Nah.

672
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,400
- Seabiscuit?
- Never saw it.

673
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,900
Movie with a horse?
You never saw it?

674
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,500
No. The only superstar I worship...

675
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
Forget it. Is there a phone
around here that I can use?

676
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,400
If you listen to your heart,

677
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,400
you won't need to phone anyone.

678
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,800
Okay.

679
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,700
Oh, my God.
No offense, Father.

680
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Look, the point is that just doesn't
help me out at all right now.

681
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,800
But thank you.

682
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,700
- Why don't you have a drink?
- Oh, no, no. I don't...

683
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,700
No, have it, it's lovely.
It's a lovely drink.

684
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
- I'm not supposed to drink.
- Great dog. Cute dog.

685
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Drink me.

686
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,900
What?

687
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,400
Hey, boo.

688
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,400
Hey, Doug, put me down.

690
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,600
Put me down, Doug.

691
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,600
Hey. Just...

692
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,200
That's a great band.

694
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,100
Yeah, yeah, we love the Demon Semen.

695
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,900
- Yeah, good call.
- Thanks.

696
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,600
So, how about
a private tour of the house?

697
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,500
Ooh, that'd be great.

698
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,100
But how about after we have a few drinks.

699
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Yeah.

700
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,600
Because, you know,
alcohol lowers all our inhibitions.

701
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,300
That is so sweet.

702
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,300
Why don't you wait right here while
the two of us go freshen up a little?

703
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,700
Yeah, yeah.

704
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,200
And then we'll take that tour.

705
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Starting with the bedrooms.

706
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,300
Okay.

707
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,100
- We can do that.
- I can do that. Can you do that?

708
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,900
I'll be there.
Are you going to be there?

709
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,700
So, you want a shot?

710
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,100
Oh. I don't know.

711
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
I mean, I already have this beer.

712
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,800
And one's usually my limit.

713
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,100
I give you permission
to get a little wild.

714
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,300
Well, okay. If you say so.

715
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,900
So, what are my options?

716
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,900
Oh, we've got everything.

717
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,600
I mean, the previous owner
left us a ton of spirits...

718
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,200
vodka, rum, gin, tequila,

719
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,300
and of course Doug's
marshmallow surprise punch.

720
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,300
Wow.

721
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,600
They all sound so good.

722
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,200
How about I try one of each?

723
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,500
But promise you'll stop me
if I get carried away.

724
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,300
Don't you worry.

725
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,300
I can handle my liquor.

726
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,500
Gwen, can you feel it in the air?

727
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Yeah.

728
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,000
It's like there's evil all around us.

729
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,100
Hey, girls.
Neat party, huh?

730
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,900
Oh, I don't know if you girls know this,

731
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,400
but I'm actually really tight friends

732
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,600
with the guys who live here.

733
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,900
Don't want to get your hopes up,

734
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,800
but I might be getting some
Barry Manilow tickets pretty soon.

735
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,700
You know what would be funny?

736
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,300
If you took your top off
and I saw your breasts and I was like,

737
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,700
"Hey, I can't believe you did that... "

738
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,100
Hey, how do you eat cereal
with that lip thing...

739
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,900
Say goodbye to those BM tickets!

740
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,600
Your back structure's exquisite.

741
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,600
I want to lick it.

742
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,300
Guys, this place is so cool.

743
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,900
Totally bad.

744
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I wonder who we have an intimate,

745
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,500
meaningful conversation with to stay here.

746
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,300
These jets are intense!

747
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,900
I'm totally sweating!

748
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,700
I'm getting so hot.

749
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,200
Guys, it's hot.

750
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,200
I think it's getting a little too hot.

751
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,000
Delilah, Jezebel?

752
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,600
Where are you little devils?

753
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,400
Doug... check it out.

754
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,400
Wow.

755
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,900
Triplets.

756
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,200
Check this out.

757
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,500
Hey, girls.

758
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,700
How's the water?

759
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,400
Good one.

760
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Mind if we come in?

761
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,800
- Well, I guess we can take that as a yes.
- They didn't say no.

762
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,300
Impressive.

763
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
I know.

764
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,900
Okay, all right.
They're fine.

765
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
They're fine out there.

766
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,400
You're okay, they're okay.

767
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,900
They're okay.
Right, Ballsy?

768
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,900
Oh, my God!

769
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,100
How did you get up there?

770
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,900
That's warm.

771
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,400
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

772
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,100
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

773
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,500
Hello, triplets.

774
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,900
So, Tecates for the hot-tays?

775
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,400
Why don't you just hang on to that?

776
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,200
Or not.

777
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,900
So which one of you was born first?

778
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,500
Doug?

779
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,700
These girls look cooked.

780
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I know, they're totally baked.

781
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,500
They can't even speak.

782
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,000
No, man.

783
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,500
I think that they're dead.

784
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,300
Holy shit!

785
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,200
You got a little piece of corpse on you!

786
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
Get it off!
Get it off!

787
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,500
All right, all right,
we got to just stay calm.

788
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
Stay calm?

789
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,100
The Von Schlutz triplets
are dead in our hot tub!

790
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,400
What do we do?

791
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,500
Doug, relax!

792
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,300
We've just got to think, man.

793
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,500
Now, first things first.

794
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,100
We drink another beer.

795
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,700
She's got my beer!
She's got my beer!

796
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,900
- Here.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

797
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,300
Okay, then we call the cops.

798
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy, man?

799
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,100
We can't call the cops.

800
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,500
- Okay, no cops. Why?
- Because!

801
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,500
We got dead triplets floating in our hot tub.

802
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,200
They'll shut the party down, man.

803
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,600
Maybe even impound the house.

804
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,600
No, no, no!
We can't let that happen!

805
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,900
I know.

806
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,900
And all because of one completely random
freak party accident.

807
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,200
And we haven't even scored yet!

808
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,700
Yes! Yes! See?
Same page every time!

809
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,100
- Okay, all right.
- All right, all right.

810
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,200
- Okay, what do we do?
- Look.

811
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,900
We'll call the cops in the morning, okay,

812
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,900
after everyone's gone.

813
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,700
And then we'll replace
all the smoke detectors in the house.

814
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,500
- Fine.
- Okay.

815
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,900
But for now...

816
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,100
I say that we don't tell anybody, okay?

817
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,200
Not even Brody.

818
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,300
Oh, no, no.

819
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,100
Especially not Brody.

820
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,600
Yes!

821
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,100
Okay.

822
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,200
What do we do with these poor girls
in the meantime?

823
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,600
Oh, no, it's empty.

824
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Maybe we should just slow down
just a wee bit, though.

825
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Oh, okay.

826
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,300
Maybe you're right.

827
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,500
Hey, do you know
what I've always wanted to do?

828
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,500
Can we... just get some air?

829
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,200
Pop my top.

830
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,500
I think that is a great idea.

831
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,300
You know, like, in public?

832
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,200
Just jump up on a table and rip it off!

833
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,000
I think that is a great idea.

834
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,400
Really?

835
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Hey, maybe I could just
pop it right here for you.

836
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,200
Like, for practice.

837
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,800
I think that's a great idea.

838
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,200
Hey.

839
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,100
Hey!

840
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Aren't you that famous guy Brody,

841
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,600
who's like... owns this killer place,

842
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,600
who, like, is responsible
for this killer bash, right?

843
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Yeah.

844
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,400
Yeah. Oh, dude, there's some people
looking for you out front.

845
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,600
They seem pretty mad or something.

846
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,100
Hold that thought.

847
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,800
So, uh, is your dad, like, a robber,

848
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,600
because he stole some stars
and put them in your eyes.

849
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,400
We caught him speaking
in tongues down at the curb.

850
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,800
He's scaring away all the Mexican trim.

851
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,100
Senores, el diablo están...

852
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

853
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,400
El diablo aquí en tu casa.

854
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,600
This hot sauce is making him mental.

855
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,900
Although, I do like the tie.

856
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,800
It's a nice touch.

857
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,600
What do you want us to do with him, boss?

858
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,900
Well, I don't know.

859
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,800
I mean, what are my options?

860
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,500
Let's see.
We could whack him.

861
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
Whack him?

862
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,800
Oh, sure.
We've done it before.

863
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,400
I'll just stick myself
a few times in the arm with a shiv,

864
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,400
call it self-defense.

865
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,600
I don't know.

866
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,600
What if we just get him out of here
with a stern warning?

867
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,500
You're the boss.

868
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,100
Look, I want you and your fellow squatters
to get the hell out of here

869
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,100
and stay the hell away from our house.

870
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,300
And if I see you back here again,

871
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,300
you sure as hell better have a pair of tits.

872
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,600
Big ones.
Double D.

873
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,800
Hi. I'm Brian Trolet.
The "T" is silent.

874
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,900
What's your name?

875
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm Amber, Amber Waves.

876
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,200
And this is my partner...

877
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,300
Cherry Red.

878
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,800
What do you do?

879
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,800
I'm in adult films and so is she.

880
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,100
I saw an adult film once.

881
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,900
My father has them.

882
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,700
He hides them in a box labeled "poison. "

883
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,500
Wait a minute.

884
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,000
There's nothing wrong with nudity.

885
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,700
- Really?
- No.

886
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
- It's natural.
- It is?

887
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,300
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

888
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,000
Well, if it's natural, do you think...

889
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,800
Am I allowed to see your breasts?

890
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,300
Well, yeah!

891
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah?

892
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,200
Watch it, stretched.

893
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,200
I missed it.

894
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,200
Save me dance?

895
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,800
I missed it.

896
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,000
Oh, Jesus, Craig.

897
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,800
Two and a half more people are dead.

898
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,200
Do you know what this means?

899
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,100
Yeah.

900
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,200
There goes any shot of
the Meet the Knockers sequel.

901
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:55,800
That, and this is just another
completely random freak party accident.

902
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Again... it's like we're on the same page.

903
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,200
What are the chances?

904
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,900
Every time.

905
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,400
So, Craig, what do we do
with these bodies?

906
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,100
I actually do a silly little
Bruce Willis impersonation.

907
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,600
- You know, because...
- Give me a break.

908
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,400
No, it's true.
It's really great.

909
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,700
Because it's all in... it's all in the mouth.

910
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,200
You know, he's got
this little scowl, and he's like...

911
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,600
You know, he's like...

912
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,800
Let's see.

913
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,900
He's like, Hans.

914
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,900
Hans, that's a...

915
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
that's a tricky little accent there, Hans.

916
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,000
You should be on TV with that accent, Hans.

917
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,200
Hey.

918
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,900
You okay?

919
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,800
Hey, you...

920
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,200
Joey...

921
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Joe...

922
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,700
Hans.

923
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,400
What are you going to do
with the detonators, Hans, hmm?

924
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,100
What do you think, I'm stupid, Hans?

925
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,500
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

926
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,100
What the...

927
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,000
Hey! Father Patrick, how's it going?

928
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,300
Hey! Father Patrick, how's it going?

929
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,100
It's Brother Backwater.

930
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah.

931
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,000
Yes, I know it's late.

932
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,500
I'm sorry to get you up.

933
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,100
I'm feeling a little...

934
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,200
a little thirsty right now.

935
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,500
Like I could use a drink.

936
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Yeah, you know.

937
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,800
I went to a party and, you know...

938
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,100
Yeah, yeah, I know I'm not supposed to go
to parties but I went to one

939
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,000
because I thought
if I could go to one party,

940
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,500
face my demons once and for all,

941
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,700
then I would prove to myself

942
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,200
that I was worthy of serving the Lord.

943
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,300
And it was going really well.
It was going very well.

944
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,000
I was kicking ass out there.

945
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,300
I think I even suckered
a couple converts out there.

946
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
It was...

947
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,300
I don't know if they were rich kids.

948
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,900
They were very well dressed.

949
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,300
Father, I... Come on, Father,
listen to me here, okay?

950
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,900
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm...

951
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,500
There's...

952
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,200
There's a lot of weird stuff
going on at this party.

953
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
There's a lot of very weird stuff
going on out there

954
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,200
and I don't think I'm going to make it.

955
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,300
I don't think I'm going to make it.

956
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,000
Father, what I need
is your help right now.

957
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,800
I need you to turn off
the goddamn television

958
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,900
and give me a little help.

959
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,700
My spiritual salvation is on the line.

960
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,700
Hey, Padre.

961
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,800
Father, uh...

962
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,300
I'm going to have to call you back.

963
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,400
I can't believe this is happening.

964
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,000
I don't believe my eyes.

965
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Joey Lawrence came to our party!

966
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,800
- You got it?
- Yeah.

967
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,300
- Excuse us.
- Oh, my God, it's the guy from Blossoml

968
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,000
- Hey, no, no, no. Later. Later?
- Going this way.

969
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Call me.

970
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
Okay, okay.
Guys, guys.

971
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,200
- Call me.
- Okay, later.

972
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,600
We got it.

973
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,000
All right, around the table here.

974
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
- What are you, eating?
- Comfort food.

975
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,800
- Dude, is this party bitchin' or what?
- Shit.

976
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Oh, my God.

977
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,300
Hey.

978
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,800
Is that Joey Lawrence?

979
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,400
Well, we were actually
just heading outside.

980
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,500
I mean, I knew this party was good,

981
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,000
but it just went A-list!

982
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah, that's... It's totally killer.

983
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,600
It's one they'll never forget.

984
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,900
Joey...

985
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,300
can you just, you know...

986
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,800
just give me a little sip
of the whole "whoa" juice?

987
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,300
Joey got a little crazy with the Cuervo.

988
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,300
We're just going to take him by the pool

989
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,500
for some, you know, fresh air.

990
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,100
I'll go with you!

991
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,800
Just let me grab a beer.

992
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh, my God.

993
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,200
Someone drank all our good beer!

994
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Could this night possibly get any worse?

995
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,100
Top shelf!
Top shelf!

996
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,000
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that one had to hurt.

997
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,900
What is the matter with you?

998
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,800
There are two severed heads
in our refrigerator.

999
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,600
Okay, all right.

1000
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,700
There's no reason for hysterics.

1001
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,900
I mean, it's just two more
completely random...

1002
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,200
- Unrelated!
- Accidental deaths.

1003
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,000
What? Accident...
What are you...

1004
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,900
Come on, man!
Shit happens!

1005
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,100
- All the time.
- Wait, wait.

1006
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Two more?

1007
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,400
Okay, um, look.

1008
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,500
We weren't going
to tell you this until after...

1009
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,200
...we got sexed.

1010
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:12,200
But there is something
very strange going on here.

1011
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,900
Eight people died.
Make that nine.

1012
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,200
Joey Lawrence is dead.

1013
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,500
Tonight Hollywood lost one of its treasures.

1014
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,500
Wait, nine people died?

1015
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,900
Here? Tonight?

1016
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,100
Yeah.

1017
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,800
And some thoughtless bastard
clogged our toilet.

1018
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,100
Yeah, but, hey, don't worry, okay?

1019
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,700
Hey, hey, we got it
under control, all right?

1020
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,600
It's just two more, you know,
accidental party deaths.

1021
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,900
What... Accidental deaths?

1022
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,900
These people were murdered!

1023
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,100
- What?
- What?

1024
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,600
We have got squatters inside the wire.

1025
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm calling the cops.

1026
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,200
No, wait, wait!
Just wait, man.

1027
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,200
Are you insane?

1028
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,600
We can't call the cops!

1029
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,000
I mean, okay.

1030
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,700
Uh, murder.

1031
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,300
Yes, it's a big deal,

1032
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,800
but, I mean, if we lose the house,

1033
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,300
you'll totally blow any shot
that you've got with Lucy.

1034
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,100
Okay, maybe I got a little carried away.

1035
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,100
It's understandable.

1036
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,400
I mean, you got
two human heads in the fridge.

1037
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,800
I mean, these people are dead,

1038
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,000
and that's tragic, for sure.

1039
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,000
But there's nothing we can
do about it now, right?

1040
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,100
We will call the cops in the morning,

1041
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,400
after we've got all this place cleaned up.

1042
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,700
But for now, we've got to stop

1043
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,700
these blood-thirsty squatters on our own.

1044
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,500
For all we know,

1045
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,400
they may still be in this house.

1046
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,900
So we've go to be vigilant
and keep our eyes open.

1047
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,500
If we look hard enough,

1048
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,600
we're bound to see someone
who looks suspicious.

1049
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,200
Oh, my God!

1050
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,800
It's the squatter!

1051
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,800
Joe, put that away.

1052
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,800
Now, look, friend.

1053
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,700
We can either do this the easy way

1054
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,500
or we can do this the hard way.

1055
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,000
Tell us what we need to know, wo... man.

1056
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,100
And one more word about
that freakin' hot sauce...

1057
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,500
Tough guy, huh?

1058
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
Boys?

1059
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,400
No.

1060
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,700
Open up. Say "ah. "

1061
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Open up and say...

1062
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,500
I got a good one!

1063
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,500
I love my job.

1064
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,500
Look!

1065
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,100
We know that before we moved in

1066
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,100
you and your friends were living secretly
down in the basement.

1067
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,400
Squatting, if you will.

1068
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,800
But this is our house now.

1069
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,800
So why are you still here?

1070
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,900
- Again!
- Again!

1071
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,700
Hey, look!
It's Delilah and Jez!

1072
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,700
Oh, I think they're going to do that geek.

1073
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,100
They must have used us to get to him!

1074
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,600
It's been Delilah and Jez this whole time.

1075
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
- Why?
- Wait.

1076
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,100
Delilah and Jez are Lucy's best friends.

1077
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
You guys...

1078
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,100
that can only mean one thing!

1079
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,500
Oh, no.

1080
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,400
- Lucy's in danger!
- Exactly!

1081
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,900
I'm going to save her!

1082
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,700
Lucy, I gotta talk to you about something.

1083
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,200
Brody...

1084
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,300
would you wear this for me?

1085
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,700
Absolutely.

1086
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
Just got a little bit
of the goosebumps there.

1087
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,900
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

1088
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,100
Oh, right.

1089
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,000
Lucy, have you ever noticed anything strange

1090
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,400
about your friends Delilah and Jez?

1091
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,800
No. Why do you ask?

1092
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,300
Well, let me first say

1093
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,100
that just because
they're your best friends,

1094
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,100
that doesn't mean I think
you're anything like them.

1095
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,600
I mean, I know that you are good
and kind and innocent.

1096
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,100
Wow, that's really...

1097
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,300
You were saying?

1098
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,400
How do I say this?

1099
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,100
Delilah and Jez... are minion of the devil.

1100
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,700
Oh, my, that's awful.

1101
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,100
Yeah, I know.
But that's not it.

1102
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,300
This house is actually a portal to hell,

1103
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,300
and they're devouring souls
to feed to their master.

1104
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,200
I'd rather devour something else.

1105
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,600
Oh, my God.

1106
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,700
God's not going to help you now, Brody.

1107
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,700
I hope not.

1108
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,800
Wow! You have really sharp nails.

1109
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,100
Lucy, I gotta say,

1110
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,500
there is something about you, you know?

1111
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,800
I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

1112
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,100
You just have this great...

1113
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,800
I don't know, this great spirit
about you, you know?

1114
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,900
You're just really special.

1115
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You've got these horns...

1116
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,500
Horns!

1117
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,500
Wings!

1118
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,200
Oh, my God!

1119
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,500
Brody, come on.

1120
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,000
You got a penis!

1121
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,800
I've got a vagina, too.

1122
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,200
Brody, please.

1123
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,400
You're the devil her... him...

1124
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,900
her... himself!

1125
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,900
You know, I thought I sensed an accent.

1126
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,800
I speak all the languages, baby.

1127
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,300
Delilah and Jez are... are your minion!

1128
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,600
You're the Antichrist.

1129
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,400
And you've been killing
innocent party-goers all night long.

1130
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,000
I had to.

1131
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,700
I mean, that's what I do!

1132
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I'm Satan!

1133
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,700
I lie and screw people over.

1134
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,600
You used me.

1135
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,500
Well, yeah.

1136
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,700
You bitch.

1137
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,200
Brody, why don't you join me?

1138
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:29,000
I'll give you everything you've ever wanted:

1139
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,500
Money, power, eternal life!

1140
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,800
Plus, we can throw a party
like this every night.

1141
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,400
Does sound kinda good, you know?

1142
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,000
Partying every night.

1143
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,000
Wait, what am I talking about?

1144
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,500
You've got a penis!

1145
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,300
Details.

1146
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,900
Guys!

1147
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,800
Guys, what are you doing?

1148
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,300
Hey, boys, wanna party?

1149
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,800
Boys, save yourselves!

1150
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,900
Lucy's the devil!

1151
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,900
I don't even care.

1152
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,100
Let me offer some words of persuasion.

1153
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,700
She has a penis.

1154
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,600
Holy camel foot!

1155
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah.

1156
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,400
- Deal-breaker!
- Hey, move it!

1157
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
What are we going to do?

1158
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,300
He had a penis!

1159
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,500
Brody, what are you... Focus!

1160
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,800
My nana warned me about
these creepy L.A. People!

1161
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,000
There's got to be somebody here

1162
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,100
that knows how to battle the powers of evil.

1163
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,100
I am a golden god...

1164
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,800
Flying squirrel!

1165
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,300
- Backwater!
- Oh, my God!

1166
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,600
We should never have dared him!

1167
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,200
Oh, Preston, baby.

1168
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,600
That was awesome.

1169
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,500
Catholic school girls are evil.

1170
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,000
Get Backwater inside and sober him up.

1171
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,700
I'm going to save some lives.

1172
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,000
It's an emergency, man.

1173
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,700
Hello again.

1174
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,600
Look, I need everyone here
to listen to me very, very carefully.

1175
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,900
But whatever you do,
please do not panic.

1176
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,200
Everybody here is in danger
of being brutally murdered

1177
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,900
and sacrificed to the devil.

1178
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,400
So, if you would, please just move
single file to the door,

1179
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,200
and we'll look forward
to seeing you next time.

1180
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,700
Show us your tits!

1181
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,900
Hell, no, we won't go.

1182
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,500
Everybody, run!

1183
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,700
Run!
Everybody out!

1184
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,300
Last chance.

1185
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,400
Come on, man!
You gotta wake up!

1186
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,800
- Come on, bro.
- You're our only hope!

1187
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,900
Come on, wake up!
Wake up!

1188
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
- How's it coming?
- I don't know!

1189
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,400
Maybe we need some more coffee!

1190
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,800
I'm on it.
I'm on it!

1191
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Back up, hot little thing.

1192
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,000
Was that decaf?

1193
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,500
Oh. My bad.

1194
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,100
- That one's on me.
- Yeah.

1195
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,700
Come on, boy!
Ride 'em, boy!

1196
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,900
It's Backwater's Bible.

1197
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,800
This thing is, like,
the official textbook for fighting evil!

1198
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,200
Ballsy, you are brilliant!

1199
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,700
Who's my dog?

1200
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,300
I think I found it: The Book of Psalms.

1201
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,900
"And he who praises the Lord
through the glory of song

1202
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,200
shall be saved and fear no evil. "

1203
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,300
Come on, you guys, put it together.

1204
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:57,300
We will sing a holy song
to defeat those evil... hot...

1205
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,400
evil bitches!

1206
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,100
Yes. Yes!

1207
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,200
Hey! They're singing a holy song
to defeat us hot, evil bitches!

1208
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,500
Child?

1209
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,900
I don't know the song.

1210
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,400
Get him!

1211
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
Can I get you ladies a beverage?

1212
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,200
Hey, fatty!

1213
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,400
Keep it.
Keep it.

1214
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
No, please!

1215
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
Not really thirsty or...

1216
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,900
Holy shit.

1217
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,800
Sing it one time!

1218
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,100
Come on!

1219
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,500
Sing it with me, children!

1220
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,600
They're bonding together.

1221
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:15,400
And the show has unity
and human kindness.

1222
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,200
Send these Satanic bitches
into their soul hole.

1223
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,300
And now we're going to send
you evil hos back to hell!

1224
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,900
That's hot!
That's hot!

1225
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,100
Come on!

1226
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,900
Oh, yeah, bitch.

1227
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,900
Your soul is mine.

1228
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,600
My balls.

1229
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,000
And vagina.

1230
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,300
Please, don't destroy me.

1231
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,800
Do me.

1232
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,300
Don't do it, Brody!

1233
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,200
She is still pretty hot.

1234
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,400
Whoa, your head, bro!

1235
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,000
Awesome, dude.

1236
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:23,200
That was one killer party, dude.

1237
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:27,000
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1238
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
I knew you were a dirty boy.

1239
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,600
Come on, girls.

1240
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,500
Let's leave this whack devil house.

1241
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,700
This ain't even evil.
You want to see evil?

1242
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,200
- Yeah, baby, show me evil.
- I'll show you evil.

1243
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,400
Wait till we get to my mom's house.

1244
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,200
Yeah, you can't handle my evil lovin'.

1245
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,600
You'd be like,
"Oh, MC Baby Chuggy-Thug,

1246
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,900
your lovin' is too much for me!"

1247
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,300
Then I'll get on the microphone

1248
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,400
and rap to you so pimpaliciously,

1249
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,900
you'll have an eargasm for a millennia.

1250
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,900
Then we're going to hop onto my private jet

1251
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,800
and we going to Rome for some biscotti

1252
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,700
and some espresso, bitches!

1253
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,900
Let's go! Give me some room.
Give me some room.

1254
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,400
Check it out.

1255
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
We got you a little something.

1256
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,700
El Diablol

1257
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,100
Now we can use that spice up
our mother's marinara.

1258
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,300
Then we'll do a little fiesta,

1259
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,500
and afterwards, we clean you up,

1260
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,100
you'll look like Antonio Banderas.

1261
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,500
Hasta la vista, boys.

1262
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,600
Ciao.

1263
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,300
Backwater, we know we let you down.

1264
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,600
Yeah. Sorry, man.

1265
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:06,100
I know your spiritual
salvation was on the line.

1266
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,600
You going to be okay?

1267
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I think I'll be fine.

1268
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,400
- Yeah.
- Hot party, boys.

1269
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,700
We'll see you next time.

1270
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,300
Well, that's it.

1271
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,700
All the stiffs have come back to life

1272
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,600
and everybody's going home.

1273
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,600
Yeah.

1274
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,700
Including us.

1275
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,600
My dad's balls are enormous.

1276
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,000
They're like cantaloupes in a tube sock.

1277
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,900
Fuck!

1278
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,600
Where your house go?

1279
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,600
Winnie?

1280
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,400
What are you doing here?

1281
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,800
I come to see how
you like your new pad.

1282
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,300
Where it go?

1283
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,000
Well...

1284
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,500
we're not really sure.

1285
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,200
No problem.

1286
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,300
I like you boys, especially you, Softie.

1287
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,500
Winnie help you find you a new pad.

1288
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,000
You just invite Winnie
to the housewarming party.

1289
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,100
Of course!

1290
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,600
Yeah! Consider yourself officially invited!

1291
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,600
Yeah, you can come
to all of our parties!

1292
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,100
Come on, boys!
Winnie buy you breakfast.

1293
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,800
You're so cute.
Shotgun.

1294
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,300
Hello, Softie.
How are you?

1295
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,300
Hey, where've you been, buddy?

1296
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,100
Ballsy, come on.
Let's go!

1297
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,200
This nice lady,

1298
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,700
she's going to buy us a new house.

1299
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,500
And she's going to take us to breakfast.

1300
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,600
Sausage links!

1301
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,500
Buckle up, boys.

1302
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,400
- So, you're familiar with Tobey Maguire, right?
- Right.

1303
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,600
You know the movies he was in,

1304
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,800
like Spider-Man,
Seabiscuit, stuff like that?

1305
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,200
- Whatever, yeah.
- All right, so look.

1306
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,700
He's not really cool
with meeting new people.

1307
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,500
So when you meet him,
just talk about his movies.

1308
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,300
Talk about his movies,
but not the movies

1309
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,200
that no one saw,
like Pleasantville and stuff.

1310
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,300
- All right?
- Yeah.

1311
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,200
Oh, and, um, don't make
direct eye-contact

1312
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,500
because he doesn't like
to meet anybody for the first time

1313
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,800
and look him directly in the eye...

1314
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,100
- Right, and that's...
- What?

1315
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,700
- I mean, how's that possible?
- What are you talking about?

1316
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,700
- Man, look at... Just go.
- I'm sorry. Shit, my bad.

1317
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,100
It's going to be cool
because he doesn't like

1318
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,800
anybody taller than him,
so you're going to be perfect.

1319
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,800
- That's perfect.
- Yeah.
