00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,735
Can't we just get past this whole
horny, teenage boy archetype.

177
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,654
Quite frankly, the idea that it's gay
to think of sex

178
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,699
as something that's meaningful and special
is offensive.

179
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,577
That's the gayest sentence
anyone's ever said, dude.

180
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,246
Okay, so what is it?

181
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
Am I gay, or did my dick fall off?

182
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,374
Your dick fell off.

183
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,210
Good luck being gay with no dick.

184
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,427
[clears throat]

185
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,347
- May I help you?
- What was that?

186
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,225
What? I was just answering
Dell's question.

187
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,061
No, you weren't.
You totally threw me under the bus.

188
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,732
And not like any bus, like a giant,
hulking tour bus for Beyoncé.

189
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,234
- Don't be dramatic.
- I'm not.

190
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,529
But you made me seem
like a prudish, sexophobic freak.

191
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,280
Well, isn't that kind of true?

192
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,491
No.

193
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,492
What?

194
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,078
That is so not true.

195
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,831
- I never wanted to wait until marriage.
- Shh. Okay.

196
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,625
- Not that specifically.
- Well, then what specifically?

197
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:27,919
Okay.

198
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,341
Why is it every time we're,
you know, like, going at it,

199
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,802
you always put the brakes on
at a certain point?

200
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,595
Well... I don't know.

201
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,932
I just... We've never really talked
about going past that point.

202
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,395
- Maybe we should just go for it.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,646
You know, I mean...

204
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,567
- I'd like to.
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

205
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,235
Okay, so when?

206
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,452
Let's get a hotel room.

207
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,912
- What?
- Let's do it.

208
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,664
Let's get a hotel room next week.

209
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,082
Deal?

210
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,961
Okay, I don't think
you're supposed to shake on this.

211
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,171
- Okay. Deal.
- Okay.

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,133
I'm gonna sex you so good
you wont know what time it is.

213
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,342
Wow.

214
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,344
- I like that.
- Yeah?

215
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,431
I'm gonna sex you like a tornado on fire.

216
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,599
Nice.

217
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm gonna sex you
like a gorilla would sex his...

218
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,313
fuzzy, furry gorilla...

219
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,065
life mate.

220
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,776
- You should workshop that one.
- Yeah, it's not as good.

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987
[bell rings]

222
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,323
The Golgi apparatus is responsible

223
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,658
for the manufacturing and shipping

224
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,744
of the molecules produced by,

225
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,832
and synthesized in,
the endoplasmic reticulum.

226
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,543
But the most amazing thing
about all of this...

227
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,046
is Alex Truelove
is going to have sex next week.

228
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,714
What?

229
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,132
Hot...

230
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,091
sweaty...

231
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,219
ass-slapping intercourse...

232
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,554
of a sexual kind.

233
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,141
Just try not to fuck it up.

234
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,726
[gulps]

235
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,936
Okay, yeah.

236
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,145
[bell rings]

237
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,190
Okay, read pages 121 through 140

238
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,524
for tomorrow, guys.

239
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,651
- Okay?
- [student] Okay.

240
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,568
Okay?

241
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,490
I found my dick.

242
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,908
I'll be the judge of that.

243
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,119
Not that it's any of your business,
but Claire and I talked

244
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,497
and we're planning
a little date next week.

245
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,374
A consummation, if you will.

246
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,960
"Consummation"? Are you my grandma?

247
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,629
- I need your help.
- It's called "bumping uglies," Alex.

248
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,755
Your sister's help.

249
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,174
Or "vaginal humping"
if you want to get technical.

250
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,259
- Dell!
- What?

251
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,261
I need Hillary to book me a hotel room.

252
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,762
You predator.

253
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,806
You have to be over 18 to book a room.

254
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,516
- So get Josh to do it. He's 18.
- What?

255
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,393
No, no. I want to keep this
under the radar.

256
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,519
Is she still in town?

257
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,813
Oh, she's in town
for the foreseeable future.

258
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,232
Fun fact, she got kicked out
of Northside Community College,

259
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,110
- if you can believe that.
- Okay, will you talk to her, please?

260
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,738
Since it's for a good cause. Yeah! Yeah!

261
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,740
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Oh!

262
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,450
Yeah, congratulations, Truelove.

263
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,035
You will be a man soon.

264
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,912
Well, that makes one of you.

265
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,207
[Alex] <i>Okay, sidebar. Sophie Hicks.</i>

<i>[Alex] Dell has had a mad crush
on Sophie Hicks since elementary school.</i>

271
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,562
<i>In the sixth grade,
he thought it'd be a brilliant move</i>

272
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,316
<i>to take some 11-year old beefcake selfies
and send them to her for Valentine's Day.</i>

273
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,153
<i>Of course, Sophie couldn't keep
a treasure like that to herself,</i>

274
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>and it wasn't long
before the entire sixth grade</i>

275
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,573

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,581
<i>Dell has always been an optimist.</i>

280
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,874
Sophie Hicks.

281
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,125
You know you love me.

282
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,002
Yeah, let me sleep on that one.

283
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,254
Are you inviting me to sleep with you?

284
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,505
[gasps]

285
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,382
Sophie, that's so forward.

286
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,969
In another dimension, Delgado.
Another dimension.

287
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,974
A man can dream.

288
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,646
[Claire] So, I'm thinking
we go full <i>Great Gatsby</i> for prom.

289
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,441
Some hardcore Jay and Daisy action.
What do you think?

290
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,944
Hello?

291
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,821
Condoms.

292
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,323
What?

293
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,702
I don't have any condoms,
so we should stop off at the Rite Aid

294
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,537
before we do the whole hotel thing.

295
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,957
Oh, God, Alex,
please do not freak out about this.

296
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,334
I'm not freaking out.

297
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,086
Yes, you are. I know you.

298
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,130
You will stress out and get all uptight
and scrunch up your face,

299
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,091
just like you are doing right now.

300
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,510
You shouldn't worry so much.

301
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,136
It's not sexy.

302
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,597
[scoffs] Excuse me? I'm plenty sexy.

303
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,061
Wow, what a... what a crazy party.

304
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,480
You're awesome.

305
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,150
Yes.

306
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,738
Has anyone ever told you
that you have beautiful breasts?

307
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,577
So perky and well-proportioned.

308
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,872
You should take off your bra.

309
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,128
Oh, you want me to take off your bra?

310
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,921
Okay.

311
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,758
Oh, nice.

312
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,760
Boobies.

313
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,096
Mmm.

314
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,973
Does that feel good?

315
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,059
Do you like that?

316
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,104
I want to throw caution to the wind

317
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,023
and make sweet love to you.

318
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,568
Long and sensuous.

319
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,196
I want to slide my hard cock

320
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,823
into your wet pussy.

321
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,825
- [Lina] Alex?
- What? What?

322
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,161
Claire's here.

323
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,745
Great.

324
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,707
Who were you talking to?

325
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,292
No one. Myself.

326
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,668
My monkey.

327
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,254
Okay.

328
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,631
[Alex] Hey!

329
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,759
Okay, so Dell does not know
that it's a Drama party.

330
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,219
So don't tell him anything.

331
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,055
What's up? What's going on?

332
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,641
I got in.

333
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,852
To Columbia?

334
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,479
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

335
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,189
Congratulations. Amazing.

336
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,232
You got into Columbia?

337
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,028
Ron, Claire got into Columbia.

338
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,322
- Congrats, Claire.
- Thanks.

339
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,824
So when the hell
are you gonna hear from Columbia?

340
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,911
He's gonna get in. I applied early.
That's the only reason I heard.

341
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,746
You sent in the essay about Scout camp?

342
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,707
Nope, I sent the one
about the autistic kid at the rec center.

343
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,834
Ooh, that's good. Autism is good.
I'm sure you're in.

344
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,712
It's a good thing we have autistic kids
to help us get into college.

345
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,007
Okay, Mr. Sarcasm.
You'll be whistling a different tune

346
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,178
when you and Claire are walking across
the Columbia quad together next fall.

347
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,805
Dad, just don't jinx it, okay?
I'm stressed out enough already.

348
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,683
Okay. Well, we are very proud
of you, Claire.

349
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,977
Oh, thanks.

350
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,271
I can't wait to visit you two on campus.

351
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,232
Shut up, Dell.
I don't even know if I got in.

352
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,485
And Claire, FYI, I will be trying
to hook up with your roommate.

353
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,654
So, let's just try
and get that out in the open

354
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,405
so no one's uncomfortable later.

355
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,740
Okay, duly noted, Dell.

356
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,827
<i>Willkommen!</i>

357
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,789
Wait, is this a Drama party?

358
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,541
- Hey.
- Hi.

359
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,835
Here. You're welcome too, my boy.

360
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,760
Hi!

361
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,428
You were so good!

362
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,724
You're killing me. You're so good.

363
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,152
You sure you don't want
anything stronger to drink?

364
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,113
We're completely surrounded by Drama kids.

365
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,199
This is Amaro,
the Italian digestif, my friend.

366
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,578
- What do you have against Drama kids?
- They only have shit like "Amaro"

367
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,745
to drink at a party.

368
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,747
Trust me, it's strong.
That's why I'm sipping it.

369
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,458
One day, Truelove,
I'm gonna get you freakin' hammered

370
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,876
on good old-fashioned beer,

371
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,879
and then you'll realize that cutting loose
is actually fun.

372
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,758
Acting dumb and puking your guts out
sure sounds like a lot of fun to me.

373
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't knock it till you tried it.

374
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,181
Greetings, Buchanan Drama geeks.

375
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,933
This party is about to begin.

376
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,560
Please tell me you brought me beer.

377
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,478
Beer?

378
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,065
Where we're going, we don't need beer.

379
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
[Blake] It's a frog.

380
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,946
[Josh] It's the Guyana banana leaf toad.

381
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,906
Wait. That's an extremely rare species.

382
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,618
Hell yeah. Do you know how hard it was
to get one over the internet?

383
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,954
You smuggled an illegal exotic animal
into the country?

384
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,334
Illegal, exotic,
and highly psychoactive, baby.

385
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,793
[laughter]

386
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,088
I owe you and Claire a huge thank you
for your weird-ass videos.

387
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,425
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know
that this guy exists.

388
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,926
[frog croaks]

389
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,844
So...

390
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,013
Who's first?

391
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,141
No.

392
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,435
No way, we're not licking this frog.

393
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,395
Oh, we are so licking this frog.

394
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,774
Dell, wait, that is dangerous,
and toxic, and...

395
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,610
And delicious.

396
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,446
All right, I can't watch this.
I gotta go pee.

397
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,198
Shit.

398
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,240
What happened?

399
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,744
Uh...

400
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,789
You lost the frog?
You... you dumb shit!

401
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,083
God help us.

402
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,429
Shut the door.

403
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,472
Shut it.

404
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,270
Sorry to be so gruff, but honestly,
I don't want to advertise this

405
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,064
to the entire world, okay?

406
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,273
Yeah, sure, sure.

407
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,027
Come on, join the cool kids.

408
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,737
Hey.

409
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,118
- Do you guys go to Buchanan?
- No.

410
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,204
Actually, I go to Northridge
and I met Sophie at drama camp.

411
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,915
He doesn't even go to high school.

412
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,333
Yeah, I'm a juvenile delinquent.

413
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,127
Really?

414
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,963
No. I graduated last year.

415
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,049
Tragically, she's still got
one more year to endure.

416
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,428
Yeah, that's why I'm getting stoned.

417
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,012
Okay.

418
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,639
Elliot.

419
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,598
Alex.

420
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,058
Gretchen.

421
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,184
Yeah! Hey!

422
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,148
I think we're here to corrupt you, Alex.

423
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,318
He's gone.
He's totally fucking gone, Dell.

424
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,946
Don't yell at me, man.
It was a slippery little shit.

425
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,073
You owe me $1,100 bucks.

426
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,451
I'd be more concerned
about the environmental catastrophe

427
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,744
when that thing breeds.

428
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,746
That's not funny, dude.

429
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,663
Help me look.

430
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,708
Have you looked
next to the singing garden hose?

431
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,044
[yodeling]

432
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,922
What are you talking about?

433
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,843
I, uh... yeah.

434
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,138
[yodeling]

435
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,516
I think I'm going to go inside
and get a drink of water.

436
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,480
What is this weird vendetta that you have
against the cheerleaders at our school?

437
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,609
The cheerleaders at our school
phone it in.

438
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,862
I mean, if they were more
like the competition cheerleaders

439
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,656
that actually did gymnastics
and had real skills

440
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,700
and smiled so wide
that they looked psychotic,

441
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,285
I'd totally be into it.

442
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,205
- Okay, fine, you have a point.
- I definitely have a point.

443
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,457
Every time we have an argument, I'm right.

444
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,293
So the sooner you accept that,
the better our relationship will be.

445
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,086
- Okay. Kiss and make up.
- Yeah.

446
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,298
Aww, you guys are the cutest couple.

447
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,966
Mmm, I think so.

448
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,136
If only Elliot were straight.

449
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,222
- Shut up.
- Or bi...

450
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,431
Or poly.

451
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,308
Then at least I'd have a chance.

452
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,185
What's "poly"?

453
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,939
It's some new thing kids at our school
are experimenting with.

454
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,856
Polyamory.

455
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,484
Everyone except this one.

456
00:21:58,943 --> 00:21:59,819
But, alas...

457
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,867
Sorry, wrong room.

458
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,910
Don't be silly.

459
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,538
- Come join us, kind knave.
- No, no, really, I...

460
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,040
Oh, hush. Oh, hush, hush, hush, hush.

461
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,501
We're gonna play Sound Ball.

462
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,378
Sweet, gentle Jesus.

463
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,631
You guys live together?

464
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,594
Uh, yeah, my dad sort of flipped
about the whole gay thing, so...

465
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,221
Oh, shit.

466
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,933
Oh, yeah, I mean, it wasn't a surprise.
He's kind of a redneck.

467
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,561
Plus, I posted a coming out video
on YouTube,

468
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,355
which did not help my case.

469
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,482
Did he kick you out?

470
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,571
It was a mutual decision.

471
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,034
Besides, I graduated, so...

472
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,453
Time for me to spread my wings, right?

473
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:57,334
And lucky for me, Gretchen has, like,
the coolest parents known to man.

474
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,380
Elliot can cook,
so we're totally keeping him.

475
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,675
And last week, he made this...

476
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,094
kick-ass <i>osso buco.</i>

477
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,641
I'm not even sure I know what that is.

478
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,519
It's really fucking good.

479
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,439
[sounds of gibberish]

480
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,792
Oh. Oh, God, no. Please, no.

481
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,085
No, no.

482
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,637
Remember me, bitch?

483
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,804
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:54,892
[groaning]

485
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,649
God, he's good.

486
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,485
I don't know him. Was he in <i>Pippin?</i>

487
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,367
So, mister fancy class president Alex,

488
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,079
What are your craziest hopes and dreams?

489
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,289
Oh, I don't know how crazy they are.

490
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,333
Go to Columbia next year,

491
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,335
major in Marine Biology,

492
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,046
get married at some point, have kids.

493
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,673
Maybe move out west to...

494
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,424
Seattle, Arizona...

495
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,759
Wow.

496
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,428
You've got the whole thing all mapped out.

497
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,139
Yeah. What can I say? I'm a planner.

498
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,527
[breathing heavily]

499
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,737
Alex.

500
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,451
[exhales]

501
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,497
[moans]

502
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,040
Worms.

503
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,085
Eat us.

504
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,337
Eat us.

505
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,841
Delicious worms.

506
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,858
[Alex] <i>National Geographic </i>photographer.

507
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,234
Hm?

508
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,194
Crazy hopes and dreams.

509
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,112
I guess.

510
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,407
I tell people marine biologist because...

511
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,284
because it sounds lucrative, but...

512
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,328
really, I just want to take pictures
of animals.

513
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,497
It's pretty nerdy, I guess.

514
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,666
- Okay, what's your favorite animal?
- Proboscis monkey.

515
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,835
- They live in the mango groves of Borneo.
- Wow.

516
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,003
- Yep.
- That's intense.

517
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,630
- Yes. Sorry, I'm a little obsessed.
- That's okay.

518
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,258
I like a guy with strong opinions.

519
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,013
Yeah.

520
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,856
There you are!

521
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,526
You little stoner.

522
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,653
Guys, meet my friend, Claire.

523
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,863
Friend?

524
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,156
Unh-unh.

525
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,034
I am his lover.

526
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,161
We do dirty things together.

I'm glad Gretchen bailed on you tonight.

It was fun.

Actually, I have a confession.

00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,014
Gretchen was never coming. I said that
'cause I didn't want it to sound weird

- That thing has a cock nose.
- What? No. That's ridiculous.

what does that say about you?

Nothing.

- terrified of the whole thing.

- Yeah, but do you want to rock her body?
- Yes. I would like to.

672
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,416
I would very much like to rock her body.

673
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,543

no girls in high school are virgins?

680

No. I'm saying that girls know their shit.

681

You know, they have websites
dedicated to their vaginas.

682
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,441
They Snapchat their bazongas
with their friends.

683

Bazongas?

684
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,653

with their boyfriends,

685

and then post them online.

686
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,822

that I'm not gonna measure up.

about that stuff.

all the time.

as her last boyfriend?

- Clitoris.

The clitoris. Yes.
See, I can't remember the name of it.

not an expert on this, um,

697
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,098
but I've found that...

698
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,809
when you are in the moment,

699
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,603
things just fall into place,

700
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,939

00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,529
Yeah, I've heard that before.

703
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,576
So, wait, you've slept with girls?

704
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,912
I tried. It never really worked out.

705
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,833
Right. But you said everything
just fell into place.

706
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,461
Yeah, with guys.
I mean, that's how I knew I was gay.

707
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,379
Right.

708
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,382
Right. But how did you... how did you,
like, know you were gay,

709
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,259
and not bi or something like that?

710
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,761
How do you know you're straight?

711
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,681
I don't know. I guess I just knew.

712
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,474
I guess.

713
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,018
You guess?

714
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,438
Yeah. I don't know.

715
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,397
You're a dork.

716
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,107
- I'm not a dork.
- Yes, you are.

717
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,986
- A dork is what you call a whale's penis.
- [laughs]

718
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,487
That's the term for it.

719
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,531
And the shitty thing is,

720
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,826
guys like my dad,
they're giving Jesus a bad name, okay?

721
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,371
Because from all that I know,
Jesus was amazing.

722
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,458
I mean, I don't know,
he helped out the poor and sick, okay,

723
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,126
he loves you unconditionally...

724
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:33,131
I just think all those kids
with their WWJD wristbands

725
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,343
need to ask themselves,
"What would Jesus actually do?"

726
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,137
Call me a "faggot loser"?

727
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,890
Did your dad call you that?

728
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,061
It's not really worth getting into.

729
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,360
What I don't get is...

730
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,987
how do you know
if you're like a good person?

731
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,407
I feel like if you're asking yourself
that question,

732
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,034
you're probably a good person.

733
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,328
At least you're trying.

734
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,333
You're a smart kid, Alex.

735
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,251
Mm-hmm. 3.94 GPA.

736
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,336
[laughs]

737
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,338
I don't mean like that, you nerd.

738
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,673
I mean, like...

739
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,758
that you're insightful.

740
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,718
I don't know.

741
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,179
Most of the time
I just feel like I'm confused.

742
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,725
Maybe you think I'm insightful
because you're special.

743
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,772
- Special Ed
- Rude.

744
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,816
Ooh, cat-like reflexes.

745
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,275
- That was good.
- Oh!

747
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,861
You're strong.

748
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,991
All right, you win, you win.

749
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,416
Well, um...

750
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,087
I guess, like, I should be...

751
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,631
"on the road," as they say.

752
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,800

753
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,927
Yeah, Willie Nelson.

[Alex] Wow. That would be...

772
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,909
- That would be Claire.
- I thought so.

773
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,119
- She just came out of your house.
- Gee. This is...

774
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,204
This is...

775
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,456
It was a pleasure hanging out with you.

776
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,209
Yes. Nice doing business with you.

782
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,309
Jesus, how long you been out here?

783
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,352
Not long.

784
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,814
- Did you guys have fun?
- Uh, yeah, it was fine.

785
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,273
You were gone a long time.

786
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,274
Uh...

787
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,777
- Yeah, we got some food after the show.
- How romantic.

788
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,446
- Not really.
- Did you guys make out?

789
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,698
What? No?
Why would you say that?

790
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,450
Calm down, I was joking.

791
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,036
I like you. I like girls.

792
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,747
I want to sleep with girls,
you in particular.

793
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:53,706
That's a relief.

794
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,458
Geez, I can't wait to sleep with you.

795
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,544
What is your problem?

796
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,672
Nothing, but it's midnight and you show up
here like this crazy stalker person.

797
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,923
Excuse me?

798
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,675
I can't have one night to myself?

799
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,593
Okay.

800
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,887
I don't know what your deal is,

801
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,598
but you're acting like an asshole,
so I'm gonna go.

802
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,519
- Claire...
- And just for the record,

803
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,437
I was with my mom at the hospital tonight.

804
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,731
She's okay, but I got really depressed
hanging out there,

805
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,108
so I thought I'd come here.

806
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,150
Big mistake.

807
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,902
Claire...

808
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,321
You know, it's not always about you, Alex.

809
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,157
Claire.

810
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,496
Okay...

811
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,006
Hi, interweb.

812
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,384
No new episodes
of<i> Savage Kingdom High</i> today.

813
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,011
In fact...

814
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,346
I'm alone, because...

815
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,183
frankly, my counterpart
is on my shit list.

816
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,230
Can someone please explain
modern high school boys to me?

817
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,773
They are so...

818
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,317
oversensitive,

819
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,445
and high-strung, and selfish,

820
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,030
and just like rude.

821
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:12,076
My mom made me watch this old movie
the other day, <i>Sixteen Candles,</i>

822
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,705
and in it, the main girl
is in love with a senior, Jake.

823
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,374
And Jake is hot. Like hot, hot.

824
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,711
And he's kind of a tool, but he's...

825
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,047
sweet and dumb,

826
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,174
and I'm like, "Yes, that is what I want.

827
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,383
I want a Jake."

828
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,510
I mean, Alex is...

829
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,222
straight A's, class president,
pretty decent dresser,

830
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,016
like perfect boyfriend on paper,

831
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,393
but he is more high-maintenance

832
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,854
than all of my girlfriends put together.

833
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,731
And it's not like he...

834
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,690
Oh my God, Mom.

835
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,651
Sorry, I just...

836
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,074
I may not be the best person
for relationship advice.

837
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,409
Clearly, your father would agree.

838
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,578
But my sense is

839
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,666
that Alex is a pretty decent guy.

840
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,210
It's just, sometimes he acts like...

841
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
he's stuck in a marriage.

842
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,338
You know?

843
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,466
Like I'm constricting him,

844
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,552
and all he wants to do is hang out
with his dumbass friends.

845
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,806
Sounds like a teenage boy to me.

846
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,849
Teenage boys suck.

847
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,101
That they do.

848
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:22,271
But so do college boys
and middle-aged men.

849
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,274
Old guys are okay, I guess,
except for the...

850
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,276
cranky, racist ones.

851
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
[sighs] Maybe I should become a lesbian.

852
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,242
Believe me, I've thought about it.

853
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,619
So, what do I do?

854
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:41,541
Just forgive Alex for being a dick
and move on?

855
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,209
Or you could stay mad.

856
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,463
But what I do know is...

857
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,967
we're not gonna be on this earth forever.

858
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,844
And...

859
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,349
being angry is an exhausting way
to spend your day.

860
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,645
I love you.

861
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,647
I love you, too.

862
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,194
Oh, I heard what you were saying

863
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,572
about Jake in <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

864
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,199
You'd be bored with a Jake.

865
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,868
You're too smart.

866
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,606
Whoa.

867
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,775
Okay.

868
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,074
[sighs]

869
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,243
Gay Flakes.

870
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,540
Heter O's. Gay Flakes.

871
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:22,642
Bi.

872
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,020
I'm bisexual.

873
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,774
- Say what?
- I'm bisexual. I think I'm bisexual.

874
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,317
- No, you're not.
- What?

875
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,152
You're panicking, dude.

876
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,779
You're wigging out about the hotel,

877
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,073
and you're trying to come up
with an excuse to cancel it.

878
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,784
No, I'm just taking advantage
of all the options available.

879
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,410

887

- Hm.

905

- I'm not into slurping on nutsack.
- Right.

906
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,513
You know why?
Because nutsacks aren't sexy.

907

Look, it's a confusing time, man.

908
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,227
I mean, everywhere you look,
someone's omnisexual, or...

909
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,104
polyamorous, or gender queer,

910
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,190

Hey, Sidney.

I'm attracted to the person.

01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,810
Come on. Don't play dumb, dude.

1232
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,939
I think we broke up, actually, so...

1233
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,359
- Whoa.
- I'm fucking over it, Dell.

1234
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,277
The whole thing.

1235
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,739
Fuck sex, fuck love, fuck it all.

1236
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,032
I'm... I'm out.

1237
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,954
[man] <i>Lost and separated from the herd,</i>

1238
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,873
<i>it is just a matter of time</i>

1239
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,542
<i>before the baby elephant
dies of starvation.</i>

1240
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,585
[elephant trumpets]

1241
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,588
[knocking]

1242
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:03,965
[screams]

1243
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,093
Whoa, whoa!

1244
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,262
Fuck.

1245
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,057
Dell.

1246
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,061
So, your brilliant plan
was to stage a home invasion,

1247
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,896
with monkey masks,

1248
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,856
kidnap me and take me to a frat party?

1249
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,233
I advised against the monkey masks.

1250
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,860
What? I love the monkey mask.

1251
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,112
I figured a little monkey mask action

1252
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,281
would shake you
out of your funk, Truelove.

1253
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,493
Never thought you'd go all Liam Neeson
and smash my face in.

1254
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,829
Wow, jeez, I guess your foolproof plan
had a flaw in it.

1255
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,247
What else were we supposed to do?

1256
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,291
You never would have come
if we'd just asked you.

1257
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,252
- I'm still not gonna come.
- Goddammit, Alex.

1258
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,922
Let me give it to you straight.

1259
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,884
You are so far up your own ass,
and it's fucking depressing.

1260
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:48,927
Excuse me?

1261
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:53,431
You're coming with us to this party,
which has booze and slutty girls and...

1262
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,267
Booze and slutty girls.

1263
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:59,646
And you're gonna let your little
constipated hair down and enjoy yourself.

1264
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:03,066
In case you forgot, Dell,
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

1265
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,568
Okay? So I'm sorry
if I'm not in the "Let's party" mood,

1266
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,321
and honestly, I'm really, really sick
and tired of this,

1267
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,782
"Let's get you laid, Alex" routine.
I'm not into it.

1268
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,576
Whoa, who said anything
about getting you laid, Truelove?

1269
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,911
Clearly, that's impossible.

1270
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,913
In fact, I never want to hear

1271
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,083
about your flaccid
little micropenis ever again.

1272
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,211
I don't give a shit if you get laid
or if you don't get laid,

1273
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:27,215
or if you're bisexual, asexual, pansexual,
or if you join fucking NAMBLA.

1274
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,217
And as for Claire,

1275
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,677
I'm sorry you broke up.

1276
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,221
But it was kind of inevitable.

1277
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,474
What do you mean?

1278
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,977
Everyone breaks up
when they go to college.

1279
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,104
You guys just got a head start on things.

1280
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,235
Hey...

1281
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,362
I'm sorry to be harsh, dude,

1282
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,322
but... but it's the truth, all right?

1283
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,408
And... and you know what?

1284
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,243
Fuck it.

1285
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,288
Right now, the only thing
we should be giving a shit about

1286
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,542
is like having fun before we all go
off to college and forget...

1287
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,503
that this is actually
a really great time in our lives.

1288
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,591
So, sack up, Truelove,

1289
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,509
and meet us out in the car in three.

1290
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,262
He has a point.

1291
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,597
Right, Josh?

1292
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,223
[elephant trumpets]

1293
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,641
Poor little elephant.

1294
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,396
Fuck this noise.

1295
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,648
We've wasted enough time
on that granny turd.

1296
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,774
[engine turns over]

1297
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,239
I'm in.

1298
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,783
Get in the car before I kick your dick in.

1299
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,831
Now that I'm thinking about it,
Claire has been holding me back.

1300
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,584
I can't be with one girl for the rest
of my senior year.

1301
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,212
I should be playing the field
with the ladies, plural.

1302
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,672
Know what I'm talking about?
Get some notches on the bedpost.

1303
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,632
Bust some nut.

1304
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,051
- Yeah, let out some population paste.
- Yeah.

1305
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,969
Have a cream dream, baby.

1306
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,846
Yeah, get some bitches pregnant.

1307
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,558
- Sorry, I was trying something out.
- It's okay.

1308
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:04,103
Oh, my God,
it's the whole nutsack brigade.

1309
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:07,190
Alex, how was
your little hotel fuck festival?

1310
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,984
- It could not have gone better.
- Actually, Claire and I broke up.

1311
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,819
And now, I'm looking for sluts.

1312
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:12,779
You know of any?

1313
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,614
Do I look like your regional pimp?

1314
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,241
More like an employee.

1315
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,618
Delbert, I'm choking on the vomit
of your hilarity.

1316
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,496
- Oh, they have clinics for that, actually.
- Will you guys get a room?

1317
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,455
[both moan in disgust]

1318
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,123
Now I'm choking on vomit.

1319
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,375
[moans in disgust]

1320
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,092
[exhales]

1321
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,010
Let's party!

1322
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,137
Oh, yeah!

1323
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,014
Come, on baby, come on.

1324
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,891
[hip hop music plays]

1325
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,060
[cheering]

1326
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,823
[screams]

1327
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,032
Yeah!

1328
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,650
You're sexy.

1329
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,027
You are sexy.

1330
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,321
You're a sexy little sex kitten.

1331
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,115
What are you, like, 12?

1332
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,910
No, I am of the legal sex age
in the state.

1333
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,495
I looked it up.

1334
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,122
Oh, yeah?

1335
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,123
Yeah.

1336
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,377
You want to see what's upstairs?

1337
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,462
Fuck yeah.

1338
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:08,561
Frankly, I don't even know why
we bother with high school boys.

1339
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,564
I, personally, haven't touched one
since freshman year.

1340
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:16,069
I mean, sure, Alex is maybe smarter
than the average boy,

1341
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,071
but he's still just as useless.

1342
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,364
I don't get it.

1343
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,617
I mean, Alex has always been
weird and shy about sex,

1344
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,287
but I never got any sense
that he was interested in anyone else.

1345
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,956
Well, something's definitely going on.

1346
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,251
We could stalk him.

1347
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,259
No question, dolphin. I'd fuck a dolphin.

1348
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:41,719
I'd fuck a unicorn.

1349
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,388
No way, it can't be imaginary.

1350
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,597
- Why not?
- Why not?

1351
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,266
Because then I'd fuck Arwen
from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1352
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,893
Dude, Arwen's an elf, not an animal.

1353
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,603
Yeah, you fucking idiot.

1354
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,189
I thought you guys
were gonna try to meet girls.

1355
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,402
- We are.
- It's fine, we are.

1356
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,529
Yeah, we're just pumping each other up.

1357
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,030
You're killing it.

1358
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,449
- We met so many girls before this.
- [cell phone rings]

1359
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,201
There were a bunch of them here...

1360
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,244
Holy shit.

1361
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,749
Miss Sophie Hicks.

1362
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,586
I'd fuck a cute little
fucking furry panda bear.

1363
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,428
I can't wait either.

1364
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,097
I feel like
we really haven't talked in ages.

1365
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:27,932
See you soon, Delbert.

1366
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,520
They're at a frat party on Mickley Avenue.

1367
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:33,938
Done.

1368
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,780
You're... you're sexy.

1369
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,615
I like touching your face.

1370
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,533
What?

1371
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,451
Nothing.

1372
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,786
Can you take your shirt off, please?

1373
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,746
Okay.

1374
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,415
Whoa! Look at those honkers.

1375
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,541
- Honkers?
- Yeah.

1376
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,044
Or what, do you prefer "hooters"
or just good old-fashioned "tits"?

1377
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,421
[laughs] You're funny.

1378
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,798
You are chewing gum.

1379
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,883
Yeah. You want some?

1380
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:02,842
I'm okay.

1381
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,719
Okay! [laughs]

1382
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,513
It's lost it's flavor a little bit,
but that's okay.

1383
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,765
I want you to fuck me.

1384
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,017
Can do.

1385
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,477
Oh, yeah? Do you have a condom?

1386
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,437
Yeah, I do. Yeah, in my pants.

1387
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,773
- Get it.
- Okay, yeah. Sure.

1388
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,281
[Alex] <i>Don't overthink this.
Would Dell overthink this?</i>

1389
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,533
<i>No, Dell would say...</i>

1390
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,076
Slurp my nutsack.

1391
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,077
Shut up, Dell.

1392
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,121
- Huh?
- Nothing. Found it.

1393
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,665
She'd better be hot

1394
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,793
She'd better be
the Mother of fucking Dragons.

1395
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,878
Claire, this is Alex we're talking about.

1396
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,380
He and Dell are probably standing
by themselves in a corner,

1397
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:44,884
talking about which <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
character they'd want to have sex with.

1398
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,640
So, I'm all, "Fine, bitch,
go and fuck any dude here.

1399
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,517
I don't give a shit."

1400
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,894
And she's all, "Fuck you, I'm going home."

1401
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,854
And I'm all, "Adios, slut."

1402
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,690
You know what, bro?

1403
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,776
I really do love her.

1404
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,611
Hey, Dell.

1405
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,321
Sophie.

1406
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,198
Wow, you made it.

1407
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,449
Wow.

1408
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,492
Hi.

1409
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,869
Oh, Claire Bear. Hey.

1410
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,539
Sophie told me
this is where the action is tonight.

1411
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,791
Funny, did she?

1412
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,086
Sophie did not mention you'd be coming.

1413
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:21,921
Where's Alex?

1414
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,715
Man, that's a...
that's a really good question.

1415
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,133
I don't really...

1416
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:29,929
No, Claire, I've got to tell you,
I think he's really drunk...

1417
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,266
I should go help her look.

1418
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,851
See you, Dell.

1419
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,185
Yeah.

1420
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:37,687
Right. See you.

1421
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,941
- Oh, fuck me, baby.
- I know.

1422
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,026
- Oh, fuck me hard.
- I know, I'm trying.

1423
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,070
- Fuck me!
- Okay, here I go.

1424
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,029
Hang on a sec.

1425
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,073
[breathing heavily]

1426
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,826
Oh, come on, mister class president.

1427
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,077
Just a sec. I'm trying.

1428
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,707
- Maybe you're getting shy?
- No.

1429
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,792
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1430
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,502
You are a hot, sexy chick,

1431
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:05,339
and I'm gonna ejaculate my erect penis
inside your wet vagina if it kills me.

1432
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,716
- Excuse me?
- Okay, here we go.

1433
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,593
Come on, little penis.
Get in there.

1434
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,011
- Hey!
- Come on, little guy.

1435
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,597
Jesus, get off me, you creepy weirdo!

1436
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,348
[door opens]

1437
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,226
Alex?

1438
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:18,811
Claire.

1439
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,063
[Sierra] Ever heard of knocking, bitch?

1440
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,566
Shut the door, this isn't a fucking show.

1441
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,528
Claire, wait!

1442
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:30,865
Sierra?

1443
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,409
- Dakota?
- You guys know each other?

1444
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,077
You said you were going home.

1445
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,538
Yeah, well, I decided to take
a little detour, fuck stick.

1446
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,124
Well, obviously you guys have
some problems to work out. So...

1447
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,793
- What'd you do to my girl, piece of shit?
- Not much.

1448
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,338
Yeah, she's right,
I could barely get it up, so no big deal.

1449
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:47,340
Wait, I'm naked!

1450
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:48,758
[screams]

1451
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,468
[groans]

1452
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,386
Hey, guys.

1453
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,389
- [Dakota] Get out of my way.
- [Sierra] Dakota, stop!

1454
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,517
[Dell] Hey, douchebag.

1455
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,647
You want him,
you've got to get through me first.

1456
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,028
[grunts]

1457
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,910
I'm sorry, Dell. Thank you so much.

1458
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,752
You see them jump, babe?

1459
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:25,711
I'm the shit.

1460
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,630
You're so hot, babe.

1461
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,423
No, babe, you're hot as fuck.

1462
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,848
[frog croaks]

1463
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,485
A Guyana banana leaf toad?

1464
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,654
What?

1465
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,739
[Alex] Claire!

1466
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,621
Claire!

1467
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,542
Claire!

1468
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:14,552
Dell?

1469
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:17,930
What happened?

1470
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,349
What do you care?

1471
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,020
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.

1472
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,605
And if I did see Claire,
why would I tell you?

1473
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,692
Dell.

1474
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,652
You're an evil person, Sophie Hicks.

1475
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,571
Evil, evil, evil.

1476
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,531
- Oh, I'm evil?
- Yes.

1477
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,532
Yes.

1478
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:40,077
Because I helped my best friend
find her bastard boyfriend?

1479
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,205
No. No, you're evil
because you tricked me.

1480
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,126
You know
that I've liked you since... forever.

1481
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,298
And I know that I'm just a joke to you,
okay? I'm not an idiot.

1482
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:56,093
Girls like you have this ultimate power
over guys like me.

1483
01:15:57,053 --> 01:16:00,514
But it doesn't give you the right
to fuck with my feelings.

1484
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,018
It's not cool, Sophie.

1485
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,736
- You're right.
- It's not cool.

1486
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,616
- I'm sorry, Dell.
- Not cool.

1487
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,832
Hey, uh...

1488
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,794
I want to show you something.

1489
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,763
Oh, you... you kept those.

1490
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:44,683
Of course I did.

1491
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:48,395
I mean, I think they're
the most adorable thing I've ever seen.

1492
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,526
I could send you updated versions.

1493
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:55,486
Yeah...

1494
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,863
- Let's take it one step at a time.
- Okay.

1495
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,949
- Sound good?
- Sounds good.

1496
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,242
Yeah.

1497
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:10,876
Claire!

1498
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:14,505
[frog continues croaking]

1499
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,676
That's Josh's frog.

1500
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,180
That's Josh's frog.

1501
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,142
Come here. Come here.

1502
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,408
No, no, no, no...

1503
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:43,951
Don't jump.

1504
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,329
No!

1505
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,747
Oh God.

1506
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,083
[sighs]

1507
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,234
Dude. Oh, my God.

1508
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,153
- Alex has a boner.
- Oh, my gosh.

1509
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,364
Why do you have a boner, Alex?

1510
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,491
I, I... No, I don't.

1511
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,742
Are you a fag?

1512
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,619
No, I'm not...

1513
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,621
Alex has a boner. He's a fag.

1514
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,706
[laughing] Oh, my gosh, yeah.

1515
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,500
Where you going, Alex?

1516
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,252
Are you gonna cry?

1517
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,422
Just let me go!

1518
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,175
Oh, he's gonna cry, he's gonna cry.

1519
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,132
[gasping]

1520
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,073
[Claire] Alex?

1521
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,367
Jesus, what happened to you?

1522
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:31,994
Oh, you know.

1523
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,247
Just went for a little swim.

1524
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:36,874
Are you okay?

1525
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:38,876
Yeah.

1526
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,294
Yeah.

1527
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,213
Claire...

1528
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:47,343
I'm gay.

1529
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,180
What?

1530
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:52,931
I'm gay.

1531
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,017
You called it.

1532
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:57,811
I'm gay.

1533
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,193
I'm sorry.

1534
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,614
I'm really sorry.

1535
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,320
Claire.

1536
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,990
Are you okay?

1537
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,926
Hey, honey.

1538
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,386
Did you have fun?

1539
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,640
Sweetie?

1540
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:20,811
- [cries]
- Oh.

1541
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,319
I got you.

1542
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,157
Let it out.

1543
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,533
- [crying]
- Oh.

1544
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:24,416
So...

1545
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,131
The person you like...

1546
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,177
It's a boy?

1547
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:42,226
That kid Elliot?

1548
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,483
And, um...

1549
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:51,610
Did you just...

1550
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,362
figure all this out?

1551
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,991
I guess it's always been there. I just...

1552
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,911
had to be honest with myself.

1553
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,872
I just couldn't ignore it anymore.

1554
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,250
Maybe you're just going through a phase.

1555
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,709
No, I thought of that.

1556
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,421
But, you know,
I thought I'd grow out of it, and...

1557
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,008
thought I'd get over it.

1558
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:19,513
You know...

1559
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,057
I thought I'd meet the right girl.

1560
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,395
But, uh...

1561
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:36,029
You know, I met the right girl.

1562
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:40,701
[Alex sighs]

1563
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:51,628
Alex, don't people know
who they're attracted to?

1564
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,171
I mean...

1565
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,424
isn't it just obvious?

1566
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,301
It's different when...

1567
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:58,594
When you're gay?

1568
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:00,596
No, it isn't.

1569
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,933
My cousin just came out and she's 12.

1570
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,561
What are you so scared of?

1571
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,064
Losing you.

1572
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,288
I love you.

1573
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,084
I'm sorry I was such a shitty boyfriend.

1574
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,252
No.

1575
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,255
No, you're the...

1576
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:38,300
best gay boyfriend a girl could have.

1577
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,593
[both laugh]

1578
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:43,388
