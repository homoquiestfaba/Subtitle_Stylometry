1
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,337
<i>Technically speaking, I'm an alien.</i>

2
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:24,567
<i>And from the perspective
of immigration, an illegal one.</i>

3
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:30,081
<i>My parents met at the university in Saint
Petersburg where he taught astrophysics</i>

4
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,134
<i>and she taught applied mathematics.</i>

5
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:36,071
<i>My mother fell in love with him
when she found him almost frozen to death</i>

6
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:39,991
<i>on the bank of the Neva,
staring at the stars.</i>

7
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,658
[ What on earth are you doing? ]

8
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,761
[ Isn't it marvelous? ]

9
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:49,718
Tonight, the sky is completely
full of miracles.

10
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,240
<i>My mother won't talk much
about that time.</i>

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,491
<i>But my aunt Nino told me
about my father.</i>

12
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,164
Max...

13
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:02,848
<i>His name was Maximilian Jones
and he was the son of an English diplomat</i>

14
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:06,368
<i>who always saw the best in people.</i>

15
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,410
[ My time... ]

16
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,223
<i>I often wonder if what happened
to my mother and father</i>

17
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:15,720
<i>changed me from someone
who might have seen the best in people</i>

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,271
<i>to someone who always expects
the worst.</i>

19
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:21,182
How's my Jupiter?

20
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,064
[ How is my baby? ]

21
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,651
[ We can't name a child
after a planet... ]

22
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,875
Not a planet. The planet.

23
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:34,662
The biggest and most beautiful planet
in our solar system.

24
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,800
She is our Jupiter.

25
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:43,171
Over my dead body
we will name her "Jupiter."

26
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:50,946
Soon you will discover that your mother can
be extraordinarily unreasonable at times.

27
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:57,776
But fortunately for us, she remains
susceptible to your father's particular...

28
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,038
charm.

29
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,929
[ Don't hurt us! ]

30
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:08,819
[ Where is our money, bitch? ]

31
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,119
[ Let's go! ]

32
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:17,105
No, oh, no, oh, no!
No, not the telescope, please!

33
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,740
Don't take the telescope, please!

34
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,235
[ Help! ]

35
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,991
Max! Ma...

36
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,692
[ Don't leave us. ]

37
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:53,525
<i>In her grief, my mother pushed everyone
except her sister out of her life.</i>

38
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,382
<i>Somewhere in the middle
of the Atlantic,</i>

39
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,668
<i>she pushed me out too.</i>

40
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,811
Pusha. Pusha!

41
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:13,462
<i>I was born without a country.
Without a home.</i>

42
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,017
<i>Without a father.</i>

43
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,504
<i>But I was born in the house of Leo...</i>

44
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:30,710
<i>with Jupiter rising at twenty-three
degrees ascendant.</i>

45
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,349
<i>According to my aunt,</i>

46
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,436
<i>this is supposed to mean
that I am destined for great things</i>

47
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:42,474
<i>and that I will find
the one true love of my life.</i>

48
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,763
- Jupiter.
- Coming!

49
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,064
- You finish the bathroom yet?
- Not yet.

50
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,853
- We still have another house tonight.
- I'll be fast.

51
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,480
<i>Problem with astrology?</i>

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,023
<i>Total bullshit.</i>

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,450
What was the name of this planet?

54
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,986
Zalintyre, I think.

55
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,965
Have you ever seen a harvest?

56
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:07,458
Oh, no. Never!

57
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,461
But I've heard they feel no pain.

58
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,081
It's all quite humane,
from what I've been told.

59
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,082
Well, there are marshals
and administrators

60
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,936
to make sure everything's done
according to code, but still...

61
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,655
It can be rather... affecting.

62
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,924
Now you sound like Mother.

63
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,831
Most of them were miserable in their lives
and what we do for them is a mercy.

64
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,800
Balem, thank you for responding.

65
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,187
We were just admiring this ledger
from your latest success.

66
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,672
Well done, brother.

67
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,125
The house of Abrasax
continues to thrive,

68
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:43,277
despite the squandering
of your inheritance, brother.

69
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,997
I must say, you're looking
a little worse for wear.

70
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,883
Could it be success
does not agree with you?

71
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,503
And you look so well.

72
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:54,472
Could it be that failure
agrees with you?

73
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:58,551
You may have inherited Mother's head
for business, but I inherited her heart.

74
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,262
And what does that leave me?

75
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,714
- Her beauty.
- Liar.

76
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:05,945
- Her humor.
- Her unluckiness in love?

77
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,819
Her fetish for wrinkles.

78
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,138
Well, if this is to be another
of your eulogies, Titus,

79
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,607
I have more important matters
to attend.

80
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,976
It was her birthday recently.

81
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:18,246
You know I get sentimental, and I was going
through some of Mother's old sheave-work

82
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:22,307
and I came across a description of a planet
she claimed was the most rare

83
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:26,388
and beautiful estate she ever owned.

84
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:29,875
- I believe she named it...
- Earth.

85
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:34,063
...earth. It was part of your inheritance,
wasn't it, brother?

86
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,485
I was quite moved by her description
and I was wondering

87
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:39,651
if there was any chance
you might be willing to part with it.

88
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:44,539
Titus, didn't you bother
to look at the sheaves?

89
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,392
That planet is worth more
than all of your estates combined.

90
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,594
Really?

91
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:52,025
I had no idea.

92
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,433
- Kalique.
- Balem.

93
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,585
Jupiter, get up!

94
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,119
Get up!

95
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:37,759
Jupiter, make the coffee. Come on.

96
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:38,664
[ Let's go. ]

97
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,366
I hate my life.

98
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,020
[ Come on, girl.
We don't have all day. ]

99
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,711
Jupiter, hurry up!

100
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,930
That one goes next to that one.

101
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,384
Jupiter! Get the garbage after this.

102
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:05,483
- You finish the bathroom?
- No.

103
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,561
Jupiter!

104
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,550
I hate my life.

105
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,588
Damn it.

106
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,375
Told you.

107
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,897
Lycantant.

108
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,282
Another Hunter.

109
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:54,127
And ex-legion. He was a skyjacker.

110
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:57,489
- How do you know that?
- The boots.

111
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,710
There was a Hunter in the legion.
A legend.

112
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,979
Could track a single gene in the gyre.

113
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,159
No matter who or what he is...
he's after our bounty.

114
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,841
That's him. It's got to be.

115
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,043
We should warn Lord Balem.

116
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,131
That is what we should do, but...

117
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,711
Do you trust me?

118
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,407
This matter must be handled
with delicacy, malidictes.

119
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,326
I understand, lady Kalique.

120
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,971
Neither Balem nor Titus
must suspect my involvement.

121
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,631
Of course, Your Majesty.

122
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,386
You believe The Hunters can be trusted?

123
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:03,791
Trust is an illusion, my lady.
I believe only in mutual self-interest.

124
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:07,395
They want another life.
We can offer it.

125
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,180
Make the deal.

126
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,417
Welcome back, Lord Balem.

127
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,952
It has been too long.

128
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,774
I have not crossed the vastness
of space for your pleasantries, Mr. Night.

129
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,979
Of course, My Lord.
We have verified the geneprint.

130
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,497
Most unfortunate news.

131
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,603
I believe Titus is aware
of the recurrence.

132
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,508
My spies whisper
but cannot substantiate.

133
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,261
So you have her print,
but you don't have her?

134
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,512
Mr. Tskalikan.

135
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:52,068
The keepers traced the print
to a medical clinic.

136
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,546
They're eliminating every lead.

137
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:59,607
We have a name. Dunlevy.
Katherine Dunlevy.

138
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,194
Well, I want miss Dunlevy found...

139
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:06,280
and I want her dead.

140
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,852
Black. Classic? A la mode, a la m... No.

141
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,720
Katherine, I'm done.

142
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,276
Jupiter! Help, please?

143
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:19,610
- Wow, what's the occasion?
- Austin Davis is taking me to dinner.

144
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,897
- I think he's gonna ask me to marry him!
- Do you wanna marry him?

145
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:26,567
Jupiter, he's the number eight richest
bachelor under thirty in America.

146
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,436
He speaks fluent Chinese and German,

147
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,572
and he was an alternate
on the olympic curling team.

148
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,909
- Solid résumé.
- Yeah, I mean, it sounds totally...

149
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,226
- ...Cinderella, doesn't it?
- Sure.

150
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,456
Then why do I feel like
I'm about to throw up? Oh, God.

151
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,252
I just don't remember
Cinderella puking.

152
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,138
Kind of remember her dancing
with a bunch of mice.

153
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:53,177
Have you ever...
fallen in love, Jupiter?

154
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:58,450
You know, my mom says that love
is just a fairytale for little girls.

155
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,307
That really, it's all just urges
and obligations.

156
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,466
Wow. That's kind of harsh.

157
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,009
- You want my advice?
- Yes.

158
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,877
If he's really in love with you,

159
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:13,747
then he'll understand
that you're just overwhelmed and...

160
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,249
and you need a little time.

161
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,742
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,587
Okay, what do I wear now?

163
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,208
Something that reminds him
of what he is waiting for.

164
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:27,828
Like that Red McQueen,
or this Little Ricci.

165
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,291
Katherine? Everything all right?

166
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,862
Yeah, no, no. We're good.
I'll be down in a sec.

167
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,998
Picked up a referral. A townhouse.
But it has to be Wednesday.

168
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:24,652
- Wednesday's full. Three houses.
- So do four.

169
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,520
[ We are not your animals... ]

170
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,207
English, please.
We use English in this house.

171
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:32,360
Use whatever you like.
You sound like Stalin to me.

172
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,163
Stalin?! I'm Stalin?
You don't want the money.

173
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:37,598
I will give it to... Gleb's crew.

174
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,500
Good. Thank you.

175
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:43,371
- We'll take it.
- Big surprise.

176
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,906
Hey, cousin, speaking of money,
I was wondering if...

177
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,014
Oh, let me guess. Another advance.

178
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:52,430
For what this time? Shoes? A new phone?

179
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,416
I'll earn it back.

180
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,136
No, you mean you'll waste it
trying to make yourself feel better

181
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,924
by buying something you don't need.

182
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:04,725
So, what, instead of feeling better,
I should save my money and feel worse?

183
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,795
Exactly.
Now, you're a smart girl, Jupiter.

184
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,780
I admit it's none of my business,

185
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,782
but that's probably the reason
you are not married.

186
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,401
Men do not like smart women.

187
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,103
You keep talking about
my daughter like that,

188
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,812
- I will ram that latke so far up your ass,
you won't crap for a week.
- [ You can't talk to my husband like this. ]

189
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,125
[ Vassily is right. ]

190
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,126
English.

191
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,208
[ I've got a latke for you too, bitch. ]

192
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,047
Hey! Hey!

193
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,533
You swore, no fighting at dinner.

194
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:33,133
Jupiter, what is the money for?

195
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:36,577
No, you're right.

196
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:39,559
It's nothing I need.

197
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,624
Hey, what was that about? You're not
having second thoughts, are you?

198
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,059
What if I am?

199
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,895
Jupiter...

200
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:03,893
These people, they're counting on you.

201
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,036
Have you even looked at this thing?

202
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:10,077
Why do they have to use words
like "harvesting"? It's just creepy.

203
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:13,342
Why would you read this?
You heard what the doctor said.

204
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:17,498
It's not a big deal.
You go in, cash comes out.

205
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,687
This money, I'm telling you,
I have real plans, serious plans.

206
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,664
I believe this money's
gonna mean something...

207
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,333
possibly life-changing for both of us.

208
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,341
Okay.

209
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,069
Okay.

210
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,455
- You will not regret this.
- All right.

211
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,973
- I promise. I promise!
- All right, all right.

212
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,493
All right. Oh, wait, I have a question.

213
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,963
Why is it that you get ten grand and
I get five? I mean, they're not your eggs.

214
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:54,852
That's capitalism, babe.
Shit rolls downhill. Profits flow up.

215
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,195
Ms. Dunlevy? Excuse me.

216
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:31,497
You are Katherine Dunlevy, aren't you?

217
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,241
The doctor's ready.

218
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,582
- It's the hormones, dear.
- Don't worry. You'll be fine.

219
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:45,227
Trust me, honey. I could do
this procedure with my eyes closed.

220
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,071
No, no, no, no, no!
Please! Please, I can't!

221
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,423
Just relax.

222
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:02,686
I can't move my arms! What's happening?

223
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:06,070
Get a sample.
Make sure this is the right one.

224
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,226
Wait, wait. Please, please, stop.

225
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:14,882
- It's her.
- Good. Kill her.

226
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,163
Please, somebody...

227
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,770
Oh, my God!

228
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,038
You all right?

229
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:58,793
- Who are you?
- Caine Wise. I'm here to help you.

230
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,540
Pardon me, Lord Titus.

231
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,127
Only good news is allowed
in here, Famulus.

232
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,997
We received an FTL from Mr. Wise.
He says he has the girl.

233
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,149
Brilliant.

234
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,595
Then send the transport immediately.

235
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:44,017
At once, My Lord.

236
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,385
I thought it would make you
feel better when you woke up.

237
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,012
- What?
- The gun.

238
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,618
But it works better if you flip
the switch by your thumb.

239
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,728
Careful. You've been asleep
for almost twelve hours.

240
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,715
- Where am I?
- You're still in Chicago.

241
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:14,051
Okay, good.

242
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,921
My clothes?

243
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,340
You were still in the paper clinic gown.

244
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:23,243
Can't really think about that right now.

245
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:27,631
Look, Jupiter... Is that your name?

246
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:29,948
- How do you know?
- I'm sorry.

247
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,336
I was just trying to figure out
what happened.

248
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,384
You must have used
a false name at the clinic

249
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:37,308
and their tests probably tripped
the monitor to your geneprint.

250
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,489
What are you saying?
I mean, yes, I used a false name, but...

251
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,748
lots of people do that in there. What does
that have to do with what happened to me?

252
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:49,019
Okay. When I was in the legion,
they gave me protocols for this.

253
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:55,591
It can be difficult for Terrsies,
or people from underdeveloped worlds,

254
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:59,496
to hear that their planet is not the only
inhabited planet in the verse.

255
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:03,333
It has to be the anesthesia.
I mean, it's gotta be a dream.

256
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:07,438
Protocol actually says that most Terrsies
will say that this has to be a dream.

257
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:10,624
Yeah, because a dream is the only way
any of this makes sense.

258
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:15,395
Compared to what? The idea
that you're the only intelligent species,

259
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,149
on the only inhabitable planet
in a universe so full of planets

260
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:22,219
that you don't even have a number
to describe how many there are?

261
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,973
- Are you saying you're an alien?
- Genomgineered human.

262
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:29,011
They cut my DNA with the DNA
of something like a wolf.

263
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,879
I'm a Lycantant,
bred for the military, but...

264
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,881
that didn't work out for me.

265
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,995
- And those things at the clinic?
- Keepers.

266
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:40,832
They're from the Diorite system,
but they're genetically repurposed

267
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:44,090
to act as monitors and watchdogs.

268
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,396
And they're trying to kill me?

269
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,232
- Yes.
- Why me?

270
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,820
Please. This has to be a mistake.

271
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:59,016
These people don't make
those kind of mistakes.

272
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:02,876
What if I say no? What if...
I don't go with you? What if I go home?

273
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:08,079
What? Are they gonna come
after me again?

274
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:14,271
An FTL, My Lord.

275
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:19,593
There was a problem at the clinic.
A former legionnaire was involved.

276
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,145
A legionnaire?

277
00:24:21,355 --> 00:24:24,014
- What about the girl?
- Still alive.

278
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:29,376
Double our security deployment.
Destroy any ship that comes near the planet.

279
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:32,156
Go!

280
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:37,811
Wow.

281
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,250
- Are those flying boots?
- They use the force of gravity,

282
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,594
redirecting it into deferential
equation slopes that you can surf.

283
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:53,864
Yeah. I heard "gravity" and "surf."

284
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,931
Up is hard. Down is easy.

285
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,879
Thank you. Wow.

286
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,188
Our ride's here. You ready?

287
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,322
Ready?

288
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,876
Ready to walk out of a hundred-story window
with you and your gravity boots...

289
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,362
- ...onto an invisible spaceship to meet...
- This might make it easier.

290
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:14,030
Okay.

291
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:23,729
Sorry.

292
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,278
Shit.

293
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,789
Hold tight!

294
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:24,346
Hold on!

295
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,558
Whatever you do, don't let go!

296
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,595
Look, I just need to know
what in the hell is going on here.

297
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:22,298
Think we might have stumbled into a war
within the Abrasax family.

298
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:23,566
The Abrasax family?

299
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,968
It's one of the most powerful
dynasties in the universe.

300
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:28,079
I don't care who they are.
You cannot just...

301
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,460
blow up a bunch of buildings
and get away with it.

302
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,626
Those buildings
will be rebuilt by tonight.

303
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,827
That's impossible.

304
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,084
Take a look.

305
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:42,627
Holy crap.

306
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:48,391
Wait, a bunch of people saw what happened.
I mean, they can't cover that up.

307
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,962
You have a picture of a keeper on your phone
that you can't remember taking, can you?

308
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:55,198
They blanked you.

309
00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:58,168
Short-term stuff is easy.
They won't get everybody,

310
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,687
but no one ever believes the ones
that slip through the cracks.

311
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:03,111
Oh, my God.

312
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,824
Why is this happening to me?

313
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:08,494
I asked Titus that question
before I took this job.

314
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,497
All he'd tell me
is that it was personal.

315
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:15,001
Look, this is ridiculous. I have never
even met this Titus, what's his name?

316
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,451
Abrasax. The house of Abrasax
has three primary heirs.

317
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:22,458
The oldest is Balem.
He's the one that controls this planet

318
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:24,694
and is obviously the one
who wants you dead.

319
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:27,630
That's insane.
I am telling you, I am nobody.

320
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:32,185
Balem Abrasax wouldn't demolish
an entire city for a nobody.

321
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,205
Kill her.

322
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:39,047
Wait. Oh, my God! Stop!

323
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:01,765
There you are.

324
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,757
You know there are moments
when I actually miss you.

325
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:17,948
But no one understands
this universe like you did.

326
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,827
No one understands me...

327
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:25,939
like you did.

328
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,006
Mr. Tskalikan?

329
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:47,026
How is it possible for a single splice

330
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:50,230
to destroy an entire fleet of shadows?

331
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,117
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

332
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:57,207
They underestimated him.

333
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:00,372
The next mistake...

334
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,775
I hold you accountable.

335
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,567
What are you doing?

336
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,786
I just want the owner of this car
to know who borrowed it.

337
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,339
We needed a low profile
to get out of the city.

338
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:20,610
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

339
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,897
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.
- Lucky for you...

340
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,872
a woman owns this car.

341
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,072
What is that? Is that a...

342
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:38,010
Just... I wanna thank you...
for saving my life. I mean, I've...

343
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,913
I've never been so scared
when I started falling...

344
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,008
Then you were there, and...

345
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,379
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

346
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:52,284
No.

347
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:55,728
Then why did Titus hire you?

348
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,782
Titus hired me because I'm good
at finding people.

349
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,655
Are you taking me to him now?

350
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:07,890
No.

351
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,270
How do you know this guy?

352
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,888
A long time ago, he was a friend.

353
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,095
- What is he doing living way out here?
- He's a marshal for the Aegis.

354
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:32,766
- The Aegis?
- They're like cops.

355
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,571
Space cops. Sure.

356
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,532
Stinger.

357
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,220
Back from the goddamn dead.

358
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,608
It's kind of funny, both of us
ending up on this planet.

359
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,072
Funny ain't the word I'd use.

360
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:09,242
- How'd you get out?
- Titus Abrasax. He hired me to lift her.

361
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,194
Since Deadland ain't taught you
a damn thing...

362
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,709
Just as I was getting used
to this life,

363
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:20,664
you come back reminding me
what I flushed down the shitter for you.

364
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,677
Where's Kiza? She used to at least listen
to my side of the story.

365
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,837
You stay the hell away
from my daughter.

366
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,133
Don't drag me
into your male mating rituals.

367
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:45,604
- Hi. I'm Kiza.
- Hi.

368
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,363
Jupiter. Nice to meet you.

369
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,009
You used to have a little mettle
in you, kid.

370
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:53,245
- I guess I'm getting a little old.
- Old? Look at me.

371
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,353
Not a recode
or a drop of juice in years.

372
00:36:55,953 --> 00:36:57,633
You are a lot uglier than I remember.

373
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,932
Hey! Hey!

374
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:08,076
What is going on here?

375
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,058
Your Majesty.

376
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,866
Your Majesty.

377
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,585
Thank you.

378
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,904
I'll go to town to pick up
some groceries for dinner.

379
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:58,773
- I'll go.
- I'm fine, Dad.

380
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,850
Okay. All right.

381
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,260
Let's have a look at you.

382
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:12,940
It's not pretty, is it?

383
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,873
Clipped and stripped. The mark
of a court martialed skyjacker.

384
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:19,382
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you want your wings back or not?

385
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:21,084
Wait, you had wings?

386
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:25,467
The best bio-neural-synaptic prosthetic
the military could buy.

387
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,777
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

388
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:44,248
Your Majesty has no idea of the scientific
miracles that human beings are capable of.

389
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:48,019
Why won't those human beings
share things like this?

390
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,132
Sharing has never been the strong suit
of your species, Your Majesty.

391
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,468
Okay, what is with this
"Your Majesty" thing?

392
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:58,204
You've never been stung
by a bee, have you?

393
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,261
No.

394
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:04,210
You know, bees are genetically
designed to recognize royalty.

395
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,095
Royalty?

396
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:11,984
Well... You are in for a surprise
when you find out what I do for a living.

397
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:17,200
Oh, it's not what you do.
It's what you are. They sense it.

398
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,926
Bees aren't like humans.
They don't question or doubt.

399
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,778
Bees don't lie.

400
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,759
Oh, I... Sorry, I gotta take this.

401
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:34,590
I'm guessing Titus
didn't say anything about it.

402
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,295
No. Must have slipped his mind.

403
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:40,897
Not easy to picture you
making a deal with a royal.

404
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,449
Titus told me you were posted
to this planet

405
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,471
and said if I helped him, he'd get you
your wings back, full reinstatement.

406
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:53,993
- I figured I owed you.
- Yeah, you do.

407
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,073
But if she is a recurrence...

408
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:00,717
then this is a hell of a lot more
important than wings.

409
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:06,455
<i>It's life changing, Jupiter!
Wait till you see this thing.</i>

410
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:11,636
Two million pixels of resolution.
Everything I ever wanted.

411
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,492
Yeah, no. That's great. Is mom there?

412
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:20,603
No. She went out with Nino. Listen,
they were a little freaked out last night

413
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:23,456
when you didn't come home,
but I covered. I think it's fine.

414
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:25,375
How 'bout a little gratitude
for your cousin Vladie?

415
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:29,211
I mean, this thing was a cakewalk,
right? Just like I said.

416
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:32,740
- Easiest money we ever made. Cha-ching!
- It didn't happen.

417
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:35,717
Didn't happen.

418
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,424
- What?
- <i>No, I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

419
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,426
- Oh, no.
- <i>I'm really, really sorry.</i>

420
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:46,279
- <i>Why?</i>
- There was an accident at the clinic.

421
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,581
<i>Someone got hurt.</i>

422
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:51,759
Shit! I knew it!

423
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,320
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I can't catch a break.

424
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,817
- <i>I cannot catch a single break!</i>
- Look, Vladie, I'm with some people.

425
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,809
- <i>I don't wanna be rude.</i>
- Wait, Jupiter, we have to reschedule.

426
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,078
Totally. So, just tell mom I'm okay
and I will call her when I can.

427
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:06,799
Wait, wait, wait! Jupe, Jupe...
I already spent the money.

428
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,844
You're in trouble.

429
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:12,037
You're in trouble.

430
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:15,124
Don't touch my stuff!

431
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:25,075
Balem ordered a blockade.
Nothing is getting on or off this planet.

432
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:28,153
But Aegis command said
once her geneprint is verified,

433
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,339
they'll get an injunction
to take us to Orous.

434
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:32,867
- So we wait.
- They're sending a cruiser.

435
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,483
- When?
- Should be here tomorrow.

436
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:38,149
- We won't last the night.
- We need a plan.

437
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:40,216
We need firepower.

438
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:42,351
If she's what you say she is,

439
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:45,037
we're not getting off this planet
without a fight.

440
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,439
Stash is in the back.

441
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,247
- Is he mad at me?
- When he's mad, you'll know it.

442
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:56,315
He just...

443
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:59,835
seems different since we got here.

444
00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:07,045
Caine is... complicated.

445
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:14,500
He's a Lycantant without a pack.

446
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:20,581
Had the bad luck to be born
half-albino. Runt of the litter.

447
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:24,126
The splicer that bred him had to sell him
to the legion for a loss.

448
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:27,963
But a Lycantant needs a pack.

449
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:30,049
It's their center of gravity.

450
00:42:31,153 --> 00:42:35,581
Alone, usually they waste away and die,

451
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,540
unless they become like him.

452
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,563
Fearless. Relentless.

453
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,821
Perfect hunting machines.

454
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,819
Caine was the best soldier
I ever went into battle with.

455
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:53,205
Why did he get court martialed?

456
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,343
I'm sorry. If it's none of my business.
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:42:57,443 --> 00:43:00,704
Oh, he attacked someone.
He attacked an entitled.

458
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:04,593
- He bit him.
- He bit him?

459
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:07,162
Tore his throat out.

460
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:12,992
There's something about the royals
for Caine. It's instinctual.

461
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,622
They tried to put him down, but he was
under my command so I took the blame.

462
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:23,602
Two scars across my back as a reward.

463
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:56,051
You know, you both have marks on your neck,
but they're slightly different.

464
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:58,764
The brand of the splicer.

465
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:02,758
Marcellian Cahun was her name.
She loved bees.

466
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,110
Wow.

467
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,638
My father would be freaking out
right now.

468
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:12,668
Do you know what this will do to people
when they find out the truth?

469
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:17,723
I don't think that most people
would want to know the truth.

470
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:19,375
I do.

471
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,477
Okay.

472
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:27,538
So, you've been taught that the birthplace
of the human race is earth, but it's not.

473
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:31,647
It's actually a planet in the Cunabulum
system called Orous,

474
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:34,590
a little over
a billion of your years ago.

475
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,878
Your planet was discovered during what is
commonly called the great expansion.

476
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,961
At the time, earth was inhabited
by a branch-species of Saurisapian,

477
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:49,705
a dangerous human predator
called the Sargorn.

478
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:51,503
Obviously before any colonization

479
00:44:51,603 --> 00:44:55,111
or resource development
could be done safely to your planet,

480
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:58,713
a large-scale extinction event
was manufactured...

481
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,599
Damn budget cuts.

482
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:04,779
Are you talking about dinosaurs?

483
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:10,109
Wait, are you saying your people
killed the dinosaurs?

484
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,012
Technically,
they're your people, Majesty.

485
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,798
Come on.

486
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:42,152
According to commonwealth records,
this planet was seeded by Abrasax industries

487
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,410
roughly one hundred thousand years ago.

488
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,391
Human DNA spliced with indigenous
species to evolve a fertile population.

489
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:52,851
And that's where the "why"
gets ugly. Basically,

490
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,197
the goal is to grow a population
as large as possible.

491
00:45:56,297 --> 00:46:00,993
Once the population exceeds
the planet's ability to sustain it,

492
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:04,724
it's considered ripe for harvest.

493
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,836
Harvest?

494
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:12,438
What's going on?
What's wrong with them?

495
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:14,437
They're here.

496
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:15,465
- Go.
- Come on.

497
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:18,494
What? Caine? Wait, Caine!

498
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:21,128
Caine!

499
00:46:58,033 --> 00:46:59,234
Beeswax.

500
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,890
Gotcha.

501
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,418
Mr. Night,

502
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:16,088
I want this facility
running at capacity.

503
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:20,224
I want full diagnostics and cost
projections for an early harvest.

504
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,494
Of course, My Lord.

505
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,163
What kind of grade
are we getting from the skim?

506
00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:26,065
Excellent product, sire.

507
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:28,257
Premium grade.

508
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:32,805
It's a... particularly robust stock.

509
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:38,577
Assuming market stability,
if we harvest later this century,

510
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:42,947
profit margins should eclipse
your nearest competitor.

511
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:47,369
Understand this, Mr. Night.

512
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:52,824
I will harvest that planet tomorrow

513
00:49:53,395 --> 00:49:56,450
before I let her take it from me.

514
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:04,357
- Here we go.
- I trust you.

515
00:50:36,694 --> 00:50:39,605
Premium Abrasax, as requested.

516
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:50,120
Now...

517
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:54,236
Where is Her Majesty?

518
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,579
<i>Good evening, Your Majesty.</i>

519
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:07,099
<i>Allow me to assist.</i>

520
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,552
<i>I am Sendi, your chamber presence.</i>

521
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:14,005
- New clothes?
- <i>We wish only to attend your needs.</i>

522
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,502
Where am I?

523
00:51:15,602 --> 00:51:18,743
<i>This is the Alcazar of Kalique Abrasax,</i>

524
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:21,580
<i>second primary of the house of Abrasax.</i>

525
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,174
- What's an Alcazar?
- A fancy way of saying my home.

526
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,070
I'm Kalique.

527
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,772
Jupiter Jones.

528
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:36,078
I'm sorry for staring,
but it's really quite astonishing.

529
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:38,447
What is?

530
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,418
It will be easier to show you.

531
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:51,109
Could this get any weirder?

532
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:56,465
Imagine it for me. Meeting your mother
long after she's passed away.

533
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:58,150
But I'm not your mother.

534
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:03,423
Your planet is just now entering
its genetic age.

535
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:08,277
You understand very little about something
which is a vital part of our reality.

536
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:13,782
In our world, genes have
an almost spiritual significance.

537
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:16,068
They are the seeds of our immortality.

538
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:21,923
When the exact same genes
reappear in the exact same order,

539
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:24,810
it is for us what
you would call reincarnation.

540
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,352
But how could I be a reincarnation
of your mother

541
00:52:27,452 --> 00:52:29,023
unless your mother was from earth?

542
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:31,516
My mother was born
before your first cities were built.

543
00:52:34,174 --> 00:52:37,246
Are you some kind of vampire race?

544
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,443
We are the cause
of a lot of those myths,

545
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:44,529
but I promise my mother
was just as human as you or I.

546
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:48,033
The difference between us
is our knowledge and technology.

547
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:51,603
How old do you think I am?

548
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,722
Late forties?

549
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,858
I recently celebrated
my fourteenth millennium.

550
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:00,695
You're fourteen thousand years old?

551
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:03,715
Fourteen thousand and four,
to be precise.

552
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:08,403
My mother was approaching her ninety-first
millennium when she passed.

553
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:10,829
You'd be just as amazed
how quickly it goes.

554
00:53:14,354 --> 00:53:18,447
If your lives are so long, could I ask you
how your mother actually died?

555
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:21,858
She was murdered.

556
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:24,719
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

557
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:28,790
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

558
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,324
My mother and I
did not always get along.

559
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:37,009
But I have a hope that this recurrence
might mean a second chance for both of us.

560
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:41,744
Come. Let me introduce you
to the possibilities of your new life.

561
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:46,512
Holy crap.

562
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:52,517
Each of us has a code
for our optimal physical condition.

563
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:56,778
The problem is our genes have an expiration
date which is transferred to our cells.

564
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,930
A long time ago, someone figured out

565
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,483
how to replace deteriorating
cells with new ones.

566
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:04,052
Today, it's as easy
as changing a light bulb.

567
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,806
- Where do you get these light bulbs?
- You grow them.

568
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:12,977
- Like clones?
- No. Clones lack genetic plasticity.

569
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,380
Several million years ago,
a gene plague caused by cloning

570
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,233
nearly annihilated
the entire human race.

571
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:22,771
I was told that the house
of Abrasax seeded the earth.

572
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:24,839
Is that where you get it?

573
00:55:26,384 --> 00:55:30,969
Your earth is a very small part
of a very large industry.

574
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:33,810
Feel my skin.

575
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:37,319
Oh, wow.

576
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,043
In your world, people are used
to fighting for resources,

577
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:43,891
like oil, or minerals, or land.

578
00:55:43,991 --> 00:55:46,328
But when you have access
to the vastness of space,

579
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:50,268
you realize there's only
one resource worth fighting over...

580
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:52,942
even killing for...

581
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,385
more time.

582
00:55:57,071 --> 00:56:01,159
Time is the single most precious
commodity in the universe.

583
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:07,267
<i>Unidentified Lycantant.</i>

584
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:27,568
So, sorry, I just don't understand what
you mean when you say, "claim your title."

585
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,021
Well, it's common for people
in the first estate

586
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:32,557
to leave a trust
for any potential recurrence.

587
00:56:33,565 --> 00:56:36,311
My mother wrote her future self
into her will.

588
00:56:37,111 --> 00:56:40,518
Right now, Balem owns the title
to earth, but...

589
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:44,319
Once you claim it,
the earth will belong to you.

590
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:48,136
How can one person own the earth?

591
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:50,975
It's just a planet, Jupiter.

592
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,312
In this world, people own things
far more valuable.

593
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,362
You cannot know right now

594
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:59,501
what it will be like when you're offered
wealth beyond your imagining.

595
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:03,070
When you can choose
to remain young and beautiful,

596
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,591
or when you can have the power to change
the lives of your family for the better.

597
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:09,628
And all you have to do
is close your eyes.

598
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:25,760
Caine?

599
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,698
This must be The Hunter Titus hired.
Well-made, by the look of him.

600
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:33,318
Whoa, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey!
It's okay. She's on our side.

601
00:57:33,418 --> 00:57:35,170
Abrasax don't know any side
but their own.

602
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:38,456
Precisely.
And since Jupiter is an Abrasax,

603
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,242
you can understand why
I helped her get off that planet.

604
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:44,322
He has contacted the Aegis.
They are entering orbit now.

605
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:47,682
Excellent.

606
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:50,206
I had planned to take you myself, but...

607
00:57:50,306 --> 00:57:53,888
the Aegis will undoubtedly
insist they handle things from here.

608
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:59,344
I wish for you the life
you've always dreamed of.

609
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:08,253
Welcome aboard, Your Majesty.
My name is Diomika Tsing.

610
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:10,912
- I'm the captain of this Aegis cruiser.
- Please, call me Jupe.

611
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:12,725
Your Majesty.

612
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:15,410
Stinger! You're all right!

613
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,902
For the time being, Your Majesty.
The time being.

614
00:58:19,002 --> 00:58:21,183
We'll be escorting you to the commonwealth
ministry on Orous.

615
00:58:21,283 --> 00:58:23,802
If there's anything we can do to make
the journey easier, you let us know.

616
00:58:24,102 --> 00:58:26,023
Actually, you know what?
I'm feeling a little overdressed,

617
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:29,374
so if you maybe have something
that I could change into?

618
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:34,078
By myself. While I'm awake.

619
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,213
What?

620
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,987
No, no! Lord Balem!

621
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,622
It was The Hunters!

622
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:49,844
They betrayed you in the name
of your sister! Please!

623
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:53,048
Mercy, My Lord! Mercy!

624
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,988
Mr. Greeghan.

625
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,841
Bring her to me.

626
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,167
Yes, My Lord.

627
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:12,116
Come in! I don't really...

628
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,769
Oh, I don't really know how
to work this thing.

629
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:18,144
Oh, hi. Come in.

630
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:20,197
Your Majesty might want
to take a few of these.

631
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:22,460
Portaling can be a little rough
on the royal bowels.

632
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,764
Oh. Well, my bowels
are anything but royal.

633
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:30,985
Thank you.

634
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:34,639
You heard the lady down there.
You're an Abrasax now.

635
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,274
No, no, I am a Jones.

636
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:40,095
Well, except when I'm mad,
then I'm a Bolotnikov.

637
00:59:40,195 --> 00:59:42,420
If that's all you were,
you would not be on an Aegis cruiser

638
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,237
headed to the hall of titles.

639
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:48,603
Yeah.

640
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:51,439
Stinger said that you attacked
an entitled once.

641
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:55,542
- Stinger talks too much.
- Is it true?

642
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:57,671
Does it matter?

643
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:04,431
Sorry, I get it's none of my business.
I was just trying to understand.

644
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,340
Look, the truth is...
I don't know why I did it. I...

645
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,243
I don't even remember doing it.
It just happened.

646
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,432
We all do things we can't explain.

647
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:21,234
They said it was... in my genes. A...

648
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:24,295
defect of my genomgineering.

649
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:27,770
Could explain a lot of things about me.

650
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:32,564
Like the fact that I have
an uncanny ability

651
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:35,734
to fall for men that don't fall for me.

652
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:40,839
It's like my internal compass needle
points straight at Mr. Wrong.

653
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:44,379
Maybe it's my genes.

654
01:00:45,235 --> 01:00:48,329
Maybe I have defective engineering too.

655
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,683
And if that's the case...

656
01:00:51,783 --> 01:00:54,252
is there any way to fix it?

657
01:00:56,012 --> 01:00:58,739
You are royalty now.

658
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:02,860
I'm a splice. You don't understand
what that means, but...

659
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,213
I have more in common with a dog
than I have with you.

660
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:10,166
I love dogs, I've always loved dogs.

661
01:01:11,652 --> 01:01:14,706
- I should go, Your Majesty.
- Right.

662
01:01:14,806 --> 01:01:18,610
- You need to strap in before we portal.
- Right, okay.

663
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:22,946
"I love dogs?"

664
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:00,206
Welcome, Your Majesty,

665
01:02:00,306 --> 01:02:04,455
to the overpopulated, oozing cesspool
we humbly call "home."

666
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,804
I did three tours in Abukesh, a battle
that cost the lives of two million soldiers,

667
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:22,940
and I'd rather be back there than have
to deal with these bureaucrats.

668
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,177
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I am intergalactic advocate Bob,

669
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,403
here to assist you
through the ascension process.

670
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:39,426
Sheave.

671
01:02:42,043 --> 01:02:46,314
This is the authentic recurrence
of her ladyship the Abrasax sovereign,

672
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,866
and we have come to claim her title.

673
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,419
You need to file
an inheritance petition,

674
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,807
and if the title is held,
you'll need a transfer of title.

675
01:02:56,657 --> 01:02:58,263
Thank you.

676
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:04,929
File a quit claim through central services,
section nine-eighteen. Next.

677
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:09,637
You need a title survey and geneprint
identification from wills and trusts.

678
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:21,833
Yeah, I can't touch this without
a tax number from the revenue review.

679
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:35,812
This is revenue request,
not revenue review.

680
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:43,553
[ A title number is required before
a Tax Identification Number can be issued.]

681
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:46,641
We can't get the title
without the tax I.D.

682
01:03:46,841 --> 01:03:48,792
[ Not my problem. ]

683
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,110
[ How much? ]

684
01:03:57,395 --> 01:03:58,691
[ 10 C's. ]

685
01:04:04,191 --> 01:04:08,830
It goes without saying that graft
is incompatible with my programming.

686
01:04:11,132 --> 01:04:13,053
I think you dropped something.

687
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:18,305
Press your thumb in the depression.

688
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:28,598
Seals and signets
are on sub-thirty-three.

689
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,918
Your Majesty.

690
01:04:40,661 --> 01:04:43,383
Well, well, well, well.

691
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,625
This is what I have to deal with.

692
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:14,537
Oh, yeah.

693
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:22,853
Yeah, very nice.

694
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:26,456
Would Your Majesty kindly
place your wrist here?

695
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,258
Yes.

696
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,112
- Palm up, please.
- Sorry.

697
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:33,740
Thank you. Thank you.

698
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,463
Very good.

699
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:42,395
Yes!

700
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:46,057
Okay.

701
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:50,881
- It's cool.
- Very nice. Very, very nice indeed.

702
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:56,120
Now, here is your code
and conduct guide

703
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,423
and your royal ways
and means commission.

704
01:06:00,891 --> 01:06:05,912
And file this with a legion administrator
for your royal guard appointment.

705
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:07,481
- Yes?
- Okay.

706
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:11,572
Well, congratulations, Your Majesty...

707
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:14,422
And my deepest condolences.

708
01:06:18,025 --> 01:06:19,210
Thank you?

709
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:25,532
I will never complain
about the DMV... ever again.

710
01:06:25,632 --> 01:06:29,503
Well, you did it. It's official.
You are now entitled.

711
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:34,919
Entitled to what?
Like, free parking? Key to the city?

712
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:37,828
I mean, what does it even really mean?

713
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:41,816
It means Your Majesty's life
is gonna change... if she wants it to.

714
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:45,785
Can you say that again?

715
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,988
Just the "Your Majesty" part.

716
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:51,008
Your Majesty.

717
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,328
That's interesting.

718
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:59,232
When other people say it,
it makes me really uncomfortable.

719
01:06:59,332 --> 01:07:01,335
But when you say it...

720
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,104
I don't know.

721
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:08,025
I will admit there are things
about my life that I would like to change,

722
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:10,258
but that doesn't make me
a different person. It doesn't...

723
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:15,917
it doesn't change the things
that matter to me, or who I care about.

724
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,316
I'm still the same me.

725
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,857
If Your Majesty says so.

726
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:28,295
Well, you're the one
with the entitled instinct.

727
01:07:28,695 --> 01:07:32,566
Is there something
happening to you right now?

728
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:36,823
Does any part of you wanna bite me?

729
01:07:38,842 --> 01:07:39,886
No.

730
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,228
Well, maybe.

731
01:07:49,386 --> 01:07:50,713
Go ahead.

732
01:07:52,688 --> 01:07:55,439
How can Your Majesty be so sure...

733
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:59,977
if, as you've said,
your "compass is broken"?

734
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:03,525
Tell me that I'm wrong.

735
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:07,066
You used to work for Titus,
but that's not true anymore.

736
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,137
So, why stick around?

737
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:12,736
Why help me?

738
01:08:17,558 --> 01:08:20,190
Because of Stinger.

739
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:24,886
He thinks if we help you, then you might
help us get back in the legion.

740
01:08:26,193 --> 01:08:29,573
- I see.
- Good to know we're both liars.

741
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,388
What is this?

742
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:33,347
Sorry.

743
01:08:34,228 --> 01:08:35,889
Hello, Mr. Wise.

744
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:41,567
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

745
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:49,053
I'm sorry, man.

746
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:33,337
Welcome, Your Majesty.

747
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:36,106
I am Titus Abrasax,

748
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:38,942
third primary of the house of Abrasax,

749
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:43,112
and it is my profound honor...

750
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,249
to meet you.

751
01:09:47,044 --> 01:09:49,581
You are aware that by detaining me
without consent,

752
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:52,990
you are in direct violation
of statute twenty-seven-b-stroke-six.

753
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,507
Your Highness is a quick study
of the entitled code, I see.

754
01:09:57,607 --> 01:10:00,054
I also know that I can file
a tax grievance against you

755
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,699
unless you take me directly
where I want to go.

756
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,569
I'd be delighted to take you
wherever you'd like.

757
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,480
I'd like to go home.

758
01:10:11,005 --> 01:10:12,526
Very well.

759
01:10:12,856 --> 01:10:15,247
- Set a course for earth.
- At once, My Lord.

760
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:20,671
In the meantime,
since you've invoked code and conduct,

761
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:23,544
I trust you'll do me the honor
of dining with me this evening.

762
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:26,363
Very well.

763
01:10:32,412 --> 01:10:34,333
The Aegis is involved now,

764
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:36,851
more than likely
tracking you as we speak.

765
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:39,687
- We've committed no crime.
- How 'bout detaining a royal?

766
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:44,275
Her Majesty is... hardly detained.

767
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:45,609
Where is she?

768
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:48,993
Dining with Lord Titus, of course.

769
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:02,190
Unless they've moved on to dessert.

770
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:13,134
Your Highness looks ravishing.

771
01:11:13,234 --> 01:11:15,621
What have you done with Caine?

772
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:19,393
I know you do not trust me right now,
but I promise I am not your enemy.

773
01:11:22,521 --> 01:11:23,889
Please.

774
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:33,843
Mr. Wise and I had an arrangement.
He broke our contract.

775
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:36,176
For that, I promised
to return him to the Deadland.

776
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:39,747
Is that open to negotiation?

777
01:11:40,347 --> 01:11:43,385
Everything is open to negotiation.

778
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:04,121
I confess I feel I have you
at somewhat of a disadvantage.

779
01:12:04,221 --> 01:12:06,914
Is it because you kidnapped me?

780
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:08,976
From the moment I saw your geneprint,

781
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:12,971
I knew so many things about you
because I was very close to my mother.

782
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:16,733
So close, in fact, that I could tell
by the way she raised her eyebrows

783
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,464
exactly what she was thinking.

784
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:23,707
At this point, I probably know more
about you than you know yourself.

785
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:26,494
Well, shoot.

786
01:12:26,857 --> 01:12:30,439
Just like her, always expecting
the worst from people.

787
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:33,200
Funny how often people exceed
those expectations.

788
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,504
That distrust in others,
in the world and even in yourself,

789
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:41,485
has made it difficult for you
to fall in love. Until now.

790
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:45,796
You're in love
with Mr. Wise, aren't you?

791
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:49,569
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this isn't love.

792
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:53,294
All Mr. Wise wants from me
is to make him a legionnaire again.

793
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:56,457
Mother was also a terrible liar.

794
01:12:56,757 --> 01:12:59,477
Your sister did tell me that you
would do anything in your power

795
01:12:59,577 --> 01:13:01,229
to prevent me from claiming my title.

796
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:02,796
What makes you think Kalique
told you the truth?

797
01:13:02,995 --> 01:13:05,441
- Why would she lie?
- Kalique is in competition with Balem.

798
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,431
She knows that the loss of the earth
will reduce his yield

799
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:10,084
and impact his position in the market.
His loss is her gain.

800
01:13:10,184 --> 01:13:12,672
Same can be said for you.

801
01:13:15,872 --> 01:13:17,995
Not long ago, yes.

802
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,181
- I would have been just like them.
- And now?

803
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:26,203
I knew this moment would come
when your geneprint was first confirmed.

804
01:13:26,303 --> 01:13:29,189
I knew that when it did,
I was going to ask you one question,

805
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:34,161
and if you gave me the right answer,
I was going to change my life, irrevocably.

806
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,252
Come with me.

807
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:49,237
What is that?

808
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,781
It has many names.
Regenx, recell, nectar.

809
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:56,300
There are various levels
of usefulness and quality,

810
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,073
but this is the most pure
and most valuable solution

811
01:14:00,173 --> 01:14:02,238
made by the house of Abrasax.

812
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:04,540
Kalique came out of a bath.

813
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,362
Naturally, my sister didn't explain
what it is or where it comes from.

814
01:14:10,163 --> 01:14:12,748
It comes from people.

815
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:17,020
Each unit is refined from approximately
a hundred human beings.

816
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,071
What?

817
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:21,530
Your planet is a farm, Jupiter.

818
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,801
There are thousands of planets like yours
set up by families like mine

819
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:28,816
to supply an ever increasing
demand for more time.

820
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,954
Are you saying you killed
a hundred people to make this?

821
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,197
Not me, but...

822
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:39,908
yes, someone did.

823
01:14:40,282 --> 01:14:42,896
Not unlike butchering a herd of cattle.

824
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:50,337
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right. It's all right.

825
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:53,778
My mother went through a profound
change at the end of her life.

826
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:56,226
She felt exactly as you do now.

827
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:59,788
But when she tried to do something
to stop this business, she was murdered.

828
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:01,818
I believe the same thing
is about to happen to me

829
01:15:01,918 --> 01:15:04,117
because I began to carry out
the work she started.

830
01:15:05,188 --> 01:15:07,674
That is why I hired Mr. Wise
to find you.

831
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:10,924
I needed someone I could trust.

832
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:14,294
I cannot allow my brother or sister
to end up with control

833
01:15:14,394 --> 01:15:17,472
over my part of the Abrasax inheritance.

834
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:22,731
I want to know that when I die...
you will be my heir.

835
01:15:24,028 --> 01:15:26,592
Which brings us at last to my question.

836
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:32,007
Jupiter Jones...

837
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:35,986
will you marry me?

838
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:50,574
A pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Apini.

839
01:15:50,674 --> 01:15:54,026
<i>I told your men not to take Caine.
You should have left him on Orous.</i>

840
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:57,669
Unfortunately, My Lord promised
Mr. Wise that if he betrayed us

841
01:15:57,769 --> 01:15:59,866
he'd be fed to the void.

842
01:15:59,966 --> 01:16:02,405
Titus Abrasax is a man of his word.

843
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:08,398
- So was I.
- We got the trace.

844
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,169
- Outside the Cleopeides.
- Better get a move on.

845
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,680
Don't sound like Caine's
got a lot of time.

846
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,220
Put him back in the brig.

847
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,334
Lord Titus will see you now.

848
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:37,808
You should have told me the truth
about why you wanted her.

849
01:16:37,908 --> 01:16:39,796
What good would that have done?

850
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:44,423
If I did, then Jupiter would be dead
and Balem would still own the earth.

851
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:46,553
Lies are a necessity.

852
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:50,306
They are the source of meaning,

853
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:53,586
of belief and hope.

854
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:59,016
Honestly, lies are sometimes
the only reason I get out of bed.

855
01:17:10,142 --> 01:17:12,846
I'm particularly fond
of the lies we tell ourselves.

856
01:17:12,946 --> 01:17:14,538
Like the lie you are now concocting

857
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:18,151
that somehow you'll survive
being tossed into the void

858
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,585
and find some way to rescue Ms. Jones.

859
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:24,390
You can't kill her. The title
will just remain with her family.

860
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,593
Well, not once Her Majesty
and I are married.

861
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:21,732
<i>Emergency pressurization complete.</i>

862
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:31,724
<i>You have thirty-seven minutes
of air remaining.</i>

863
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:37,563
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

864
01:18:40,276 --> 01:18:42,944
- You did what?! Shame on you!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

865
01:18:43,044 --> 01:18:48,959
You're telling me you convinced
your cousin to sell her eggs? Yeah?

866
01:18:49,109 --> 01:18:51,878
What the hell do you think she is,
a goddamn chicken?

867
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,234
- Vassily, that's enough!
- Dad, Dad! She wanted to do it!

868
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:57,171
She wanted to do it.
It wasn't all my plan!

869
01:18:57,271 --> 01:18:59,236
- You little shit, Vladie!
- She begged me.

870
01:18:59,336 --> 01:19:02,385
She wanted to buy some stupid telescope.
The deal wasn't even very good for me.

871
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:05,642
- Telescope?
- It's a curse. Our family is cursed.

872
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:09,947
I don't care what she wanted!
You don't treat your cousin like chicken!

873
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:49,572
You're the mother.

874
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:55,818
Be gentle with this one.

875
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,158
<i>You have zero minutes of air remaining.</i>

876
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:03,280
<i>Carbon dioxide levels at maximum.</i>

877
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,430
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

878
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:20,361
- Is he alive?
- A few ticks later and he wouldn't be.

879
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:23,103
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna kill her!

880
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,193
Is there a problem?

881
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:33,179
No, I'm so sorry,
I don't think I can do this.

882
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,366
I told you not to think about it
like a wedding on your world.

883
01:20:36,466 --> 01:20:39,786
It's just a contract
in order to protect people.

884
01:20:39,886 --> 01:20:41,223
- Innocent people.
- I know, I get that, I do.

885
01:20:41,323 --> 01:20:44,157
I wish I could show you
the four small planets I inherited.

886
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:48,328
Nothing as large as your earth, but each
unique and beautiful in its own way.

887
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:50,640
I'd love to see them one day, but...

888
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:54,820
Right now, I need to speak to Caine.

889
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,447
I see.

890
01:20:56,547 --> 01:21:00,094
You still don't trust me.
Even though you trust the man I hired.

891
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:05,778
I'm sorry, but talking to Mr. Wise
is no longer possible.

892
01:21:05,878 --> 01:21:06,896
Why?

893
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,983
He attacked a servitant
and destroyed a host of guards.

894
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:13,269
Given his history, I was advised
to return him to the authorities.

895
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,752
You do know what he did, don't you?

896
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:19,095
And you still trust him.

897
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:22,428
Beauty and her beast.

898
01:21:22,528 --> 01:21:25,305
Why wouldn't you tell me sooner?

899
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,050
So you can plead for this.

900
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,119
The original rite of pardon
and reinstatement

901
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,447
my lawyers procured for him
and Mr. Apini.

902
01:21:32,547 --> 01:21:36,667
I kept it, knowing how you felt,
even if you wouldn't admit it.

903
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:42,782
To be fair, there was a time when I would
have used something like this against you.

904
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:45,822
But now if you can believe
anything, Jupiter,

905
01:21:45,922 --> 01:21:48,781
you can believe that the life
of one splice matters very little to me

906
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:51,923
compared to the lives of my subjects.

907
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,108
Goodbye, Miss Jones.

908
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:05,005
Titus.

909
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:09,964
I'll do it.

910
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:13,795
Thank you.

911
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,122
I need your help.

912
01:22:23,222 --> 01:22:26,108
Sure you want to go into a fight
with someone you can't trust?

913
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,862
Has anyone in your crew ever
broke through a field of warhammers?

914
01:22:31,497 --> 01:22:33,501
What happened?

915
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:38,746
Kiza's got the bug.
Couldn't afford the recode.

916
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:41,163
I love my daughter, Caine.

917
01:22:41,263 --> 01:22:44,344
She's the only good thing
I've done with this life.

918
01:22:46,143 --> 01:22:48,865
You would have done the same.

919
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:51,217
Are there any other family issues
that I should know about?

920
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:53,770
- No.
- Loans?

921
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,038
Money problems?

922
01:22:56,499 --> 01:22:59,674
- No.
- He's good. Let's go.

923
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:26,945
Holy crap.

924
01:23:32,116 --> 01:23:35,846
Portal at mass. Nine ticks to intercept.

925
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:04,074
<i>Abrasax clipper D-gamma-nine,
this is the Aegis.</i>

926
01:24:04,174 --> 01:24:07,056
<i>Cut your engines
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

927
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,783
The Aegis are demanding to board, sire.

928
01:24:20,281 --> 01:24:23,684
Do what you must,
but keep them off this ship.

929
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:30,371
Warhammers are launching.

930
01:24:41,694 --> 01:24:42,809
Here we go.

931
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:49,418
Your Highness.

932
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:52,739
- Who are all these people?
- Just Sims.

933
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:55,241
A necessary feature
for all royal weddings.

934
01:24:55,341 --> 01:25:00,580
As I told you, these are matters of state,
not of the heart. Shall we begin?

935
01:25:10,823 --> 01:25:11,962
Let's hit it!

936
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:22,634
I, Titus Abrasax,
take Jupiter Jones to be my wife.

937
01:25:22,734 --> 01:25:27,096
I enter into this union being
of sound mind and of my own volition.

938
01:25:27,196 --> 01:25:32,035
Would my liege place his hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

939
01:25:42,788 --> 01:25:44,161
Break left, I'm going right!

940
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,027
I'm hit!

941
01:26:06,101 --> 01:26:07,413
Your turn.

942
01:26:08,013 --> 01:26:10,037
Where are you at, Stinger?

943
01:26:11,217 --> 01:26:13,202
- I've lost a wing plate!
- I got you!

944
01:26:18,249 --> 01:26:19,384
Go, go, go, go, go!

945
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:29,685
I, Jupiter Jones,

946
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:32,756
take Titus Abrasax to be my husband.

947
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,637
"I enter into this union being..."

948
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:52,198
I enter into this union...

949
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:56,854
being of sound mind...
and of my own volition.

950
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:08,733
We're clear!

951
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:16,799
Would Your Majesty place her hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

952
01:27:19,936 --> 01:27:23,097
I'm tracking heavy SIM activity.
That's gotta be where she is.

953
01:27:30,296 --> 01:27:32,139
Cover me!

954
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,492
What's going on? What was that?

955
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:44,857
No.

956
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,957
Caine?

957
01:28:04,296 --> 01:28:09,011
Mr. Wise, you are as resourceful
as promised.

958
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:12,387
This whole thing was nothing but a lie.

959
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:15,776
- Was the ring executed?
- No.

960
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:19,778
Once you were married
he was going to murder you.

961
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,548
He told me right before
he threw me out the airlock.

962
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:29,622
Honestly, I don't believe my mother
was ever as beautiful,

963
01:28:30,622 --> 01:28:32,659
or as gullible as you, my dear.

964
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:36,520
May I kill him?

965
01:28:37,362 --> 01:28:39,391
Just get me out of here.

966
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,830
- Your Majesty?
- Please, don't call me that.

967
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,001
Titus will pay.

968
01:28:57,101 --> 01:29:00,654
- Captain Tsing has already filed...
- I don't care.

969
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:03,082
The more you care,

970
01:29:03,182 --> 01:29:07,025
the more the world finds ways
to hurt you for it.

971
01:29:14,566 --> 01:29:18,070
That's your pardon. Congratulations.

972
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:20,865
You and Stinger
are officially skyjackers again.

973
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:26,031
Thank you.

974
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:30,984
- When we were in the commonwealth...
- I don't wanna talk.

975
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:40,033
I really just wanna go home.

976
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:52,254
Mom? Oh, God, no. Nino?

977
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:54,908
Good evening, Your Majesty.

978
01:29:55,008 --> 01:29:57,375
Easy, Dingo.

979
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:00,963
Where's my family?

980
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:05,567
Well, we can all only hope
that they remain unharmed.

981
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,958
I see you have the standard issue
Abrasax temper.

982
01:30:12,058 --> 01:30:13,877
A transfer of title
has already been processed.

983
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:16,946
You and your Lord are trespassing
in this precinct.

984
01:30:17,046 --> 01:30:20,778
We are aware of all current legalities.

985
01:30:20,878 --> 01:30:23,736
I have been instructed
to offer your grace a proposal.

986
01:30:24,436 --> 01:30:27,795
- What proposal?
- You are to come with me to meet My Lord.

987
01:30:27,895 --> 01:30:32,435
They will abdicate your title

988
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:37,016
and in return My Lord guarantees
that he will do everything in his power

989
01:30:37,116 --> 01:30:41,354
to see that no harm comes to you
or your family.

990
01:30:41,454 --> 01:30:44,130
You can't do it, Your Majesty.
You cannot trust these people.

991
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,842
If you abdicate, you'll have nothing
to protect yourself.

992
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,830
You're going to kill them
if I don't come with you.

993
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:55,885
Your Majesty, I could not even consider
such an abhorrent crime.

994
01:30:55,985 --> 01:30:58,905
- He's lying.
- You wound me, Mr. Wise.

995
01:30:59,005 --> 01:31:02,275
If I were trying to wound you, Mr. Night,
you wouldn't be breathing.

996
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:05,711
If it makes everyone
feel warm and cozy,

997
01:31:05,811 --> 01:31:08,430
the Aegis is welcome to follow us.

998
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:11,884
No. She won't be going
anywhere with you.

999
01:31:11,984 --> 01:31:17,006
Very well. I will inform My Lord
you have rejected his offer.

1000
01:31:18,447 --> 01:31:20,180
Wait.

1001
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:27,866
This is my family.

1002
01:31:27,966 --> 01:31:29,985
It's too dangerous.

1003
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:32,091
I know...

1004
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:34,233
but it's not your decision.

1005
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:49,195
This is Greeghan, on approach.

1006
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,228
We have an escort.

1007
01:31:54,977 --> 01:31:58,848
Mr. Nesh, keep us close.
Mr. Wise, that pacing's not helping.

1008
01:31:59,342 --> 01:32:01,922
<i>The gate is prepped
and standing by, sir.</i>

1009
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:09,774
- Captain Tsing!
- They're closing the vortex! Shields up!

1010
01:32:10,593 --> 01:32:12,543
Accelerate to full.

1011
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,109
- We've lost all Nav-com, Captain!
- Grav-drive not responding!

1012
01:32:23,389 --> 01:32:24,873
Shields failing!

1013
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:29,174
Get us out of here, Nesh!

1014
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:48,597
Damn it.

1015
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:31,308
Where's my family?

1016
01:33:31,408 --> 01:33:33,859
You should have stayed dead.

1017
01:33:33,959 --> 01:33:36,162
I am not your mother.

1018
01:33:36,662 --> 01:33:41,083
No, my mother
never cleaned a toilet in her life.

1019
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:43,852
Maybe that was her problem.

1020
01:33:44,136 --> 01:33:46,721
My mother...

1021
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:57,649
My mother taught me what was necessary
to rule in this universe.

1022
01:33:57,749 --> 01:33:59,891
Like killing people?

1023
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:04,348
I create life!

1024
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:07,459
And I destroy it.

1025
01:34:09,159 --> 01:34:10,862
Life...

1026
01:34:10,962 --> 01:34:15,356
is an act of consumption... Jupiter.

1027
01:34:15,634 --> 01:34:18,086
To live...

1028
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,772
is to consume.

1029
01:34:21,563 --> 01:34:26,295
Now the human beings on your planet
are merely a resource...

1030
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:29,669
waiting to be converted into capital.

1031
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:33,552
And this entire enterprise

1032
01:34:33,652 --> 01:34:37,379
is just a small part in a vast...

1033
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:41,526
and beautiful machine
defined by evolution,

1034
01:34:41,626 --> 01:34:45,665
designed to a single purpose...

1035
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:50,370
to create profit.

1036
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:55,641
If that's what your mother taught you,
then I can see why you hated her.

1037
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:00,339
I loved my mother.

1038
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:02,949
And yet, you're trying to kill me.

1039
01:35:04,049 --> 01:35:06,485
My mother...

1040
01:35:07,185 --> 01:35:12,132
made me understand
that every human society is a pyramid

1041
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:16,395
and that some lives will always
matter more than others.

1042
01:35:18,643 --> 01:35:21,700
It is better to accept this...

1043
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,736
than to pretend it isn't... true.

1044
01:35:29,262 --> 01:35:30,907
Is that why you killed her?

1045
01:35:32,189 --> 01:35:34,501
How dare you?!

1046
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,652
I know because of who and what you are,
you're unable to say this...

1047
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,732
so I'll say it for you.

1048
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,034
You lied in the commonwealth
because you're a Hunter...

1049
01:36:06,134 --> 01:36:10,015
who's been searching
for one thing his whole life.

1050
01:36:10,815 --> 01:36:12,718
You survived so long without it,

1051
01:36:12,818 --> 01:36:16,508
the fact that you may have
found it terrifies you,

1052
01:36:16,608 --> 01:36:19,975
but not as much as the fact
that she's down there...

1053
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:22,978
buried in several tons of hurricane.

1054
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:27,387
And if you wanna see her again,
then you take my advice...

1055
01:36:27,487 --> 01:36:30,636
you get down there
and you start digging.

1056
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,911
This is a notice of abdication.

1057
01:36:39,511 --> 01:36:42,464
You will confess
your genetic incapacity to rule

1058
01:36:42,564 --> 01:36:45,484
and you will return the title
to its natural heir.

1059
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:47,558
Where's my family?

1060
01:36:58,263 --> 01:37:00,229
Mom! Oh, God.

1061
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:06,688
I... I will do whatever
it is that you want,

1062
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:09,408
so long as the Aegis can get
my family out of here safely.

1063
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:12,495
You are in no position to negotiate.

1064
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:24,846
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!
I will do anything. Please, you win.

1065
01:37:24,946 --> 01:37:27,576
I beg of you, stop. Please.

1066
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,566
<i>Mr. Wise, as a matter of public record,</i>

1067
01:37:50,666 --> 01:37:54,019
I must inform you that I strongly advise
against this reckless course of action

1068
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:57,088
that will almost certainly
cost you your life.

1069
01:37:57,188 --> 01:37:58,990
Understood.

1070
01:38:00,732 --> 01:38:04,629
Off the record, I will tell you
that you're a man of rare courage...

1071
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:06,468
and I pray your aim is true.

1072
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:09,677
Thank you.

1073
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,083
And hereby return the title
to its original heir,

1074
01:39:15,183 --> 01:39:17,685
Balem Abrasax.

1075
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:25,577
Once I seal this...

1076
01:39:26,077 --> 01:39:28,483
How long until you harvest the earth?

1077
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:31,383
I can promise that you will not see it.

1078
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,235
But how long?

1079
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:39,391
You knew nothing of harvesting before.
Why should it matter now?

1080
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:44,523
Remember why you're here.

1081
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,220
I came here to try
to protect my family.

1082
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,406
Seal that sheave,

1083
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:58,727
and you and your family
will return home safely.

1084
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,053
If I don't seal this...

1085
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:13,060
you can't touch the earth,
even if you kill me.

1086
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,009
Is that right?

1087
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:18,646
That planet belongs to me.

1088
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:20,559
It is my right.

1089
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:29,766
Not anymore.

1090
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:34,729
You have no idea what you're doing.

1091
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:39,009
I am making sure that whatever
you do to me and my family,

1092
01:40:39,109 --> 01:40:41,797
you're not able to do to anyone else's.

1093
01:40:41,897 --> 01:40:44,731
This is not a game.

1094
01:40:45,906 --> 01:40:49,378
I am not my brother or my sister.

1095
01:40:49,478 --> 01:40:52,448
- If you do not seal...
- Beg pardon, My Lord.

1096
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:54,404
- Mr. Night!
- It is an emergency!

1097
01:40:54,504 --> 01:40:56,644
The grav-hull is ruptured.

1098
01:40:56,785 --> 01:40:59,768
The gas is reacting to the stock works.

1099
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:09,806
You seal it now.

1100
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:23,952
Seal it now!

1101
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:39,777
My Lord, is that advisable
without the abdication?

1102
01:41:42,146 --> 01:41:43,714
Kill her!

1103
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:55,582
Here, take this. Get your family out.

1104
01:41:55,682 --> 01:41:57,523
Wait.

1105
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:04,020
In case we don't get the chance again.

1106
01:42:06,771 --> 01:42:08,567
Go.

1107
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:14,608
I'm getting readings from the refinery.
It's destabilized. Sinking fast.

1108
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,390
- Captain, the gate's open.
- It's an evacuation.

1109
01:43:03,812 --> 01:43:06,072
Get us down there, Nesh.

1110
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:23,935
You're just like her.
You won't pull that trigger.

1111
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:42,056
Jupiter!

1112
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:29,700
You hurt me.

1113
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:35,807
And I'm gonna make you regret it.

1114
01:47:17,381 --> 01:47:20,657
- Captain, I'm tracking a ping.
- Is it Her Majesty?

1115
01:47:20,757 --> 01:47:22,570
Signature unknown.
Attempting to lock in.

1116
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:26,808
This is Captain Tsing of the Aegis.
We are tracking. Can you click back?

1117
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:29,642
- <i>This is Caine.</i>
- Yes!

1118
01:47:29,742 --> 01:47:33,430
<i>I have the family. Can you extract?</i>

1119
01:48:23,364 --> 01:48:27,651
- Caine, we can't wait long!
- Give me every second you can.

1120
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:57,581
Is this familiar, Mother?

1121
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:02,179
Does some part of you
remember this like I do?

1122
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:05,460
Well, this is how it began!

1123
01:49:09,393 --> 01:49:11,953
We were fighting.

1124
01:49:12,563 --> 01:49:15,582
Do you remember what you said?

1125
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:41,002
I remember what you said.

1126
01:49:45,696 --> 01:49:49,416
You told me you hated your life.

1127
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:51,518
It's the truth.

1128
01:49:52,941 --> 01:49:55,292
And you begged me to do it.

1129
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,863
You begged me to do it!

1130
01:50:01,562 --> 01:50:04,781
I am not your damn mother.

1131
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:56,287
Jupiter. Just breathe.

1132
01:50:56,517 --> 01:50:58,527
Just breathe.

1133
01:50:59,887 --> 01:51:02,317
- My family?
- They're safe.

1134
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:25,880
- Twelve ticks to portal.
- Eruption imminent!

1135
01:51:38,463 --> 01:51:41,300
- Portal's open!
- Come on, Caine.

1136
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:49,992
Core-gen's about to blow!

1137
01:52:02,021 --> 01:52:02,830
Now!

1138
01:52:13,849 --> 01:52:17,419
- Everyone all right?
- Aye, Captain.

1139
01:52:19,287 --> 01:52:23,192
Captain, I don't understand,
but I'm pinging Mr. Wise again.

1140
01:52:24,092 --> 01:52:25,978
What?

1141
01:52:26,978 --> 01:52:30,716
- <i>Hello in there.</i>
- Wise, where are you?

1142
01:52:30,816 --> 01:52:33,068
<i>Why don't you take a look
out your window?</i>

1143
01:52:34,538 --> 01:52:37,106
<i>You might want to open the door
for us or something.</i>

1144
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,619
Jupiter.

1145
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:10,972
Jupiter, get up. Make the coffee.

1146
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:19,280
Morning, Nino.

1147
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,181
[ - Thank you.
- Pleasure. ]

1148
01:53:23,952 --> 01:53:25,408
Morning, mama.

1149
01:53:26,304 --> 01:53:28,002
[ Breakfast is ready. ]

1150
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:51,659
- Jupiter.
- Yeah?

1151
01:53:52,597 --> 01:53:55,385
- Need help?
- All done.

1152
01:53:57,317 --> 01:54:00,572
- Big moment.
- English, please.

1153
01:54:00,672 --> 01:54:02,570
Vladie.

1154
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:05,327
Look, Jupiter...

1155
01:54:05,527 --> 01:54:08,680
I know we don't always see eye to eye.

1156
01:54:09,415 --> 01:54:11,401
But...

1157
01:54:11,836 --> 01:54:15,054
- well...
- For you, my dear.

1158
01:54:16,806 --> 01:54:19,024
Why, you guys?
It's not even my birthday.

1159
01:54:19,124 --> 01:54:21,760
Vladie told us what you wanted
the money for.

1160
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:25,046
You didn't. No.

1161
01:54:26,348 --> 01:54:28,649
Are you serious?

1162
01:54:30,552 --> 01:54:32,470
Oh, my God.

1163
01:54:33,371 --> 01:54:34,657
Oh, my God.

1164
01:54:34,757 --> 01:54:37,202
- We all pitched in.
- Thank you.

1165
01:54:37,302 --> 01:54:39,728
Your father was good man...

1166
01:54:39,828 --> 01:54:42,747
and I loved him very much.

1167
01:54:43,548 --> 01:54:46,317
And you should have this.

1168
01:54:46,718 --> 01:54:49,245
Could we take it up to the roof?

1169
01:54:50,662 --> 01:54:52,268
I'm so sorry. I...

1170
01:54:53,024 --> 01:54:55,026
- I actually have a date.
- What?!

1171
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:57,796
- Is he Russian?
- Is he rich?

1172
01:54:57,896 --> 01:55:00,102
- Does he have a younger brother?
- Does he need a big television?

1173
01:55:00,202 --> 01:55:01,682
- How is he with a mop?
- What's his name?

1174
01:55:01,782 --> 01:55:05,988
- More importantly, what's his sign?
- I don't know.

1175
01:55:11,293 --> 01:55:15,364
I guess you can say my family's complicated
the way that most families are complicated.

1176
01:55:15,464 --> 01:55:19,467
- You think you'll ever tell them?
- What, that I own the earth?

1177
01:55:20,952 --> 01:55:23,191
Are you kidding me?
They'd have me locked up.

1178
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:25,204
And I wouldn't blame them either.

1179
01:55:25,304 --> 01:55:29,260
Besides... I'm still trying to understand
exactly what it means myself.

1180
01:55:29,611 --> 01:55:31,618
Well, maybe it just means
that Your Majesty's planet

1181
01:55:31,718 --> 01:55:34,517
has a different future than the one
that was planned for it.

1182
01:55:36,884 --> 01:55:38,081
Say that again.

1183
01:55:39,449 --> 01:55:42,707
You mean... "Your Majesty"?

1184
01:55:44,302 --> 01:55:46,298
That really works for me.

1185
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,997
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1186
01:55:49,097 --> 01:55:51,252
