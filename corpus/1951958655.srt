Yes, why?
You were going to do?

00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,272
Actually
I would like to see that.

59

Yeah, sure it does.

Hey. Still doing that.
Are you going to finish consumed.

68

It is more than what you

00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,977
The brave Dwayne.
Arrives late.

71
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:28,285
Give her a moment to
thinking, then send it

72
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,382
Well.

73
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,689
Lucy, keep that crap
and get out of here,

74
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,195
Damn. ¿Tony?

- Tony,
- Yes?

76
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,561
Why do I always go
every time we get someone here?

77
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,572
Because I
I say, small.

78
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,939
I do business here. Go ahead
until they tell you to bring Z.

79
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,103
Whenever I go
when you do business.

80
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,077
Why can not I
See this side?

81
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,910
I'm learning
phones.

82
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,712
It is part of the business.
You said you teach me.

83
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,946
Not this side,
OK? This side does not.

84
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,080
You go and you prepare to Z
some macaroni.

85
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,714
I have no hunger.

86
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,318
Honey, you're killing me.
Ve. You want me to hit?

87
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,692
I always hit.

88
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,355
You beat now
same. Ve.

89
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:11,366
The next time
I will stay.

90
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:14,403
I will stay, Tony,
despite everything.

91
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,904
- I will stay.
- The next time.

92
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,572
It's good to be nice.
But I have to reconsider it.

93
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,340
Beno, brings to the subject.

94
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,217
Want the rest
of macaroni yesterday?

95
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,883
Do not be silly.

96
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,927
Well, look
which brought the cat.

97
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:49,494
Tony, how are you?

98
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,732
I've been better!

99
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:55,039
I become irritable when not me
time to return what is mine.

100
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,372
Well!

101
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,918
Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne,
Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne,

102
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,322
What the hell am going
to do with you?

103
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:12,156
Otherwise I will have
next week.

104
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,219
Oops! Dwayne.

105
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,963
Let me ask.
What do I look?

106
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:21,401
I am standing here.
What do I look?

107
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,802
What do you mean?

108
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:26,831
I mean,
What I look like?

109
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:31,471
Do I look like the bank
Home Savings and Loan?

110
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,037
Not really.

111
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:36,142
You really do not?
Do I look like the Wells Fargo?

112
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,279
I will have the rest the next
week. I swear by God.

113
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:43,257
Next week.
The theory of the next, right?

114
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:47,319
I hate theory
the next one. Yes.

115
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:51,493
We will have a lesson
comprehension, okay?

116
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,832
Okay?
Yes. Come here.

117
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:56,166
Come here.

118
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,871
Knock knock.

119
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,740
I said toc toc, Dwayne.
Come on, is a game.

120
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:06,578
I say knock knock. You say,
Who is it? It's fun.

121
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,674
- Toc toc,
- Who is it? 

122
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,845
Dwayne.
Dwayne the pan.

123
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:20,887
Understand?
Did I choke? 

124
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:27,024
Is not it funny?
Choking me, Dwayne.

125
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,532
I was choking.

126
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,706
- Fired!
- Yes?

127
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:35,869
Sorry.

128
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,845
Calm down!
Okay.

129
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:41,680
Life is tough when
not pay your debts!

130
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:44,948
This is what happens
if not pay your debts.

131
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,512
Okay? Well.

132
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,353
Look at this.

133
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,559
Damn!

134
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,897
up,
Come on, 

135
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,398
That heal, 

136
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,901
Ten. No bloods
in my soil.

137
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:05,402
Good. While it was fun,
There is a lesson to learn.

138
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:08,967
It's when you need money, you should
pay the man, right? 

139
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,410
Yes, Tony.

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,347
It was clear. Will bring me
7. 500 that you owe me ...

141
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,714
plus 2. 500.

142
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:19,221
¿10. 000? Where do
will draw $ 10. 000?

143
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,984
I do not care where,
as long as you get.

144
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,458
Okay? Or what
Otherwise by Beno will you ...

145
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,995
and this is more fun
it was here,

146
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:29,964
Look, get this,
I'm doing you a favor,

147
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,795
What is this crap?

148
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,170
Get out of here
m money and get me.

149
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,832
Beno, am I?

150
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,250
How will all, Joey?

151
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,576
Everything is going well.

152
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:56,354
I have some
concerns, Joe.

153
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,254
Okay.

154
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,455
I've been
reviewing your work.

155
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,126
're Reaching number
as any in this office.

156
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,930
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:12,338
Joe, I've seen it a thousand times with
talented young people like you.

158
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,672
It sounds basic, but ...

159
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:17,241
're sleeping
enough?

160
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:19,941
You are the first to
arrive. The latest go.

161
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,677
I like what I do.

162
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,514
S refers to that.

163
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:26,180
I know you
like, but ...

164
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:28,849
some of the decisions
you've taken ...

165
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:31,723
have nervous
some of our customers.

166
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,694
Agreed.

167
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:36,231
Some of your purchases ...

168
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,666
were made as
s were a swing trader.

169
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,804
Did not you give way
until the next day?

170
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:47,866
The customer has
high expectations.

171
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,606
These portfolios are
the amount of hard work ...

172
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,910
of life
People really, Joe.

173
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:56,418
The reputation of this company
is based on being conservative, 

174
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:58,818
What you did
is called to play.

175
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,254
That reputation can
ruin a company.

176
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,791
Sr. Barman ...

177
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,556
Your job is to respond to
customers' expectations.

178
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,029
It is imperative
for our overall success.

179
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,032
Sometimes it can become
in a thin line, right?

180
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,764
And it is your job
know the difference.

181
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,004
Yes, Carolyn?

182
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,845
There is a spread of a
restaurant who comes to see you.

183
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,312
He says called Beno, 

184
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:32,911
Well ...

185
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:36,390
Yes. Yeah, tell that to happen.

186
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,586
Well.

187
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,787
Damn.

188
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,904
Hello, Beno.

189
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:57,969
Just being
by calling them.

190
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,810
I got here
m agenda.

191
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:09,582
I am sorry you had
to come. I apologize to you.

192
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,856
Tony is concerned.
That you've forgotten about it.

193
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,022
I was buying time ...

194
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,691
so I can collect all
my winnings. That's it.

195
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:21,362
Tell Tony that it will call
after the game in Oakland,

196
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,927
And I will have my winnings.

197
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:27,169
I tell Tony that call today.
Is that what you said?

198
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:30,644
Yes, exactly,
It is exactly what I said,

199
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,510
Very good.

200
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:34,675
Do not miss
Tony waiting.

201
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,274
Agreed.

202
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:39,980
Have a sandwich.

203
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:43,822
It is something that will help you
make that call early.

204
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,811
Heavens. Damn.

205
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,371
Throughout the match, because
under normal circumstances ...

206
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,647
Pittsburgh would be favored
by a notation, 

207
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,019
But now Cleveland
could be the favorite ...

208
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,352
Ray!

209
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:16,755
Hello?

210
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:19,351
He <i>. Westin is
the line sounds scared, 

211
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,123
Comunícame.

212
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,591
Sr. Westin, Joey here.
How are you?

213
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:28,865
Joey, have you seen your monitor?
Intro is falling into minced, 

214
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:30,371
Yes, I got here.

215
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,169
The last offer <i>
Intro to was 221 / 2, 

216
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:36,370
I want to sell all <i>
15 thousand shares at 181 / 2, 

217
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:38,345
That will save <i>
our margins, 

218
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:40,348
Agreed.
I will.

219
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,213
Bye.

220
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,656
Did not do that.

221
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:01,203
Wine as if it was his place,
It is a place for disabled

222
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,067
I understand,
but see.

223
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,539
M problem is that I
observe this monitor.

224
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:08,668
S wanted a place where
park, everything is ruined.

225
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,975
I will go rapidly to the dry cleaners
m m trousers and shirt.

226
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,345
I'll come back soon.

227
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,043
You should move your car.

228
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:16,584
Do you have one of compassion?

229
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,120
You all are equal
strict. Did you know?

230
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:22,021
Let me park
for a second!

231
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:27,887
I said move
your car!

232
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:31,057
Or else I will have
tow his car expensive ...

233
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,397
With its rear
inside it!

234
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,897
How much do you earn per day?

235
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:39,304
Trying to be nice.

236
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,607
But getting this will end
auto racing of the deposit.

237
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,547
Do these two bills settled
this battle of wills?

238
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,116
- You have 10 minutes!
- Thank you.

239
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,627
- Creep.
- Have a nice day.

240
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

241
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,329
Barman Jeffries.

242
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:13,705
Jerry, listen. I need you sell
All of Introt Westin now.

243

00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,077
U n times. Hold on, Jerry.
Do not do anything.

247
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,123
Come on!

248
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,589
Want to sell?

249
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,684
No! No! Do not do anything until
you say so. Okay? 

250
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:35,663
Wait a minute, 

251
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:38,791
my God! Come
Go above the indicator! 

252
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:41,632

255
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,738
Jerry, hang on.
Do not do anything. 

256
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,007
I look.

257
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,323
- Joey, we sell?
- No! Wait!

258
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,724
What do you mean?
We are in hand.

259
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,833
Sale! Sell now!
All the 15 thousand shares. Sell It! 

260
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:17,737
Done. Selling 15 mil
Introt shares at 19. 

261
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:18,831
My God.

262
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,304
This is fun.

263
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,307
Yes.

264
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:30,079
Here the player
5150, J D.

265
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:35,749
- Hey, T. 5150.
- Really?

266
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:37,725
Hey, Joey.

267
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:38,851
Hello!

268
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,533
I'm sick of the sales of shares
and employers ungrateful.

269
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,538
No one is satisfied
with their lot.

270
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,403
¿Beno tells me
you want to bet?

271
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,875
You still have a great <i>
outstanding debt, 

272
00:17:55,945 --> 00:18:00,279
I was hoping that this
debt would be paid.

273
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:03,375
I know, I know,
I appreciate your patience, 

274
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:06,512
But you know that <i>
back to you, Tony, 

275
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:10,955
Well. You gave me 5.
You are still 60.

276
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:14,257
There are 60 thousand who <i>
are still pending, 

277
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,797
What are you thinking?

278
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,425
Four games.
Ten each.

279
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,934
Four parties
ten each?

280
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:24,268
That reduced to 20,
This is manageable.

281
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,535
But if you do not win? 

282
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,305
They must 60,
plus another 40, 

283
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:32,176
There are 100 large,
Joey. 100.

284
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,546
The man goes for more
than any other.

285
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:38,018
I am ready, Tony.
I am ready for every penny.

286
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,146
S won, live
to fight another day.

287
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:43,919
S does not, I will be in your office
on Monday to fix all this.

288
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:46,086
Every penny <i>, 

289
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:47,958
S lose, they are
100 thousand, Joseph.

290
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:57,832
I need not tell you that I want.
At 9: 00. I want it all.

291
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:00,307
Only the commission
should arouse your interest.

292
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:05,037
Agreed.

293
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:08,675
is what we will do. Four
parties to ten thousand each. 

294
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:10,810
- Who do you like?
- Cleveland.

295
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,037
What did he say?

296
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,273
s said that no
caught the guy ...

297
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:40,611
People will look at
to do so.

298
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:44,448
Thanks, Angela!
Thanks, Peter!

299
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,617
Very good.

300
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,491
You have to smell it.

301
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,795
The utility
the art.

302
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,300
Thank you.

303
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:05,673
Thanks for coming
so soon. I appreciate that.

304
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,299
Of course.

305
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:12,414
I brought you some bets
for the crawl.

306
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,382
It is a risky bet,
but I heard some good things.

307
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:20,845
Heavens. Firestorm,
100 to 1.

308
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:23,414
There must be heard
very good things.

309
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,757
Sometimes it happens
greater than the probability.

310
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,093
Save it somewhere.
You never know.

311
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,826
I will.
Thank you very much.

312
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:37,599
Here is $ 300. 000, Joey.

313
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,074
I will give you.

314
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,106
Are there 300 in cash?

315
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,110
Are the Vegas?

316
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:51,379
Every penny.

317
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:58,522
I want the funds in place
Insurance growth low profile.

318
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:02,257
In oil, capital minors.
Even in small shares.

319
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:03,525
Espárcelos.

320
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,295
Yes, I will.

321
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:07,630
Is that ...

322
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:10,096
Today is Friday.

323
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:12,970
Do you really want
takes the whole weekend?

324
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,567
I can transfer the
Monday morning,

325
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:19,307
Attempt to evade payment of taxes.
At least for now.

326
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:23,708
Sr. Villa, I have
a concern.

327
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:27,654
It is illegal for me to take
a sum so large.

328
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:31,420
I'm just a customer who has
put your trust in your agent.

329
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,326
Take it.

330
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,608
Sr. Villa. Now ...

331
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:52,272
If my partners know
I received a commission legal ...

332
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:54,474
Hey, hey.

333
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,486
It is not a commission.
It is a gift of thanks.

334
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:00,818
Thank you
supply, but ...

335
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,050
Look.

336
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,355
Buy Ali
something nice.

337
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,294
Recompénsala at night
you away from it.

338
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:11,355
She deserves it.
You deserve it.

339
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:16,504
Come on, take it.

340
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,168
A gift then?

341
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,113
Agreed.
A gift.

342
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:28,115
Thank you.

343
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,445
What are you going to eat?

344
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,479
S knew what it is
charcuterie, as requested.

345
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:44,257
How are you, Jimmy? It seems
who'd seen a ghost.

346
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:48,326
Two subjects were outside the
shop all day. Just watching.

347
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:49,768
Do the same?

348
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,671
- They seemed to federal agents.
- Did you see anything?

349
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:55,039
They were attentive to all
which came and went.

350
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,011
On the back, On the side,
On the whole establishment,

351
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,049
- Damn.
- They were watching,

352
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,584
We do not know anybody s
can begin to talk.

353
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,486
14, No, cambial to 15,
The line has changed, 

354
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:10,047
Well Done, 

355
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,649
Do some
Call Jimmy.

356
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,558
We are moving
abroad.

357
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:15,153
Well.

358
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:33,038
Heavens.

359
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:36,846
I can not be seated.

360
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,917
Are you kidding?

361
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:45,960
M ear!

362
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:52,199
Thank you for your
damn support!

363
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:56,431
Hey, just relax.
We are putting nervous.

364
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:59,065
It is not good
you're so nervous.

365
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:02,167
You better
get nervous.

366
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:06,146
The next time will be their heads
in a sink full of cabbage.

367
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,577
What do you mean
with that will we be?

368
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:14,349
Yes, even
knows who we are,

369
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,448
We are not looking
Mike and me.

370
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,922
Not even
in its radar.

371
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:25,091
Really? This man
will avenge us,

372
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,465
Us,
His parents,

373
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,800
Of the parents
their parents!

374
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,668
This subject does not play!

375
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,801
Gosh, Dwayne. 're
starting to get nervous.

376
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:39,506
All three made the bet.
The three will pay.

377
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,980
No. No, no,
No, no, no.

378
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,744
Yes, yes, yes!

379
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:45,480
Trying to pretend
I do not know?

380
00:24:46,822 --> 00:24:48,653
How soon
I do not know?

381
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:51,625
How would s
leprosy or something?

382
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:56,095
Well, friend, newly
I met this year.

383
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:58,291
So who knows
what you got, right?

384
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,333
Do you have leprosy?

385
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:10,144
- Go to hell!
- What?

386
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,646
Heavens. Calm down.

387
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,682
Everything is fine,

388
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:28,759
These men
are not going around the bush.

389
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:33,829
If you fall, do not fall alone.

390
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:38,305
So it will be better than
resolve this with me,

391
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,206
I do not re-wetting
head cabbage hot.

392
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,039
Bear for sure.

393
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,238
That was not
anything nice.

394
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:55,478
Hello?

395
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:58,082
Is a.C. Branda?
It is the office of Dr. Perry, 

396
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,320
I am.

397
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,191
¿Ali? Do you communicate
with Dr. Perry 

398
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,730
Clear.

399
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:06,633
Hello, Ali, I am Dr., Perry,
I have news, 

400
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,260
Well.

401
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:12,330
The 680 with
15 grand. He lost.

402
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:16,275
The 2139 bet on Pittsburgh.
He won, but not covering.

403
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:18,643
Well. What
the largest?

404
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,806
23 mil.

405
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:22,509
- Who?
- The 4035.

406
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,484
Are you kidding?
She called you?

407
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,249
Phil did. They are in the city
to raise funds.

408
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:28,880
She had pressure.

409
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:32,518
said that it s not fired
made the bet. So I did.

410
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:35,119
Nothing is more dangerous
a bored wife.

411
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:37,256
And during the campaign.

412
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:40,859
Well. Tell Bobby
to collect the difference.

413
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:43,496
And the alibis, Jimmy.

414
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:47,201
S coming actors,
we need to be forewarned.

415
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,300
¿Lanzelin?

416
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:53,109
Tonight we
where we should be.

417
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:57,416
First of all
I want to say ...

418
00:26:57,486 --> 00:27:00,683
that political life
Today in America ...

419
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:04,055
would have neither a fraction
of force that has ...

420
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:09,291
s not for the hard work
and enthusiasm of our young ...

421
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:12,800
who are committed
with the daily pressure,

422
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,769
Working hard <i>
Out and volunteers ...

423
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:18,738
have been the column
vertebral in this campaign.

424
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:22,106
At this time <i>
I wish to point out personally ...

425
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:26,079
a star
my team.

426
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:28,048
His hard work ...

427
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:30,016
dedication to all
Cases ...

428
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,950
and specifically ...

429
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,650
for their perseverance
and only constant.

430
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,955
Ali Brandt.

431
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,761
Thank you.

432
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:51,962
I feel a little
overwhelmed to be here.

433
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:56,273
The campaign this year
has been a challenge, 

434
00:27:56,344 --> 00:28:00,610
Our opponents used propaganda
negative from the outset.

435
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,946
We will choose
follow the ethical path.

436
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:10,886
But not just tonight
this is politics.

437
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,654
They are friends.

438
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:15,127
Of hope.

439
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:17,495
Of the family.

440
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,965
Of love.

441
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:22,129
This is <i>
of fun, 

442
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:26,004
So begins
dancing. Thank you.

443
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:27,905
Very good!

444
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,500
Chalk is the favorite.

445
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:00,802
Yes.

446
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,470
The "beard" hidden
to the real gambler.

447
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:04,705
Excellent.

448
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,780
The diamond is when
The commission is 10%.

449
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:15,083
The pretext ...

450
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,899
- It is not enough.
- We are ruined.

451
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:49,185
The data mining looking at a
large quantity of statistics ...

452
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:51,623
to find
the situation profitable.

453
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:55,891
Very good! Excellent! The lessons
Nightlife successful, right?

454
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,556
The dollar powerful.

455
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,759
Beno, take
a break, will you?

456
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:05,136
Hello, sir. Barman.

457
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,140
You can serve <i>
something, Sra. Lanzelin 

458
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,005
Whiskey, please.

459
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:17,142
What do you think of your small
Ali, Mr. Important?

460
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:20,145
I think it's attractive.

461
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,587
It's beautiful.

462
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,717
It is the best person
Intelligent I've ever met.

463
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:28,160
And I think that everything
the state of California ...

464
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:31,289
to be eating
your hand, myself included.

465
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,731
You look different
tonight.

466
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,276
Yes?
¿How different?

467
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,673
I do not know.
You look different.

468
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:52,516
This afternoon
v Dr. Perry.

469
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,080
Really?

470
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,785
Can I interrupt? Desire
personally congratulate the person ...

471
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,725
who is responsible
of all this.

472
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,574
Hello, Mrs. Lanzelin.

473
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:22,083
What are you doing here alone?

474
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,917
Today I lost. Attempt
think of my bets.

475
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,884
Are you kidding?

476
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,853
M lack of luck
has been terrible lately.

477
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:38,922
Not win the race if sent to 9
horses to the glue factory ...

478
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,332
and mine
it ran alone.

479
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,541
Should send it to him
to the glue factory.

480
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:05,459
Damn, 

481
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,028
Are you OK? ¿Joey?

482
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:17,233
You look down.

483
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:23,377
Beno! Call Joey
by phone, please.

484
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,652
¿Joey?
Lost .

485
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,367
Hi, Tony.

486
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,869
No. I'm fine.

487
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:53,072
Well. I will go immediately.

488
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,408
See you in the circle
of winners, Joey. 

489
00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:08,886
Damn!

490
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,824
Damn!
Damn!

491
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,418
Well, Jimmy,
we launch the hook.

492
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,059
Phil here.

493
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:22,126
Phil, I'm Nick, 

494
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:24,831
Apparently Mrs
lost this afternoon.

495
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:28,535
I do not want to interrupt <i>
The meeting of the Governor, 

496
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,445
We are in the neighborhood. I thought
going to visit them. To greet them.

497
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:37,182
I hope not
stationed at the door.

498
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:39,880
Of course.
For now.

499
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:42,855
You come back to draw
this number at 5 minutes.

500
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:47,722
Sir?

501
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,790
Sorry.

502
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:02,666
What happens?
Are you OK?

503
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,372
No. I do not feel well.

504
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:09,007
Do not you feel good?
My God, you're hot.

505
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,573
I know.

506
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,712
I just throw up
in the bathroom.

507
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,561
You think I do
This fund-raising ...

508
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:29,001
to give them a corridor
Bet you're outside?

509
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,063
Are you crazy?

510
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:40,142
You know what this
could mean for me?

511
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:43,673
You are very attractive
when looking for funding.

512
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:46,584
- Isn 't it, Phil?
- Please, I just ...

513
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:48,417
You gave me your word.

514
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,724
At least until they pass
elections. I promised.

515
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:59,899
And you promised me
you would be faithful, creep.

516
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,768
Until that move <i>
elections, at least, 

517
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,934
You think I will be quiet
while you're in campaign ...

518
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:11,911
and go after each lap
that crosses our path?

519
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,143
You do not have any
consideration for me.

520
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:16,774
Joan, I ...

521
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:20,378
No! You know something? H ce
As best I could for t.

522
00:35:20,455 --> 00:35:22,685
Since Chula Vista
until the damn ...

523
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,726
and abhorrent
Trees of Mystery, 

524
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,055
I must withdraw.

525
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,686
No. Stay right there, Phil.

526
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,163
I want someone

I will go directly
home.

529
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,534
You sure you do not
want to go with you?

530
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,974
Yes. Stay.

531
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:45,740
You can not leave when all
are eating out of your hand.

532
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,509
Please.

533
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,290

00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:59,977
Or the Bank of America?

571
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,409
Brian, open the faucet.

572
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:07,920
Dwayne, these faucets
do not work.

573
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:41,549
Hey, stop!

00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,281
Leave the bottle!
Drop it!

583
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,815
Okay!

584
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:12,419
Damn!

585
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,819
Why not get
with someone of his size?

586
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:18,052
- It's just a kid!
- I just told you that you hold.

587
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:21,220
Am I threatened with a bottle?
And I ask you are calm?

588
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:24,856
The cut in pieces!
The cut, maricas!

589
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:13,678
Hey, Lucy?
Go get a sandwich.

590
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,511
What?

591
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,044
Come on.

592
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,020
You are a fool.

593
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,025
Yes. Darling,
do not be angry.

594
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,618
Don 't hate me
because I'm beautiful.

595
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:35,159
Hey, T.

596
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:37,431
M man!

597
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,905
I thought it would
send it to Beno.

598
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:44,104
No, not me. You do not have
to tell me twice, Tony.

599
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,908
But ...

600
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:50,712
Why the haste?
I still remain three games.

601
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:54,585
$ 70,000. It is much
Money, Joey.

602
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:57,715
I thought we could
clarify our agreement.

603
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,492
I thought that the agreement
was for Monday.

604
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:05,794
I think we need
something in good faith.

605
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,527
Tonight.

606
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:12,301
Good faith? What ...?
What the hell is that?

607
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:15,137
An advance, my friend.

608
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,734
Are you kidding me, Tony?

609
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:19,803
Do you have any idea ...

610
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,782
how much I helped you in
past and you did win?

611
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:27,446
Did you know? Because
is every damn penny.

612
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,183
And after all
These business ...

613
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,590
I suddenly press ...

614
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,096
S how it was a
peasant newcomer?

615
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:38,926
What the hell
does that mean?

616
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:45,333
I do not talk so damn

620
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,176
And I think that things
have not changed.

621
00:41:57,251 --> 00:42:00,277
How long

622
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,616

Owes much money

658
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:11,742
It's in the base
of the food chain.

659
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,446
A purpose.

00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,286
Thanks for the advice.

Hi, Tony,

00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:05,371

Yes, it's smart.
Hey, Nick.

00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:30,024
I just came to make you remember
I'm interested in friendship ...

675
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:33,089
to fix our
outstanding debt.

676
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:35,431
The payment date
is Monday.

677
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,696
S accounts with your
customers pay you.

678
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:42,003
I hope so.

679
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,977
But, nevertheless,
that's not my problem.

680
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,104
M problem is
my own clientele.

681
00:45:47,181 --> 00:45:50,173
And my own
clientele is you.

682
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:53,914
I have been assuming
almost all your debt.

683
00:45:55,623 --> 00:46:00,390
I need some
kind of advancement, Tony.

684
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,691
Something in good faith.

685
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,856
I am sure
you understand.

686
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:08,629
I do not like to subsidize
a small gamblers like you.

687
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:11,762
Nor do I like to come
to places like this.

688
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,364
But is the world
in which we live.

689
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:22,882
Take this. There are 10.

690
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:32,488
There are 10 thousand. Accept it
my apologies.

691
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,391
On Monday it out.

692
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,895
I hope it is
so for your own good, Tony.

693
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,494
I do not want
to come back here again.

694
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,902
Yes. We understand.

695
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,601
Well.

696
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:04,522
Damn!

697
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:21,855
What happens?

698
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:26,756
Hey.

699
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,937
With head start
Governor's campaign ...

700
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:50,238
Ali forgot to remind their
Parents would come the weekend, 

701
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,608

I deserved it,

Also invited <i>
my parents, 

703
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:58,151

A Jane liked to take a vacation, 

705
00:52:04,992 --> 00:52:09,622
my parents only
came to meet, 

706
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:12,563
Today I want to see
A couple of matches.

707
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:16,330
We can see them
together in the room.

708
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,736
I know!
I'm excited.

709
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,177
He had a debt of 70
with 3 major parties, 

710
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,344
Putting a happy face
I was killing, 

711
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,516
going to the left, No!
Was hurt, drop, 

712
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:39,752
seems to be
hurt his knee, 

713
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,987
Gary was preparing <i>
particularly for the winter ...

714
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:45,429
and I made no effort to
make eye with a punch, 

715
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,933
I thought <i>
if left alone ...

716
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,936
I amanecería
with a new roof, 

717
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:54,701
Seattle was down and I was
about to lose another 10 thousand ...

718
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:57,175
which would raise
my debt to 80 billion, 

719
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:59,644
In the zonal <i>
Memo to Seattle! 

720
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:02,375
I knew that Tony <i>
I was waiting, 

721
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:06,215
not succeeded,
Seattle loses against Miami, 

722
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,981
Do not walk away, Seattle.

723
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,850
Arizona remained <i>
in 1 hour, 

724
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:16,623
San Francisco was the first
game the next morning, 

725
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:20,292
The match will begin <i>
in 2 minutes, 

726
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,029
Do not put sauce
of the barbecue soon.

727
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:26,004
Hold on to the meat
separated from the bone.

728
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:29,065
So you'll know that the chicken is
Ready, We do not want salmon, 

729
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:31,167
Then newly <i>
Put the sauce, 

730
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:33,906
I felt the pressure <i>
when Gary ...

731
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,915
gripped me grill, 

732
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:38,213
It can not be removed
Grilled by one, 

733
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,879
I finally rid
of the varices.

734
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:45,254
Could Irme in <i>
a cruise and be okay, 

735
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:48,226
The best we could do
was to win the two remaining ...

736
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,388
duty and 60
unless the commission, 

737
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:53,331
Arizona went way <i>
to defeat, 

738
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,630
$ 90, 000, 

739
00:53:55,702 --> 00:54:00,196
The best thing about it was the duty 80 more
The committee, I am ruined, 

740
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:07,513
Barman was about to say goodbye,
Nick asked me to wash their money, 

741
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:10,573
Almost lose the money from the
University of Westin's daughter, 

742
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,211
my accounts were in arrears,
I was almost no money, 

743
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:18,087
It would not surprise me <i>
if I were suspending the credit, 

744
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:22,959
I Wine then to the head,
Only then, Las Vegas, 

745
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:26,693
I'll come back soon.
Okay?

746
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,964
Jerry and I play 18 holes,
I will return as at 4:00, 

747
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:32,096
- At 4: 00.
- Is it okay?

748
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:35,168
We will call you later.

749
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:36,834
He had 90 big, 

750
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:37,968
Bye.

751
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,637
It was a match, 

752
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:43,547
Tony wants his money,
He knows where to work, 

753
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:46,313
knows where I live, 

754
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:48,320
My only option <i>
Go to Las Vegas was ...

755
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:51,516
get 100 in credit
and return, 

756
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:55,857
The alibi golf
I would give some 9 or 10 hours, 

757
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,988
It could lead <i>
to Las Vegas ...

758
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:01,000
get the money and get
in time for dinner, 

759
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:17,508
Here you go, T.
freshly made.

760
00:55:31,698 --> 00:55:32,790
It is our man.

761
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:35,027
Let him before
that he does so. Lim.

762
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,467
Yes.

763
00:55:58,258 --> 00:56:01,250
can be a criminal
against San Francisco, 

764
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:04,161
The Line Backer
crossed the line, 

765
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:09,294
That will cost San Francisco
5 yards as a gift to Washington, 

766
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:12,133
Johnson took the pass,
Is under pressure, 

767
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:13,900
was shot down ...

768
00:56:13,974 --> 00:56:17,740
by the Line of Backer
San Francisco, Jason Langford, 

769
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:19,972
Johnson is <i>
the quarterback, 

770
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:22,981
Mitchell is as <i>
receiver on the left, 

771
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,710
Wilson is <i>
on the right, 

772
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:27,480
Johnson is going to happen,
Is under pressure, 

773
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,522
It goes from a defender, 

774
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,717
It's in the zone
Interior Lanza, 

775
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:34,191
Find Wilson, 

776
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:35,592
Damn!

777
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:38,597
It diverts <i>,
Wilson has the ball! 

778
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:41,099
five, Record, 

779
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:46,162
He has been the best year in Washington,
It is unbelievable what has happened, 

780
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:48,070
Washington rises, 

781
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:51,577
Well. That's it.
19 hours.

782
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:53,579
be in his office
at 9:00, Beno, 

783
00:56:53,647 --> 00:56:57,777
A 35 <i>, That was a gamble
who came from heaven ...

784
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:59,876
while defending ...

785
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:10,789
Nobody deserves <i>
Thus, 

786
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:15,528
would have bet a loser,
At least that would have been better, 

787
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:19,265
Tony Beno to send to
the office in the early hours ...

788
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:22,740
to collect their money,
This is the first priority, 

789
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,245
As for the hotel <i>
and what they have to ...

790
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:28,440
I can deal <i>
with that later, 

791
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:31,348
I knew that I would work
I break their legs, 

792
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:32,749
At least <i>
not immediately, 

793
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:34,650
Joey Delgado, 

794
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:37,318
Welcome to
Las Vegas.

795
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:41,887
Come on, come on!
Everybody out!

796
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:51,095

has the right to a lawyer
During interrogation, 

802
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:28,503
If not, all that
says may be used against him, 

803
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:30,668
Does your rights? 

804
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:33,269
I take that as a yes,
Llévenselo, come on, 

805
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:39,880
Yes, yes.

806
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:43,719
Nick. They entered the office of Moffit.
There are policemen everywhere.

807
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,588
Make them all go.
This place closes.

808
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,150
Clear the place.
Despéjalo.

809

Good luck.
Goodbye, Joey.

813
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:19,925
Did you know
Joey something?

814
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,422
Do you take so long <i>
play 18 holes? 

815
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:25,987
My dinner is cold, 

816
00:59:28,368 --> 00:59:32,896
I think we need <i>
something in good faith, 

817
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:39,339
Are you kidding me, Tony? 

818

01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:41,784
I do not know where he is.

860
01:03:41,854 --> 01:03:45,654
He had to get home at 4:00,
He went to play golf with Jerry,

861
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:47,920
Ali, I was

He was not with him.

864
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,470
Cool.

865
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,560
Hey, Joey.

866
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:38,399
You need to relax.

867
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:40,371
Let's go to the bar

Not found.

872
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:15,226
I imagined.

873
01:08:17,864 --> 01:08:19,024
Damn.

01:08:22,702 --> 01:08:24,101
Not this wine
Tomorrow, Ali.

876
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:32,075
Well. I will go after
the closure of the bag.

877
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,538
Thank you, Jerry.

878
01:08:56,035 --> 01:08:57,866
Hey, Joey.

879
01:09:21,193 --> 01:09:23,320
Are you interested in the fire?

880
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,561
What is needed
for the job.

881
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,330
I do not want
anything back to me.

882
01:09:31,637 --> 01:09:34,538
Nothing comes back
with the fire.

883
01:09:38,477 --> 01:09:42,436
We want to put
and wants to take his hand.

884
01:09:48,387 --> 01:09:51,447
It's fun to see <i>
things burn ...

885
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:03,586
Let me!
Suéltenme!

886
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:06,256
Shut up!
Walk!

887
01:11:18,711 --> 01:11:22,772
No! Please!
My God! 

888
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:24,907
Please! No!

889
01:11:24,984 --> 01:11:26,952
Yes.

890
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,251
Hello?

891
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:37,091
Joey! I see you've known
my Asian counterparts, 

892
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:41,124
Hi, Tony.
Look, I was your money.

893
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,261
not have to do this,
I swear by God that you will pay, 

894
01:11:45,337 --> 01:11:47,669
You know, I understand, Joey.

895
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,232
It's like the rat who tries to bring
cheese home. Never happen.

896
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:55,076
Your heart is on the rise
correct, is just that something ...

897
01:11:55,147 --> 01:11:58,241
is disappearing,
That's why ...

898
01:11:58,317 --> 01:12:00,148
that let you live.

899
01:12:00,219 --> 01:12:04,246
found a way for
This works for both parties, 

900
01:12:04,323 --> 01:12:06,689
See? Today I
A visit to your house, 

901
01:12:06,759 --> 01:12:08,784
It is very beautiful, 

902
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:11,591
I also

01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,928
Cas cover the payment.

904
01:12:13,999 --> 01:12:16,559
I need the signature
both, Joey.

905
01:12:16,635 --> 01:12:18,262
Yours and that of Alice.

906
01:12:19,805 --> 01:12:21,204
Does touched?

907
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:25,972
Yes. The touch.

908
01:12:30,116 --> 01:12:32,209
Now comunícame
with my friends.

909
01:12:35,888 --> 01:12:37,412
Yes.

910
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,385
wants to call
your wife.

911
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:03,844
Ali.

912
01:13:31,443 --> 01:13:33,434
Hello?

913
01:13:33,512 --> 01:13:36,208
¿Ali?

914
01:13:36,282 --> 01:13:38,477
Where are you?

915
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:40,883
We missed everything to lose.

916
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:47,756
were here.

917
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:51,129
What have you done?

918
01:14:39,778 --> 01:14:43,509
I knew the moment I heard
the pause in the voice of Jerry.

919
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:48,752
Sorry, Ali.

920
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:51,321
Did you feel?

921
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:54,423
Did you feel? 

922
01:14:54,493 --> 01:14:57,758
Look, I think
I give them ...

923
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,027
No, no, no.
Stay.

924
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:13,810
you promised me, I
promised the first time ...

925
01:15:15,781 --> 01:15:18,545
even when played
the money for your education ...

926
01:15:18,617 --> 01:15:22,144
that this would not
happen, I thought, 

927
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:28,058
I ask that
I believe ... and I did.

928
01:15:29,862 --> 01:15:33,662
You supported <i>
for years, 

929
01:15:33,732 --> 01:15:36,132
And I swore.

930
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:39,637
Remember? I swore that
this does not happen again.

931
01:15:41,774 --> 01:15:46,211
I am a fool. I
m at the world in hand ...

932
01:15:46,278 --> 01:15:50,510
but am only listing it
when you thought the first time.

933
01:15:53,085 --> 01:15:56,179
And so I asked
foolishly thought that was ...

934
01:16:00,926 --> 01:16:02,791
sacred.

935
01:16:02,861 --> 01:16:05,853
And the only thing that
I thought again ...

936
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:10,363
is that I was
very easy to do.

937
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,171
And it is curious that ...

938
01:16:18,677 --> 01:16:21,441
The odd thing is that
I do not know s is ...

939
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:28,848
is love, or is it something
I have ...

940
01:16:31,123 --> 01:16:33,091
t stuck to.

941
01:16:38,263 --> 01:16:40,322
I always thought that
was cleverer than that.

942
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:43,596
I thought it was cleverer,
but I am.

943
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:45,637
I am not, 

944
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:51,604
Look at me.

945
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,911
Look at me!

946
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:02,448
Want to know how it is
smash someone ...

947
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:06,423
with a little
of disdain?

948
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:09,893
Look at me.

949
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:12,123
Look at me!

950
01:17:13,532 --> 01:17:16,729
Look at my face.
This is how it is.

951
01:17:18,637 --> 01:17:21,697
Look at her.
Watching.

952
01:17:21,774 --> 01:17:23,969
It seems hell,
Right?

953
01:17:35,654 --> 01:17:37,019
I'm pregnant.

954
01:17:38,824 --> 01:17:41,190
Yes, I'm pregnant.

955
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,195
Do not cry!

956
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:54,138
You do not have
right to mourn!

957
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:31,132
Look who showed up.

958
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:37,814
Moffit. Must be
The payday.

959
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:04,068
Hey, Jimmy,
turn on the heating.

960
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:08,737
Heavens!

961
01:19:10,782 --> 01:19:12,113
My God.

962
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:29,585
never forget the look
Tony while alive, 

963
01:20:29,661 --> 01:20:33,153
I was standing there with
writing home about me ...

964
01:20:33,231 --> 01:20:35,995
and Lucy with
a sandwich, 

965
01:20:37,769 --> 01:20:41,728
What arrested for murder
Nick Villa and Jimmy, 

966
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:46,102
The look I had, 

967
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:52,309
Tony decided to strike
before being beaten, 

968
01:20:52,384 --> 01:20:54,614
Wisdom
of business, 

969
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:57,120
A corridor <i>
Bet less, 

970
01:21:07,466 --> 01:21:11,664
Tony did not have that
Detectives watched Nick, 

971
01:21:11,737 --> 01:21:14,399
Now the state had <i>
Two eyewitnesses ...

972
01:21:14,473 --> 01:21:17,033
found to be
Federal agents, 

973
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:34,850
Firestorm, Who
would have thought? 

974
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:37,485
100 to 1, 

975
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,825
My debt was clean ...

976
01:21:43,902 --> 01:21:46,769
but at the cost of
a client and a friend, 

977
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,345
Ali accepted <i>
meet with me, 

978
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:37,712
I gave him the ticket <i>
for 100 thousand ...

979
01:22:37,789 --> 01:22:41,020
and briefcase
leather with 300 thousand, 

980
01:22:41,093 --> 01:22:43,254
I told him about <i>
Debt casino ...

981
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,626
and use the rest
for rehabilitation, 

982
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:49,333
I knew we were <i>
for each other ...

983
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:51,961
despite everything,
also knew, 

984
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:57,736
It did not matter what happened,
We were made that way, 

985
01:23:03,548 --> 01:23:05,482
finally accepted, 

986
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:10,544
He was released <i>
conditional, and well, 

987
01:23:11,923 --> 01:23:14,084
300 thousand Nick ...

988
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,923
and 100 thousand of Firestorm, 

989
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:18,963
the house was still
our being, 

990
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,262
He was right, Fate
can overcome the likelihood, 

991
01:23:25,937 --> 01:23:28,132
ONE YEAR LATER

992
01:23:36,248 --> 01:23:39,240
The clinic said the game
was a product of my work, 

993
01:23:39,317 --> 01:23:42,548
The haste of the motion should
match the rush of bets, 

994
01:23:42,621 --> 01:23:45,522
The pressure of the office
created a pathological condition, 

995
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,115
Of course,
That made sense, 

996
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:53,129
- Hello.
- Hello.

997
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,066
How are you, sir. Lim?
This and what was at 8.

998
01:23:58,136 --> 01:24:00,297
Well. 17, 95.

999
01:24:00,372 --> 01:24:02,033
Yes. Here you go.

1000
01:24:02,107 --> 01:24:04,575
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

1001
01:24:04,643 --> 01:24:07,840
How much is
paying the Powerball?

1002
01:24:07,913 --> 01:24:09,380
I do not know.

1003
01:24:09,447 --> 01:24:11,506
Okay.

1004
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,517
No matter.
Have a nice day.

1005
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:16,247
- Thank you. Sr. Joey.
- Bye.

1006
01:24:17,589 --> 01:24:20,717
A scandal arose with the wife
candidate for Governor, 

1007
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,555
They found the <i>
Nick books ...

1008
01:24:22,627 --> 01:24:24,822
and linked
with the campaign, 

1009
01:24:24,896 --> 01:24:26,727
Ali was <i>
jobless ...

1010
01:24:26,798 --> 01:24:28,891

Full-time, 

1011
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:31,900
Hello?

1012
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,904
Yes, one moment.
T is for.

1013
01:24:33,972 --> 01:24:37,408
It seemed that the entire <i>
nightmare was gone, 

1014
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:39,306
No, I got it. Hello.

1015
01:24:39,377 --> 01:24:42,904
But ... not everything
it is always so easy, 

1016
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:50,086
It turns out that Tony <i>
I still wanted to, 

1017
01:24:50,155 --> 01:24:52,214
Even <i>
from prison ...

1018

Zoran was released and he was not
partnered with the murder of Nick, 

1020
01:25:00,832 --> 01:25:04,393
She felt compelled me <i>

1022
01:25:13,378 --> 01:25:15,778
Nobody comes out with theirs
as easily as I do, 

1023
01:25:15,847 --> 01:25:18,372
in the background
I knew it, 

1024
01:25:20,185 --> 01:25:22,085
My life had changed, 

1025
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:24,314
Ali, my son
4 months, 

1026
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:28,416
I know we should beat,
It was my turn, 

1027
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:32,356
Zoran said today that <i>
was the day,

I could not, I knew
I had to do,

01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:38,766
I will go by the newspaper.

1031
01:25:42,807 --> 01:25:46,004
A coup was a coup,
and I knew I was on the way, 

1032
01:25:46,077 --> 01:25:48,910
But as Firestorm,
I do not want to take me away, 

1033
01:25:54,219 --> 01:25:55,948
True, 

1034
01:25:56,021 --> 01:25:59,923
Time is a great teacher,
but it kills all its students, 

1035
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:03,185
Okay.

1036
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:24,678
This is not a place where
I would normally arrogant,

What did bingo?

1052
01:27:47,032 --> 01:27:49,193
As this year.
It's ridiculous.

1053
01:27:50,335 --> 01:27:53,236
Get the following
number. 75.

1054
01:27:53,304 --> 01:27:55,465
Oh! 75.

1055
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:59,203
Two winners. Are you working
diamond in the game?

1056
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:01,006
- not yet,
- Nothing? 

1057
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:03,912
Get the following
number. 51.

1058
01:28:03,982 --> 01:28:07,509
G51. No,
there are no winners.

1059
01:28:07,585 --> 01:28:09,485
Ascend the bets.

1060
01:28:09,554 --> 01:28:13,388
$ 5 bet. 75 to 1.
I can cover.

1061
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:15,892
Does anyone agree?
$ 5 bet. Jerry!

1062
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,928
Yes! You're my man!

1063
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:20,430
You are wonderful.
Here it comes. Say the number.

1064
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:22,466
- 74
- 44? 

1065
01:28:22,534 --> 01:28:24,593
- 74!
- 74. 

1066
01:28:24,669 --> 01:28:27,433
70! Almost lost!

1067
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:30,702
That was ugly!
You owe me $ 6, Jerry.

1068
01:28:30,775 --> 01:28:32,936
Okay?
Ride the account.

1069
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:36,640
I do not want to play your insurance check,
but I will if necessary.
