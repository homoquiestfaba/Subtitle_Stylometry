1
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,104
Nica?

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,344
Nica. There's somebody
at the door.
I'm busy.

3
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,481
Nica, please.

4
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,218
God!

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,155
What are you doing
that's so important?

6
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,224
I was playing solitaire.

7
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,559
The computer cheats, you know.

8
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,001
Yeah, well, I'm used to that.

9
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,867
Morning.
Hi.

10
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,769
Got a delivery
for Mrs. Sarah Pierce?

11
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,104
I'll... I'll sign for it.

12
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,306
Cool.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,761
Whoa.

14
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,577
You know, you don't
look like a Mrs.

15
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,378
Oh, I'm...

16
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,881
I'm not. It's for my mother.

17
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,650
Oh, God. I'm back
living with
my mother, too.

18
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,452
It's just a fucking
nightmare, right?

19
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,856
You have no idea.

20
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,693
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

21
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,228
I know you.

22
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,228
You do?

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,565
Yeah, yeah.
It was, uh, City College.
The Psych Department, right?

24
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,702
That was me.

25
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,570
Well, when'd you graduate?

26
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,639
I didn't.
I never completed my thesis.

27
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,841
Oh, on what?

28
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,610
Uh... Completion anxiety.

29
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,578
Thought only guys got that.

30
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,836
So, is your mom
home now or what?

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,220
Yeah.

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,657
Too bad.

33
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,897
Well, uh, see you around.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,734
Bye.

35
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,871
Was that guy hitting on me?

36
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,240
Baby, you're beautiful.

37
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,643
Thank you.
But I... I think that
guy was hitting on me.

38
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,444
Maybe I should go ask him out.

39
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,180
Nica.

40
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,383
He was just being nice.

41
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,854
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,356
Oh, honey,
I just don't ever want to
see you get hurt.

43
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,233
I thought you swore off
the Home Shopping Network.

44
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,669
I haven't bought
anything in three weeks.

45
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,404
Maybe you have
a secret admirer.

46
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,639
You sound threatened.

47
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,942
No. Not at all.

48
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,344
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

49
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,386
Who's it from?

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,689
It doesn't say.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,306
Must be some kind of joke.

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,609
I don't get it.

53
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,710
Neither do I.

54
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,086
He's cute.

55
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,849
If you say so.

56
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,553
<i>Hi. I'm Chucky. Wanna play?</i>

57
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,626
Alice will love him.

58
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,699
I DVR'd <i>Real Housewives.</i>

59
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,035
I'm going to make
tuna melts later. Okay?

60
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,057
Mom?

61
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,032
Mom?

62
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:40,906
Mom?

63
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,981
Mom?

64
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,109
Oh, God.

65
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,950
Mom! No.

66
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,591
I need
an ambulance right away.
It's my mother.

67
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,796
I don't know. I don't know.
There's so much blood.

68
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,576
Nica.

69
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,318
I'm sorry.

70
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,319
She was fine.

71
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,121
She was taking her meds,
she was painting again.

72
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,222
No. No.

73
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,090
She was fine.

74
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,063
How could she do that, Barbie?

75
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,232
How could she do
that to herself?

76
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,671
You, uh...
You remember Father Frank.

77
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,242
Uh... Yes.
Hello, Father.

78
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,714
I'm so very sorry
for your loss, Nica.

79
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,917
Thank you.

80
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,220
Your sister just
thought it might be
a good idea for me to come.

81
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,888
I appreciate it.

82
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,828
But you know my mother
and I both left
the church a long time ago.

83
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,630
But not in the eyes of God.

84
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,699
I just thought it might be nice

85
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,101
for us to have
someone to talk to.

86
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,137
We have each other.

87
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,806
Nica.

88
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,712
We have to pray for her.
To be forgiven.

89
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,217
She was sick.
You can't judge her.

90
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,419
No one is judging her.

91
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,922
In fact, the church's
official response to
a situation like this

92
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,891
is not to judge, but to pity.

93
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:05,089
My mother and I
have had quite enough
pity, thank you.

94
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,165
I understand.

95
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,704
It was my fault.

96
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,067
I should have seen it coming.

97
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,110
Nica, you cannot
blame yourself.

98
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,379
She was supposed to
be taking care of you.

99
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,692
Hey.
Hey, Ian.

100
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,959
Gimme a hug.

101
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,835
Is that a new chair?

102
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,070
Uh, yeah.

103
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,940
- It's cool.
- Thank you.

104
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,976
Uh, this...
This is Jill,
my new au pair.

105
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,212
No, I'm just the nanny.
Hi.

106
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,782
I'm so sorry, Nica.

107
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,951
Thank you. I'm, uh,
I'm glad you're here.

108
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,023
Come here, you.

109
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,759
Oh...

110
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,428
I'm so happy to see you.

111
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,130
Me, too.

112
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,101
Did Grandma go to heaven?

113
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,977
Yes, sweetie, she did.

114
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,346
Hey, I have a surprise for you.

115
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,320
That's funny.

116
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,763
Oh, Mommy,
I have to go to the bathroom.

117
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,132
Okay.
Jill will take you.

118
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,935
You show her the way.
Mommy needs to
talk to Aunty Nica.

119
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,337
Jill, let's go.

120
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,213
Um... I think I'm going to
go with them. Okay?

121
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,222
Remember, you don't
have to lock the door.

122
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,524
But somebody might come in.

123
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,992
We won't let anybody in.

124
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,560
But what about
you guys?
Hmm.

125
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,862
Honey, we really don't want to
see you do your business.

126
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,558
Okay, bye.

127
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,135
So listen, how much
is she paying you again?

128
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,237
$400 a week.

129
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,807
That's more than I make.

130
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,575
Well,
maybe you should consider
a career change.

131
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,345
Hey, I'd be
a great nanny.
$400 a week!

132
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,914
Man.

133
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,048
Yeah, but no benefits.

134
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,240
What's your name?

135
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,581
Alice? Alice,
open the door, honey!

136
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,585
Alice? Alice,
open the door right now.

137
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,559
He scared me half to death.

138
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,634
What is this?

139
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:43,107
Well, um, Mom left
the house to both of us.

140
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,676
So?

141
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,610
So.

142
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,879
I think we should
consider selling.

143
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,250
What are you talking about?

144
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,155
Nica, this place is fabulous.

145
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,291
It's so much closer to us,
we'd get to see
you way more often.

146
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,727
And with your half
of what we could
get for the house,

147
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,970
you'd be set for
the rest of your life.

148
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,032
This isn't about me.
This is about money.

149
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,672
Well, you know
we've been struggling.

150
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,741
Print media is dead.

151
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,544
Ian's working at Starbucks.

152
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,347
We're going to
have to send Alice
to public school.

153
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,716
And she so had her
heart set on St. Bridget's.

154
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,038
I don't want to
deprive my child.

155
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,020
You have a live-in nanny.

156
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,462
Well, actually, that's
not really working out.

157
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,495
Barb, this is my home.

158
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,000
Nica, I know this is hard.

159
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,636
But do you really think
you can manage
here all by yourself?

160
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,273
Mom would have wanted you
to be taken care of.

161
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,478
That's all she ever wanted.

162
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,148
We're back.

163
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,282
You found him.

164
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,584
He was in the bathroom.

165
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,640
Really?

166
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,525
You know, I think Grandma
would have wanted you
to take care of him.

167
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,328
It was obviously
sent here by mistake.

168
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,295
It must belong to someone else.

169
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,032
And Alice, you already have
too many dolls as it is.

170
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:18,169
Yeah, but Chucky's my
friend till the end!

171
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,852
I actually think it's
a really nice gesture.
Thank you, Aunty Nica.

172
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,176
It's a doll.

173
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,379
What's the worst
that can happen, huh?

174
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,315
<i>I like to be hugged.</i>

175
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,819
I like to hug you, too, Chucky.

176
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,692
Mmm...

177
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,729
What's that, Chucky?

178
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,833
Oh! Chucky wants to
know what's for dinner.

179
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,536
Well.

180
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,306
I guess I better get
started in the kitchen.

181
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,275
Oh, don't be silly.

182
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,710
Uh, you guys are my
guests and you must be
exhausted from your flight,

183
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,813
please just make
yourselves at home.

184
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,096
Father Frank, you will stay
for dinner, won't you?

185
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,520
Well, I, uh...
I'd love to, Nica. Thanks.

186
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:14,125
Uh, you're going to
make dinner. For six.

187
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,760
Seven.

188
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,362
Well, I will need
a chef's assistant.

189
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,399
And Chucky can be my assistant.

190
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,734
Great. Let's get cooking.

191
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,762
Mmm.

192
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,633
It's really good.
It's the oregano.

193
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,901
Did you finish
setting the table?

194
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,902
Almost.

195
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,477
Pay the toll.
We're on a roll.

196
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,944
Oh, no, honey,
don't touch that. Can you
grab me the napkins?

197
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,180
The fancy ones
from last Christmas.

198
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,275
This smells delicious.

199
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,477
Thanks.

200
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,511
Come on, Chucky.

201
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,948
Wow. Look at this,
Nica. You've really
outdone yourself this time.

202
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,484
We are going to sit right here.

203
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,919
Barb, sit next to me here.

204
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,654
Okay. If you insist.

205
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,356
Wow. Look at this.

206
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,924
Thanks, Jill.
Make yourself comfortable.

207
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,026
Oh. You brought out
the nice china.

208
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,998
Father,
would you like to say grace?

209
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,804
Bless us, oh Lord,
and these Thy gifts

210
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,774
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

211
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,757
Stop.
Through Jesus
Christ our Lord we pray.

212
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,447
Amen.

213
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,388
Jill?
Mmm. Thank you, Ian.

214
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,789
Don't mind if I do.

215
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,724
How about you, Father?

216
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,893
Oh, no. I'm good.

217
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,433
I am starving.

218
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,294
Uh, wait.

219
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,340
Your daddy would
like to make a toast.

220
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,677
To the chef.

221
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,520
Thank you.
I had a great assistant.

222
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,682
I love chili.
Do you really?

223
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,124
Yeah.
Me, too. Love it.

224
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,087
Is there meat in this?

225
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,356
No. Not at all.

226
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,857
It's vegetarian.

227
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,693
Huh.

228
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,671
Oh, my God.

229
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,408
Oh, my God.
What?

230
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,879
This is amazing!

231
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,783
I know. I can't believe
there's no meat in this.

232
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,085
It's so hearty.

233
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,387
It's the oregano.

234
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,389
This is just the way
my mama used to make it.

235
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,892
Nica, could you
pass me the salt?

236
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,932
Thank you.

237
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,004
You know, that doll,
it looks really
familiar somehow.

238
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,574
Oh, Father, come on.

239
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,908
Good Guy dolls
were all the rage
back in the '80s.

240
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,977
My brother even had one.
So did mine.

241
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,979
Are you serious?
Yes.

242
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,448
- Oh, come on.
- That is wild... I...

243
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,451
I seem to remember
seeing them on the news?

244
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,587
I remember seeing people
standing in line overnight

245
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,489
just to get their
hands on one of these.

246
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,931
They were right up there
with Smurfs and
Cabbage Patch Kids.

247
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,161
Mmm.

248
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,958
Hmm. Hmm...

249
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,430
Alice, honey,
is something wrong?

250
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,899
It tastes funny.

251
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,502
Maybe we put too
much oregano in.

252
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,558
Alice, sweetheart,
it's not that bad.

253
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,842
Eat it.

254
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,003
Father, are you all right?

255
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,574
Oh, I'm...

256
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,746
I'm so sorry,
I'm going to have
to be going.

257
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,114
Oh, my God,
Father, are you ill?

258
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:17,114
Oh, no, I'm fine.

259
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:21,919
I have an appointment
back at the church.

260
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,055
Nica, thank you so much,
the chili was delicious.

261
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,757
Father, are you?
No, please forgive me.

262
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,993
I don't mean to be rude.

263
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,963
I'll see you all in
the morning at the cemetery.

264
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,179
Uh...

265
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,167
Good night.

266
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,204
I'm so sorry.

267
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,749
Where is he?

268
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,184
This way.

269
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,586
What happened?

270
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,354
Lost control, hit them head on.

271
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,356
Probably drunk.

272
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:35,826
No, no, this isn't right.
I know him, I'm in his parish.

273
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,027
He doesn't drink anymore.

274
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,596
You sure about that?

275
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,931
He's my sponsor.

276
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,213
Stanton, you're going
to need a drink
after you see this.

277
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,176
Jesus Christ.

278
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,311
Steel's got him pinned.
He's lost a
shitload of blood,

279
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,246
but we just can't
tell from where.

280
00:26:56,248 --> 00:27:00,250
Father, can you
hear me? Father?

281
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,621
Just hang on!
We're going to get you out.

282
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,155
What the hell are
you waiting for?
Get this shit off him!

283
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,890
I can't make that call.

284
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,293
He's bleeding to death!
Get him out!

285
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,536
- Okay, set in.
- On my count.

286
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,631
One, two, pull.

287
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,107
Oh.

288
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,842
Oh. This is an oldie.

289
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,680
Oh, my God. Is that you?

290
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,881
Shut up.

291
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,249
You're so cute.

292
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,383
It's called baby fat.

293
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,054
Look, I didn't say anything.

294
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,056
Go back to sleep.
Will do.

295
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,437
Look at her.

296
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,905
She's so happy.

297
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,846
What happened to your dad?

298
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:40,050
He drowned that year,
couple of weeks
before Nica was born.

299
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,340
Mom was never
the same after that.

300
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,974
Who's that?

301
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,263
Some neighbor back
in Chicago, I guess.

302
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,214
What a weirdo.

303
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,151
Hey there,
missy, what'cha up to?

304
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,754
Chucky's gone.

305
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,156
Not again.
Well, where did
you leave him?

306
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,425
I didn't. He's hiding.

307
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,394
Okay, time for bed.

308
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,433
And don't forget
to brush your teeth
and your hair.

309
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,068
What about Chucky?

310
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,036
Jill will go look for Chucky.

311
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,976
I'll give you a hand, Jill.
Uh-uh. We're not
done here yet.

312
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,280
I think he's
hiding under my bed.

313
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,642
Don't worry, we'll find him.

314
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,332
I'm going to be right back.

315
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,908
Are you sure you didn't
leave him downstairs?

316
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,878
I didn't leave him
anywhere. He's hiding.

317
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,413
There he goes!

318
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,329
I am not in the mood for this.

319
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,378
Need a hand?

320
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,580
I need a fucking search party!

321
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,384
I have looked over every inch
of this house and I can't
find him anywhere.

322
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,313
God, I've missed you.
Shut up.

323
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,822
Oh...

324
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,590
You found him.

325
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,161
I think she
wanted you to find him.

326
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:37,507
You know, I haven't been
spending enough time with her.

327
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,989
It's like if I'm not working,
I'm just so
tired all the time.

328
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,246
<i>Life is short</i>

329
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,718
Did they always say that?

330
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,253
I don't know.

331
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,655
Listen, little man,
what else are you, uh,

332
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,223
telling my kid
behind my back, huh?

333
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,692
<i>I like to be hugged.</i>

334
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,495
Oh. And?
<i>Hey. Wanna play?</i>

335
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,665
Is that it?
<i>Hi. I'm Chucky.</i>

336
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,507
<i>And I'm your</i>
<i>friend till the end.</i>

337
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,870
That one's a classic.

338
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:10,173
Ah... And it works on so
many different levels.

339
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,175
Yeah, the '80s were awesome.

340
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,337
Did you find him yet?

341
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah, we found him!

342
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,584
I'll take him up.

343
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,620
Ian?

344
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,698
Anyone?

345
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,549
Hello?

346
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,595
Oh, shit.

347
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:15,699
Coming!

348
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,738
See, with her,
it's always something.

349
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,908
She needs my help
and then resents me for it.

350
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,644
You're the only one
who really appreciates me.

351
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,017
You know, I was thinking.

352
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,285
Hmm?

353
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,356
We can get by
without the money.

354
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,391
You don't have to sell.

355
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,827
I mean, this is her home.

356
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,397
She's a mess.
You can see that.

357
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:20,997
Oh, crap.

358
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,077
There you are, Chucky!
We've been looking
for you everywhere.

359
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,611
<i>Hey, want to play?</i>

360
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,347
I didn't know
you could do that.

361
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,749
Playtime's over.
It's time for bed.

362
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,319
Can you read us
a bedtime story?

363
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,953
Aunty Nica's tired, sweetie.
We'll let her rest now.

364
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,922
I'm fine.

365
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,045
It's important that
you don't overextend
yourself.

366
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,005
Don't you think
I'm the best judge

367
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,473
of when I'm
overextending myself?

368
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,009
Frankly, no.

369
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,044
Really.

370
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,748
I don't think you realize
the strain you're under.

371
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,190
There's no shame
in admitting that
you need help.

372
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,555
You mean "assistance."

373
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:22,625
Nica, I am worried
about your heart. Okay?

374
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,896
Dr. Masur said
I was fine, Barb.

375
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,033
You're at significant risk
of it happening again,
you know that.

376
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,535
13% of all T5 paraplegics...

377
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,037
I know the statistics.

378
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,106
Dr. Masur said
that extreme stress,

379
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,975
any kind
of even mild shock
could bring it on.

380
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,297
And since last night,
God knows you've
had plenty of both.

381
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:50,120
Alice, sweetheart,
please come down
from there.

382
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,058
I'm disabled,
Barb, I am not a child.

383
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,394
And I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

384
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,534
Aunty Nica, you're bleeding.

385
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,872
Oh, my God.

386
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,407
I got it. Okay?

387
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,979
It almost looks
like a knife wound.

388
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,914
You must have cut
yourself making dinner.

389
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,449
I... I didn't.

390
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,418
Doesn't it hurt?

391
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,154
No. No, don't worry,
sweetie.

392
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:25,955
She can't feel a thing.

393
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,327
All right, come on.
Come on. Off to bed now.

394
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,031
Good night, Aunty Nica.

395
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,734
Good night, baby.
Sweet dreams.

396
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,093
Now I lay me down to sleep,

397
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,796
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

398
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:11,501
If I shall die before I wake,
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

399
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:16,172
God bless Grandma, and Mommy,
and Daddy, and Jill.

400
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,041
And especially Aunty Nica.

401
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,579
What about Chucky?

402
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,881
He says there is no God.

403
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,017
Who said that?
Chucky did.

404
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,821
He said that life's
a bitch and then you die,
bleeding like a stuck pig.

405
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,991
Alice. You know
it's not nice to curse.

406
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,094
I don't curse, Mommy.
Chucky did.

407
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,003
Mommy, am I going to die?

408
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:52,642
No. Of course not, sweetie.

409
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,879
Grandma died.
And Chucky says
we're all going to die.

410
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,150
Alice, who really
told you that?

411
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,952
Was it Jill?
No.

412
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,588
Was it your daddy?
No, it was Chucky.

413
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,027
Okay.

414
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,143
Can't we sleep in
with you tonight?

415
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,948
Alice, we've talked
about this. You're
a big girl now.

416
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,083
It's only a storm.

417
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,926
And Jill's going
to be in in a while.

418
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,689
Don't forget Chucky!

419
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,126
Don't worry, Chucky.
It's only a storm.

420
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,181
<i>- Ma'am, thank you for holding.</i>
<i>- The package...</i>

421
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,884
<i>evidence depository.</i>

422
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,953
Um...

423
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,475
I'm... I'm sorry, you're
breaking up. Did you say
"evidence depository"?

424
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:51,894
Hello? Hello, are you there?

425
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,215
Chucky, I'm scared.

426
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,826
You fucking should be.

427
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,496
Oh...

428
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,932
Sorry.

429
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,501
We found him.

430
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,437
She sure loves that thing.

431
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,559
Yeah.
She sure does.

432
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,777
But you know,
I just called
the delivery company,

433
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:50,913
and they said it was sent
from an evidence depository.

434
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,919
As in crime scene evidence?

435
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,961
I don't know.
Maybe I heard them wrong.
The connection was bad.

436
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,198
I'm sure that's it.

437
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,575
Yeah, but we still
don't know who sent it.

438
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,399
I don't care if it
was the Manson Family.

439
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,481
Anything that
keeps her this happy
is fine by me.

440
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,005
She's been so sad lately.

441
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,879
I better get to bed.
Long day tomorrow.

442
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,216
Uh... Good night.

443
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,418
Good night, Jill.

444
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,467
Andy Barclay.

445
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,618
Charles.

446
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,494
She's up.

447
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,384
Women.

448
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,754
Can't live with 'em. Period.

449
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,687
Shit.

450
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,456
What's going on?

451
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,698
Power's out again.

452
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,575
I'm going to go check on Alice.

453
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,201
What about Jill?

454
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,307
What about her?
Well, come on, Barb.

455
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:54,310
You're paying her
$400 a week to
take care of our kid.

456
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,112
Don't you think
she can handle it?

457
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,646
Ian, she's afraid of the dark.

458
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,281
It's storming out.
She might need me.

459
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,758
Who, exactly, might need you?

460
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,824
Who do you think?

461
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,793
Right now I'm not
sure what to think.

462
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,637
You know...

463
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,542
Don't try to implicate me
in your sick fantasies, okay?

464
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,124
I've seen the way
you look at her.

465
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:31,921
Ditto.

466
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:38,654
Ian, I am not
sleeping with the nanny.

467
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,789
No, of course,
you couldn't be
that stupid, Barb.

468
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,491
Knowing that if I
could prove such a thing,

469
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,853
I could easily take
Alice away from you.

470
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,290
Or I could just
check the footage.

471
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,666
What are you talking about?

472
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,908
The footage from the nanny cam.

473
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,570
What nanny cam?

474
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,932
The one I hid in
the doll today.

475
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,615
You are not taking my daughter
away from me. Do you hear me?

476
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,717
I am not going to let
you destroy this family

477
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,554
because of your sick,
paranoid accusations.

478
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:12,955
Oh, that's right.
Tune me out.

479
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,757
Let Barb take
care of everything.

480
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,399
That's what you
always do anyway, right?

481
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,894
You latte-making loser.

482
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,503
What's the word from Forensics?

483
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:30,940
<i>Won't know anything</i>
<i>for sure till they cook</i>
<i>his blood.</i>

484
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,209
Hey, you talk to
anyone at St. Paul's yet?

485
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,331
<i>Said he was out at</i>
<i>the Pierce house all day.</i>

486
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,348
Okay, well,
maybe they'll have
some answers for us.

487
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,990
I'm going to
head out there now.

488
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,875
Alice?

489
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,398
Alice! I don't have
time to play games.

490
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,013
Barb?

491
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,415
Barb!

492
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,522
Barb, where's Alice?

493
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,857
Playing fucking hide and seek.

494
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,759
Barb, put him down.

495
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:57,893
What is wrong with you?

496
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,797
Look, I know
that this sounds nuts,
but that doll,

497
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,332
I think that there's
something in it.

498
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,967
Wait a second.
You know about this?

499
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,610
Well, I think that I do.
You know what's in this?

500
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,904
Do you?

501
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,374
Why didn't you tell me?

502
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,475
I'm trying to tell you.

503
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,444
Wait, wait.
When did you find out?

504
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,980
What does it matter?
It matters to me.

505
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,750
It matters to me
that my own sister
is out to get me.

506
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,619
No. No, no, no,
you don't understand, this...

507
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:26,722
Oh, I understand perfectly.

508
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:30,059
I understand you
resent the fact
that I actually have a life.

509
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:31,627
No, Barb, this isn't
about anything that...

510
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,362
Well, you know what, Nica?

511
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:36,031
It isn't my fault. Okay?

512
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,436
What happened to
you isn't my fault.

513
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:43,005
And it isn't my fault
that you dropped
out of school,

514
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,773
and it isn't my
fault that you chose

515
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,010
to never leave
this goddamned house.

516
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,412
I mean, what the hell
were you waiting for,
a sign from God?

517
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:53,582
No, Barb! Just put
the fucking doll down!

518
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,554
Fuck you, Nica.

519
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,390
Barb!

520
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,120
Alice!
Get down here!

521
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,135
Jill?

522
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,072
Ian!

523
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,949
Shit!

524
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,472
Alice?

525
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:07,022
Alice, don't touch anything.
You hear me?

526
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,582
Alice, you are in big trouble,
young lady!

527
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,938
Alice!

528
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,742
Alice, please.

529
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:05,581
Mommy is just about sick
to death of all of you.

530
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,585
Alice?

531
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,524
Alice, you come out
here right this minute.

532
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,556
Oh, my God.

533
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,378
Alice.

534
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,821
Alice is mine.

535
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,658
Now she knows

536
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,066
there is no God.

537
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,276
You have your mother's eyes.

538
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:26,314
And they were always too
fucking close together!

539
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,183
No!

540
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,030
Barbie?

541
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,366
Nica.

542
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:34,042
I'm gonna get you.

543
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,280
Alice!

544
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:42,984
Alice!

545
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,892
Ian! Ian!

546
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,594
Ian! Ian!

547
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,003
Ian!

548
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,006
Ian! Ian!

549
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,441
Wha... Huh? What?

550
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:08,443
Ian, they're dead!
What are you talking about?

551
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:12,013
Barb, Jill, they're dead,
and I can't find Alice?

552
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,849
No! No! He's still out there!

553
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:14,516
Who?

554
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:15,884
Chucky!

555
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,454
Alice! Alice!

556
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,409
I gotta go find Alice.

557
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:42,939
Ian!
What?

558
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,509
Ian, if you see Chucky,
whatever you do,
just leave him alone.

559
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,944
Chuck...
What are you talking about?

560
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:51,386
Just stay away from that doll!

561
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,005
Alice?

562
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,114
Alice?

563
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,053
Ian?

564
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,499
Ian!

565
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,468
Ian!

566
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,046
Alice?

567
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:03,184
Ian! Ian!

568
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:52,534
No!

569
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,569
Nica!

570
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,471
No!

571
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:57,705
Nica, what the hell
are you doing?

572
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,374
He did it! It was him!

573
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:00,575
Nica! Look at me!

574
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:05,180
Give me the ax.
What? No!

575
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:06,581
Now, give me the goddamn ax!

576
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,223
Oh, my God.
Nica, what have you done?

577
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:18,393
Ian. Ian, please.
You know I would never...

578
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,670
Oh, my God.

579
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,745
Ian. Ian. Take this.

580
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,748
I need you to
inject it under my rib.

581
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,291
Ian.

582
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,734
Ian. Ian, what are you doing?

583
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:34,636
What the hell have you
done with my daughter, Nica?

584
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,704
Ian, where's Chucky?
You're sick!

585
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,473
Ian, I swear to God,
I can prove it!

586
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,208
And so can I.

587
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,394
<i>Hey, Barb, check this out.</i>

588
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:02,764
<i>RadioShack, 450 bucks.</i>

589
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:06,668
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>
<i>if you're watching this,</i>
<i>I put it on your MasterCard.</i>

590
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:29,657
Where are you, Alice?

591
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,654
<i>They'll never find</i>
<i>me in here, Chucky.</i>

592
01:10:59,656 --> 01:11:01,889
<i>This is the best game</i>
<i>of hide and seek ever.</i>

593
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,592
<i>Just keep your</i>
<i>fucking mouth shut.</i>

594
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,894
<i>Chucky, stop cursing.</i>

595
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,963
Say hi to
the little woman for me.

596
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,943
Maybe not.

597
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,224
Your turn.

598
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,600
My turn.

599
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,133
You're Charles Lee Ray.

600
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,204
My friends call me Chucky.

601
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,674
You're dead.

602
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,176
No, you are.

603
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,246
Why us?

604
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:55,049
Didn't your
mother ever mention me?

605
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,086
I'm an old
friend of the family.

606
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,837
Charles, come over here.

607
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:19,206
I wanna introduce
you to someone.

608
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,741
October 27th.

609
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,743
Okay.

610
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,782
Right against my rib cage.

611
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:30,651
Soon enough.
Cannot come soon enough.

612
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,188
Charles, this is Sarah.

613
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,623
Hi.
How do you do?

614
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,058
Her husband, Daniel.
Hello, sir.

615
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,025
Hi, Daniel.
Nice to meet you.

616
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,127
And this is Barb.

617
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:52,273
She has her mother's eyes.

618
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,842
<i>Such a nice, happy family.</i>

619
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,311
<i>But not for long.</i>

620
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:37,918
You like 'em?

621
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,420
Mmm-hmm.

622
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:55,936
They're beautiful, thank you.

623
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,106
Difficult to find right now.
They're not exactly in season.

624
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,710
Anyway, enjoy.

625
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:05,413
It's gettin' late,
and I'm gonna go
pick up Barbie at day-care.

626
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:06,414
No!

627
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,454
I mean, shouldn't we have
some time alone together?

628
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,925
What about family time?

629
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,761
Later.

630
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,331
Right now I want to
have you all to myself.

631
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:31,372
Sarah. Sarah,
you've had me all day.

632
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,342
It isn't enough.

633
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:40,481
That's a selfish
fucking attitude
for a mother to take.

634
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,086
You don't wanna
share me with her?

635
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,223
No. No.

636
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:54,361
Well, what's gonna happen
when the baby comes?

637
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,799
Are you gonna keep
her from me, too?

638
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:01,435
Because that would
be very hurtful to me.

639
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,173
And you wouldn't wanna
see me get hurt, would you?

640
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:11,212
Would you?

641
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,347
Would you?
No. No.

642
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,015
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

643
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,417
I don't wanna see
anybody get hurt.

644
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,020
Okay.

645
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:23,991
I'm gonna go get Barbie.

646
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:26,427
No! Please, please!
Please don't.

647
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:40,207
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

648
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,209
You told them about us?

649
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:46,347
There is no us.

650
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,086
Why?

651
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:58,125
Why would you want to
destroy this family?

652
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,362
You destroyed my family.

653
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,402
No.

654
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:09,036
I told you,

655
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,141
I've always had
a thing for families.

656
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,377
No!

657
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,880
Especially kids.

658
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,387
You did this to me?

659
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:34,829
<i>No, Nica, you did this to me.</i>

660
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,199
<i>You and your mommy.</i>

661
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,270
<i>She betrayed me.</i>

662
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,473
<i>Got me killed.</i>

663
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,348
<i>But I knew a way to come back.</i>

664
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:00,855
Give me the power.

665
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,957
I beg of you!

666
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,507
<i>Took me 25 years,</i>

667
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,111
<i>but believe me,</i>

668
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:26,647
<i>it was worth the wait.</i>

669
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:34,655
Twenty-five years.

670
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:38,158
Since then,
a lot of families
have come and gone.

671
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,963
The Barclays,
the Kincaids, the Tillys,

672
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:48,335
but Nica, your family
was always my favorite.

673
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:53,374
And now,
you're the last one standing.

674
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,911
So to speak.

675
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:04,251
You know, you remind me
a lot of Andy Barclay.

676
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:07,121
He was a whiny little bitch,
just like you.

677
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,323
Did you kill him, too?

678
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:10,691
More or less.

679
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,459
I killed his childhood.

680
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,599
And the truth is,
I killed you 25 years ago.

681
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,668
Didn't I, Nica?

682
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,137
You haven't been living.

683
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:26,573
You can't call this living.

684
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,442
You've just been
on life support.

685
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,981
Time to pull the fucking plug.

686
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:37,117
So you never actually
killed Andy Barclay,
did you?

687
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,421
What?

688
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,589
You know,
it's called
completion anxiety.

689
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:44,458
It's very common in males.

690
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,128
You are a male, aren't you?

691
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,165
Oh...

692
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:54,735
I'm gonna kill you slow.

693
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,140
Yeah, no, I get that.

694
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,477
Twenty-five years.
Must be the slowest
murder in history.

695
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,982
I mean,
what are you waiting for?
A sign from God?

696
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:12,252
No!

697
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,472
You feel that, don't ya?

698
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:51,525
You wanna play,
motherfucker? Let's play.

699
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,319
Police. Open up.

700
01:25:25,321 --> 01:25:26,720
Help! Help me!

701
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,489
<i>Based on the evidence,</i>
<i>the defendant</i>

702
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,791
<i>is declared legally incompetent</i>

703
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:41,862
<i>and remanded indefinitely</i>
<i>to a facility for</i>
<i>the criminally insane.</i>

704
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,720
I'm alive, you son of a bitch.
You hear me?

705
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,990
I'm still alive!

706
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,660
I'm still alive!

707
01:27:48,155 --> 01:27:51,766
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

708
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:56,770
Hey, it's me. I'm on my way.
And don't forget my money.

709
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,431
They never learn.

710
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,003
So who's next?

711
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,308
Next.

712
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:43,817
Good afternoon.

713
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,053
Three-day,
two-day, or overnight?

714
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:48,922
Overnight.
It's extremely urgent.

715
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,724
Fragile?

716
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:53,360
Surprisingly not.

717
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,464
Approximate value?

718
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:02,002
Well, my mother always
used to say you can't
put a price on love.

719
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,839
Under 250, then.

720
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,675
Would you like to
insure the package?

721
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,911
Oh, that won't be necessary.

722
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:13,647
It protects you and it
protects the recipient.

723
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:16,850
I doubt that.

724
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,686
Perishable goods?
Live animal?

725
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:22,956
Just put "other."

726
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,734
Grandma, I'm home.

727
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,006
Grandma?

728
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:40,006
<i>And how are you today?</i>

729
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:43,410
<i>Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

730
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:43,410
<i>Feeling lucky?</i>

731
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:43,410
<i>- Yeah.</i>

732
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:47,614
<i>Oh, that's great, Bunny.</i>

733
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:50,984
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>Bunny has won 17,000...</i>

734
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,767
Chucky, you found me!

735
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,835
I told you I would.

736
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,737
Where's Grandma?

737
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,606
In the cellar.

738
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,474
What's she doing down there?

739
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:15,876
Nothin'.

740
01:30:15,878 --> 01:30:19,579
Chucky, Mommy
and Daddy are dead.

741
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,515
Aunty Nica killed them.

742
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:24,017
But I'm your friend
till the end, Alice.

743
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:29,156
And now it's time to play.

744
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:30,657
Hide and seek?

745
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,893
Hide the soul.

746
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:34,928
And guess what?

747
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:37,697
You're it.

748
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:39,499
Why do I always have to be it?

749
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:45,071
Because you're somebody
that no one
would ever suspect.

750
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:50,444
Now, close your eyes.

751
01:30:56,918 --> 01:31:00,020
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

752
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,452
Package for you.
Really?

753
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,021
Maybe you won something.

754
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,223
Must be my lucky day.

755
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:58,792
Have a good one.

756
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:00,326
Thanks. You, too.

757
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,411
<i>Oh, boy. A seat!</i>

758
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:18,712
<i>Hey!</i>

759
01:35:21,016 --> 01:35:23,883
<i>Get your seat off of my feet.</i>

760
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:26,365
<i>But what feet?</i>

761
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:29,456
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom,
how you doing?

762
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:33,426
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I meant to.

763
01:35:33,428 --> 01:35:35,828
Yeah, I'm definitely coming
for my birthday tomorrow.

764
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,998
No, don't get me anything.

765
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,120
Do me a favor,
Ma, no surprises, okay?

766
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,039
Yeah. I'll be there,
like, noon? 1:00?

767
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:50,376
What are you making for dinner?

768
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:54,013
Yeah?

769
01:35:56,117 --> 01:35:57,884
How's Mike doing?

770
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:01,855
Well, tell him I said hello.

771
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,091
Um... Yeah.

772
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,796
All right.
<i>Come on, open up, open up!</i>

773
01:36:09,798 --> 01:36:12,365
Well, I'll see you
around that time.

774
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:14,267
Okay.

775
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,337
Yeah.

776
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:18,579
<i>Aha!</i>

777
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:33,486
Play with this.

778
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:34,487
Andy...
