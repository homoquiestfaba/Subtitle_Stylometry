1
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,298
Christ, it stinks in here, dad.

2
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,800
Didn't I call someone last week
to clean this place up?

3
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,406
Are you sleeping down here?

4
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,909
The stairs are giving me
a pain in the ass.

5
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,612
Yeah. Well, I told you
you could call me.

6
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,615
We could bring the bed
in here if you want.

7
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,451
- Did you get fired?
- No, I didn't get fired.

8
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,187
- Where's Cathy?
- She's not coming today.

9
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,922
Did she leave you?

10
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,557
Cathy's fine.

11
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,227
Your mother said
she was fine, too.

12
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,729
Didn't stop her
from walking off on us.

13
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,065
You can make yourself
somethin' decent to eat.

14
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,867
Something healthy.

15
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,068
Meatloaf.

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,437
And a little bit of gin.

17
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,341
Gin too much to ask
for a man dying alone here?

18
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,459
Hey, dad.

19
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,395
I need to ask you something.

20
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,632
Leave me alone.

21
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,601
I got no answers.

22
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,551
- <i> David.</i>
- Hey, Linny.

23
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:08,353
Listen,
I can't really talk very loudly

24
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,822
'cause Cathy's downstairs.

25
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,526
<i>I heard at the office that Cathy kicked
you out and you're living in a motel.</i>

26
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,495
Who said that?

27
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,397
That's not true. Who said that?

28
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,398
<i>Wilson.</i>

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,867
He's out of his mind.
That is not true.

30
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,304
Hey.

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,873
- Guess what?
<i>- What?</i>

32
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,909
I'm lying here naked.

33
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,611
<i>Come on, David.</i>

34
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,282
Tell me what you're wearing.

35
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,253
Do that thing that you do.

36
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,556
<i>Okay.</i>

37
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,227
- Mm.
<i>- One day, we go away together.</i>

38
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,962
Keep talking.

39
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,431
Tell me. And?

40
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,566
<i>There's sand.</i>

41
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,703
<i>A beach.</i>

42
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,607
<i>And we've made love</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

43
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,243
Mm.

44
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,246
Say that thing that we do.

45
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,815
<i>This is what we do.</i>

46
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,286
Yeah. Say it again.

47
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:19,658
<i>- It's okay. This is what we do.</i>
- Hm.

48
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,539
Okay.

49
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,360
Hi.

50
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,929
I'm supposed to ask you
for a cigarette.

51
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,537
What was it, some kind of dare?

52
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,873
What grade are you in?

53
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,642
- Seven.
- They don't teach you anything?

54
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,912
This your idea?

55
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,649
- Whose was it?
- Syd's.

56
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,485
The tall one?

57
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,087
She in seventh grade, too?

58
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,789
We all are.

59
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,025
She looks older.

60
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,593
I know.

61
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,864
She always put you up
to things like this?

62
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,933
I guess.

63
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,650
All right.
Put it in your mouth.

64
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,719
A lady doesn't light
her own cigarette.

65
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,666
What's in the purse?

66
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,469
Makeup.

67
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,571
I don't have any money.

68
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,942
I just buried my father.

69
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,845
You ever been to a wake?

70
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,158
You know, your friends are
over there, laughing at you.

71
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
You know that, don't you?

72
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,798
I'm gonna give you
a little tip.

73
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,100
Something that
you can hold on to forever.

74
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,103
What? -I'll even give you
this whole pack of cigarettes.

75
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,572
In exchange, you let me play a
little trick on your friend, Syd.

76
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,141
Teach her a lesson
for doing this to you.

77
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,810
What kind of trick?

78
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,212
Let's scare them.

79
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,916
Let's pretend
I'm kidnapping you, okay?

80
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,518
I'm gonna march you over
to my truck.

81
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,486
And you're not gonna scream. You're
just gonna look back at them

82
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,188
so they know you're afraid.

83
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,824
What? No, I... -I'm just gonna play
a trick on your friends, okay?

84
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,759
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on. -What...

85
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,828
Teaching a little bit
of a lesson, right?

86
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,229
Come on.

87
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:52,898
Get up.

88
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,698
You should know better.

89
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,800
I could be taking you somewhere
to kill you right now.

90
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,336
Your friend should know better.

91
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:35,340
It was a very dumb thing for you to
do to be coming up to me like that.

92
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,950
Which way? Where do you live?

93
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,785
Terrace.

94
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,499
Look, I'm sorry.

95
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,235
I'm not a bad guy,
but I could've been.

96
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,916
Maybe we should go inside and
tell your parents what happened.

97
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,245
Nobody's home.

98
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,616
You have any brothers
or sisters?

99
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,356
You think your friends went into one of
the stores and told people what happened?

100
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,362
No.

101
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,398
Yeah. Me neither.

102
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,776
Purse.

103
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,435
Knock, knock.

104
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,871
Coffee?

105
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,674
Thanks.

106
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,714
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

107
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,683
He was a good guy.

108
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,985
A real son of a bitch.

109
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,758
You kinda made a mess
of things here.

110
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,565
There's a great position
for Linny.

111
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,734
I mean, don't wreck her career.

112
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,137
You put me in a hell of a spot.

113
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,374
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

114
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,244
This is all beyond what I'm used
to, dad dying and everything.

115
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,748
Look, I'm gonna insist
you take some time.

116
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,285
Clear out, let the dust settle.

117
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,720
Okay?

118
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,327
You didn't tell her
you're getting divorced, either?

119
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,945
- David.
- Hi.

120
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,347
Are you going somewhere?

121
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,917
I was just gonna make some calls today,
so I thought I'd do it from home.

122
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,819
Mm.

123
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,362
So, this is what we do.

124
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,131
Is this what we do?

125
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,041
You know,
it hurts me to say this,

126
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:00,712
but you should let one of those
university guys take you out to dinner.

127
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,348
Buy you dessert,
put his arms around you.

128
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,783
Don't.

129
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,385
I'm not stupid, you know.

130
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,422
I know I don't deserve you.
I know I'm lucky to have you.

131
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,029
So, come over
and spend the night tonight.

132
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,567
I can't.

133
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,672
I'm just doing all the things I have to
do so we can spend a few days together,

134
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,407
free and clear.

135
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,248
Did you come back
for cigarettes?

136
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,351
'Cause I quit since yesterday.
I'm on a new plan.

137
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,957
Glad to see
you covered yourself up.

138
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,496
You know, I thought about you
a lot since yesterday. Yeah.

139
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,266
I was worried I hurt you.

140
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,906
None of them even called me.

141
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,475
To see if you'd
killed me or what.

142
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,411
Sorry about your friends.

143
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,213
Not friends anymore.

144
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,317
Tell your mom about yesterday?

145
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,387
No way. -Are you too
embarrassed to say anything?

146
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,561
You lived around here
your whole life?

147
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,098
Probably gonna die here.

148
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,468
I'm sorry to hear that.

149
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,971
What's your name?

150
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,474
Tommie.

151
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,142
That's a beautiful name.

152
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,147
So, let me buy you lunch.

153
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,017
I won't drag you this time. It'll
just be my way of apologizing to you

154
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,386
if I scared you yesterday.

155
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,324
Well, it was pretty stupid.

156
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,093
- You or me?
- Both.

157
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,399
What's your name, anyway?

158
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,970
Gary.

159
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,371
Good thing it's not tom.

160
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,707
- That'd be weird.
- We couldn't be friends.

161
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,345
Here you are.

162
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,580
Grilled cheese with
nothing on it for you.

163
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,083
Thanks.

164
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,887
You know, my grandmother used to make grilled
cheese sandwiches with a slice of pear

165
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,889
when we went camping
down by the river.

166
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,390
- With pear?
- Yup.

167
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,060
Yuck. -Don't knock
it till you try it.

168
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,300
I was actually thinking about
taking a sort of camping trip soon.

169
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,402
Good luck finding a river.

170
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,071
I know plenty of rivers.

171
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,747
Well, I could give you
my email or something.

172
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,987
Why? Are we gonna
see each other again?

173
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,456
I don't know.

174
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,193
I don't really have
that many friends around here.

175
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,085
Higher. Throw higher.

176
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,289
- You get it?
- Yeah.

177
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,794
Yes!

178
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,219
Imagine a place
way better than this.

179
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,758
Acres of pale grass.

180
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,961
Slash of green

181
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,265
down where the tamaracks and the
cottonwoods grow by the river.

182
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,801
You see all that?

183
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,170
Well... sort of.

184
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,506
Okay, go.

185
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,077
There's only one road to get in,
El Rancho road.

186
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,546
It's still unpaved.

187
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:06,484
It's locked in by a cattle gate. You
need a little black key to open it.

188
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,153
Mountains taller
than your eyes can see.

189
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,059
Off to the side of the cabin
there's a shop.

190
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,728
Inside of it,
there's a little wood stove.

191
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:24,068
A little am radio and a bunch
of my father's old tools.

192
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,204
On the work bench there's
a bunch of old pickle jars

193
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,540
with rusted nails
and half packs of cigarettes.

194
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,509
You're not allowed
to have any of those, okay?

195
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,647
Beyond the shop
there's a set of bunk beds.

196
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,251
Looking out at the river and the old,
brown ragged horses that we keep.

197
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,187
I love horses.

198
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,642
Maybe this should be our
last outing for a while.

199
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,211
Why?

200
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,014
'Cause it's weird?

201
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,883
Yeah, 'cause it's weird.

202
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,327
That's a lot of fish.

203
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,337
Oh, eight grand. Eight
grand in two weeks.

204
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,240
- That's a lot of money.
- Easy work.

205
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,178
Where you been?

206
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,414
Jenny's.

207
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,751
How many times I told you not
to walk around outside at dark?

208
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,452
It's dangerous.

209
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,488
Okay.

210
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,765
I know someone
who died watching TV.

211
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,401
No, you don't.

212
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,738
Not someone I know,
but someone I heard about.

213
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,275
Well... he was probably old.

214
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,214
Just goes to show you
that you die the way you live.

215
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,816
Who told you that shit?

216
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,821
Some families do other stuff,
you know.

217
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,489
Tommie!

218
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,226
Look, your mother is tired from busting
her tail to take care of you, you know?

219
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,529
And we sit up here worrying about
you, wondering where the hell you are

220
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,030
and the first thing you do
when you walk in the door

221
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,800
is tell us that we don't
give you enough attention?

222
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,768
I'm mean, god damn!

223
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,905
Go on, take your shower.
Get ready for bed.

224
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,909
- It's not even 7:00.
- I said, do it!

225
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,665
- How did you know to come early?
- How did you?

226
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,400
Seem to talk without talking,
you and I.

227
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,834
Are you bringing me to school?

228
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,537
I was thinking maybe we could
skip school today.

229
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,807
Maybe we should call in
as a kindness to your teachers.

230
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,344
No, I'll just tell my mom I was sick and
then she'll write me a note tomorrow.

231
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,415
- You've done this before?
- Yep.

232
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,949
I'm not corrupting you?

233
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,290
So, where are we going?

234
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,559
Got you a little gift.

235
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,435
You wanna try it on?

236
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:19,870
No.

237
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,972
I like it when it's new.

238
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,741
Don't wanna ruin it.

239
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,481
All right. Seat belt.

240
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,619
Tommie.

241
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,555
Gary.

242
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,358
You really wanna see
those mountains?

243
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,560
Yeah.

244
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,428
I mean, you wanna go with me?

245
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,697
Sure.

246
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,599
Where?

247
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,902
A secret trip
in your secret life.

248
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,505
You finally get
your camping trip.

249
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,907
- For how long?
- Just a week.

250
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,844
Not even two mondays.

251
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,046
I'll bring you back
before anyone starts to worry.

252
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,950
We're not gonna tell anybody
where we went.

253
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,853
You'll have to swear to god.

254
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,755
Swear to god.

255
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,022
You promise?

256
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,525
I promise.

257
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,397
<i>You wanna leave now?</i>

258
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,133
<i>I don't have my stuff.</i>
<i>I'll buy you stuff.</i>

259
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,437
We shouldn't even tell my mom.

260
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,407
She might let me,
but Jesse would never.

261
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,360
All right.

262
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,896
Do you... like cartoons?

263
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,173
Listen, I'm gonna go out
to the store

264
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:05,042
and get us some things for our trip.
We need to be prepared, right?

265
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,013
How long is it gonna take
for us to get there?

266
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:10,981
Two days.

267
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,684
Then how are we gonna make
it back in five nights?

268
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,354
That's why we're
doing this in stages.

269
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,557
So we don't do anything stupid.

270
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,326
It's actually more like
seven nights.

271
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,728
- Can I come with you to the store?
- No.

272
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,331
Why?

273
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,000
I want you to spend
some time here alone.

274
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,873
You remember how to get home
from here, more or less?

275
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,080
That's for a cab ride home.

276
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,749
I don't wanna go home.

277
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,888
Look, I want you to think
about this, okay?

278
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,757
I want you to take an hour,
so think about this really hard,

279
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,760
whether or not you wanna
stay here and wait for me.

280
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,699
This will look a lot like a
kidnapping to other people.

281
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,133
Right?

282
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,369
Oh.

283
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,372
Here you are with a
stranger in a hotel room.

284
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,840
But you're not a stranger.

285
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,210
Yeah, I know, but maybe this
makes you feel a little funny.

286
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,211
It doesn't.

287
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,082
I'm 47 and you're 11.

288
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,751
Okay?

289
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,122
Say, "okay, Gary."

290
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,557
Okay, Gary.

291
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,730
Now, if you decide to stay,

292
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,132
I want you to rearrange the
room like it's your own.

293
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,601
Okay? You line your shoes up in
the corner, you wash your face,

294
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,270
you mess the pillows up.

295
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,138
So, that when I come back,

296
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,274
it's like you're inviting me
into your room.

297
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,943
You're weird.

298
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,211
Maybe so.

299
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,514
But if I come back
and you're not here,

300
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,551
I will completely understand.
There's no hard feelings, okay?

301
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,923
What if I wanna go back, like,
at a certain point... later?

302
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,526
Well, we'll put you on a
plane and get you home.

303
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,195
All you have to do
is say the word.

304
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,097
It's an open door policy.

305
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,067
Okay.

306
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,869
So, we have a deal?

307
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,706
Equal partners, 50-50?

308
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,116
I'll be back.

309
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,051
I'm heading out of town.

310
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,355
Where?

311
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:06,256
Dad's cabin. Tomorrow.

312
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,628
It's for a few weeks.

313
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,664
Well, do you want me
to come with you again?

314
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:18,102
Not now. But soon, okay?

315
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:22,573
Now that he's gone, I just need a little time
to figure out whether or not I wanna sell it.

316
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,090
You're such a doll.

317
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,462
Tag!

318
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,060
Gary, how come
you never got married?

319
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,864
I don't know.

320
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,200
Never met the right girl,
I suppose.

321
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,935
Oh.

322
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,605
What about you?
You ever have a boyfriend?

323
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,873
No.

324
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,076
- Nothing that serious.
- "Nothing that serious"?

325
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,411
What do you mean?
Like you've never been in love?

326
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,514
Like not hooking up.

327
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:44,948
You never?

328
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,118
What is that,
like it's no big deal?

329
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,179
Do you even know
how much a stamp costs?

330
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,383
Like, 50 cents?

331
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:24,054
In 1968, the us postal stamp
cost a man five cents.

332
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,223
That doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

333
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,126
Not really.

334
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:33,363
We have to do a better job of
understanding the world around us.

335
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,100
Don't do that. Jesse does that.

336
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:40,604
- Does what?
- Says "we" when you mean "me."

337
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,441
You're right.

338
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,083
You haven't hooked up with a
boy yet, have you, tommie?

339
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,485
Because it's a big deal.

340
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,422
Do you understand?

341
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,302
There.

342
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,440
The year I was born
is now on your beautiful head.

343
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,288
Memorize this.

344
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,024
You'll wish you were
back here one day.

345
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,228
You'll wonder about the old guy
who drove you around,

346
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,497
showing you so much beauty
in the world.

347
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,671
I know it's not
for just one week, Gary.

348
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,007
Don't say that. It's not true.

349
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,311
I know you had to say that
or we would've never left.

350
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,055
Imagine being a truck driver.

351
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,693
Seeing a man like me
and a girl like you,

352
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,495
talking about things. What do you
think that they would think?

353
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,766
I guess they would think
some guy and his kid.

354
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,035
If they were to ask you, would you
be able to look them in the eyes

355
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,237
and tell them
that's what we are?

356
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,573
- Sure.
- Okay.

357
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,110
"Hey, kid,
who's that guy you're with?"

358
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,479
That guy? Him?

359
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,714
You mean my dad?

360
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,617
Good.

361
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,321
You could be an actress.

362
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,856
Thanks.

363
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,358
That wasn't a compliment.

364
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,638
Brush your teeth.

365
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,752
Let me turn the bed down
for you.

366
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,353
Turn down the bed?

367
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,789
Yeah.

368
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:50,527
You're the kind of girl who deserves someone
to turn down the bed for you every night.

369
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,732
This is like my grandma's.

370
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,775
Are you getting homesick?

371
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,612
No.

372
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,415
A little.

373
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,056
It's good.

374
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,424
If we're gonna be partners, we have
to be square with one another, right?

375
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,659
Right.

376
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:34,438
Thirty three,
thirty two, thirty one,

377
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,807
thirty,

378
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,775
twenty nine,

379
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,677
twenty eight,

380
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,312
twenty seven,

381
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,448
twenty six...

382
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,119
Eighteen,

383
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,221
seventeen,

384
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,823
sixteen,

385
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,791
fifteen,

386
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,760
fourteen,

387
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,796
thirteen,

388
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,364
twelve,

389
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,499
eleven,

390
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,334
ten,

391
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,103
nine,

392
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,105
eight,

393
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:09,840
seven,

394
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,875
six,

395
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,710
five,

396
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,779
four,

397
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,848
three,

398
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,850
two,

399
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,385
one.

400
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,155
Okay.

401
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,264
Are you just a little bedbug?

402
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,703
Delectable pizza.

403
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,877
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yes.

404
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,246
Good.

405
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,548
It's my job.

406
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,884
Make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

407
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,620
You're sweet.

408
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,628
Look at you,
you are a perfect person.

409
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,167
You know, age 11 is the perfect
age to be a young girl

410
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,469
and you'll know it
the minute you turn 12.

411
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,279
This is a perfect moment.

412
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,883
It's like we're camping.

413
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,518
Right?

414
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,888
Like I'm your brother.
We're brother and sister.

415
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:36,626
- I guess you're the older brother.
- No, I'm...

416
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,863
I'm the younger one.

417
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,233
The smaller one. You're the
older one, the smarter one.

418
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:48,772
You're gonna teach me about all the
beautiful things that I'm supposed to know.

419
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,475
Gary?

420
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,478
Yes, dear?

421
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,482
I think I might want
to call my mom.

422
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,086
Okay.

423
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,621
Okay?

424
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,891
- In the morning?
- Sure.

425
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,197
What do you want to tell her?

426
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,834
Just that everything's okay,
that... I'm okay.

427
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,003
Not to worry.

428
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,573
Do you think she'll worry
more if we call her?

429
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,377
I don't know.

430
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,514
Maybe we should
think about that.

431
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,603
Are you okay, sweetheart?

432
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,975
Can I help you?

433
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,378
What's your name, honey?

434
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,280
Emily.

435
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,382
Emily, my name is Melissa.

436
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,584
Can I help you with something?

437
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,421
- Your mom or daddy here?
- Morning. Hey.

438
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,326
Is she okay? -Yeah, yeah,
just a little carsick.

439
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,451
That's the most extraordinary
sound I've ever heard.

440
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,252
Blow again.

441
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,861
What are the facts here?
Do you remember?

442
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,431
I'm running away from home.

443
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,133
Is that what you think?

444
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,038
We spend a week
and then you take me back.

445
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,306
Close.

446
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,308
We spend a few days
and then you take me back.

447
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,043
And we agreed
to this deal, right?

448
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,446
Yes.

449
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,182
So, there's no running away.

450
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,686
You're just like a teenager.
You're going on vacation, right?

451
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,792
Look...

452
00:39:55,794 --> 00:40:00,497
I know your mom's worried, but how
about we send her a postcard, okay?

453
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:03,900
It'll be such a relief to her to know
that you're out here in the world,

454
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,502
having so much fun.

455
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:09,873
And she'll love you more than ever and
you'll love her more than ever. Right?

456
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,612
Hey.

457
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,518
There's room in your heart
for more love, okay?

458
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,521
Okay.

459
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,025
Okay.

460
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,833
You blow your nose
like a honking loon.

461
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,101
Come on.

462
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:04,928
Twenty five,

463
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,664
twenty four,

464
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,633
twenty three...

465
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,904
All right.

466
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,911
One good gulp will refuel you.

467
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:26,082
That way I won't get lonely
until I get tired.

468
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,351
No, I don't want one...

469
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,253
Ah! Ow! It's hot! -Tommie,
you've got it all over you.

470
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,755
Ow! It's hot! -We have to get
you to the bath, cool you down.

471
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,757
- I don't want it to burn.
- No!

472
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,292
- It's okay.
- I don't want a bath!

473
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,694
I'm just gonna put you
in the bath...

474
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,163
aah! Goddamn it! My eye.
That hurt, tommie.

475
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,032
Don't want a bath! -We have
to rinse it off. Come on.

476
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,601
- No...
- Look...

477
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,270
- Just go outside! Count to 60! Go away!
- Okay, that's what I'll do.

478
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,840
Ow! Ow! My lip! My lip!

479
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,042
Okay, okay, okay.

480
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:58,781
Okay, look.
Just gonna rinse you off

481
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,085
so we can get you cleaned up
so you can sleep better, okay?

482
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,556
- Tommie, we have to...
- Go away!

483
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:09,592
You have to get out of your clothes
so we can rinse you off! -Go away!

484
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,928
Can you give me your shirt
so we can... -Go away!

485
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:17,433
Give me your shirt
so we can rinse you off, tommie.

486
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,801
Okay?

487
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,271
Just give me your shirt,
so we can rinse you off.

488
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,809
- Okay. Okay.
- Go away.

489
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,511
Go away!

490
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,314
Go away! Go away!

491
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,749
Okay.

492
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,319
Go away! Go away!

493
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,021
Go away!

494
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,293
Go away!

495
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:47,897
I wanna go home!

496
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,032
You hungry?

497
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,835
You must be.

498
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,371
You slept for two days.

499
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,077
I wanna go home.

500
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,884
All right.

501
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,289
We'll find a place to pull over
and we'll take you home.

502
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:52,495
- I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
- No, you're not.

503
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:55,098
They're gonna be so happy
to see you.

504
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,870
And then I'll leave town
and then you can get over this.

505
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,439
Never to see me again.

506
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,775
I'm not a little kid.

507
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,177
I didn't sleep for two days.

508
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:12,682
You treat me like I'm five. I
don't need any fucking baths!

509
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,218
All right.

510
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,494
You're right.

511
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:28,164
We have to be honest with one another.
We have to tell each other everything.

512
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:33,102
Look, I wanna know when you're
sick or when you're homesick

513
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:36,406
or when you're cold. We have
to tell each other everything.

514
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,315
We'll turn around
and take you home.

515
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:49,118
Just like we said we would.

516
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,398
My god. Is this the most beautiful
place you've ever seen?

517
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,238
Did I bruise your eye?

518
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:16,479
Wanna hit me again
so you even them out?

519
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,759
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive me?

520
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,007
There's something up there
for you.

521
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,351
- What is it?
- I don't know. Open it.

522
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:18,261
Isn't it pretty?

523
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,978
I've never seen so many.

524
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,275
- Can you take your shoes off?
- Yeah.

525
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:47,683
Good.

526
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,022
Oh.

527
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,124
- Cold?
- Yeah.

528
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,100
Ew.

529
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,535
This here is private property.

530
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,239
Mr. foster.

531
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,808
Who's that?

532
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,045
Walter lamb's son.
This is my niece, Emily.

533
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,616
You be here for a while?

534
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,754
Just about a week.

535
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:27,556
Ain't much of a place
for a girl.

536
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,726
- I like it.
- Yeah, well.

537
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:34,263
Girl doesn't get to choose
where she lands, does she?

538
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,200
Hey, em, give us a minute.

539
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,573
She just lost her mother.

540
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,343
Sister? Yours?

541
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,744
Sister-in-law.

542
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,646
Oh, okay.

543
00:50:55,953 --> 00:51:01,290
You got gutters comin' down in back
and you also got a broken window.

544
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:29,685
Listen, tommie.

545
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,721
I feel a little funny about that old
man peeping in the windows and...

546
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,591
Getting any ideas.

547
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:39,028
- Like he'll know you're not my uncle?
- Exactly.

548
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,729
Well, you act like an uncle.

549
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,265
Even like a dad.

550
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:47,002
Well, my dear, that's a very
nice thing for you to say.

551
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:50,873
But neither one of us really knows
what a father should act like, right?

552
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:53,676
- Oh, yeah.
- So...

553
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,579
We'll keep the lights out,

554
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,849
and we use an old-fashioned
lantern and a candle.

555
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,118
Okay?

556
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:23,482
Nice.

557
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:24,699
How do you know
how to do all this stuff?

558
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,668
Well...

559
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:29,572
I've been waiting 40 years
for a moment like this.

560
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,975
I figured in all that time, I'd have
probably figured out how it'd go.

561
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,813
But you didn't know about me
that entire time.

562
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,283
No.

563
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,919
You are a complete
and total surprise.

564
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:46,522
Good surprise?

565
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,592
Good surprise.

566
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,711
Will you miss me
when you take me back?

567
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,551
No hard questions.
Let's just enjoy the morning.

568
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:39,875
- Gary?
- Yeah.

569
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,913
You think my mom
called the police by now?

570
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,750
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

571
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:51,086
Yeah, I do.

572
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:53,355
Are you gonna get in trouble?

573
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,958
No.

574
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,593
How do you know?

575
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:02,398
You don't have to worry.

576
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,967
This is gonna be good
for everybody.

577
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,873
There'll be a new light
about you.

578
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,678
And you'll know about
this country's secret heart.

579
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,080
And you'll be drenched in it.

580
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,349
It's gonna get
all over everybody.

581
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,751
Okay.

582
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,494
You really are beautiful,
you know that?

583
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,852
You are whole.

584
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,787
I am?

585
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,749
Can I get a root beer?

586
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,218
Sure. Grab me a beer
while you're at it.

587
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,988
- Can I have a sip?
- One sip.

588
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,724
Off the top,
and then bring me the rest.

589
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,024
Hello, there.

590
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:46,161
- What you got there?
- Em?

591
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:52,234
Hey.

592
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,069
Go inside. Now.

593
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,538
Get inside! Go!

594
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:05,013
Sorry you had to witness that. She's
never done anything like that before.

595
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:10,786
Well, guess a little sip of beer
never hurt anybody, did it?

596
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:16,725
I saw you walking north, by the river.
You don't wanna do that.

597
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:20,496
We got some unfriendly
landowners up that way.

598
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:23,031
We got this old guy,
ed Granger,

599
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,634
had a metal plate
put in his head in '91.

600
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,836
Hasn't been right since.

601
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:31,240
And he don't like kids.

602
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,775
See, he was up when my
brother-in-law put this place up

603
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:36,478
when his kid
almost lost her arm

604
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,514
on a square of sheet metal.

605
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:42,484
Not the kind of picture
you forget.

606
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,152
I guess not.

607
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,458
There's a hospital
70 miles away.

608
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,960
Should've taken that
into consideration.

609
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,578
You take a deep breath.

610
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,649
You promised there were horses!

611
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,651
Hey.

612
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,587
Can you calm down
and listen to me?

613
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:27,429
What would've happened if I
didn't react like an angry uncle?

614
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:30,911
What do you think he would've thought of a man
letting his niece drink a beer like that?

615
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,168
I don't know.

616
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,840
It's child abuse, tom.

617
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:43,345
And I would've gone to jail.

618
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,982
Then the police would've figured out
who you are and where you belong.

619
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,119
How do you think they would've
reacted to that at home?

620
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,622
Not good.

621
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:01,797
It breaks my heart
to see you crying like this.

622
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,333
Sorry.

623
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,806
Can you forgive me?

624
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:18,647
I forgive you.

625
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,725
When you get older you start to
appreciate how short life is.

626
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,896
And you feel it in your bones.

627
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,968
Now, when that happens,
everyone becomes ageless.

628
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,350
Okay?

629
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,818
Okay.

630
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,755
Okay.

631
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:10,265
<i>A Wyoming couple died overnight
in a deadly fire in their home.</i>

632
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,134
<i>Investigators are still trying</i>
<i>to figure out</i>

633
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:15,237
<i>exactly what caused</i>
<i>the deadly fire to ignite.</i>

634
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,406
<i>I asked the officer</i>
<i>what was going on</i>

635
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:20,509
<i>and she told me that a house at the
end of the street was on fire.</i>

636
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,644
<i>The folks who live here</i>
<i>on hidden mountain Lane</i>

637
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:26,348
<i>watched the flames, knowing there
was nothing they could do.</i>

638
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,792
Okay, open up.

639
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:20,462
Oh, gosh.

640
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:29,471
Big, brown, raggedy horses.

641
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,945
Who's that?

642
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:12,914
Let's go.

643
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,583
Come on! Run!

644
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,318
Come on, we've gotta run!

645
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,256
Get in, get in.

646
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,257
Okay.

647
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,892
Listen to me.
This is the biggest test.

648
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26,061
Foster was nothing
compared to this.

649
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,163
If they come and go
without you being seen,

650
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:29,898
then I won't get in trouble,
all right?

651
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,833
How did they know
you were here?

652
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:33,201
David?

653
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,081
- Hey.
- Hey!

654
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:48,884
Surprise!

655
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:51,586
I felt bad that you're out
here all by yourself.

656
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,788
Linny.

657
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,658
- This is a surprise.
- Oh.

658
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,827
- Champagne?
- Yeah.

659
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,228
How's it been going?

660
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,097
Okay.

661
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,300
Oh, wow. It's so nice
to be back here.

662
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,279
You're acting weird.

663
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,933
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom first.

664
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:49,377
We were just talking out there,
did you hear us talking?

665
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:52,447
- Is she your girlfriend?
- I'll explain later, okay?

666
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,184
I want you to run, as quiet
as a mouse to the shop.

667
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,853
She's not staying long, right?

668
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:02,557
Am I making the wrong decision not
being able to trust you out there?

669
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,061
Come on. Let's go.

670
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:08,363
Run.

671
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:33,989
Is there somebody else?

672
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,226
Just a dozen others.

673
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,563
Kidding.

674
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:44,299
What do you think I'm doing up here, huh?
Having my kicks?

675
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:47,035
- I mean, come on.
- Sorry.

676
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,672
Really.

677
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,108
You know me by now, don't you?

678
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,112
Sometimes.

679
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,016
Hey.

680
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:12,627
I just need a little space.

681
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,532
I need to test myself.

682
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:23,038
Clean up my heart.

683
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:30,412
It's like an old, crowded garage
in there that needs some tidying.

684
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:36,217
I don't know
if you can tidy a heart.

685
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,520
Not like you tidy a garage.

686
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:48,630
We don't have to do this,
you and I, and I want to.

687
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:52,233
I just feel like I'd be stealing
you away from the world.

688
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,204
I can wait for you.

689
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:59,574
I'm willing to do that.

690
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,543
I knew you would say that.

691
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,616
Why does that make you look
like you wanna die?

692
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,722
'Cause I'm afraid
I made you say it.

693
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:21,696
I'm afraid I make everybody
say everything.

694
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,435
Of course you didn't.

695
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:31,339
You're not that powerful.

696
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,575
You're not even at all
angry with me?

697
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:35,577
Do you want me to be?

698
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:39,380
I think I want somebody to be.

699
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:47,722
Well, you can't go around and just make
people angry so you know where you stand.

700
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,702
I think I might be
an awful person.

701
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:10,678
I think the whole world's out there
eying on something really wonderful.

702
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,483
And I don't know what it is.

703
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:20,488
I can't be part of it.

704
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,890
Why did she call you David?

705
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,662
That's like
when I call you Emily.

706
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,334
Everything I do from here
on out is to protect you.

707
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:09,504
To protect us.

708
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,440
Does she love you?

709
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,743
Yeah, she does.

710
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,513
Do you love her?

711
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:20,949
Not in the least bit.

712
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,918
I'm doing this for us.

713
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,357
How long do I
have to stay in here?

714
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:32,827
Just one more day.

715
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,396
Okay?

716
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,511
My stomach hurts.

717
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:53,047
I have to go to the bathroom.

718
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,482
I can't see.

719
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:57,018
We have to be careful, okay?

720
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,320
Come on.

721
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:04,926
I'm gonna tell you something that
I've never told anyone before.

722
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,162
What?

723
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,266
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

724
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:14,435
What is it?

725
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,507
It's about my little brother.

726
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:22,577
You have brothers?

727
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:25,580
I'm telling you this to show
you how special you are to me.

728
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,850
I promise.

729
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:34,555
My little brother disappeared.

730
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:36,824
Where?

731
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,794
We don't know.

732
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:43,798
When he was about your age.

733
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,700
Was he kidnapped?

734
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,704
I don't know.

735
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,940
We never knew.

736
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,747
He used to sleep in a sleeping
bag behind the gas station.

737
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,082
Why?

738
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:07,322
Our house
was kind of a sad place.

739
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,393
I think you know
how that can be.

740
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:17,098
Then one morning
he just never came back.

741
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,070
Never showed up.

742
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,472
Not ever?

743
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,574
Not ever.

744
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:38,886
You have to promise you'll
always call me Gary, okay?

745
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,925
- Say, "I promise."
- I promise.

746
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,458
Hi.

747
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:20,862
Here.

748
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,166
All right. You stay here and you
just hibernate and snuggle up,

749
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,235
my little mountain critter.

750
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:30,438
When she leaves, we'll have all
kinds of new energy, new fun.

751
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:33,107
- Right?
- Okay.

752
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,208
Okay.

753
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:37,812
- Hide?
- Hide.

754
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,448
Hey, what's this room?

755
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,216
It's just the bunk room.

756
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,818
Well, why don't we sleep in here instead
of the mess that's on the floor.

757
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,319
Yeah, they're infested
with mice shit.

758
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:48,022
- But that's actually beds...
- No, they're old and shitty.

759
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:41,809
I'm gonna go get the mattresses
from the bunk room.

760
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,345
It has to be better
than this hard floor.

761
01:14:44,347 --> 01:14:46,013
I told you it's infested
with mice shit.

762
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:49,050
Yeah, but we can clean them.
We can cover them with towels.

763
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,485
No.

764
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,186
What?

765
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,722
It's haunted.

766
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,592
That room is haunted.

767
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:04,699
I don't wanna scare you. I want
you to really love it here.

768
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,200
Me, too.

769
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:09,937
Tell me.

770
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:13,541
All right. So, the owner of this
house was a man named Calhoon.

771
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:16,944
The old neighbor, foster,
he had a little girl

772
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:18,145
with his sister.

773
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,882
And what was her name?

774
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,351
Emily.

775
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:24,919
So, Calhoon, he wanted
to have a wood shop

776
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:28,289
built off the side of the
house to store all his tools.

777
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:31,492
And he and foster
decided to build it.

778
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:33,394
He'd dug the foundation,

779
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:36,297
set the footers,
tied the rebar.

780
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:38,099
And Emily,
who was all of ten years old,

781
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:42,303
she would come down everyday
and join them for lunch.

782
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:46,707
She used to love playing in the yard with
all the scrap metal and all the wood.

783
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,744
And dipping her hand
into the wet cement.

784
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:54,181
One day, they were pouring
the concrete slabs...

785
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:58,419
And Emily disappeared.

786
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:02,123
Sheriffs came with cadaver dogs and
they searched the prairies for weeks,

787
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,091
but they never found her.

788
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,994
They never found her
alive again.

789
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,099
And the kid is still
haunting the place?

790
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,336
Even worse.

791
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:21,609
Foster comes down here every night
with a flashlight, looking for her.

792
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,947
Have you seen her?

793
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:30,217
I've talked to her.

794
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:35,356
What did she say?

795
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,029
She says she's in love with me

796
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:45,066
and she wants to live
with me here forever.

797
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,845
Gary?

798
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:45,186
David.

799
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:47,388
David!

800
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:51,125
Who is this?

801
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,561
It's my niece, Emily.
She's been sick.

802
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,429
I didn't want you to...

803
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,570
No! No! I hate you!

804
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,639
I hate you! I hate you!

805
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,242
- Tommie!
- I'm just a kid to you!

806
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,847
Linn, wait.

807
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:14,548
I'm sorry. This is just such
a bad time, okay?

808
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,451
We'll take a rain check. We'll
come back in a few weeks.

809
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:19,453
Linn...

810
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:21,255
She's my brother's girl.

811
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,824
My younger brother,
the one who died.

812
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:27,495
You never told me that.

813
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:35,436
Now, that we can be closer, you'll
learn a lot about my family.

814
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,642
- I don't understand.
- Look at me.

815
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:44,578
I need you to be patient
with me, please.

816
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,980
Please?

817
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,168
If you don't like her,
then how come you see her?

818
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,469
I told you.

819
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:44,839
For us.

820
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:49,176
To keep each other safe.

821
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,566
This is the beginning part
where we take you back home.

822
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:17,338
But they'll ask me where I was.

823
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:20,241
And you won't tell them, right?

824
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:27,147
I ran away, but here I am now.

825
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,775
Memorize that.

826
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:57,444
It's the 14th post
on the 14th day.

827
01:21:58,014 --> 01:21:59,546
Can you remember that?

828
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:03,217
Why? -The 14th fence post
will always stand for you.

829
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:07,354
Turn around.

830
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:11,191
Turn around
and see our little house.

831
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,628
It's ours, right?

832
01:22:15,498 --> 01:22:17,932
Equal partners, right?

833
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:24,104
I will it to you, tommie.

834
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,508
It's yours.

835
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:32,246
And maybe even more yours
than it was ever mine.

836
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:37,418
You'll move her
long after I'm gone.

837
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:43,257
I will write you half a dozen
letters like this one here.

838
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:46,593
Every single day
for the rest of my life.

839
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:50,664
And they will tell the story
of my love for you.

840
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:56,203
Messages from the dead.

841
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,008
I don't wanna go home.

842
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:05,679
You feel that?

843
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,615
That pressure right there?

844
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:12,653
It's the world calling you.

845
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,725
I feel hot again.

846
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:29,763
If you want, I can go to the
store and get you more medicine.

847
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:33,367
Yeah.

848
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:38,072
We've stayed here before,
haven't we?

849
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:57,424
If you discover one day
that you hate me,

850
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:00,727
that you're angry with me,
that I ruined your life,

851
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,498
at any time...

852
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,734
If I'm 90, you'll
tell me, won't you?

853
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,838
Gary.

854
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,575
You'll buy a pair of steel-toed
boots and you will find me...

855
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:18,579
All alone and dried up...

856
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:22,783
And sick in a nursing home and
you'll kick my fucking teeth in.

857
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:27,354
Please don't say that.

858
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,160
You will outgrow me.

859
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:39,766
You will forget everything.

860
01:26:06,996 --> 01:26:08,862
N... no, I won't.

861
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:28,775
This is how we said
it'd go, didn't we?

862
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:34,548
I'll make you a promise.

863
01:27:35,284 --> 01:27:36,683
Valentine's day.

864
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,353
I'll come and find you.

865
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,590
You'll come and pick me up?

866
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,026
I'll send you a sign.

867
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,396
What kinda sign?

868
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,833
I don't know.
Like a ribbon or something.

869
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,970
Tied to an unusual place.

870
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:01,541
Or I'll break a window
like the one at the cabin.

871
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:06,280
I'll leave it broken.

872
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:08,715
And that way you'll know
I was there.

873
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:15,722
It's okay.

874
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,026
Hey. It's okay.

875
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,796
It's okay.

876
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:48,055
It's okay, sweetheart. Aw.

877
01:28:48,057 --> 01:28:49,623
Sweetheart.

878
01:28:50,726 --> 01:28:52,793
Listen. Remember...

879
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,561
You have to be brave.

880
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:57,564
Okay?

881
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,000
Maybe...

882
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,636
What, sweetheart?

883
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,907
Maybe we can tell everyone.

884
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:12,779
I think...
I think they would understand.

885
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,049
Because...

886
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:19,786
Because it's love, right?

887
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,022
Oh, sweetheart.

888
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:26,226
Remember what we said
about keeping each other safe?

889
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:27,694
Yes.

890
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:29,496
Okay.

891
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:32,532
Will you stop crying?

892
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,068
- I... I'm trying.
- Okay.

893
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,807
A love like ours
is expensive, right?

894
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,778
Think of it that way.

895
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,614
We pay for it
by not seeing each other.

896
01:29:50,285 --> 01:29:54,654
Can't we just... Can't we just
go get a coffee or something?

897
01:29:54,656 --> 01:29:57,824
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
This is the last chapter.

898
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:00,961
You remember what we said?

899
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:04,931
You know what to do
if they're not there, right?

900
01:30:07,302 --> 01:30:09,169
- Yes.
- What?

901
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:14,441
I... I tell
the security guard that...

902
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,643
"I ran away and here I am now,"

903
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:20,180
and, "could you help me
find my mother?"

904
01:30:20,182 --> 01:30:21,915
All right.

905
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,318
- And you'll be strong and beautiful?
- Yes.

906
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,953
Then say it.

907
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:31,158
- I'll be strong and beautiful.
- Yeah, yeah.

908
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:38,665
Don't ever forget this hurt.

909
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,101
Don't ever forget the things
that we've seen together.

910
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:44,805
'Cause it'll save you.

911
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,909
You...

912
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:53,547
Will be an apple tree among all the
ash-colored buildings of this city.

913
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,751
You just need
to close your eyes...

914
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,354
Take a deep breath and listen.

915
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:06,526
Listen to the rain
and the wind...

916
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,698
All that rushing through you...

917
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:16,503
That'll be me
whispering to you.

918
01:31:17,673 --> 01:31:20,173
I'll be with you this way.

919
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,477
Right?

920
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,680
Hey.

921
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:28,882
Hey.

922
01:31:33,288 --> 01:31:34,721
Come on.

923
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,906
You should keep it.

924
01:32:04,553 --> 01:32:05,986
It's okay.

925
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:08,989
We're gonna count to five.

926
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,194
One.

927
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:47,994
Wait!

928
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:49,930
Wait!

929
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:54,034
Wait!

930
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:56,169
Wait!
