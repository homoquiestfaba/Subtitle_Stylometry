00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,280
# Tell me where you come from,
was it heaven above? #

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,800
# Oh, my dear,
I must be falling in love. #

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,640
# Can you climb the sunny peaks
of a fortress in mud? #

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,160
# Oh, my dear,
I must be falling in love. #

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,680
# Did I tell you I want more #

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,680
# than what
you're really made of? #

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,240
# Oh, my dear,
I must be falling in love. #

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
# Can you scope a purple blunder
and admit that you are young? #

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,760
# Oh, my dear,
I must be falling in love. #

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,720
# Tell me where you come from,
was it heaven above? #

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,840
# Oh, my dear,
I must be falling in love. #

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,520
# Can you climb the sunny peaks
of a fortress in mud? #

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,520

I must be falling in love. #

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,600
# love. #

18
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,720
Hello?

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Three hours over!

20
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,720
Shit, lady.
I'm on my way out.

21
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,720
Three hours over!
$21 more if you stay.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
Jeez, what'd I say, lady?
I'll be done in a minute.

23
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
That ching-chong bitch.
Don't worry about it.

24
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Wait!

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,240
Ah, homework.
Bus was late?

26
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Mm-hmm.

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,160
Good day at school?

28
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,600
Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,960
A lot of homework?

30
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,480
I call Mrs. Thomas, science teacher,

32
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,960
to find out what kind of homework
you have tonight.

33
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
She wasn't there.
Nobody was there.

34
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,480
Everybody have half-day today
except you.

35
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
You have long day.

36
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
Aah!

37
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,520
Should not lie to Mommy.
You understand?

38
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Now go.

39
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Rooms are dirty.

40
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Hey!

41
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,480
Come on.
Shut up.

42
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I'll tell Mom.

43
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll tell Mom.

44
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
Shut up.
Let's go.

45
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,120
You got a letter today.
Mommy took it.

46
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,040
I don't care.

47
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,560
What was it?

48
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,160
She's really mad about it.

49
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
Go away.

50
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,120
Ow! Mom!

51
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,800
Ernest.

52
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,000
You got letter.

53
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,440
How come you didn't tell me you
enter contest?

54
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,600
What?

55
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,560
The writing contest.
You entered a writing contest.

56
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,440
Oh, the writing contest.
Yeah.

57
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,760
You got honorable mention.

58
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,200
Really?

59
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,120
Mm-hmm.

60
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,440
Well, could I read it?

61
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,200
I throw away.

62
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
You what?

63
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
You should not lie to Mommy.

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
But I didn't lie.

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,560
You lied two times today!

66
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
You make me upset.

67
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,760
You did not tell me you enter contest.

68
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,560
It was just a stupid contest.

69
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah, you're right.
Waste of time.

70
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,000
But you said I won.

71
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,480
You did not win.

72
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,400
You got honorable mention.

73
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,640
That is not winning.

74
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,040
That is bad.
That's worse than losing.

75
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,240
They tell everyone at fancy dinner
your name and say,

76
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,280
"See?
his boy's not even good enough to win."

77
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,440
You're not even good enough to lose.

78
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,240
Let me tell you something.

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,560
When I was young,

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,440
there was a man in our village who
used to tell stories.

81
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,240
All day telling stories.

82
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,680
One day the whole village

83
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
came to his house and cut out his
tongue!

84
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
Do you want to be like that?

85
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
So, there's a dinner?

86
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Ay.

87
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
No! Don't die on me!

88
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Who did this to you?
Tell me.

89
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Oh, you're so gross.

90
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
Hey, I found a good one.

91
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,640
Oh, yeah?

92
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
Oriental women?

93
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
This is disgusting.

94
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,160
Let's go check it out.

95
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,520
I got the Crème de Menthe for you.

96
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,280
It's liqueur, but it's the works.

97
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,280
Now you can smoke.

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
When you're done, you just gargle
with it,

99
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,800
and your mom won't smell smoke.

100
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,800
It's like breath mints.

101
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,280
No, I'm cool.
I don't wanna smoke.

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
This is so gross.
Listen to this.

103
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,320
"From an early age, oriental girls

104
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,360
"learn the ancient ways of pleasing
a man.

105
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,640
"The secrets of the Orient are as deep
and mysterious

106
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,760
"as their luscious pussies.

107
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,560
You like it, don't you?

108
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,560
No, I don't.

109
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,560
No, no, seriously, Ernest.
It's okay.

110
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,920
You're supposed to.
You're a boy.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, well, it's all right.

112
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,760
That is so gross!

113
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,520
Okay, okay!

114
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,360
Cut it out, Ernest!
Cut the shit.

115
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,360
Why don't you cut the shit?

116
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,320
Get your boner out of my face.

117
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,160
Ugh!

118
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
You're such a spaz.

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,640
Shut up.

120
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, um, I got a letter

121
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,720
from that stupid contest you made
me enter.

122
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
Yeah, what'd it say?
Did you win the 500 bucks?

123
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
No, but I got the honorary mention.

124
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,520
That's awesome.
Do you get any money?

125
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,920
No, but I think there's this huge dinner

126
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,320
at some fancy place in the city.

127
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
I should get to go.

128
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,200
You wouldn't have entered that
contest if it wasn't for me.

129
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,640
Well... I'm not going.

130
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,040
You have to go.

131
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,560
I don't have to go.
It's stupid.

132
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,560
I didn't even win.

133
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,040
You just said you won.

134
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
I said I got the honorary mention.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,720
That's not winning.
It's worse than losing.

136
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,720
They get me
upstage and let everyone know

137
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm not good enough to win.

138
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard.

139
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
You won.
You should go.

140
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Fine.

141
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,480
Hey, Christine.

142
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
I don't have any way of going or
anything.

143
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,840
I mean, if I did, I'd probably go,

144
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,320
And I'd probably take you, but I don't,
so I can't.

145
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I would, but I can't.

146
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,800
Okay.

147
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Hey, Ernest...

148
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
Congrats.

149
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
All right.

150
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,480
Hey!

151
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Fetch it, dog!

152
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,680
Why don't you stay right there?

153
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm gonna go get us a room, all right?

154
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
What's up, baby Buddha?

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,960
Sam ... Sam Kim.

156
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,280
What's your name?

157
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Ernest.

158
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,960
Ernie, I need a room.

159
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
It's Ernest.

160
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,960
Wait.

161
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Pick a card, any card.

162
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,600
Don't tell me.

163
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
9 of clubs.

164
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Keys?

165
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,400
Thanks.

166
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Hey, give my best to Pol Pot.

167
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,760
Oh, shit.

168
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,400
What you doing?

169
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,960
Someone just dropped their credit card.

170
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360
Stupid people.

171
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I'll go return it.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Hey.
Oh, easy there, son.

173
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,080
How you doing?

174
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,920
I knew I'd find you running around
here somewhere.

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,920
You know, I do admire that about
the Chinese.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,840
You stick together.

177
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,560
You know how you been changing our
sheets every day?

178
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,800
Uh, well, I was thinking,

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,640
you don't have to do that any more.

180
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay.

181
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,520
Maybe you can talk to your mother

182
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,520
about adjusting the rate ...

183
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
I mean, since we're saving you money
on laundry and all.

184
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,560
I don't think she's gonna lower the rent.

185
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
Then why don't you just go ahead

186
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
and keep changing the sheets?

187
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,120
Evening, gentlemen.

188
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Howdy.

189
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,640
A very good evening.

190
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,600
Hey.

191
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,280
Ernest?

192
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Come here.
Talk to Mommy.

193
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,800
I think it is time to stop.

194
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,800
Mommy's too old and tired to fight
with you.

195
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,200
If you write these stories about
family secrets and...

196
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
# Come on #

197
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,680
# Yeah #

198
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,080
Okay?

199
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay?

200
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Go play with your sister.

201
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,200
Mommy.

202
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Go to sleep, Katie.
Go to sleep.

203
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,680
Oh... Bunny.

204
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,960
Where are you?

205
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
Where the fuck are you, Hank?

206
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,680
I know you're fucking in there,
you son of a bitch!

207
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,080
Gina! Gina!

208
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
What the fuck are you doing?

209
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
That's my stick!

210
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,680
Gina!
Will you fucking calm ...

211
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,080
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Oh!

212
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,400
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

213
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Will you calm the fuck down?

214
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,600
Get down from there!

215
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,080
Baby, baby, just ... baby.

216
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
Will you please just calm down?

217
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,600
Just get down.

218
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,160
Please.

219
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,160
You know I love you.

220
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,600
Fuck you!!

221
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Motherfucker!

222
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
What's up, gangster?

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
Good show.

224
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,440
Must be love, huh?

225
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, I was starting to get lonely
out here, you know?

226
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,640
Kind of late for you?

227
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Well, we had a problem with your card.

228
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,000
It was declined.

229
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, that's all?

230
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,560
Just a matter of time, I guess.

231
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,560
Oh, boy.

232
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
Smoke?

233
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,840
It sure is beautiful out here, huh?

234
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,120
Well, can I get some money ...

235
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
you know, like, before my mom finds out?

236
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
I'll get it to you, man.
Don't worry.

237
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
What's she gonna do ... fire you?

238
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,360
No, but she's probably gonna kick my ass.

239
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,040
I bet you
see a lot of shit growing up here.

240
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,160
I guess.

241
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,040
You don't even flinch.

242
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Like, this afternoon, I come in
barreling in

243
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,240
with that big,
blond bitch, drunk off my ass,

244
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,240
and I bet I know exactly what you're
thinking.

245
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,760
You're thinking,
"Shit, I hope this motherfucker

246
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
speaks English," right?

247
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,280
Be honest.

248
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,800
No.

249
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,160
I guess I knew you spoke English.

250
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,600
Really?

251
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
Well, I mean, you walk like you
speak English.

252
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
I like you, man.

253
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,560
Thanks...

254
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,480
I guess.

255
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,000
Hey, I don't scare you, do I?

256
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't mean to.

257
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,440
It's a Korean thing.

258
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,160
I can tell you're still thinking about
the money.

259
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,160
It's that chink in you.

260
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,960
All right, here.

261
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,680
Don't fuck that up.

262
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,520
It's collateral.
Understand?

263
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Hey, you hungry?

264
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,920
Has that been there all day?

265
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,480
Yep.

266
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,480
Shouldn't you open it up?

267
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,600
Okay.

268
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,880
Come on.

269
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,400
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

270
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,360
You okay?

271
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,400
If you scream before you do stuff,
it seems less scary.

272
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,960
- Come on.
- Stop it!

273
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
Come on!

274
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,120
- Ow!
- Aww!

275
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Ugh!

276
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,000
Ernie, where we going?

277
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
Mommy?

278
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,360
Mm-hmm?

279
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,560
How come people stay at our house?

280
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,440
Because they can't go home.

281
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,920
How come they can't go home?

282
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,480
Because they poor.

283
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
Is that why they're so angry?

284
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,880
They're not angry.
They're just poor.

285
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Oh.

286
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,240
How come people stay at our house
for three hours?

287
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,000
Because people like to take nap.

288
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,000
Sometimes we take nap in afternoon.

289
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
Oh.

290
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,000
How come they're so loud when they
take a nap?

291
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,240
Hmm?

292
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,120
Did Ma ask you if we were going to
the award dinner?

293
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,000
Reward dinner?

294
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,760
Um, yeah.
I won a contest with a story.

295
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Ohh, you won contest.

296
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,000
But we have a TV.

297
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
Where is my TV?

298
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,480
I just want to go home and take my TV.

299
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,960
Hmm!

300
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,760
Four-in-one screwdriver.

301
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

302
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,600
I could sit here and stare at you all day.

303
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,040
Mama said she's gonna buy me
a calculator.

304
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,440
Wow.

305
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,520
You shut up!

306
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,240
Are we gonna do it, or what?

307
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
You know what?

308
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,680
I think you deserve a nice night out.

309
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,680
What you talking about?

310
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,960
I was thinking
if we went to the award dinner,

311
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,160
they'd probably give us a nice,
free dinner.

312
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,680
Talking about stupid contest?

313
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,080
Well, I thought it'd be nice for us to
go out and have some fun time.

314
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,080
We don't have time
for dancing and fancy things.

315
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,600
I didn't say we'd go dancing.

316
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,560
Hey, how about I make you deal?

317
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,000
You show me story, then I decide.

318
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
No.

319
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,560
If I like story, then we can go.

320
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
- How about that?
- No. Forget it.

321
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,120
Why? Other people like your story.

322
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
I should like it, too, right?

323
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,640
Just drop it.

324
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,680
I want to read it, too.

325
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,000
It's not so hard ... life.

326
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,880
It's not so bad for you.

327
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,880
That's not fair.

328
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
Life not fair.

329
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,080
You always say that.

330
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Because it's true.

331
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,720
One day you can do whatever
you want,

332
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
but not today, okay?

333
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,080
Eat.

334
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Don't question me, pervert.

335
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I want to show you something.

336
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,080
Ugh!

337
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,080
Cut the shit.

338
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,080
After you, Roy.
You're such an a-hole.

339
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Come on, pervert.
I don't got all night.

340
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
- You're a queer, aren't you?
- No.

341
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,600
Are you sure?

342
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,040
My dad said you looked like you'd
grow up to be queer.

343
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,600
Roy, leave him alone.

344
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,600
Shut up, stupid.

345
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,600
We live here because it's temporary.

346
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,600
Got that?

347
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,160
But you ... you're here for good.

348
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,600
You know that, right?

349
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,920
You're such a jerk.
You're gonna make him cry.

350
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,320
Good!
It's good for him.

351
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,320
Shut up.

352
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840
What?
What'd you say?

353
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,320
Say that again.
I didn't hear you.

354
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
Nothing.
I got to go.

355
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,680
Whoa, not so fast.

356
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Now, I'll let you go to your mommy,

357
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,320
but first you got to do something.

358
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,840
You said you're not queer.
You have to prove it.

359
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,720
Either you kiss my sister...

360
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,680
Roy!

361
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,680
...or you fight me.

362
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,160
Now, what's it gonna be?

363
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
I don't want to.

364
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,120
If you don't make up your mind,
I will.

365
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

366
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,200
Wh-o-o-o-o-oa!

367
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,800
Good evening.

368
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,880
Found this one wandering around
by herself.

369
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
I figured she belonged to you.

370
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,160
I hope she does.

371
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,640
$5 for the ride, ma'am.

372
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,440
Slap five.

373
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,920
I have a guest waiting.

374
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
Tongue her.
Put your tongue in her.

375
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,280
- Shut up, Roy.
- Yeah. Shut up, Roy.

376
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,760
Is this okay?

377
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,360
Yeah, sure.

378
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,640
Yeah.

379
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,520
What are you doing?

380
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,520
Nothing.

381
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,960
Just kissing, okay?

382
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,560
Okay.

383
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,040
Your dick is hard.

384
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,400
That means you love me.

385
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,400
Really?

386
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,920
Yeah. You love me.

387
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,360
You make me very sad!

388
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,840
Hey, come on.

389
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,880
There you go.
Play ball?

390
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,920
No.

391
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
The way you flinged that chicken
last night,

392
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,320
I was sure you had a good arm.

393
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Come on.
Let's go across the lot.

395
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,320
I used to be a pretty good player.

396
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,920
I could have played college ball

397
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
if I'd stuck with it, you know?

398
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,440
Well, I want to play hockey, but Mom
said I'd get hurt.

399
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,240
Isn't that the point of hockey?

400
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,080
I only have one mitt, so we're gonna
have to trade off, right.

401
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,360
All right.
The old fireball.

402
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,920
What was that, man?
Give me some pepper.

403
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,280
Well, I don't want to hurt you.

404
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
Hurt me?
You can't hurt me.

405
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm invincible.
Ugh!

406
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,680
Good stop.
That's the way to get in front of it.

407
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,680
Doesn't your dad play with you?

408
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,040
He's not around anymore.

409
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Oh, that's why you throw like a girl.

410
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,720
Is he dead or just gone?

411
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
Just gone, I think.

412
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,560
All right, play's at third.
Come on, hustle, baby.

413
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh, come on.
Runner at third.

414
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,520
Hustle, baby!
Come on! Come on!

415
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Heads up!
Ball, boy!

416
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,000
Runner at home.
Come on, let's go!

417
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,000
Stealing base.

418
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't think I want to play anymore.

419
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
Wild pop.

420
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm done, okay.

421
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
Come on. Why?

422
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,040
Well, I'm tired,

423
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,040
and I don't want to play anymore,

424
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,640
and I got homework to do.

425
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,680
Okay.

426
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,040
Good game.

427
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,520
Just got to work on that overhand.

428
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,880
I'm done.

429
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,240
<i>Hi, this is Grace.
Leave me a message.</i>

430
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,480
<i>If you're calling for Sam Kim,
do not leave messages here.</i>

431
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,520
<i>He will not get them.</i>

432
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,240
Psst!
Hey, Ernie, wake up.

433
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
Open the window.

434
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
What time is it?

435
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,960
I don't know.
I don't have a watch.

436
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,240
Come on. Open up.

437
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,200
Shh! Shh!

438
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,200
Here.

439
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,200
It's not Popeyes,

440
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,200
but it's pretty good for the middle
of the night.

441
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
I didn't know if you like crispy or not.

442
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440
Aren't you gonna eat?

443
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Am I dreaming?

444
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Hey.
What is this?

445
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,520
Oh, that.
I found it... cleaning.

446
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,040
It's real?

447
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,120
People so stupid to forget nice things.

448
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,200
We give to Gung Gung.
He needs new watch.

449
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
No credit for Room 15.
He stay one more day now?

450
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh. Oh, Room 15.

451
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,880
He paid in cash.

452
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,840
You say credit.

453
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
No, cash.

454
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,840
Yeah?

455
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
We can count after dinner.

456
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
Are you stealing?

457
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,720
Is that a customer?

458
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,720
No, Mommy.
It's Ernest.

459
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,640
What's going on?

460
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
Shut up.
I wasn't stealing.

461
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,640
I saw you.

462
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,240
Don't say anything or...

463
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,080
...this is you.

464
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,280
Got it?
I'm serious.

465
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,800
What's this?
Mommy's tired.

466
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
Nothing.
We're just playing.

467
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
Ernest broke a pencil.

468
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Ernest.

469
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,240
Sorry.

470
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
- And stole money.
- What?

471
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,160
She's lying!

472
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,680
I was just making sure the money from
Room 15

474
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
was still there.

475
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,200
Room 15?

476
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,680
Well, you said I should count it.

477
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,640
I say I will count it.

478
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
Oh. I thought you said I would count it.

479
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,080
I count.

480
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
Oh, I thought you said...

481
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,160
Well, it's there.
You can count it.

482
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,960
Is that a picture of me?

483
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,320
No.

484
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,360
It looks an awful lot like me.

485
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
It's not you.

486
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,640
I think it's me.

487
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

488
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,200
That's okay.

489
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,440
Whether you meant it or not,

490
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,680
it definitely looks an awful lot like me.

491
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,960
It's not you!

492
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,160
Okay, okay.
Don't be so sensitive.

493
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,720
You're stupid.

494
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I know.

495
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,880
- Stop!
- What?

496
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,120
I'm not supposed to play with you, either.

497
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,080
- Come on.
- No.

498
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,640
- Please?
- No.

499
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,080
Pretty please?

500
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,200
No!

501
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
My mom says she thinks you're goofy.

502
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,440
She wants to know why you always
hang around outside.

503
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,280
I don't know.
I'm not goofy.

504
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,440
It's a compliment.
My whole family's goofy.

505
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,480
Oh.

506
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,720
Get off the dumpster.

507
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,760
Hey, I was thinking that maybe I
could ask my dad

508
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,400
if he would drive us to your award thing.

509
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,160
Don't do that.

510
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,920
Didn't you say you needed a ride?

511
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,160
There's no dinner.

512
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,000
I think you're lying.
Are you lying?

513
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,360
No.

514
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,280
I can tell, you know.
I have ESP.

515
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,360
See? You are lying.

516
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,360
I am not.

517
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,040
You just don't want me to go to
the dinner.

518
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,560
That's so crappy, Ernest.

519
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,360
There is no dinner.

520
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,800
Fine. Whatever.
You watch.

521
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm just gonna write my own
story about you

522
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,400
and win my own damn award.

523
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,400
And I'm not gonna invite you
to my dinner.

524
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm not even gonna tell you
about it.

525
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,120
All right.
I'll think about it.

526
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,040
I knew you were lying.

527
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,080
Hey, I got a great idea.

528
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm gonna teach you how to drive.

529
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
I don't know.

530
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,400
Come on.
We'll just circle the parking lot.

531
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,880
It'll be totally safe. Trust me.

532
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
I don't think this is ...

533
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,400
Shh!

534
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,640
Listen to me.
I'll tell you this once.

535
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,360
There comes a time in every man's life

536
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
when he has to make a decision.

537
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,760
If he has any cajones,
he'll think about himself first.

538
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
This is great.

539
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,720
You're doing a great job, man.

540
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Shit.

541
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,160
Hey, you like girls?

542
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Sure.

543
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,680
That's okay if you don't.
That's what they say, at least.

544
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
I like girls.

545
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,160
Yeah? Me too.

546
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
Got a girlfriend?

547
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
Kind of.

548
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,960
What's she like?

549
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,960
- Well, she's older.
- Yeah?

550
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,960
She's really fun.
You'd like her.

551
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,960
Well, she drinks and smokes
just like you.

552
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,960
Oh? Sounds perfect.

553
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,480
And she's real pretty.

554
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,440
Yeah? How so?

555
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,880
Well, um... nice eyes, long hair.

556
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,440
What about tits and ass?

557
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,880
Kind of.

558
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,440
Yeah? Nice.

559
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,440
Let me tell you a secret about women.

560
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,440
See, no matter how coy they get,

561
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,440
you put them in front of some high-quality
amateur porn,

562
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
and they all get wet.

563
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
You know what I'm saying?
It's, like, scientific.

564
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,240
Never think porn is bad.
Porn is good.

565
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,880
Got it?

566
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,040
Um, okay.

567
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,880
Alright, this is enough pussyfooting, man.

568
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,760
I'm tired of driving around in circles.

569
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,840
You know what I'm saying, Ernie?

570
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
Punch it, baby!

571
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,120
Whoo!

572
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,320
- You feel cool?
- I'm okay.

573
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,320
You look cool, man.

574
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,520
You look
like one bad-ass motherfucker.

575
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,920
Thanks, motherfucker.

576
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,280
Okay, take this left.

577
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Come on.
Hand over hand.

578
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,840
Hand over hand.

579
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,680
Nice.

580
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,840
Are we lost?

581
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,600
No. No way, man.

582
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,600
We're definitely not lost.

583
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,200
I know exactly where we're going.

584
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,080
Okay.

585
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,200
All right.
This is good.

586
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,880
Now press "send."

587
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,080
When she picks up,
pretend like you're some kid

588
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,360
who's spending the night over at a
friend's house

589
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,720
and you're freaked out, okay?

590
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I don't know.

591
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,080
All right, forget it.
Let's play it by ear.

592
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,800
Press "send."

593
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,320
Hi, this is Grace.

594
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,200
It's the machine!

595
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,440
Just hang up.

596
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,840
How do I hang up?

597
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,840
Press the "end" button.

598
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
No, not that button!

599
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,120
Aah, fuck!
Fuck!

600
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,120
Are you okay?

601
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Fuck, Ernie!
Damn it!

602
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,480
God, get in this fucking century, man!

603
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,480
You don't know how to use a cellphone?

604
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,080
Shit!

605
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,920
All right.
Relax.

606
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,720
Help me with this.

607
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,080
Why the fuck would she move this?

608
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,120
It was fine where it was.

609
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,640
Grab that end.

610
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Hey, watch this.

611
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,400
Watch this.

612
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,440
Nice.

613
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,240
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

614
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,720
You're all right, kid.

615
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Watch out.

616
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,760
- Can I tell you something?
- Sure.

617
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,960
I hate working at the motel.

618
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,360
I could imagine.

619
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,360
You got to deal with assholes like me
all the time, huh?

620
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,360
I hate my family.

621
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,360
That's life, kid.

622
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,360
The first noble truth in Buddhism is
that life sucks.

623
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,360
Just imagine yourself on the road to
enlightenment.

624
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Hey, how old are you?

625
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,200
13.

626
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
That sucks.

627
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,680
When I was 8, I used to pray to God

628
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,680
that he would end my life when I
turned 12.

629
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,560
Just take me out quick and painlessly.

630
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,400
When I was 12, I used to sit in my
room with the lights off

631
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,880
and just wait for him just to zoom!

632
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,880
Yep. 8 is great.

633
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,440
Die at 12 ... you lived a full life.

634
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,000
Anything after that's just an insult.

635
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,440
My mom forgot my 12th birthday.

636
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,400
Fuck.

637
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,120
I didn't ask for this!

638
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,080
I didn't ask for any of this!

639
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,600
I want to be happy...

640
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,200
happy right fucking now!

641
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,680
I hate doing homework, going to school,

642
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,120
and other kids!

643
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,120
I want to be happy... right now!
Hear me!

644
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,560
Yeah, you hear us?

645
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,000
I want to be happy!

646
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,640
- Yeah, I want to be happy, too!
- Right now!

647
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,760
Right fucking now!

648
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,120
I want to be happy!

649
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,640
I want to be happy!

650
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,640
I want to be happy!

651
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,120
I want to be happy!

652
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,120
I want to be happy!

653
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,720
Right fucking now!

654
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,880
Right now!

655
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,480
All right, Ernie.
End of the line.

656
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,720
Tomorrow we'll get you laid,
all right?

657
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
Hey, wait.

658
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,560
Well, I had fun ...

659
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,400
Not fun, but, you know.

660
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,720
I know.

661
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,120
Hey, that's my shit.

662
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,880
- It's cool.
- No, it's not.

663
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,080
Look, I'll pay you back.
Nothing like a good smoke.

664
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,280
Ernest, don't be such a 'tard.

665
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,600
Stick to egg rolls.

666
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,880
Hey!

667
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,400
You guys can't skate here.

668
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,880
Or what? You're gonna pull some
Jackie Chan shit on us?

669
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,280
Seriously.

670
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,880
Look, if I break my hip, I promise I
won't sue you.

671
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,160
Isn't your name Toby?

672
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,080
Yeah, how'd you know?

673
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,960
We're in Urban Soc together.

674
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,880
Oh, yeah.
Hey.

675
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,640
Hey, Toby, who's your girlfriend?

676
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,040
Uh...

677
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,560
Christine.

678
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah, Christine.

679
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,040
Hey, Christine, you want to hook us up
with some chop suey or something?

680
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,880
We don't have chop suey.

681
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,680
Or whatever.
Some dumplings.

682
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,200
Um... I don't know.

683
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,160
Maybe.

684
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,040
Hey, guys, let's get out of here.

685
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,360
Dude, we're gonna get free food.

686
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,160
Let's get out of here, man.

687
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,920
It'd be wrong for me not to kick
your ass before we left ...

688
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,920
a goodbye gift.

689
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,400
- Roy.
- Shut up.

690
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,400
Why don't you turn around, chicken?

691
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,400
I should kick your ass for being chicken,

692
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,920
you little chicken shit.

693
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,920
- Cut it out, Roy!
- Shut up.

694
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,440
Come on, you chicken.

695
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,160
Why don't you turn around, chink?

696
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,720
Oh, what are you gonna do, chink?

697
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,120
Is that it, chink?

698
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,640
Aw, chinky baby doesn't like that.

699
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,760
Poor chinky boy.
Keep walking, you chicken chink.

700
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,200
Come on, you poor chinky boy.
Keep walking.

701
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,200
You're poor and stupid.

702
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,640
You're poor, stupid,

703
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,160
And your father's a drunk, and he beats
your mother.

704
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,600
You're gonna grow up to be a drunk,

705
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,600
and you're gonna be poor and stupid
forever.

706
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,560
And you're gay!

707
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,600
Yeah, I'll be
back to normal in no time, man.

708
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,600
Yes.
Yes, ma'am. All right.

709
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,280
Just e-mail me those reports,
and I'll get them back to you.

710
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,520
Okay! Shit.
All right.

711
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,040
Thank you. Bye.

712
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,520
Fuck.

713
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,080
Ugh! Shit.
That was rough.

714
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,840
Damn! Look at me.

715
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,760
Scotch and Chinese food.

716
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,800
I don't know
how I keep from passing out.

717
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,760
How's school, dude?

718
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,880
School's really good.
I got beat up, though.

719
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,480
That sucks.

720
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,640
No, it's great.

721
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,520
Okay.

722
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,160
You hungry?

723
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,880
Did you get my story?

724
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,240
Good thing I got the lo mein.

725
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,080
I'm hungry as hell for some good
Chinese food.

726
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,280
She's cute, man.
You got good taste.

727
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,640
Real cute.

728
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,080
What is she ... like, 15, 16?

729
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,280
Nice ass.
Know what I'm saying?

730
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,680
Don't think I didn't think about it.

731
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,560
You didn't tell me she was Chinese.

732
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,440
Dude, I would have warned you
to stay away from her.

733
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,760
She's not gonna go for you.

734
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,680
You're Chinese, man.

735
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,000
She's looking for some guy to come in

736
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,400
and save her from all that.

737
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,760
All you do is remind her of it.

738
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,360
All right.

739
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,360
You want to get with her?

740
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,520
Here's my advice.

741
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,160
You got to do something ...
like, really do something.

742
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,920
No more stories and shit.

743
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,840
You could write 200 stories
about her.

744
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,160
She's not gonna fall
in love with you, you understand?

745
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,400
All right?

746
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,360
I'm gonna show you how to get
with her.

747
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,200
Foolproof plan.
Nothing to worry about.

748
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,600
Sam is here for you, all right?

749
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,600
You're gonna get laid... tonight.

750
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,880
How come room 15 didn't pay?
3 days now?

751
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,400
Oh, room 15.

752
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,800
Don't worry.
Sam will pay.

753
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,320
Who's Sam?
You know everybody by name now?

754
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,400
Sam will pay? When?

755
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,400
Mail us check?
Send us gift?

756
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,760
- Don't worry. He's my friend.
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,440
I can pay for his rent.
That's his watch.

758
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,720
That fake.

759
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,240
- It's not fake. It's real.
- It's fake.

760
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,240
You said it was real.

761
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,600
Fake from China.

762
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,040
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

763
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,880
- Why?
- Because I'm your mother.

764
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,680
Stupid story.

765
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,400
- You read that?
- I did not read.

766
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,240
I do not need to read to know
it's stupid.

767
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,040
- You're stupid.
- Huh? What you say?

768
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,560
You don't understand!

769
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,080
I understand
you don't care about anyone.

770
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,160
You don't understand!

771
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,640
I understand.
I understand.

772
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,880
Well, I hate you!

773
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,200
You hate me?
You hate me?

774
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,160
Yes, I hate you.
You know what?

775
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,080
- You hate me, I hate you, too, okay?
- I don't care.

776
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,400
You're a mean, ugly, old lady,
and you make everybody go away.

777
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,560
Get lost, pervert.

778
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,280
- Chris.
- Oh, my god!

779
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,200
What are you doing?
Is that your mom's car?

780
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,200
Come on. Get in.

781
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,480
Are you serious?
Your mom's gonna kill you.

782
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,840
Well, sometimes you got to make
a decision.

783
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,240
And if you have any, uh, cannolis,

784
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,240
you think about yourself first.

785
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,960
And I'm only gonna say that once.

786
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,720
Can you even reach the pedals?

787
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,240
- Are you coming or what?
- I-I don't know.

788
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,240
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming.

789
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,240
We're both gonna get in huge trouble.

790
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,080
Whooooo!

791
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,600
Whoo!

792
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,720
Awesome! Whooooo!

793
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,200
Ernest, do you know where we're going?

794
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,960
Of course.
We're going to the award dinner.

795
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,440
You don't even know where it is.

796
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,040
If you don't know where we're going,
you shouldn't keep driving.

797
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,880
What if we run out of gas?

798
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,640
We'll get gas.

799
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,480
Look, the tank's almost empty.
Just pull over.

800
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,480
Let me look at a map.

801
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,400
I'm not gonna pull over.

802
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,360
What'd that sign say again?

803
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,360
We're not lost!

804
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,360
Jesus!
Ernest, what's your problem?

805
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,200
I want to go home now.
This isn't fun anymore.

806
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,680
What?

807
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,720
I want to kiss you.

808
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,760
Ernest, stop.
You're grossing me out.

809
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,120
I-I like you.

810
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,560
Don't be stupid.

811
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,520
I like you, too,
but not that way, you know.

812
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,040
You're like
my kid brother or something.

813
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,040
Stop it.

814
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,960
- I-I want to fuck you.
- What?

815
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,760
I want to take my hard cock and put it
between your legs.

816
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,640
Ugh!
What's wrong with you?

817
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,560
- I just wanted to prove I'm a man.
- But you aren't, dork.

818
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,600
Well, I'm trying.

819
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,440
Well, try on someone else.

820
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,360
Chris...

821
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,760
sometimes I think about us...

822
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,880
I don't know ...
like married and stuff.

823
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,960
What?

824
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,800
I mean, not for real, but, like,
in the future.

825
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,520
Like, we're married, and we live
somewhere nice.

826
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,240
Oh, my god.
I would never marry you.

827
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,200
Are you crazy?

828
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,800
Ernest, let's go home.

829
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,040
- Get out.
- What?

830
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,960
Get out of the car.

831
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,920
- No.
- Get out!

832
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,400
Are you crazy?
Want me to get killed?

833
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,280
- I don't care. I hate you!
- Ernest!

834
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,400
Get out of the car!
I never want to see you again!

835
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,000
Why are you such a spaz?
You're being such a creep!

836
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,360
Leave!
Get out of the car!

837
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,440
- I'm not leaving.
- You leave!

838
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,360
Ugh!

839
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,080
Think that was smart?
Do you know what you're doing?

840
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,000
You're being such an idiot.
Why would you ever do that?

841
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,600
What the hell?

842
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,680
Ugh!

843
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
Oh, yeah.
That was really smart.

844
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,640
Shit!

845
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,400
I don't think you should come by
the restaurant anymore.

846
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,920
# You don't have to swallow your pride #

847
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,800
# Take a step behind #

848
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,520
Hey, man.
You drive like a fucking chink.

849
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,200
You have to go.

850
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,520
You got to go.

851
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,680
What's wrong with you?

852
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,600
You are!

853
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,400
I'm serious.

854
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,760
Go play with yourself.

855
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,280
You got to go.

856
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,280
Make me.

857
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,560
Come on.
You can do better than that.

858
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,960
You're not even trying!
Get angry!

859
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,600
Come on! Get mad!
This is pussy shit!

860
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,600
Come on!
Get pissed!

861
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,200
Good.
Now hit me.

862
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,920
Come on, boy.
Give me a good whack!

863
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,200
Hit me!!

864
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,240
Ugh. Yeah.
That's it.

865
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,800
Come on.
Don't stop.

866
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,720
What kind of pussy are you, huh?

867
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Come on, you fuck!

868
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,720
Do it, you little fucker!

869
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Hit me!

870
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,800
Come on!
Do it, you little freak!

871
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,080
I feel like I'm 12 years old again.

872
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
All right, get up.

873
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
The game is over.
I get the idea.

874
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,240
You got me good, though.

875
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,320
I wouldn't be surprised
if I had some internal bleeding.

876
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,160
Get in there, buddy.

877
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,720
I think I need some ice or something.

878
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,760
I don't like you.

879
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,160
You're just saying that now, Ernie.

880
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,120
Tomorrow we're gonna be best
friends again, you and me.

881
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,040
You're not my friend.

882
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,560
You don't know what you're
talking about, man.

883
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,640
You have to go.

884
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,080
You want me to go?

885
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,240
You know what happens if I go?

886
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
Hey, if I go,
I'm not coming back, man.

887
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,000
Just like your dad, I'm gone.

888
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,800
You know nothing about my dad.

889
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,560
- Hey, you need me.
- I don't need anyone.

890
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
You got to pay.

891
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,680
Okay.

892
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,160
I tried.

893
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,680
You can't say I didn't try.

894
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,560
Here.
The extra's a tip.

895
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,800
It's been fun.

896
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,200
# These I call desperate times #

897
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,200
# When I'm desperate to lock my
heart in a jar #

898
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,240
# And save it for a break or two #

899
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,720
# Three times I begged you
to guard me #

900
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,240
# As if it is your duty to save
me from this #

901
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,800
# It's all on you, darling #

902
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,360
# I get so angry #

903
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,760
# I break in half and stab you
with part of me #

904
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:04,840
# A jagged edge would hurt like
you would not believe #

905
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,360
# And I know it better than you,
darling #

906
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,880
# The songs just pour out, and I
have lots to say #

907
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,360
# But my mouth is too dry to speak #

908
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,880
# Without a tear warming my
breath #

909
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,960
# It comes as I bleed over you #
