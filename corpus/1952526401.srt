1
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:12,795
Thank you.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,273
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,492
Thank you.

4
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:25,787
Okay. Thank you.

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,345
Thank you. That's okay.
Thank you.

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,388
You are so kind.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,405
Please.

8
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:38,025
Thank you so much.
Wow! What a--

9
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:45,272
Thank you for
that screaming ovation.

10
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:50,067
You know, oh, I picked
the right city this time.

11
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:53,530
Oh, it's true.

12
00:00:56,314 --> 00:01:00,193
I-- You know, I--
Thank you.

13
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,380
Okay.
Thank you, sir.

14
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,479
All right, I get it.

15
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:07,119
You are only
flesh and vagina.

16
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,215
But please,

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,000
I've got to do
a show now.

18
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,253
We love the South.

19
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,821
We, like
I have a backup band.

20
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:18,587
You know,
me and my crew.

21
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:19,302
We love the...

22
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,919
Because you know,
they are not politically correct.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,352
That's what I love
about them.

24
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,666
They have fun.
They laugh.

25
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,146
You know,
they don't boo.

26
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,584
And you know, ever since
the Great Recession began,

27
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,265
I have started
every show with a prayer.

28
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,647
No.

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,309
How ridiculous.

30
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,367
No, with a thank you.

31
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,348
Because
in this economic time,

32
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,485
you know, a dollar
is a hard thing to come by.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,405
I-- I know.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,717
I better be fucking good.

35
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:50,731
I know this.

36
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:52,239
Because I tell you,

37
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:55,500
your boy John Edwards
said one thing right.

38
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:57,137
He did.

39
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,415
He said
there are two Americas.

40
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,567
And he was getting
laid in both.

41
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:02,735
I love this guy.

42
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,996
He wrote a cute card today.
He rhymed...

43
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:14,853
perk breasts with D.N.A. test.
I think that's...

44
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,489
But you know,
they say the...

45
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,343
They say
the recession is over.

46
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,349
I-- You know, come on.

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,895
I saw a bumper sticker
the other day that said

48
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,961
if this van is rocking,
it's because we live here now.

49
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,441
You know, I mean...

50
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,970
That's one thing you can
say about Americans.

51
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,675
They take a lot of shit.

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,949
What is it going to take?

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,759
Some day, soon I hope,

54
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,536
people are gonna
rise up and kill bankers.

55
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,411
Bankers...

56
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:50,281
Poor bankers.

57
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,268
They are not feeling the love
these days.

58
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,806
At my branch,
when you make a deposit now,

59
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,628
the teller puts
her tits on the glass.

60
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,241
You know...

61
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:06,312
Don't you miss the days when
America was just morally bankrupt?

62
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,167
You know,
Osama Bin Laden once said

63
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,978
that one of his goals
for Al-Qaeda

64
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,838
was to bankrupt
America.

65
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,306
Well, sorry big guy.

66
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:27,100
A Jew named Bernie Madoff
beat you to it.

67
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,781
You know, right?

68
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,792
Yeah, we did it
to ourselves.

69
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,778
Like Bernie Madoff,
this always kills me.

70
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,480
People say, "Where did
all the money go?"

71
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,380
I'll tell you
where the money went.

72
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:40,987
It never existed
in the first place.

73
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:44,133
Because America doesn't
<i>make</i> anything anymore.

74
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,213
That's the little secret
about our economy.

75
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,040
What have we made lately?

76
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,041
<i>War.</i>

77
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:49,867
War.

78
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,531
And Snuggies.

79
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,055
Right?

80
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:58,553
That's what we make:

81
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:01,213
Bullshit, Snuggies
and ShamWows,

82
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,424
Flowbees and
Bedazzlers and...

83
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,633
boner pills
and Botox and...

84
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:12,246
Fucking, you know,
pizza with cheese in the crust.

85
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,061
You know,
it's a whole industry.

86
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,686
How can we get cheese into...

87
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,404
How can we get cheese
into Hanukkah?

88
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,854
Or a snow tire?

89
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:22,812
You know, it's like...

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,680
How much manpower
went into thinking about...

91
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:30,132
bratechnology
over the last decade?

92
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:34,153
Wonderbras and miracle bras
and water bras.

93
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:36,493
It's just
pushing the tits up.

94
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:37,229
Am I wrong?

95
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,676
Am I missing a big thing
about this industry?

96
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,848
It is pushing the tits
together and up,

97
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,799
so the boner pills
have something to work with,

98
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:46,853
you know?

99
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,432
The whole economy
is just about

100
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,297
keeping people hard.
It really is.

101
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,381
Y-- You know,
they sell something now,

102
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,673
I'm not kidding, called
a talking tombstone.

103
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,496
That's right.
Before you go,

104
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,630
you record a cassette,

105
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,461
a little message in a cassette
which they then put into

106
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,907
your headstone,

107
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,525
so that when people
approach your grave,

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,916
you're yakking.

109
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,503
You know what?
You're dead.

110
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:22,830
Let someone else talk.

111
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,623
That's really
how I feel about that one.

112
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:30,211
I mean, it's no wonder
we owe China a trillion dollars.

113
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,454
I opened a fortune cookie
the other day, it said,

114
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:33,862
"Pay up, deadbeat."

115
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:41,608
Our Secretary of State

116
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,335
used to go over
to China

117
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,830
and lecture them
about human rights.

118
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,689
You know,
now it's just,

119
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,102
"I'll suck your dick."

120
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,736
It's just-- It's just an
"I'll suck your dick" economy.

121
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,393
Now that's
our foreign policy.

122
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:55,635
That's our economy.

123
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,514
But hey, at least now,

124
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,819
we have a plan
for recovery

125
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,755
that doesn't involve
Jesus coming back.

126
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,069
That's something.

127
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,683
We're going to stimulate
our way out of trouble.

128
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,098
We got a stimulus program.

129
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:23,999
I mean, yeah, we are spending
a metric fuck-ton of money.

130
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,402
But you know, it's not
for shits and giggles.

131
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,627
We have to spend
this money, anyway.

132
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,679
'Cause this country fell apart
in the last 30 years.

133
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:37,075
Ever since they started giving
all the money to the top 1%,

134
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,030
the roads, the bridges,
the infrastructure,

135
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,417
the electrical, health care...
It all went to shit.

136
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,181
This country...

137
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,505
This country reminds me
the time

138
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,301
I went
to buy mushrooms.

139
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:54,181
It's a true story.

140
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:55,605
In the early 80's,
I remember

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,607
I went to buy mushrooms
from the drug dealer.

142
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:01,392
My friend Rich and I,
we were young comics in New York.

143
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:05,731
You know, living in little
fucking rat-infested boxes.

144
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,669
You know, we went to
the drug dealer's apartment.

145
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,585
I was very impressed.

146
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:12,197
It was this big apartment
on the east side.

147
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,006
And it was all lit
by candles.

148
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:19,247
I mean, I think the guy
was mostly a coke dealer

149
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:20,654
but I didn't do coke.

150
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,284
I didn't.
I never understood that drug.

151
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,190
If you want to be edgy and
nervous, go to work.

152
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,813
But I--

153
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,835
I was there
to buy mushrooms,

154
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,359
which I considered a good drug,
and consider a good drug

155
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:37,192
onto this day.

156
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,615
But you know,
I remember,

157
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,287
I was very impressed
with this guy,

158
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:44,089
with the long hair
and the candles.

159
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,621
And I got outside and
I said to my friend,

160
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,702
"Boy, that guy was so cool
with all the candles."

161
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,585
He said, "You moron,
he has no electricity."

162
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,763
He said--
I'll never forget this--

163
00:07:55,798 --> 00:07:58,703
"He put the electrical bill
up his nose."

164
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,484
And that's what America did.

165
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,901
In the last 30 years,
we put the electrical bill

166
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:05,949
up our nose.

167
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,510
And I love
the Republicans now.

168
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,114
They're like, "Boy, we can't
afford things like health care.

169
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,342
"Some asshole
ran up the debt."

170
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,489
I don't know
how it happened but...

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,268
You know, look--
No, it's okay.

172
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,652
It's not a rally.

173
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,454
I mean, I have my issues
with this president,

174
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,796
but he did inherit a mess
like no president ever.

175
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,280
He-- He...
He's...

176
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:39,820
He is the maid after Led Zeppelin
has been in the room.

177
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:40,814
You know, what I mean?

178
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:42,811
Wow.

179
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:51,114
And what I give him
unequivocal props for is that

180
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,181
what he has been able
to do just by

181
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,665
presidential decree
right away, he did.

182
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,048
You know, we're closing
Guantaunmo Bay.

183
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,768
We can have
stem cell research again.

184
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:03,355
We can <i>talk</i>
to other countries.

185
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,382
We don't...

186
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:08,477
teach abstinence in
the schools, you know.

187
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,524
You can't change
the world in a day,

188
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,139
but you can try to get
the smell of stupid

189
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,722
out of the furniture,
you know.

190
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:21,594
No, I know.

191
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,273
No, I know you know.

192
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:24,839
I know you know.

193
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,476
But the Right Wing,
they just hate it

194
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:29,969
when I call America stupid.

195
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,321
This bugs them
like you can't believe.

196
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:36,428
What they never understand is that
I don't <i>wish</i> America was stupid.

197
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,337
But it is stupid.

198
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,831
But those are two thoughts.

199
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,000
And now, that's...

200
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:48,197
That's one more than
they can really handle.

201
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,802
But I don't hate America.
I love America!

202
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,022
Thomas Jefferson
lived in America

203
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,091
and Mark Twain
lived in America

204
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,694
and Billy Holiday
and Frank Lloyd Wright

205
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,892
and a lot of other people
Sarah Palin never heard of.

206
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,114
You see, I have love for
America in perspective.

207
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,526
I-- At least,
I would think so.

208
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:25,214
You know, they have this
rock hard erection for America.

209
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,619
They have this uncritical
child-like love of America,

210
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,292
where to even question it--

211
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:34,727
to considering
how super duper,

212
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:37,909
star-spangled awesome
we are is...

213
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,583
is just kind of wrong.

214
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:42,404
You know, so, they are
always getting their panties

215
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,169
in a bunch about some...

216
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:47,622
stupid sentimental
symbolic bullshit.

217
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,998
Like I remember
the first week in office,

218
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,937
they <i>got</i> a picture of Obama,
'cause it's a big scandal,

219
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,612
in the Oval Office
without his suit coat on.

220
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,840
Oh, fuck. Call 911.

221
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:05,387
You know, because Bush
never took his jacket off

222
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:07,928
in the Oval Office.
And Reagan never did.

223
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,807
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

224
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:12,872
This is something people do
when they are working.

225
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:18,742
That's-- When they are working,
they take their coat off.

226
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,495
It's not a slippery slope.

227
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,647
Oh yeah, one day,
he takes his coat off.

228
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,108
And the next day,
he comes in with

229
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,647
cornrows and a neck tattoo,
you know.

230
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,543
There's a black light poster
of Pam Grier

231
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,061
where the bust of
Teddy Roosevelt used to be.

232
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,301
"Where is the President?"

233
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,960
"He's throwing dice
in the rose garden."

234
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,143
"He's out behind
the laundromat."

235
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,649
It's terrible what's happened
to America since...

236
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:53,636
You know,
they have this...

237
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,639
It's all sentimental-like...

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
You know,
Michelle Obama,

239
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,656
one of Barack Obama's
many wives.

240
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,284
'Cause you know,
he's a Muslim from Kenya.

241
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:07,042
You know this.

242
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,556
But she committed
the ultimate crime

243
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,297
against the right.

244
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,958
She said the thing
they can never forgive

245
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:15,933
during the campaign.

246
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,292
She said
that she was proud...

247
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:22,461
of her country
for the first time in her life.

248
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:26,143
I almost
dropped the Bible.

249
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:33,337
That I was using to help me
masturbate into my gun.

250
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,825
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

251
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,141
We're-- We're surrounded
by rednecks

252
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,122
'cause if you drive
30 miles out. Come on...

253
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,861
It's... It's...

254
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,661
You know
what I'm talking.

255
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,143
But proud of her country
for the first time?

256
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:56,456
Why don't you just say,

257
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:59,076
"Let's go skull fuck
Billy Graham

258
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,109
"on the face of Mount Rushmore...

259
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,341
"and Martha Washington
eats pussy."

260
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:14,790
That is a thought crime
against apple pie,

261
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,137
and she needs
to wash her mouth out

262
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,355
with the blood of Ronald Reagan,
which was shed for us all.

263
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,800
But-- Come on.
I mean...

264
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,071
Girlfriend does
kind of have a point.

265
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:35,307
You know, she's only
been an adult 25 years.

266
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:38,139
Haven't been exactly
our best years.

267
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:42,350
Highlights include impeaching
a dude for his penis.

268
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,458
And electing the cowboy from
"Toy Story" twice.

269
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,114
So...

270
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,024
But honestly,

271
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:04,845
for the longest time, every
Republican election has been

272
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,676
based on
some sentimental bullshit.

273
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:11,135
The flag or the flag pin
or the pledge

274
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,907
or 'It's Morning in America.'

275
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,287
"Bill Clinton got a blowjob
in the Oval Office!"

276
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:25,981
"And the Dixie Chicks insulted
President Bush on foreign soil!"

277
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:31,180
And when that happens, it hurts
the feelings of our troops

278
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,506
and then Tinkerbell's light
goes out and she dies.

279
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,454
Yes, the love of our troops.

280
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,915
The ultimate
in fake patriotism.

281
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:44,856
Are you kidding?

282
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:47,302
The troops...
We pay them like shit.

283
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,793
We fuck them and trick them
on deployments.

284
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,911
We... nickel
and dime them

285
00:14:57,173 --> 00:15:00,271
on medical care
when they get home.

286
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:03,693
Not to mention the stupid wars
that we send them to.

287
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:07,254
Yeah, we love the troops
the way Michael Vick loves dogs.

288
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,283
You know what...

289
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,609
You know how I would
feel supported

290
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:20,495
if I was
a troop overseas?

291
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,226
If the people back home...

292
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:27,159
were clamoring to get me
out of this pointless errands.

293
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,236
That's how
I would feel supported.

294
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:39,885
Don't hold your breath
on that one, fellows.

295
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,883
'Cause, you know, when
America invades a country...

296
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,038
Oh, we love you
long time.

297
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,310
Seriously.

298
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,190
We never...
We leave like Irish relatives,

299
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,798
not at all.

300
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:58,464
We have tens of thousands of
troops in Korea and Japan.

301
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,512
We have over 50,000 troops
in Germany.

302
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:05,265
"Hitler,
ladies and gentlemen,

303
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,299
"I think we got him."

304
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:14,931
You know, why are we doubling
down on Afghanistan?

305
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,492
I think I lost the thread
on this one.

306
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:19,568
I do.

307
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,936
You know,
Bin Laden attacked us.

308
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,339
And then we got him.

309
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:24,655
Oh, no. We didn't.

310
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:26,497
Okay. Okay...

311
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,052
But he was in Afghanistan
so we invaded Afghanistan

312
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:29,817
to get him.

313
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:30,683
But we didn't.

314
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,127
And then
he moved to Pakistan.

315
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,604
But we're still in
Afghanistan because--

316
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,164
And that's where
I lose the thread.

317
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,550
And I'm not the only one.

318
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:41,518
'Cause I know the media--
When they cover this story,

319
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,649
when they get
to that point,

320
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,234
that's when they go to the video
of the terrorist training camp

321
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,482
and they're on
the monkey bars. You know...

322
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,619
Monkey bars. Like it's supposed
to scare the shit out of me.

323
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:57,889
Oh fuck, there are some people
reading the Koran

324
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,334
who are on monkey bars.

325
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,739
Something is going to blowup.
I mean, come on.

326
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,395
I mean, do you even
have to be in shape

327
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,313
to do that line of work?
I mean, are...

328
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,796
Are terrorists like,

329
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:11,444
"Does this suicide belt
make me look fat?

330
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:15,301
"Because I want to be in
the best shape of my life

331
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:17,939
"for this Jihad. I want people
to say that he was--"

332
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,741
You know these plots

333
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,203
that the government is
always bragging about

334
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:29,675
that they stopped
before we got blown up.

335
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:30,916
Give me a break!

336
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:34,481
Like Bush used to always brag
about the Liberty Seven.

337
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,376
You know, these seven black guys
in Liberty City, Miami,

338
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:43,008
who were planning on blowing up
the Sears Tower in Chicago.

339
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,552
Well, you know,
they didn't even have a gun.

340
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:51,974
Probably the only seven black guys
in Miami without a gun.

341
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:57,263
But they were planning on
blowing up, you know...

342
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,244
In the same way
that Spanky and our gang

343
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:01,752
were planning on building
a space ship.

344
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,006
These guys...

345
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,648
They couldn't blow up
the Sears catalog.

346
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:08,511
I mean...

347
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:12,294
Blow up the Sears tower.
Right.

348
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,170
Well, that was--
That was Plan A.

349
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,091
Plan B was just to fuck up
one Sears store.

350
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:18,986
You know, just...

351
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,093
And just the Home
and Garden Department.

352
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:22,124
You know, this...

353
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,494
They were go to buy a dress,
wear it once and return it.

354
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,965
You know,
the whole time...

355
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,128
Guantaunmo Bay
has been open,

356
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,226
we have convicted
three guys.

357
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:43,422
The most senior of which was
Bin Laden's driver.

358
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,946
Ooh, yes. That's what
they said on FOX News.

359
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,859
They have been crowing about it
for months.

360
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,236
Yeah, we got Bin Laden's...
We got the man who took orders

361
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,118
from Osama Bin Laden.

362
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,637
Uh, yeah, orders like
"pull up a little."

363
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,251
"Take the bridge, it's faster."
You know...

364
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,211
It's funny, the--
This guy who...

365
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:12,379
You know,
the Underoo bomber I call him.

366
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:17,612
Remember on Christmas,
you know,

367
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,250
he was going to blow up
that flight, you know.

368
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,321
And right after Rudy Giuliani
comes out and he says,

369
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,763
"Well, you know,
when Bush was president,

370
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,475
"we never had
a terrorist attack."

371
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,362
The way
they rewrite history.

372
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,015
Oh, that one time.
Sure.

373
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, I mean, if you're
going to count that!

374
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:38,159
Fuck, every president
deserves a mulligan.

375
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,713
I mean...

376
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,917
You know, the bottom line
is that it's stupid

377
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,865
to use the Army

378
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,114
as we are doing
to fight terrorism.

379
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,308
<i>They</i> don't have an army.

380
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,086
They have
exploding underwear.

381
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:58,577
You know, Iraq, the only thing
I would say about that

382
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,369
is next time
we go to war for oil,

383
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:02,958
get some oil.

384
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,753
You know, we didn't
have to torture people

385
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,879
to beat the Nazis.

386
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:22,809
We didn't have to tap phones
to beat the Soviet Union.

387
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:24,824
But I live in a country now

388
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,120
where I assume every call,
you know, is tapped.

389
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,186
I treat every call
like a drug call.

390
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,114
I do.

391
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:35,756
Remember
the old drug calls?

392
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,440
"Yeah, I'd like two shirts,
please."

393
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:43,188
"And no seeds
in the shirts this time."

394
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:46,198
Don't you hate it when there
were seeds in your shirts?

395
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,897
Ah, you kids today, you don't
remember the seeds, you punks.

396
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,206
You just go
to the store and buy it.

397
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,942
But we had
to deal with seeds.

398
00:20:56,906 --> 00:21:00,700
There is another war
that never ends, right?

399
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:02,346
The drug war.

400
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:08,479
I just like to point out that
Keith Richards is alive.

401
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:13,102
And Michael Jackson
is dead.

402
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,723
I know. I'm...

403
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,784
But I'm not wrong.
Okay...

404
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,661
No, we all loved
Michael Jackson.

405
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,613
But it is so ridiculous how
America is obsessed with

406
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,576
finding out
what killed Michael Jackson.

407
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,063
Put his doctor on trial.

408
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:31,568
We got to get
to the bottom of this.

409
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:35,463
How could
a constantly anesthethised,

410
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:40,360
drug addicted,
noseless skeleton,

411
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:45,988
have slipped away
from us so suddenly?

412
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,328
Oh, America!

413
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:54,609
I could never leave you.
You amuse me!

414
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:57,653
You're like my dog.
Dumb, I suppose,

415
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,309
but you make me laugh.

416
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,135
I just have
a different view of health

417
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,851
than mainstream America.
People know this.

418
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,965
You know, Michael Jackson's
autopsy report, it said

419
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,746
he was in good health.

420
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:19,390
To me,
he looked a little pale.

421
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:22,534
I don't know.

422
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,721
And you know...

423
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:34,835
And Michael Jackson's memorial,

424
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,465
which, by the way, was
a kick-ass music extravaganza

425
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,657
in the middle of the day
on free TV,

426
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:46,174
Stevie Wonder
got up and he said,

427
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:48,160
"We needed Michael
here on Earth.

428
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:49,719
"But God needed him more."

429
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,228
And I remember thinking,

430
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:53,394
"<i>Really?</i>"

431
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:56,623
God needs people?

432
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:58,928
God needs singers?

433
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,452
God's up there going,

434
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:03,731
"Oh, fuck.
There is nothing on."

435
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:10,494
"There is never anything on.

436
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,952
"I'm tired of Sinatra and Elvis,
Andy Williams.

437
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:17,449
"Get that Michael Jackson
up here!

438
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,421
"I used to love that
moonwalk thing he did.

439
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,033
"Get that motherfucker up here!
He's going to entertain me."

440
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,077
So...

441
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,056
Okay, so this brings me
to the part of the show

442
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,425
that's about religion.
No, I usually do not--

443
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:41,335
I usually do not
introduce topics.

444
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,205
But believe it or not,
even at this point,

445
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,537
people walk out
when I talk about this.

446
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:48,345
You think it comes
preadvertised but, you know...

447
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,311
But I'm just saying this,

448
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,291
in case you were
thinking of walking out.

449
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,751
I just want you
to know two things.

450
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:57,490
One, that
until this point,

451
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,308
it was a pretty good show.

452
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,780
You can't deny that.

453
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,152
I am just saying this
if you walk out,

454
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,807
you will have at least
seen a half-hour.

455
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:16,946
You know,
they can be like... all right.

456
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,438
But also, I'm not going
to talk about it forever.

457
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:23,765
Okay, just a few minutes.

458
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,692
Indulge me.

459
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,406
I don't have to guild the lily.

460
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,326
I've made my points
on this subject.

461
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,568
I know "Religulous"
played in Raleigh.

462
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:31,743
There was a lot of...

463
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:33,209
Thank you.

464
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,854
Let me tell you something.

465
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:39,145
There was
a lot of Southern states.

466
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,121
For that movie, I got a lot of
messages from people that said

467
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,763
I had to drive 300 miles
to see this movie.

468
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,091
And I used to always say,
"Well, that's good practice

469
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:50,380
"for when you need
an abortion because...

470
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:54,696
"that's probably the same 300 miles
you are going to have to..."

471
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:57,565
So, just let me answer

472
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:00,414
a couple of the criticisms
that were leveled at me

473
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,135
for making this
informed here.

474
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:03,791
'Cause I think
they were bullshit.

475
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,535
And the first one was,

476
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,577
"Oh, Bill.
You're such a meanie."

477
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,624
"Why do you have to go after religion?
It gives people comfort.

478
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:12,939
"It doesn't hurt anything."

479
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,638
Okay, well,
other than most wars.

480
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:23,345
The Crusades,
the Inquisition, 9/11,

481
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,175
arranged marriages to minors,
blowing up girl schools,

482
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,274
the suppression of
women and homosexuals,

483
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:34,898
fatwas, ethnic cleansing,

484
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:42,201
honor rape, human sacrifice,
burning witches, suicide bombings,

485
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,238
condoning slavery

486
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,350
and the systematic
fucking of children...

487
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:52,213
There's a few little things
that I have a problem with.

488
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:52,810
So...

489
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:56,249
Okay.
Again, not a rally.

490
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,367
And I see people in the
front row who are like

491
00:25:58,426 --> 00:25:59,990
"Fuck you, Bill Maher."

492
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:02,992
"When my wife dragged me
to this show,

493
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:05,300
"I expected a little
something different."

494
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:16,146
A sweater vest in 2010.
That...

495
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:19,126
Let me guess, Republican?

496
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,202
But anyway...

497
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,010
But I think
I know the reason

498
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:28,428
that the god who doesn't
exist put me on Earth.

499
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:29,441
I do. I think...

500
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:33,339
It's-- It's to make
that connection

501
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,628
for people who say,
"It doesn't do any harm."

502
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,948
So let me give you
some practical examples.

503
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:38,682
Okay.

504
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:40,713
Number one, the Pope.

505
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:42,965
Who I love.
I'm not knocking the Pope.

506
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,698
He's a fantastic
Catholic celebrity.

507
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,851
He is... He's--

508
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,781
The Pope-- This is true.

509
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,918
The Pope has
a Facebook page.

510
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:55,420
That's true.
I'm not making that up.

511
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:58,999
The creepy thing is
Under Relationship status,

512
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,547
he put 'It's Complicated.'

513
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:02,872
That's--
That's the creepy thing.

514
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:13,579
But the Pope last year went to Africa

515
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:15,477
for a reunion with Romel.

516
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:19,849
It's just a joke.
Again, I'm not--

517
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:24,455
No, it's a joke. I--
See-- The thing--

518
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,512
I'm not after the Pope.

519
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,612
By the same token,
when it's the Pope,

520
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,960
I don't <i>pause</i>
to make a joke.

521
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,823
Okay, he's just a man.

522
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:36,533
He puts his dress on one leg at
a time like everybody else.

523
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:40,094
He's not holier than us 'cause he,
you know, wears a costume.

524
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,735
I can buy a pointy hat.
I just don't.

525
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,228
Okay. But I'm not mad
at the Pope for that.

526
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,283
He wasn't a Nazi.

527
00:27:46,318 --> 00:27:47,340
But what
I'm mad at him for

528
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,934
is going to the continent
most ravaged by AIDS

529
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,987
and telling them they
couldn't use condoms.

530
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:57,478
So don't tell me religion
doesn't do any actual harm.

531
00:27:57,538 --> 00:27:59,083
All right.
Not a rally.

532
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,804
Thank you.
Not a rally.

533
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,433
Here's another example...

534
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:07,368
Very practical.
Close to the home.

535
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:09,284
Stem cell research.

536
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,323
Now, as you know,

537
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:13,736
for the last eight years,

538
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:16,470
we couldn't have
stem cell research

539
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:19,641
because President
Larry the Cable Guy--

540
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,858
Not funny,
I know--

541
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,593
Cock-blocked
stem cell research

542
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,273
because, you know,
when he got into office,

543
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,971
he asked
a very important question.

544
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:43,301
He said,
"What is stem cell research?"

545
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,144
And they sat him down
and they explained

546
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,642
when a daddy loves
a mommy very much--

547
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,197
Look, you know,
what is this stem cell?

548
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:58,992
It's a microscopic
specklet of goo

549
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:02,787
in a Petri dish, or as
the Conservatives call it,

550
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,800
a baby.

551
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,163
Except
it's not a baby.

552
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,297
You know
how I know this?

553
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,044
Because you know
what they do with it?

554
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,839
They freeze it.
They put it in the freezer.

555
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,042
You can't do that
with a baby, okay.

556
00:29:18,077 --> 00:29:18,777
I mean...

557
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:21,450
I don't know
a lot about babies.

558
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:23,513
I've never even
touched a baby.

559
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:26,331
But I know you can't
put one in the freezer.

560
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:28,811
You know
how I know this?

561
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:31,656
Because if Americans
could do that, oh, they would.

562
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:35,553
Oh, absolutely.
There are yuppie couples.

563
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:36,510
It'd be like,

564
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:38,543
"Geez, we're so busy
this month."

565
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:44,943
"Fuck. And we've always
wanted to see Italy. You know,

566
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,849
"just put the baby in
the freezer."

567
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,283
"When we get back from the trip,
we'll thaw it out."

568
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,869
Okay, here is the last thing
I'll say about this,

569
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:57,009
and then I'll get off it.

570
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:59,005
But in a recent poll,

571
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:02,549
61% of Americans agreed
with the statement

572
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,552
religion solves
all or most of my problems.

573
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,522
Which is great.
Expect for one little thing.

574
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:10,954
It doesn't.

575
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,179
Oh, yeah. That's right.
It doesn't.

576
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:17,086
You can't pray away
global warming.

577
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:19,339
And that's the difference...

578
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:24,596
between religious people
and sane people.

579
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:26,645
We--

580
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:31,699
It is.

581
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,118
We fear different things.

582
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:38,792
I fear climate change.

583
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,910
They fear a demon in
a red body suit with a pitch fork.

584
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:50,381
I fear terrorists
getting a nuclear bomb

585
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,903
into the port of
Long Beach.

586
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:56,700
They fear not getting picked
when their imaginary friend

587
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,704
comes back
for the Rapture.

588
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,545
You know, the--
"Oh, I was in the bathroom.

589
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:03,920
"And the Rapture came.
Fuck, I--"

590
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,984
Here is
a frightening statistic.

591
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:09,828
One out
of four Americans

592
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:15,403
believes that Jesus will return
to Earth in <i>their</i> lifetime.

593
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,329
See, that's religion.

594
00:31:17,364 --> 00:31:18,539
Ego.

595
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,067
Masquerading as humility.

596
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:23,140
Jesus is coming back.

597
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:26,792
Of course he's going
to want to meet <i>me.</i>

598
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:31,978
"Hi, Jesus!
Bob Flemstine, big fan."

599
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:34,273
"Big fan.

600
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:37,083
"I know you're crazy busy with
the Rapture and everything.

601
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:39,788
"But could you sign?"
I--

602
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,652
I don't want
to be that guy, but...

603
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,864
So, you know, people
come up to me all the time

604
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:50,952
and they say, "Bill, I'm with you.
I saw your movie.

605
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:52,579
"We're right here.

606
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:55,620
"You know, I don't believe in
that crazy Biblical nonsense,

607
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:57,233
"just the central story."

608
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:01,760
Oh, you mean
the stupidest part?

609
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,005
I mean, come on.

610
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,376
God had a son.

611
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:09,215
I mean, time-out.
God had a son?

612
00:32:09,815 --> 00:32:12,585
He is powerful
beyond all imagination.

613
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:17,502
He exists in a realm above time
and space but he has kids?

614
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:22,131
What is this bonanza?
He has a son.

615
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,343
God had a son
and he said to him,

616
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:29,160
"Jesus, I am sending you down
to Earth on a suicide mission."

617
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,273
"But don't worry,
they can't kill you

618
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:34,716
"because you're really me.

619
00:32:38,314 --> 00:32:40,092
"But it is going
to hurt for a few days.

620
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:42,010
"I'm not gonna lie
about that, son.

621
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,980
"There's about three days
you're going to hate me.

622
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,473
"But I'm doing this
for you.

623
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:48,654
"I mean <i>me!</i>

624
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,531
"What am I saying?
I'm me. You're me.

625
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:51,355
"You're you. But...

626
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:55,671
"I know myself but I have you.
Me! What am I saying?"

627
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:59,374
Anyway, all right.

628
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:01,199
Now...

629
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,763
"Now, Jesus,
here is the plan.

630
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:13,509
"I, God the father,
wink, wink.

631
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,620
"I'll go down to Earth first.

632
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:19,224
"You see, we'll split up the work
'cause there's two of us.

633
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,183
"<i>Not really.</i>

634
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,008
"I'm going down to Earth and
I'll see if I can't find a...

635
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,892
"virgin Palestinian woman
to impregnate

636
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,452
"so that she can
give birth to you.

637
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:33,055
"I mean <i>me.</i>"

638
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:35,399
"What am I saying?"

639
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,867
It's like Faye Dunaway
in "China Town."

640
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:40,923
My sister. My daughter.
My sister. My daughter. I mean...

641
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,258
It is one of the silliest stories
I've ever heard

642
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,715
but I don't mean
to offend.

643
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:50,164
But you know, I--
Look, I get it.

644
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,348
Jesus was a cool guy

645
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:56,537
with the hippy philosophy and
the long walks on the water

646
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:59,145
that turns into fishing trips
with the guys.

647
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,858
I-- You know, I'm down
with all that.

648
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:05,839
You know, it doesn't
sound crazy that story to us

649
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:07,339
because we're used to it.

650
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,151
It's been around
for 2,000 years.

651
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:12,067
To really understand
how whack religion is,

652
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:14,196
you have to look
at the new religions.

653
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:19,893
Which for this country is
Mormons and Scientologists.

654
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,588
Who I think should merge and
make more montology.

655
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:28,729
But that's where you
really see it.

656
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:29,693
Because, for example,

657
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:32,335
every religion
has a creation myth.

658
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:37,939
You know what
the Scientology Creation Myth is?

659
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:41,169
They think that
12 trillion years ago,

660
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:45,810
a time frame no scientist
believe exists, but okay...

661
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:51,097
12 trillion years ago,
a galactic warrior named Xenu

662
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,720
was looking
to depopulate his planet

663
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,604
so he took
all the souls to Earth,

664
00:34:56,605 --> 00:35:00,307
bury them under volcanoes and
blew them up later with atom bombs.

665
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,135
Now just for a moment,

666
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:09,178
imagine the balls
it takes

667
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:13,103
to stand in front
of another human being

668
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:18,635
and tell them what happened
12 trillion years ago.

669
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:22,465
And I don't mean in general terms
like the planets were cooling.

670
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:25,261
I mean he knows
the dude's name.

671
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:28,625
Xenu.
Oh, yeah.

672
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:32,233
That cat from 12 trillion--
Yes, of course, Xenu.

673
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,629
I mean if someone
tells you this...

674
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:42,021
story, the only logical
response is to say,

675
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,524
"Well, I guess
anything's possible."

676
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:49,382
And then backpedal
while maintaining a smile

677
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:54,348
and dialing 911 in your pocket.
'Cause that's fucking crazy.

678
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:57,276
So you know...

679
00:35:57,311 --> 00:36:00,197
Jesus, Xenu, either you believe
in ghosts or you don't.

680
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,189
People say what's the harm
with religion?

681
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,751
It's mass delusion.

682
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:08,226
Any time there's mass delusion,
bad things do follow.

683
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:09,718
So I'll get off that now.

684
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,374
But, you know, mass delusion...

685
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,213
We have it in politics too.

686
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,774
I don't know
if it's exactly separated but...

687
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,053
I saw a recent poll...

688
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:25,751
58% of republicans don't think
Barack Obama is an American.

689
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:30,420
Because he has
a "birth certificate"

690
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:34,044
that looks exactly
like everyone elses.

691
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,398
But no.
He's not an American.

692
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,643
Hawaii is not a state.
And um...

693
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:43,940
They'd like
to give him a blood test.

694
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,175
He might be a werewolf.

695
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:50,740
You know what, I will show you
Obama's birth certificate

696
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,843
when you show me
Sarah Palin's high school diploma.

697
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:54,680
How about that?

698
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,509
Right.

699
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,370
As a comedian, you can
always depend on Sarah Palin

700
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,274
to take a drink of water.
That's what I--

701
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,760
That's what I love about
this bitch. Okay. But...

702
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:25,950
But you know, I mean,
a lot of this birther stuff

703
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:28,739
is obviously just racism.

704
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:30,708
It's funny the way--

705
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:38,183
Racism has really
grown up if you will,

706
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:39,817
you know,
from the Jim Crow days.

707
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,279
It's just
a lot more subtle.

708
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,791
You know, it's--
During the campaign,

709
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:46,183
Last campaign, I remember
in Pennsylvania,

710
00:37:46,218 --> 00:37:50,580
a Northern state, something like
10% of the people told pollsters,

711
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,365
that is, they said
right out in public,

712
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,337
that they were "not ready"
for a black president.

713
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:59,071
You know, and the media
treated this very--

714
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:00,946
Yeah, not ready. You know,
nothing racist there.

715
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:04,340
Just not-- Not ready.
You know, the man's not ready.

716
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:06,879
I'm not ready.

717
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,129
Please, I am very fragile
right now.

718
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,745
Maybe in 10 years, I could bear
the sight of a black man

719
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,256
getting on Air Force One,
but right now, I'm-- I'm not ready.

720
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:21,626
Okay. You know,
I mean, look.

721
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,728
Conservatives, there are--
I know so many of them.

722
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,695
They do my show.
They're nice people.

723
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,880
So many of them so nice.
But they do have a blind spot

724
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,492
about race.

725
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:32,046
Which is why they...

726
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:34,749
The only racism
they can see now

727
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:36,788
is reverse racism.

728
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,256
Right. This was
the big problem with

729
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,953
Supreme Court Justice
Sonia Sotomayor

730
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:44,453
is that she was
a reverse racist.

731
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:47,361
Yes, that's the problem.

732
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:50,726
For too long,
Puerto Rican women

733
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:55,257
have had their boot on
the neck of the white man.

734
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,973
But I'm telling you,
the Conservatives are nice people.

735
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,709
They don't see it that way.
They don't dislike

736
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,790
Sonia Sotomayor
as a woman or a person

737
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:16,831
or a cleaning lady,
you know. The--

738
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,491
It's just that,
you know,

739
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:21,353
you have to understand
the tea bagger mindset.

740
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:24,473
They have this nostalgia

741
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,451
for this America that
they think was stolen

742
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:29,506
from this that used to be
that was better.

743
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,544
It's really the 1950's, okay?

744
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,401
That's what they think
was Shangri-La

745
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:36,413
and you know
what they never get is that...

746
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,694
It's kind of insulting

747
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:42,429
to a lot of Americans
to pine for this era.

748
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,604
'Cause it wasn't that good
for a lot of people.

749
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,161
It was good
if you were a white man.

750
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,437
It wasn't that good
if you were

751
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:57,684
Mexican or Black or Jewish
or disabled or gay or a woman.

752
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:58,818
I mean...

753
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:00,581
You know that...

754
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,231
You know that
in the 1950's,

755
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:11,205
the big sitcom was
the Honeymooners, right?

756
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:13,781
And every week,
Ralph Kramden

757
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,423
at some point in the show,

758
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:19,805
when Alice got under his skin,
he would say, "To the moon, Alice!"

759
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:23,743
That's right.

760
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:26,927
America's biggest sitcom star
would basically say,

761
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:30,425
"You stupid cunt.
If you continue to annoy me,

762
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:33,704
"I'm going to punch you
in the face."

763
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,094
"I'm going to ball up my fist

764
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:41,049
"and punch you in the fucking face
until you hit another planet."

765
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:43,279
And America was
completely cool with this.

766
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,128
They were like,

767
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:46,940
"Well, he is the husband.
I mean,

768
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:48,751
"if she's annoying him,
he has every right

769
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,566
"to punch her in the face."

770
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:57,095
It's hard to imagine Ray Romano
doing that, you know.

771
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,382
So you know,
to be pining for this era,

772
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,575
and that's what it
always is.

773
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,425
The cry from Goober Nation.

774
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:12,646
Always about,
"We want our country back!"

775
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,632
You know,
like it went anywhere.

776
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:17,111
And Obama
is taking away our freedoms.

777
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:20,161
What-- What freedoms
exactly has he taken away?

778
00:41:20,162 --> 00:41:23,246
I think just the freedom
to live under a white president?

779
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:27,506
I think that's the only freedom
we've actually seen taken away.

780
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,012
And you know,
there's a--

781
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:37,594
And ever since Obama
came on the scene,

782
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:42,420
there is a word that has
been sticking in their throats

783
00:41:42,455 --> 00:41:45,078
that they would love to say,
but they can't.

784
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:47,097
'Cause it's not the 1950's.

785
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,334
They would love
to say this word.

786
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,604
It begins with "N"
and ends with "R"

787
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:53,115
and it's not 'Nation Builder'.

788
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,064
But they can't.
So they call him a...

789
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:04,829
Socialist or a Communist
or a community organizer.

790
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,652
You get the--

791
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,926
Every name in the book.

792
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,737
The funniest
during the campaign

793
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:12,198
when they ran out
of every other word

794
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:15,274
they said,
"He was a celebrity."

795
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,150
Oh, fuck.

796
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,938
Not that of all things,

797
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:24,392
a celebrity attracting
large crowds to stadiums.

798
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:26,189
Whatever.

799
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:28,825
If you like that
sort of a thing.

800
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:30,753
Lots of people
who believe in you.

801
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:31,407
Yeah.

802
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:36,626
John McCain was in the much more
appropriately sized function room

803
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,091
at the Olive Gardens.

804
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:46,172
And half of those people came
for the free prostate exam.

805
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:51,477
Oh, I kid the Republicans.

806
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:53,090
They can fill stadiums,

807
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:55,364
like the Superdome
during Katrina.

808
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:56,447
They filled that one.

809
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:02,501
What I said
you didn't boo.

810
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,534
Look at your boo.

811
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,826
I kid the Republicans,
with love.

812
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:09,879
It's all love.
I feel bad for them.

813
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:12,165
They got nobody
for next time.

814
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,278
Who are they
going to run?

815
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,979
Sarah Palin reading off
her hands.

816
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:20,457
Did you see that?
You saw this?

817
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:23,015
She wrote tax cuts
on her hand.

818
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:28,114
A Republican so stupid she has
to be reminded of the one thing?

819
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,344
Tax cuts?

820
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:42,188
This is like, if you saw
the coyote's paw

821
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:43,462
and it said, "Roadrunner."

822
00:43:45,515 --> 00:43:48,445
I mean, tax cuts.

823
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:54,456
Well, that's what she wrote
for the tea baggers.

824
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,322
For her husband, she wrote
other hole on her ass.

825
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:05,477
Nothing funny
about that, sir.

826
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:06,831
I agree with you.

827
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:09,770
Nothing funny about that.

828
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:14,521
I cannot wait to get home and
tear this sweater vest off.

829
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,161
But really,
who do they got?

830
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:24,489
They got Sarah Palin,

831
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:27,975
Mitt Romney, who I believe is
a department store mannequin.

832
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:31,230
I think that's
who they're running there.

833
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:35,648
And uh...
And of course, Bobby Jindal.

834
00:44:35,649 --> 00:44:40,609
The 19-year-old head of the
A.V. Department in Louisiana.

835
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,143
I mean...

836
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:43,769
Have you seen
that Bobby Jindal guy?

837
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:47,289
I-- I think the Republicans
think he's black.

838
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:48,564
I do.

839
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:50,147
I do.
I think they are like,

840
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:53,048
"We got to get some of that
Obama mojo working for us."

841
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:54,856
"Who we got?

842
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,847
"We got Bobby Jindal.
We got Bobby Jindal.

843
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:59,323
"Great.
We got Bobby Jindal."

844
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:01,469
"He is a what?"

845
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:04,240
"Close enough."

846
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:05,926
Okay, that's close enough.

847
00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:07,877
He-- He sure ain't white.
We know that.

848
00:45:09,653 --> 00:45:13,620
No, ironically, the two
great white hopes

849
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,060
of the Republican party
for 2012 is going to be

850
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:18,666
John Ensign, the Senator from Nevada

851
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:22,069
and Governor of Argentina,
Mark Sanford.

852
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,183
I mean, South Carolina.

853
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,164
Both who got caught cheating.

854
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:32,845
On the bright side,
it's good to see

855
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,645
Republicans fucking
women again.

856
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,856
For a while there,
we didn't know, but uh...

857
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:44,721
But actually Mark Sanford,
your neighbor,

858
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:48,335
It's why I do this show here.
There's so much material.

859
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:52,761
But I think in the long run,
he's going to come out good.

860
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:53,815
Because you know what?

861
00:45:54,607 --> 00:45:57,146
He's the one politician
who got caught.

862
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,613
And it wasn't lust.

863
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,155
It was love.

864
00:46:00,765 --> 00:46:02,567
And we have
the emails to prove it.

865
00:46:02,618 --> 00:46:04,336
Did you read his emails?

866
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,212
I mean, they were like you've
opened up a new chapter in my life

867
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:10,756
where I am content
just being.

868
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:15,604
You know this is the stuff that
gives women a pussy boner. Really.

869
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:21,489
"I long for the touch
of your fingertips

870
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:23,730
"and a deeper
connection to your soul."

871
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:25,187
He wrote that.

872
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:27,298
I mean, how does the wife
compete with that?

873
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:29,631
"I make a nice pot roast?"

874
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,584
I mean, what the--

875
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:33,964
But you know,
this was love.

876
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,604
I think women are going
to embrace this.

877
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:37,772
'Cause every other politician
we ever caught,

878
00:46:37,807 --> 00:46:43,513
it was always just this sick sort
of take advantage lust.

879
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:47,632
Always some
pathetic campaign roadkill.

880
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,723
"My wife just
looked the other way.

881
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:50,785
"Touch my cock."

882
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:59,274
"When that door closes,
you have three minutes to blow me."

883
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,202
"And then I'll go out
and shake hands with people."

884
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,480
You know, it's like--
I know.

885
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:09,552
No, the one I--
the one I actually admire

886
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:13,099
in this realm, Elliot Spitzer,
got a hooker, okay?

887
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,940
Honest.
Honest.

888
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:18,511
Not to mention that he is the
Elliot-ness of the financial world.

889
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:21,283
We could use his talents now.
But, you know...

890
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:24,095
Okay, he got a hooker
and then there was all this

891
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,336
editorial, hand-ringing.
For months I read article after article

892
00:47:28,396 --> 00:47:31,027
about we have
to stop prostitution,

893
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:33,067
the exploitation
and the abuse.

894
00:47:33,138 --> 00:47:35,706
And there is some of that.
And we should try to stop that.

895
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:38,093
But you know...

896
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:40,049
In the interest
of keeping it real,

897
00:47:41,054 --> 00:47:43,969
I just like to say in
21st century America,

898
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,862
a lot of chicks
are just ho's.

899
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:52,562
Just ho's. There's no abuse.
There's no exploitation.

900
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:54,278
They're just ho's.

901
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:57,515
That's why rappers are always
thinking about ho's.

902
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:01,550
# Oh, we got ho's,
In different area codes, #

903
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:04,438
# Everywhere we go,
We see the same-- #

904
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:07,028
Every-- There's just
a lot of ho's.

905
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:10,130
There's just a lot
of lazy bitches who go,

906
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:14,357
"Gee, I can work 40 hours a week
at Kentucky Fried Chicken...

907
00:48:15,064 --> 00:48:19,133
"Or I can blow Colonel Sanders
for 10 minutes."

908
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:27,313
But really, America, get over
the denial about sex.

909
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:29,038
They don't even know
what it is.

910
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,483
It's not real.

911
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,919
A hooker...
Spitzer gets a hooker.

912
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:35,194
And then
I constantly read,

913
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:39,150
what sort of fantasy was
he trying to fufill with a hooker.

914
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:42,203
Okay.

915
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:44,440
Let's get something straight.

916
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:46,494
When he was home
masturbating,

917
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:48,378
that's when
he needed the fantasy.

918
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:50,529
Okay, he was home
masturbating.

919
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:54,421
He was thinking about a woman
when he was fucking his hands.

920
00:48:54,456 --> 00:48:57,400
That's when you need fantasy.
You're fucking your hand.

921
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,609
When he got the hooker,
that was reality.

922
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,923
You see? Person.

923
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:05,547
I'm in a human being.
I'm fucking a person.

924
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:08,839
Reality,
I'm fucking my hand.

925
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:10,137
Fantasy.

926
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:14,038
Person, reality.
Hand, fantasy.

927
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:14,531
You know.

928
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:19,418
It's not like, you know...

929
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:20,825
Your hand is good.

930
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,352
It's not like, "Oh, hand!"

931
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:26,682
Happy Valentine's Day,
ladies and gentlemen.

932
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:34,833
Or as Tiger Woods calls it,
"My busy season."

933
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:41,244
Hey, he's the latest one.

934
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:43,162
They sent him to sex rehab.

935
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:44,591
Oh, give me a break.

936
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:47,016
Sex re--
He's a sex addict.

937
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,688
Yes, it's very sad.

938
00:49:50,425 --> 00:49:53,423
He was hiding
pussy around the house. It's--

939
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,123
He had it up
in the chandelier.

940
00:49:57,183 --> 00:49:58,529
Oh, it was so sad.

941
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:03,609
Tiger Woods in sex rehab.
This is not going to work.

942
00:50:03,644 --> 00:50:06,372
He asked for a therapist
with big tits right away.

943
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:12,459
But, you know,
every time in America,

944
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:13,948
some guy
gets caught cheating,

945
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:18,072
every media outlet
does the same story.

946
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:19,688
"Why do men cheat?"

947
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:23,909
Oh, take a wild fucking guess,
would you?

948
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:26,714
I think
you're overthinking this.

949
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,898
They're not looking for fantasy.

950
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:30,737
They're looking for sex.

951
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,957
That's it.
They want sex.

952
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:36,233
And not just sex.
They want new sex.

953
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,260
The way women
want new shoes.

954
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,256
Right?

955
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:44,168
You have shoes.
They're perfectly good shoes.

956
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,590
You don't
want those shoes.

957
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,497
You want new shoes.

958
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:50,887
We want a person.
You want a shoe.

959
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,689
But you're morally superior.

960
00:50:53,482 --> 00:50:55,623
I'm sure I'll get that
some day but...

961
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:59,054
But, you know...
Okay.

962
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:01,784
I'll get to you later.

963
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:06,844
But you know, the denial.

964
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,278
And not just hetro denial.
The gay denial is even worse.

965
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:15,716
Did you see that HBO special on
the Reverend Ted Haggard?

966
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:18,894
You know, all these Christians
who get caught being gay.

967
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:20,450
And of course,
they can't even admit

968
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,003
that there's such a thing
as homosexuality.

969
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:24,436
"It's just sinning..."

970
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,519
You know, Ted Haggard's quote.
I'll never forget.

971
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:32,284
It's true. He said, "He was
impacted by homosexuality."

972
00:51:33,725 --> 00:51:35,475
I swear. "Impacted."

973
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:41,678
Yes, mostly when he was on
his stomach, he was impacted by--

974
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:46,142
He was compacted
by homosexuality, I think.

975
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,292
I mean, Senator
Larry Craig gets caught

976
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:58,256
in the bathroom at the Minneapolis
Northwest Terminal Airport

977
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:02,770
with his foot all the way,
halfway under the next stall.

978
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:03,981
Doesn't deny it.

979
00:52:04,016 --> 00:52:08,040
In the-- This is the gayest
pickup place in America.

980
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:09,626
Don't ask me
how I know this.

981
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:14,840
But you know, you think
if you were caught in this position

982
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:17,994
in that place, you'd just be like,
"Okay, you got me. What can I say?

983
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:19,095
"This is how I was made.

984
00:52:19,147 --> 00:52:20,670
"I was drawn this way.
I'm gay."

985
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,127
End of story.
But, no.

986
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:27,222
To concoct this defence,
this making it a cause that

987
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:30,600
"No, I just happened
to need a wide stance. I--

988
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:34,581
"I speak for
all innocent heterosexuals."

989
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:41,511
"I mean, I've shat in quite
a few stalls in my life.

990
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:47,072
"I never needed to put my foot
anywhere near the other stall,

991
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:49,719
"let alone halfway into it."

992
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:51,790
"I mean...

993
00:52:53,564 --> 00:52:58,458
"I... I can't imagine
what would be

994
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:01,053
"so wrong with my ass."

995
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:05,694
"What intestinal issues
I would have

996
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:09,936
"to need to stretch
this much to pinch out a loaf?"

997
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:15,034
"But if I had it outside,
I wouldn't be shitting in public."

998
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,229
Listen to this, there was a--
Couple of years ago,

999
00:53:30,488 --> 00:53:35,565
this big megachurch Reverend
in Alabama died.

1000
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:40,017
Under very embarrassing
circumstances--

1001
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,173
I shouldn't say his name--

1002
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:44,683
Gary Aldridge,
the Reverend,

1003
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:47,453
Gary Aldridge,
close friend of Falwell,

1004
00:53:47,488 --> 00:53:50,136
had a megachurch,
big Republican fundraiser...

1005
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:52,418
Get this, he was
found dead of

1006
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,696
what authorities called
auto-erotic affixiation.

1007
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:59,790
Yes, yes, people know
the term from David Carradine.

1008
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,285
No joke. But that's
how he died too. Same thing.

1009
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,910
He had a rope
tied around his throat.

1010
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,192
One tied around his balls and
the third rope, tying them together.

1011
00:54:08,935 --> 00:54:12,222
You know, on the bright side,
he did earn a merit badge.

1012
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:15,796
So... All right.
One joke.

1013
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:18,582
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
I did one joke but...

1014
00:54:20,364 --> 00:54:23,548
But, listen to this.
The Reverend Gary Aldridge

1015
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:28,782
was found hanging hogtied
wearing two rubber suits

1016
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:35,866
with a ball gag in his mouth
and a dildo up his ass.

1017
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:40,908
Or as it's known in Republican
circles, "natural causes."

1018
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:52,468
And what I love is,
I swear to you,

1019
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:53,964
I'm quoting verbatim.

1020
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:57,023
The church put out
a statement after that

1021
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:01,781
saying we are taking this
in the strong arms of our Savior,

1022
00:55:01,816 --> 00:55:05,654
Jesus Christ, and we ask the public
to refrain from speculation.

1023
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:08,376
Right.

1024
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:10,340
You die with a dildo
up your ass

1025
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,499
and people just
talk, talk, talk.

1026
00:55:17,593 --> 00:55:20,364
And this is
why I found it so silly

1027
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:23,875
that the media has been
fretting for the last year

1028
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,510
that comedy is over
because Bush is gone.

1029
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:32,291
Can comedy continue without Bush?
Yes, I think it can.

1030
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:35,548
Is Obama
a slightly harder target?

1031
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:37,546
Good.
I'm glad he is.

1032
00:55:37,613 --> 00:55:39,306
I'll take that for the team.

1033
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:44,243
I'm glad my president isn't
a moron or a horn dog.

1034
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,180
Fantastic.

1035
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:49,115
You know...

1036
00:55:50,326 --> 00:55:52,148
Now, on the other side,

1037
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:56,038
people-- audiences
have to get used to the fact

1038
00:55:56,073 --> 00:55:57,873
that when I make
a joke about Obama,

1039
00:55:57,908 --> 00:56:00,732
I'm not making a joke
about all black people.

1040
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:04,029
Same way as when I made
a joke about Bush,

1041
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,803
it wasn't a swipe
at all retarded people.

1042
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:15,780
And I also think now
that Obama has the job,

1043
00:56:16,512 --> 00:56:19,031
he could black it
up a little.

1044
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:21,280
Throw us a bone.

1045
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,662
You know, do something.
Put a shark tank in the White House.

1046
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:29,815
Get fat, talk in rhymes,
something.

1047
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,233
Would it kill him
every once in a while

1048
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:36,108
to put on a purple suit
with 20 buttons up the front?

1049
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:39,460
Come on.
I got kids to feed.

1050
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:50,284
I also would feel a lot better
if instead of the Secret Service,

1051
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,137
he had a typical
black celebrity's entourage.

1052
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:55,382
I would feel better.

1053
00:56:55,417 --> 00:57:00,132
If he had like eight,
350-pound bling wearing,

1054
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:04,488
tattooed, thuggie,
ex-con motherfuckers,

1055
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:06,411
I would sleep
very well at night.

1056
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:11,300
I want to see Ving Rhames and
Suge Knight around this president...

1057
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,867
at all times and...

1058
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:16,638
I think every black celebrity

1059
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:19,765
should have to give up
one member of his entourage.

1060
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:23,646
Like an expansion draft
in baseball. You know, just...

1061
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,461
Come on, Busta Rhymes,
you can afford a cousin.

1062
00:57:28,921 --> 00:57:30,949
That would be
country first, right?

1063
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:33,692
Everybody's talking
about country first.

1064
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:35,564
You know, country--

1065
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,077
See, this is what a lot of people
had a problem with McCain.

1066
00:57:38,112 --> 00:57:39,193
I used to like McCain.

1067
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:40,711
But when you run
for President,

1068
00:57:40,746 --> 00:57:44,860
under a banner that says
"Country first" and you pick Palin...

1069
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:46,620
You know what,
we're Americans.

1070
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:48,859
We're used to
a lot of hypocracy,

1071
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:51,111
but that's
a bridge too far.

1072
00:57:52,454 --> 00:57:55,387
To set up your whole deal as...
you know,

1073
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:58,783
"It's a dangerous world out there
and I, John McCain,

1074
00:57:58,818 --> 00:58:01,439
"am the only thing
that stands between you

1075
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:03,318
"and blood thirsty Al-Qaeda."

1076
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:08,566
"And if I die, this spokesmodel
from the car show will take over."

1077
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:12,315
Come on.

1078
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:15,562
You know...

1079
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,792
Yeah, you can say I'm piling
on the Republicans.

1080
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,407
But you know,
they do it to themselves.

1081
00:58:21,442 --> 00:58:26,157
They have chosen to become
an anti-intellectual party.

1082
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:28,757
It's okay to have
ideological differences.

1083
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:31,899
You need ideological differences.

1084
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:35,481
But they keep nominating people
who just don't know enough

1085
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:37,021
to do the job.

1086
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,196
Sarah Palin is a bimbo.

1087
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:43,211
Bush was a bimbo.
Dan Quayle was a bimbo.

1088
00:58:43,494 --> 00:58:46,864
People who just
don't know enough.

1089
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:50,741
Oh, it's sold to us
by saying,

1090
00:58:50,776 --> 00:58:52,513
"Well, you want
to have a beer with them."

1091
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:54,238
"Here's a guy who want
to have a beer with--"

1092
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:55,428
Yeah, I want to have
a beer with them

1093
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:56,776
and I want
to take the bottle

1094
00:58:56,811 --> 00:58:58,662
and crack it
over their fucking head.

1095
00:59:01,224 --> 00:59:04,882
You know, when did--
When did dumb...

1096
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:09,428
become synonymous
with real American?

1097
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:12,385
"We're the backbone
of this country."

1098
00:59:13,269 --> 00:59:14,984
Calm down, sling blade.

1099
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,450
You're actually not.

1100
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,424
Statistics will prove.

1101
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:23,339
They've such a high opinion
of themselves, don't they?

1102
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:23,922
You know...

1103
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:27,356
That, like, Obama went to
make the commencement speech

1104
00:59:27,391 --> 00:59:32,013
last May at the graduation
at Arizona state.

1105
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,571
And you know,
it's customary

1106
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:37,944
to give the speaker, whoever it is,
an honorary degree.

1107
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:41,889
But Arizona state did not
give it to Obama.

1108
00:59:42,282 --> 00:59:46,329
They said his body of work
is yet to come.

1109
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:50,673
Right.

1110
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:54,611
He's the first black president
of the United States.

1111
00:59:54,646 --> 00:59:57,352
Let's see if he makes
something of himself.

1112
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:02,744
Are you kidding me?

1113
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:08,405
What posers! Arizona state--
You gave it to Tommy Lasorda

1114
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,573
last year,
for crying out loud!

1115
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,031
Arizona state.

1116
01:00:12,092 --> 01:00:14,003
"Oh yes,
we have standards."

1117
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:17,171
"We're the Harvard
of the Navaho Valley. We--

1118
01:00:17,926 --> 01:00:20,304
"We can't be giving that
to anybody."

1119
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:22,955
"First black president."

1120
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:26,447
"I guess it is eye-catching
on a resume but--"

1121
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:30,718
Fuck you.
I've been to that school.

1122
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,267
It's a party mill.
It's a football school.

1123
01:00:33,549 --> 01:00:36,485
You know when strippers say,
"I'm working my way through college."

1124
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,073
That's the college.

1125
01:00:41,144 --> 01:00:42,057
You know, they...

1126
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,514
These folks--
They just won't give it up

1127
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,565
that he's really president.

1128
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,635
You know. Conservatives.
I got to say,

1129
01:00:52,886 --> 01:00:55,972
you know, when the election
goes the wrong way for them,

1130
01:00:56,007 --> 01:00:57,498
it's not legitimate.

1131
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,738
They just can't stand.
They're so bitter

1132
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:09,539
that their claw, their bony
liver-spotted crypt keeper claw

1133
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:14,392
got pried off the levers of power
so they just went mental.

1134
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:17,725
Like you know what they cannot keep
on the shelves in America?

1135
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,440
Guns and ammo.

1136
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,022
Even though Obama and
every other pussy Democrat

1137
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:24,940
has never even
mentioned the issue,

1138
01:01:24,975 --> 01:01:29,155
these people are so sure that
he and his Negro army

1139
01:01:30,672 --> 01:01:32,226
are coming for their guns.

1140
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:35,401
They're gonna confiscate your guns
and indoctrinate your children

1141
01:01:35,436 --> 01:01:36,916
and socialize your wealth.

1142
01:01:38,109 --> 01:01:41,538
Then they're going to replace apple pie
with chicken and waffles.

1143
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,868
And I think they're going
to appoint a cabinet

1144
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:53,079
of Shaft, Foxy Brown,
Dolemite, Mandingo,

1145
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:55,811
Super Fly, Cleopatra Jones
and Blackula.

1146
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,856
I mean, it's all just fear
of a black planet.

1147
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:04,598
Isn't it? I mean,

1148
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:06,877
what does Rush Limbaugh
do for a living?

1149
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:12,151
He scares white men as they get
into their truck for lunch.

1150
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:14,377
You know...

1151
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:24,718
It's always some... some
new liberal boogie man

1152
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:27,583
who's going to snatch
the American dream

1153
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,508
away from the real American.

1154
01:02:29,543 --> 01:02:32,589
The blacks or the French.

1155
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:37,025
The Mexicans or the gays.

1156
01:02:37,095 --> 01:02:42,423
The environmentalists or Hollywood,
or activist judges...

1157
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:46,766
feminazis... Hillary.
You know,

1158
01:02:47,008 --> 01:02:50,262
Ooh, if you can demonize Hillary,
you're good.

1159
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:53,995
A blander centrist,
you will never meet.

1160
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:57,746
Che Guevarra in a pant suit,
she is not.

1161
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,200
If you hate Hillary,

1162
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,498
you were molested by
a real estate lady or something.

1163
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:05,782
Really.

1164
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,654
That's--
That's what they do.

1165
01:03:11,684 --> 01:03:13,811
They stoke up
this fear in people

1166
01:03:13,846 --> 01:03:17,605
and get them to vote against
their own economic interest.

1167
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:19,597
Joe the Plumber.
Perfect example.

1168
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:22,479
Remember, they--
They held up Joe the Plumber

1169
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,199
as the epitome of the guy
who was going to lose

1170
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:29,485
if Obama wins the election,
'cause Obama is going to steal

1171
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,724
the American dream
from Joe.

1172
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:35,512
Oh yes, I'm snaking out
a septic tank. Pinch me.

1173
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:44,395
But Joe hated Obama

1174
01:03:44,608 --> 01:03:48,660
'cause Obama was going
to raise taxes

1175
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,506
3% on people making over
$250,000 a year.

1176
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,755
Even though Joe
didn't have a job,

1177
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,158
didn't have any money,
didn't even have a plumber's license.

1178
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:02,777
But he was going to!

1179
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:06,476
"I'm going to buy that
plumbing business, Alice,

1180
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:09,059
"and we're
going to be rich!"

1181
01:04:10,491 --> 01:04:13,943
Joe was getting killed on the
taxes on the imaginary business

1182
01:04:13,978 --> 01:04:15,011
in his head.

1183
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:20,803
This is what they do.

1184
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:23,491
They get the people to vote
against their own interest.

1185
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:24,531
Health care.

1186
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,560
Did you see the people this
summer at the town hall meetings

1187
01:04:28,595 --> 01:04:34,053
fighting health care?
These obese, stressed-out,

1188
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:39,470
angry old white people,
heart attacks waiting to happen.

1189
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:41,635
You saw that guy
with the sign that said

1190
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:44,059
keep your government
hands off of my medicare?

1191
01:04:45,955 --> 01:04:47,089
You saw this?

1192
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:53,863
Who did he think was
running medicare? Sears?

1193
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:57,087
Monsanto. I mean...

1194
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:02,152
You know, drawing a Hitler
mustache on Obama?

1195
01:05:03,016 --> 01:05:06,329
Right, Obama's Hitler 'cause
he wants to give you health care.

1196
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:08,963
That's such a Nazi thing to do.
It really is.

1197
01:05:09,494 --> 01:05:12,182
Whenever I think of the Nazis,
I think health care.

1198
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,956
Look, you know,
socialized medicine.

1199
01:05:18,991 --> 01:05:23,365
This is the word that they phrase it.
They always invoke to get,

1200
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,531
"Oh, so, so, can't have that.
That's a slippery slope to the Gulag."

1201
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,537
'Cause, you know,
Americans hate Socialism.

1202
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:34,385
They don't know what it is,
but they know it's...

1203
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:39,488
something super awful like
gay marriage or child pornography

1204
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,684
or something really--
Oh, please.

1205
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,750
Arkansas doesn't have
Capitalism yet.

1206
01:05:43,785 --> 01:05:45,417
You're worried about
Socialism.

1207
01:05:46,282 --> 01:05:49,829
They're still curing people with
moonshine and leaches down there.

1208
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:54,790
Plus we already have
Socialism...

1209
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:55,753
in America.

1210
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:57,464
We just have it
for the rich.

1211
01:05:58,256 --> 01:05:59,591
There was no...

1212
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:04,768
There was no problem
with Socialism

1213
01:06:04,957 --> 01:06:07,477
at the beginning of the Meltdown
when Henry Paulson

1214
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,716
walked into the Oval Office

1215
01:06:08,837 --> 01:06:13,947
and demanded $700 billion
for the banks right away.

1216
01:06:14,587 --> 01:06:16,199
No time
to read the fine print.

1217
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,943
"What's that, lassie?
A.I.G.'s in trouble?"

1218
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,433
"Well, run to Fort Knox
and get them all the gold, girl."

1219
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:31,333
You know
this nonsense about

1220
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:34,572
"Let's give all the money to
the rich people. They create jobs."

1221
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:36,003
No, they don't.

1222
01:06:36,273 --> 01:06:37,836
They eliminate jobs.

1223
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:39,420
That's how they get richer.

1224
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:42,185
They're not interested in
creating jobs.

1225
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,739
They're interested in creating
wealth for themselves.

1226
01:06:45,774 --> 01:06:49,896
You read about these pricks
with their $1,000 shower curtains

1227
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:53,249
and their private jets and
their gold faucets and the...

1228
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:58,572
antique commodes and the
"Eyes Wide Shut" orgies or whatever...

1229
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:02,236
I mean, there's no end to the bullshit
rich fucks will spend money on.

1230
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,467
"It's 9:00, time for
my wine enema."

1231
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,797
Use the good stuff tonight.

1232
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:19,654
So, I'm glad that the executives
at Shitibank and...

1233
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:27,646
Skank of America and Notorious A.I.G.
got to keep their sailboats. But...

1234
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:30,979
You know what?
That we bailed them out

1235
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:34,672
and they're charging
30% interest on credit cards.

1236
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:38,108
I mean... You know, and
the Democrats are okay with this?

1237
01:07:38,143 --> 01:07:39,593
That's the problem
in America.

1238
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:43,420
The supposed, progressive party
is in bed

1239
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:46,848
with the same lobbyists
as the other clowns.

1240
01:07:47,623 --> 01:07:49,842
And you know,

1241
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:54,793
when Obama ran for President,
every rally he would say,

1242
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:56,266
"This is your time."

1243
01:07:57,075 --> 01:07:58,717
Well, you know what,
President Chocolate Thunder,

1244
01:07:58,768 --> 01:08:00,024
this is <i>your</i> time.

1245
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:04,845
You know what, you need
to get a little harder.

1246
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:05,987
I said this months ago.

1247
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:08,773
He needed to lay it on the line
against the corporations.

1248
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:11,692
And I agree with the people
who now agree with me.

1249
01:08:14,811 --> 01:08:19,398
You know, he needs a little Bush
and Cheney in his personality.

1250
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:21,652
Not policies, personality.

1251
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:23,715
Because, you know,
they had terrible ideas,

1252
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,753
but they got them through and
they didn't care who liked them.

1253
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:29,686
In an interview once, they asked
Dick Cheney, they said,

1254
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:33,395
"You know, most people now
don't want troops in Iraq."

1255
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:36,397
And Cheney said, "So?"

1256
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,365
In other words,
we won the election.

1257
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,564
Now we're going to do
what we think is right.

1258
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:45,493
You have an opinion?
Go Twitter it to Rick Sanchez.

1259
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:53,248
And the next time
somebody says to Obama,

1260
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:56,917
"You know, the people think that
your health care policy is Socialism."

1261
01:08:56,952 --> 01:08:59,281
He should say, "So?"

1262
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:03,328
The people can't name three
branches of governments.

1263
01:09:04,193 --> 01:09:06,822
They're full of fear and
misinformation.

1264
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:12,528
Drag them to it. Try to explain
health care to them.

1265
01:09:12,558 --> 01:09:14,297
It's like trying
to explain to your dog,

1266
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:15,437
"Why you're going
to the vet?"

1267
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:19,234
Just open the car door
and jingle the leash

1268
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:21,293
and talk like this
and he'll go.

1269
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:25,853
Just give the people
health care.

1270
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:27,819
These tea baggers are
protesting it.

1271
01:09:27,854 --> 01:09:29,343
Five years
after they have it,

1272
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:31,178
they'll forget
they were against it.

1273
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:32,872
They'll like it.
They'll be defending it.

1274
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,632
They'll have signs
that say,

1275
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:38,024
"Keep your government hands off
my Nazi health care!"

1276
01:09:45,424 --> 01:09:47,724
But, I don't lose perspective.

1277
01:09:48,026 --> 01:09:50,391
I know if the election
had gone the other way,

1278
01:09:50,826 --> 01:09:54,229
and it was now old man McCain
and Cruella de Ville

1279
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:55,874
who were running the show,

1280
01:09:56,647 --> 01:10:00,592
it would be a barber economy and
we'd be at war with Honduras, so...

1281
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:06,452
I try to keep in mind
what Obama always says

1282
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:08,294
which is that
you can't let the perfect

1283
01:10:08,652 --> 01:10:10,928
be the enemy
of the necessary.

1284
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,173
Which is pretty good.

1285
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,565
And a quote from Voltaire,
by the way.

1286
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:18,743
Who Bush thinks
is a Harry Potter character. So...

1287
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,419
I gotta say, that's something
I love about Obama.

1288
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:29,902
He never loses an opportunity
to give it to Bush.

1289
01:10:30,634 --> 01:10:32,599
Even when he was being
inaugurated.

1290
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:35,793
As Bush was sitting
like five feet away.

1291
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,711
And he just kept giving him
shot after shot after shot.

1292
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,779
Never by name.
You know, just...

1293
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,908
"We are ready to lead again."

1294
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,197
That's cool.

1295
01:10:52,793 --> 01:10:55,061
I mean, he is cool.
You got to give him that and...

1296
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:57,902
I-- You know
how I know he is cool?

1297
01:10:58,635 --> 01:11:00,241
'Cause I know
a lot of women who say,

1298
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:03,137
"Boy, I would love to be his
Monica Lewinsky."

1299
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:05,115
I know.

1300
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,294
I'm not saying
you go for it.

1301
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,569
I just think-- I just think
it's a good thing for the country

1302
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,234
when the chicks
want to blow the president.

1303
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,089
I do.

1304
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:16,390
I think it's good for the country.
The chicks are in a better mood.

1305
01:11:16,425 --> 01:11:18,087
Everybody else
is in a better mood.

1306
01:11:18,122 --> 01:11:20,008
It just--
It's a lot about mood.

1307
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:22,246
Come on, we are a fragile
people right now.

1308
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:25,104
We have to be--
you know, keep that mood up.

1309
01:11:25,139 --> 01:11:26,128
Obama knows it.

1310
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:29,279
You see, like, he does everything
he can to remind us

1311
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:32,786
that we have something new
and energetic and fresh.

1312
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:35,021
You ever notice that
whenever he is introduced,

1313
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:37,309
he always runs up
to the podium.

1314
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:40,191
Even if it's just
two feet away,

1315
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:42,889
he gives us a little run
to put it in our mind

1316
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,149
that it could be McCain
with the walker, you know.

1317
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,742
It could have been...
# dum-dum-dum-dum #

1318
01:11:49,748 --> 01:11:51,865
That would
have been so... dun!

1319
01:11:54,452 --> 01:11:56,183
'Cause whether you like it
or not,

1320
01:11:56,406 --> 01:12:02,004
the President is the most
ubiquitous presence in our lives.

1321
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:05,479
He's the one guy
who is on TV every day.

1322
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:10,614
That's for eight years, it was like the
channel was stuck on "hee-haw."

1323
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:16,363
And now,
I just feel better.

1324
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:19,947
You know, for one thing,
this is the first time in my lifetime

1325
01:12:20,147 --> 01:12:23,367
that a president
has been from a city...

1326
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:26,174
From a place I would go.

1327
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:30,809
He's from Chicago.
I love Chicago! I go there.

1328
01:12:31,807 --> 01:12:34,320
Would I ever go to
Wasilla, Alaska?

1329
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:39,397
Or Hope, Arkansas or Plains, Georgia
or Crawford, Texas?

1330
01:12:39,432 --> 01:12:40,574
Not on a bet!

1331
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:44,593
These are reasons small towns
are small.

1332
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:46,344
No one wants to live there.

1333
01:12:48,161 --> 01:12:48,783
It's true.

1334
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:55,545
So you know, I relate to
this couple in the White House.

1335
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,842
They relate to each other.

1336
01:12:56,923 --> 01:12:59,963
Which is something I haven't
seen also in my lifetime.

1337
01:12:59,998 --> 01:13:02,500
You know, I mean, they look
at each other in the eye!

1338
01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:04,154
They fist-bump.

1339
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:08,882
I think he's getting a little
first nookie. I do, you know.

1340
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:11,718
Sometimes, you see.
He looks at her like,

1341
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:15,539
"How would you like to fuck the most
powerful man in the world tonight?"

1342
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:19,393
And I love her.

1343
01:13:19,453 --> 01:13:21,571
She looks at him like,
"Maybe."

1344
01:13:23,324 --> 01:13:25,242
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1345
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,646
You were
an awesome crowd.

1346
01:13:27,128 --> 01:13:28,844
'Cause I knew
you would be here.

1347
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:30,248
Thank you.

1348
01:13:30,664 --> 01:13:32,173
A pleasure.

1349
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:15,317
Thank you.

1350
01:14:15,352 --> 01:14:17,337
I have one other surprise
for you,

1351
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:19,445
'cause we're way over time
and you know,

1352
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,279
Real Sex 28 is coming up.
We got to get out of here.

1353
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,017
Seriously... Damn,
you laughed too much.

1354
01:14:27,721 --> 01:14:29,904
But, you know, I was
just talking about Obama

1355
01:14:29,939 --> 01:14:34,812
and I have to say that you know,
he got the Nobel prize for peace.

1356
01:14:34,813 --> 01:14:37,019
You know, a lot of people said,
"What, he's conducting wars."

1357
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:37,733
I agree.

1358
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:41,888
But also, he's made this outreach
to the Muslim world which I love.

1359
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:43,745
'Cause I don't want
a million or billion people

1360
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,452
being pissed at me
for any reason.

1361
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,054
You know,
that is the one area

1362
01:14:50,089 --> 01:14:51,651
where we have
to lower tensions

1363
01:14:51,711 --> 01:14:55,108
and there are a few signs that
things might be getting better.

1364
01:14:55,187 --> 01:14:56,490
I read in the paper
the other day

1365
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:00,123
that for the first time,
Saudi Arabia had a fashion show.

1366
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:03,102
Their top designer,
Muslim Dior...

1367
01:15:06,553 --> 01:15:08,771
is on a world tour
with his spring line

1368
01:15:08,806 --> 01:15:13,467
and they just happened to be
in Raleigh, North Carolina tonight.

1369
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,892
And I asked some of the models
if they would come over.

1370
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:17,268
Would you like
to see the...

1371
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:20,817
You would? You want to see
the Muslim Dior fashion show?

1372
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:25,142
Okay. Then, start the music
because I think

1373
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:27,220
you will really like this.

1374
01:15:30,084 --> 01:15:31,284
Ah.

1375
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:36,680
Sleek and stylish
in this wool blend.

1376
01:15:36,715 --> 01:15:38,550
An ajeeba is hot, hot, hot!

1377
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:42,060
And not just from wearing
a suffocating tarp in the desert.

1378
01:15:43,114 --> 01:15:44,215
It's a look that screams,

1379
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,888
"Look out world, I'm a
woman of the 12th century."

1380
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:51,152
Turn heads
without losing yours.

1381
01:15:51,954 --> 01:15:54,088
In this sizzling
Saudi sheath,

1382
01:15:54,123 --> 01:15:56,777
be the wife
that he calls for tonight.

1383
01:15:57,488 --> 01:15:58,730
And every night.

1384
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,701
Ah, here is lovely Neema

1385
01:16:02,736 --> 01:16:06,056
in a coketter's little outfit
that showcases the girl

1386
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:10,541
inside the woman inside the
stifling female containment unit.

1387
01:16:12,137 --> 01:16:15,546
It's first class clothing for
second class citizens.

1388
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,282
And it shows off your curves
in all the right places.

1389
01:16:20,317 --> 01:16:23,724
The top of your head, your shoulders
and absolutely nowhere else.

1390
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,797
Dress it up
for morning prayers

1391
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,759
or dress it down
for midnight stonings.

1392
01:16:32,106 --> 01:16:37,041
This one says my mulla brings
all the boys to the yard.

1393
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,237
Oh, isn't Kaleela
just scrumtous in this

1394
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,704
business, casual abaya
by dawn of the Koran?

1395
01:16:49,011 --> 01:16:52,905
It's a throwback pullover that says,
"I'm too sexy for my Shiite."

1396
01:16:55,771 --> 01:16:59,977
You'll be proud to walk five steps
behind your husband in this ensemble.

1397
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:03,515
It's also perfect for when
you don't like leaving the house,

1398
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,522
because if you do,
you'll be beaten.

1399
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:09,859
Available at K-Mart
by Isaac Jihadi.

1400
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:14,327
And finally,
here comes lovely Annan.

1401
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,634
Annan is wearing
a daring French cut

1402
01:17:16,746 --> 01:17:18,869
with a plunging
eye slit.

1403
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:21,974
Slut!

1404
01:17:24,234 --> 01:17:26,717
This one comes in black
and dark black.

1405
01:17:28,406 --> 01:17:31,529
And it's guaranteed
to get your man so hot

1406
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:34,449
he'll want to crack you
on the ankle with a long stick.

1407
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:39,063
Whether you're on the go
or simply knowing your place,

1408
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:42,176
nobody does refreshing like
Muslim Dior.

1409
01:17:42,447 --> 01:17:47,391
By the way, Annan is the winner of
Saudi Arabia's "Next Top Model"

1410
01:17:47,426 --> 01:17:50,687
and I think
you can see why.

1411
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,844
How about a hand
for the fashion models

1412
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,509
from the Muslim Dior show?

1413
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,061
All right.
We got to get out of here.

1414
01:17:58,096 --> 01:17:59,267
Thank you.
You were great.

1415
01:17:59,582 --> 01:18:00,925
I appreciate it.

1416
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,903
Thank you, folks.
