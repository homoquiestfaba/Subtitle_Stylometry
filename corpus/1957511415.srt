bigger than <i>Halloween.</i>

high with me?

179

I'm getting high.
You're hot boxing me, bro.

180
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,583
Well, then I'm a good friend.
I'm getting you by contact.

181
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,451
- You don't have to do anything.
- You're so generous.

182

Yeah, where's my taquitos,
by the way?

183

I ain't getting no taquitos.

make me even more hungry.

quit smoking, dude, I wanna get better?

- so I don't remember.

- Come on, dude.
- What?

If my mom smells this
in my car,

195
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,649
- she's gonna flip.
- Your mom loves me.

Does it look good?
Do I look good?

204
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,836
You do, you look
pretty good, dude.

- Are my eyes red?
- Yep.

206

- Look at the window.

can I be in the movie?

- No.
- Why?

214
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,691
Because I already
told you no.

215
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,126
- There's no parts for you.
- We'll get you in the next one.

to feed Penny, okay?

How late are you gonna be
out doing this movie thing?

Hey, Ryan.

222
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,808
I understand the name of this
movie is <i>Streetwalkers.</i>

223
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,610
So what exactly is my
daughter gonna be doing

224

dressed like she is
underneath that coat?

225

Oh, my God. Dad, stop it.

226
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,949
Mr. Gallagher, I promise it's
gonna be a very classy film.

227
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:04,552
Yeah, no nudity
or anything like that, so.

228
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:07,790
All right, just try
to remember,

229
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,524
she has a little sister
who looks up to her, okay?

230
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,025
I'd prefer not to be
on camera, please.

231
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,327
- I'm not recording.
- All right, Dad,

232
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,662
can you just go inside now?
Just leave them alone.

00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:16,364

00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:20,803
- Oh, we'll get her back safe.
- Have a good night, sir.

236
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,471
No, but for real, thank you for helping
us, Erica. Appreciate it.

237
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,707
Yeah, it's not exactly
a dream role.

238
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,141
I mean, it's not fine.

239
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,410
She threatened
to run away again.

240
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,580
I had to talk her out of it.
You know, same old story.

241
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,983
Word on the street is you're
<i>numero uno</i> in theater major.

242
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:37,885
Is there any truth
to that rumor, Erica?

243
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,921
Oh, dude, they call her
two-take Erica

244
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,556
because she gives you
exactly what you need

245
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,225
- in the first two takes.
- Okay, no, wait.

246
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,760
Actually it's the first take

247
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,195
and I just like to have
a little fun,

on my hands, you know.

249

a full ride scholarship

250
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,535
- to a big league acting school.
- Julliard.

251

Oh, wow, that is big time,
so congrats, that's awesome.

252
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,407
She's the real deal, man.

253
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,743
Dude, that's exactly what we
need to take out Dani this year.

254
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,010
- I'm telling you, for real.
- Oh, my God.

255

She wins best short film
every year

256
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,881
and Jake is convinced that
it's because her dad is...

257
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:10,351
That is the reason, Ryan.
I tell you that every time.

258
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:11,854
Dude, what Jake won't tell you

259
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,956
is that he and Dani dated
briefly and she dumped him.

260
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,860
- Wow. Wow.
- He couldn't hang.

261
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,627

that's such a low blow.

262

- What, bro?
- Honestly.

all right? I'm over her.

just shut up

the way and just focus, please.

- Okay, so you're gonna go to the second light pole.
- Okay.

267

And then you're gonna work
that sidewalk technically.

268
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:34,909
- Okay.
- Yeah.

269
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,310

gonna take?

270

for a few minutes, babe.

- Yeah.
- We'll be quick.

- Okay, please, just two minutes, 'cause it's freezing.
- Yeah, that's fine.

Okay, can you help me
with my jacket, Mr. Director?

1033
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:48,562
and we're left
to clean it up.

1034
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:50,631
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

1035
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,504
There is a special place
in heaven for a guy like you.

1036
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:58,272
(LAUGHS)

1037
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:00,274
I appreciate
you saying that,

1038
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:02,610
but I think I'll take
my time on that heaven part.

1039
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:06,413
You know, you got food,
you've got a dartboard and a refrigerator.

1040
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:07,581
It's like you live here.

1041
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:09,683
Got a gym
and a shower as well.

1042
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:11,652
All I need is a couple
hours on the good old couch.

1043
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:13,188
You're the one paying rent.

1044
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,688
You can do whatever you want.

1045
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,129
(SIGHING)

1046
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:30,806
Hey, why didn't you
marry Jessica?

1047
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:35,476
I was close.

1048
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:41,549
But like you said, I live
here, and you know Jessica.

1049
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:44,219
She was always worried someone'd
come knocking on the door,

1050
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:47,155
telling her I got stabbed or
shot or something like that.

1051
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,727
I'm not even sure
I made the right choice.

1052
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:57,833
When you find somebody
who really loves you,

1053
00:50:57,866 --> 00:51:00,836
they're not gonna make you
choose between your job and her.

1054
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:04,039
This is part of you,
it's who you are.

1055
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,372
These are starting to
sound like conversations

1056
00:51:05,406 --> 00:51:07,708
I have with my therapist.

1057
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:09,743
Sorry, I got us off track,
I apologize.

1058
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:11,545
It's all right.

1059
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,682
It's kinda meaningful
coming from you.

1060
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,918
I knew there was a reason you
convinced me to take this job.

1061
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:18,752
All right, enough
with the therapy session.

1062
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,288
That's not gonna
solve this case.

1063
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:26,094
(SIGHS) You think he's actually
living in that building?

1064
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,330
I don't know.

1065
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:30,598
We've got no proof that
he actually lived there.

1066
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:32,366
And I don't think
he's going back.

1067
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:34,735
He is hiding.

1068
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:37,771
- But where?
- I don't know.

1069
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:42,878
We got nothing
from the dive team.

1070
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:43,912
Can I help you?

1071
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:46,081
Hey.

1072
00:51:46,114 --> 00:51:48,415
I'm here to see
Detective Adams.

1073
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:50,118
- Adams.
- It's Dr. Brooks.

1074
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:55,689
Mr. Books,
what can I do for you, Doctor?

1075
00:51:55,723 --> 00:51:57,591
Can we speak somewhere
in private?

1076
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:00,228
Sure, right this way.

1077
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:01,595
Bill.

1078
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:03,697
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1079
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:05,566
I think I know
who took the equipment.

1080
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,303
Great, any leads
would help.

1081
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:12,506
About five years ago,
I performed surgery on this patient.

1082
00:52:19,781 --> 00:52:21,249
Does the patient have a name?

1083
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:24,252
He didn't have any ID
at the time of the surgery.

1084
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:27,956
We didn't have a name,
he's listed in the report as John Doe.

1085
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:29,925
Then he stole the equipment?

1086
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,760
Yeah, see, this wasn't
a routine operation.

1087
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:37,598
We're experimenting with what
is called a xenotransplantation.

1088
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:39,901
That's animal
to human transplant.

1089
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,603
You're saying you gave
this man an animal heart?

1090
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:43,905
That's correct.

1091
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:45,673
And what kind of animal
did you take it from?

1092
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:47,275
It was a porcine heart.

1093
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:48,609
You mean a pig?

1094
00:52:48,642 --> 00:52:49,643
Yes.

1095
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,414
Dear God, did he say a pig?

1096
00:52:52,446 --> 00:52:55,649
The organ is altered genetically
with DNA from the patient.

1097
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:58,987
For long term, pigs work
well because their anatomies

1098
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,288
are very similar to human.

1099
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:01,689
<i>Sometimes there
are side effects,</i>

1100
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:04,692
but it's been done
before successfully.

1101
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:06,627
Well, how is that even
legal, Doctor?

1102
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,496
<i>Every procedure that our
research department undertakes</i>

1103
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,833
is done with the permission
of the FDA.

1104
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,835
Animal to human transplants
have been done

1105
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:15,669
since the early 1900s.

1106
00:53:15,703 --> 00:53:19,441
So why did you choose
to experiment on this man

1107
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:21,608
instead of giving him
a human heart?

1108
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:23,345
Well, the people we
use for these operations

1109
00:53:23,378 --> 00:53:25,180
have no other option.

1110
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:29,150
First, you have to be on a waiting
list to receive a heart from a donor.

1111
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:32,220
This guy was probably
at the bottom of that list.

1112
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:34,055
Right now, there
are over 100,000 people

1113
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,124
waiting for a transplant.

1114
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:39,461
Eighteen of those will die
every day while waiting.

1115
00:53:39,493 --> 00:53:42,297
If this fellow had waited,
he'd probably be dead.

1116
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,565
Well, that might not have
been such a bad thing, Doc.

1117
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:47,235
This guy has killed
six people in the last month.

1118
00:53:47,268 --> 00:53:48,569
Listen, you said
side effects.

1119
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,171
What kind of side effects
are we talking about?

1120
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:52,639
Sometimes the operation
doesn't take.

1121
00:53:52,673 --> 00:53:54,742
Sometimes the body can
reject the organ

1122
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:57,578
and cause internal issues
with the immune system.

1123
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:00,115
And what about
mental issues?

1124
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:05,854
Look, I'm sorry
all this happened,

1125
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:08,823
but I hope you're
not suggesting

1126
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,657
that the operation had
something to do with that.

1127
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,559
Well, it doesn't seem like
the heart's taking too well.

1128
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:15,230
He's acted more like an animal
than he is like a human.

1129
00:54:15,263 --> 00:54:17,432
Do you follow up with
your patients, Dr. Brooks?

1130
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:18,565
We try to.

1131
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,268
We ask that they come in
every now and then

1132
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:22,070
so we can check up on them.

1133
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:24,172
But we can't issue
a warrant or anything

1134
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:26,007
and force them to come in.

1135
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,409
And did you follow up
with him?

1136
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:28,943
He never came back.

1137
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,278
I don't know, it just doesn't
seem right

like that.

this is the guy

1143
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,388
That's why I came here.

00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:43,058
I received this note.

My daughter
Dani wasn't at home.

1146
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,432
Sometimes she stays
at her mother's place

1147
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,566
but she was with me
this weekend.

1148
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:53,600
Found a match.

1149
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:57,439
Are you sure that there's
nobody else

1150
00:54:57,472 --> 00:54:58,840
that would wanna hurt
your family?

1151
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,242
(COUGHS)

1152
00:55:02,977 --> 00:55:05,313
I received a call
from him earlier this evening

1153
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:08,416
before I met with you two
at the hospital.

1154
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:12,454
He asked me to perform
the surgery, I told him no.

1155
00:55:12,487 --> 00:55:13,555
Did he call you
on the cell phone

1156
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:14,655
or did he call you
at the office?

1157
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:15,990
My office number.

1158
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,125
What did he say after that?

1159
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:18,960
- I don't know, I hung up on him.
- Damn it.

1160
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:20,462
And then I got the note.

1161
00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:22,163
Did you talk to your daughter
after you talked to him?

1162
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:25,266
Yeah, I called Dani
to check up on her right away.

1163
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,237
She said something about
finishing a film project

1164
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,737

1165
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:32,240
Wait a minute.

1166
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:34,442
Did you say your daughter's
name was Dani?

1167
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,377
Yes.

1168
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:38,712
Is this your daughter?

1169
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:40,647
Yes.

1170
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:42,450
Where'd you get this?

1171
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:43,818
That footage came
from a camera

1172
00:55:43,852 --> 00:55:46,488
that we found at Stoker
Hills Community College.

1173
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:47,789
If he was ready
for the surgery,

1174
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:49,324
that means Dani's collateral.

1175
00:55:49,357 --> 00:55:51,359
One of the other two kids
are the match.

1176
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,694
We can catch this guy.

1177
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:55,662
If we can get a phone tap
on his landline,

1178
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:57,966
maybe we can trace him
down to a location.

1179
00:55:57,999 --> 00:55:59,968
Well, it's 12:45 right now.
It's gonna take two hours.

1180
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:01,803
So if we're gonna do
this, we gotta move now.

1181
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:04,472
What if something goes
wrong, will Dani be safe?

1182
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:05,840
This is the only
chance she's got, Doctor.

1183
00:56:05,874 --> 00:56:07,375
I'll get the team together.
