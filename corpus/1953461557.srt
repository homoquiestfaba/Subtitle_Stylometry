1
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,963
- Hello.
- Hey, Yuri.

2
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,128
Good to see you, Will.

3
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,406
Charlie.

4
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,003
- What do you say, Will?
- Slow night, huh?

5
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,130
Got kinda busy
about 10 minutes ago.

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,080
These winter colds are just the worst.

7
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,766
You know, if my shift
moves any slower,

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,002
I think I will be
going backwards.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,210
- Time to play, you ready?
- Ah, I'm kinda busy right now.

10
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,170
You want some pie?

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,886
- Oh, pie.
- Pie.

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,850
No, I just want some coffee.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,401
Coffee.
You got it.

14
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,046
How long that pot
been sitting out there?

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,761
I just made it... fresh pot...
right before it got busy, Will.

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,442
- Hey, Will.
- Aaron.

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,082
Want some more coffee?

18
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,204
You haven't even put any coffee
in my cup yet, Charlie.

19
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,203
- Damn.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,523
God damn it, Aaron.

21
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,404
Um, how are you progressing
with that coffee?

22
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,847
Sorry, I'm...

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,651
I'm not real with it today,
you know what I mean?

24
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,203
You want cream and sugar?

25
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,044
Cream.

26
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,407
- Cream.
- Do you want cream and sugar

27
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,961
with the coffee?

28
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,162
I'll take it as it is.

29
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,450
Whose move is it?

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,602
Hmm, Charlie?

31
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,450
Charlie? Charlie?

32
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,602
Charlie?

33
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,364
Whose move is it?

34
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,483
Your move.
It's your move, Will.

35
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,123
That's right.
Next Tuesday evening.

36
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,726
Mm-hmm.

37
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,845
How you doing?

38
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,727
I've been down to the diner,
it's a mess.

39
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,241
Look, is this necessary?

40
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,120
- I already gave a statement.
- I understand

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,407
you've been having
a tough time lately.

42
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,123
You could say that.

43
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,203
I've been working
for extra jobs

44
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,362
just to try to keep
my head above water.

45
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,562
You like Charlie?

46
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,609
Everybody likes Charlie.

47
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,683
Anything you don't like about him?

48
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,650
Anything unusual?

49
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,529
- Like what?
- I don't know.

50
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,444
Kind of thing maybe

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,887
you wouldn't expect
at an all-night diner.

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,003
You know who owns the place.

53
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,685
Yeah, I do.

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,127
Tell me who was there that night.

55
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,842
Just take your time.
Think a minute.

56
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,167
I... I don't know.

57
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,449
What do you mean you don't know?
You spent enough time there.

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,284
Who was there that night?

59
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,564
Just customers.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,326
I'm gonna need you to tell me
how it all went down.

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,488
I need $2. That's it.

62
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,563
I don't need
an extra day off or anything.

63
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,530
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,330
- What the hell is this?
- I would've thought that was

65
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,891
fucking obvious, mate.

66
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,321
Okay, everybody in the corner.

67
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,005
Move. Move!

68
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,563
On your feet!
I'm not gonna say it again.

69
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,563
Get in the corner!
Move!

70
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,246
Come on, love.

71
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,402
Now!

72
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,210
Let's go, on your feet.
Let's go!

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,486
On your way.

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,889
Right, if you're smart,
you're scared.

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,371
If you're not, you should be.

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,881
I don't want any heroes
and I don't want any grief.

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,363
You do what I say,
when I say it,

78
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,046
and everybody will be able
to walk out of here.

79
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,369
- You got that, geezer?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,922
Exactly as I say or I blow you
against that fucking wall.

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,451
Right?

82
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,524
Now if you'd be so kind
just to step out from behind there.

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,603
Let's go.
Eh... hey.

84
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,368
- My hip.
- 911 emergency.

85
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,851
What's the nature of your call?

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,083
All right, son, on your feet.
Let's go, move!

87
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
- Hey, cheeky.

88
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,324
- No.
- Let's go.

89
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,925
Come on.
There's a good girl.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
Crawling under there
isn't gonna help you.

91
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,649
Doing what you're told might.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,202
There, it's all right.
You'll be fine.

93
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,125
Right, mobiles, watches,
and wallets

94
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,887
into the bag provided by
my associate here.

95
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,408
Now, I know you're all scared
and that's a good thing.

96
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,882
If you're scared, you're a lot less
likely to do something stupid.

97
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,407
Because if you're thinking of
doing something stupid,

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,409
I guarantee you will regret it,

99
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,570
but only for about the half second
it'll take me to turn,

100
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,088
aim in your general direction,
and pull the trigger.

101
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,481
I have no more desire
to be here than you do.

102
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,211
So if everybody does what I say,

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,971
when I say it,
things will go a lot smoother.

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,765
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Me, either.

105
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,366
I promise everything's
gonna be different now.

106
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,568
We're gonna pick up Bonnie,
is that okay?

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,722
Yeah.

108
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
- It's just...
- I know what you're thinking.

109
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,281
I couldn't get it done before

110
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,364
and how am I gonna be able
to get it done now, is that right?

111
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,363
Are you gonna take
responsibility, you know?

112
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,569
Are you gonna be there
when we need you?

113
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,564
I made mistakes

114
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,007
and I paid for them.

115
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,285
But I know

116
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,442
what's important now.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,282
You don't have to worry.

118
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,602
I promise

119
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,161
I won't ever break into
another car again.

120
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,523
I have an ultrasound appointment
today if you wanna come.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,286
You kidding me?
Try and stop me.

122
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,010
Oh, shit.

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,442
I'm supposed to meet Patrick's friend
for this job interview.

124
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,881
That's all right.
If you can't make it, you can't make it.

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,651
- It's not a big deal.
- No, screw it. I can reschedule.

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,808
- I'm coming with you.

127
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,450
Are you fucking blind?

128
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,523
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow.

129
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,609
Not you, Bill, another cow.

130
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,841
Wait, what are you doing?

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,162
You just got out
five minutes ago, please.

132
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,209
It's not worth it.

133
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,488
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,688
Hello!

135
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,525
Jesus, Bonnie,
what are you trying to do to me?

136
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,444
I'm sorry!
I'm just so excited!

137
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,560
How does it feel to be out
in the big, wide world?

138
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,921
- It almost feels safer on the inside.
- Yeah, right.

139
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,441
I hear those communal showers
are really tough

140
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,204
- on the good-looking boys.
- Okay.

141
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,089
- Really?
- Come on.

142
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,891
What's the deal here? You living in
a hotel? What are you, big time now?

143
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,362
My apartment is flooded,
so I'm staying here till they fix it.

144
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,763
- So what's next?
- Dropping you off at the next corner.

145
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,609
Oi, what'd I tell ya?

146
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,609
Nigel, keep a lookout for us.

147
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,730
Now, who's in charge here?

148
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,008
Eh? Who runs this place?

149
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,886
I do, I do.

150
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,367
Oh, you are a proper geezer.

151
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,729
There's a safe in the back.
Take me to it.

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,803
Register's open, a lot of cash.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,241
Why don't you just take it,
get the hell outta here, huh?

154
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,601
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Either you can walk me to that safe

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,326
or I can blow your legs off
at the knees

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,403
and you can crawl there.

157
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,323
The safe is back in the office.

158
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,488
After you.

159
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,809
- Go on!
- Yup.

160
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,531
It's all yours, Bill.

161
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,209
- There it is.
- Open it.

162
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,963
Today, you mug.

163
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,369
Back away.

164
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,130
That, you cheeky bastard,

165
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,930
is not the safe I'm looking for.

166
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,321
Where's the cash safe?

167
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,448
I don't know
what you're talking about.

168
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,840
If at some point I've given you
the impression that I don't know

169
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,763
exactly what's going on
around here,

170
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,322
or that I'm some thick cunt
you mess about, I apologize.

171
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,842
Now, where's the safe?
The real one.

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,368
The one that says you get
to keep your good fucking leg.

173
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,009
Open it.

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,968
- Can't do it.
- Excuse me?

175
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,566
I can't open it.
It's on a time lock.

176
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,849
I can't open it until midnight.

177
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,728
That's God's truth.

178
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,885
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

179
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,042
Fuck!

180
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,411
Keep an eye on 'em.

181
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,565
What's going on?
It was meant to be a quick in and out.

182
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,165
Safe's on a time lock.

183
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,322
Fuck off.
Are you sure?

184
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,881
Well, it says time lock
on the door, so, yeah.

185
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,883
I'm pretty fucking sure.

186
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,769
- What time's it set for?
- Midnight.

187
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,001
Midnight.

188
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,685
I suppose that's why
he told you to pull this

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,410
at two minutes before
fucking midnight.

190
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,844
It's 30 minutes away.
What do you want to do?

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,924
- We're gonna sit tight. Wait it out.
- You're joking.

192
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,242
I'm not leaving
without emptying that safe.

193
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,726
And what happens
if someone comes in?

194
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,166
- Like who?
- Like customers.

195
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,408
We keep the doors locked,
put the closed sign up.

196
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,608
It's not exactly
brain surgery, is it?

197
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,569
This is not what we planned.

198
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,363
If you've got a problem, Bill,
trot on. I'll have your share.

199
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,571
30 minutes.
Okay.

200
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,444
And then we're out.

201
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,685
It's okay.

202
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,769
- We've got trouble.
- What now?

203
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,331
- Cops.
- How many?

204
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,847
Who gives a fuck?
A fucking cop, we gotta go.

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,571
- There's only one.
- What's he doing?

206
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,963
Singing fucking show tunes. He's a cop.
We gotta get outta here now.

207
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,281
He's standing outside
his cruiser smoking a fag.

208
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,603
Cops come in here all the time.
It's a diner.

209
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,131
Right.

210
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,011
Then let's give him
the warm and friendly fucking

211
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,889
"Be Brite" experience then,
shall we?

212
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,963
It's business as usual.

213
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,327
You and you
back behind the counter.

214
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,891
- What?
- Chef and your mates,

215
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,485
back in the kitchen.
Let's go.

216
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,325
And to all you nice people,
back to your dinner.

217
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,568
Back to chitchat,
back to coffee,

218
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,400
whatever it is that
you'd normally be doing

219
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,403
if I wasn't here
fucking up your day.

220
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,403
On your feet,
back to your tables.

221
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,006
I can't do this.

222
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,249
Hey, look at me.
Yes, you can.

223
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,889
Let's go! Come on!

224
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,241
- Come on!

225
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,531
Bill, I'm gonna need you
in the kitchen

226
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,967
in case the chef decides
to get knife-happy.

227
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,565
- Where are you gonna be?
- Behind the counter

228
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,684
- in case the old boy gets lively.
- Okay.

229
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,004
Oh, Christ.

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,650
Eh, Bonnie, is it?

231
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,610
Darling, if you're crying

232
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,003
when someone comes in here,
they're gonna think something's wrong.

233
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,280
Now, you wouldn't want someone
to get hurt, would you?

234
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,006
- No.
- Big smiles all around, then, eh?

235
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,326
- Yeah?
- Okay.

236
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,927
Yeah. I want him out of here
as soon as possible, understood?

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,610
Yea... yeah.

238
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,728
Where you want me, boss?

239
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,241
- Take one of the back tables.
- Right.

240
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,922
No fuckin' about.

241
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,047
Here, here.

242
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,521
It's all right.

243
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,448
- Hello.
- Hey, Yuri.

244
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,244
Good to see you, Will.

245
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,050
What do you say, Will?

246
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,124
Slow night, huh?

247
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,965
Got kinda busy
about 10 minutes ago.

248
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,043
It's time to play, you ready?

249
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,248
I'm kinda busy right now.

250
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,643
You want piece of pie?

251
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,690
- Oh, pie.
- Pie.

252
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,763
No, I just want some coffee.

253
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,046
You got it.

254
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,043
How long that pot
been sitting out there?

255
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,488
I just made it... fresh pot...
right before it got busy, Will.

256
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,848
More coffee?

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,446
You haven't even put
any coffee in my cup yet, Charlie.

258
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,729
- Damn.
- Shit.

259
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,407
God damn it, Aaron.

260
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,001
I'm not real with it today,

261
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,208
you know what I mean?

262
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,124
You want cream and sugar?

263
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,328
Cream.

264
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,564
I'll take it as it is.

265
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,490
So whose move is it?

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,208
Hmm, Charlie?
Charlie?

267
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,124
Charlie?

268
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,282
Whose move is it?

269
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,685
Your move.

270
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,722
It's your move, Will.

271
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,726
You know what,
I gotta take a leak.

272
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,201
Why don't you top this off again

273
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,964
and I'll be right back
and we'll get into the game.

274
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,610
Sure.

275
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,290
Take your time.

276
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,724
- Yeah.
- I came in like we planned,

277
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,291
but something's not right out here.

278
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,966
I think this... this Brit,
he showed up early.

279
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,764
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,207
You told me there
was gonna be one guy.

281
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,681
Now, Charlie is giving me
signals out here

282
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,251
like there's
a whole crew out here.

283
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,324
Fuck, I told him to go in alone.

284
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,245
What do you mean
they're giving signals?

285
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,447
Are they in there or aren't they?

286
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,967
They're hiding from me. They're acting
like this is business as usual.

287
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,488
This is not what we discussed.

288
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,081
They were supposed to
come in, sit tight

289
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,050
until this played out so Yuri wouldn't
suspect that we were involved.

290
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,089
Now I got fuck knows
how many guys out here with guns

291
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,049
and they're thinking
that I'm the bad guy.

292
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,646
Did you even tell the Brit
that I was gonna be in here?

293
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,403
Step out, step out of the stall.

294
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
Step out of the stall
with your hands up.

295
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,644
What's going on? Will?

296
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,050
Step out.
Get the fuck out!

297
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,248
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

298
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,767
Somebody's robbing this place.

299
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,450
No, shit.

300
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,969
Step forward.

301
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,122
Up against the wall.

302
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,729
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm just a customer, man.

303
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,805
I was in here when it started.

304
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,566
You call 9-1-1?

305
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,449
Yeah, of course.

306
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,810
Did you hear that?

307
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
No, there's a customer
that was in the stall hiding.

308
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,964
He called 9-1-1.
His name is Nick.

309
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,488
- Davenport.
- Nick Davenport.

310
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,047
Did he hear everything
you just said?

311
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,050
Yeah.

312
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,400
- I'll get back to you.

313
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,646
Attention, all units.
2-11 in progress...

314
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,370
- Shit.
- At the Be Brite Diner.

315
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,005
1542 Main Street.

316
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,083
All units report
to location immediately.

317
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,402
Code three.
Repeat, attention, all units.

318
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,927
2-11 in progress
at the Be Brite Diner.

319
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,442
Turn around.

320
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,450
So what are you
really doing here?

321
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,489
What the fuck
are you really doing here?

322
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,481
I told you, man.
I just came in to take a piss.

323
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,488
Don't lie to me.

324
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,722
All hell broke loose.

325
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,127
I called the cops,
for Christ's sake.

326
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,369
Till I figure out
what the fuck's going on,

327
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,806
this is going with me.

328
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,282
I want you to stay right here.

329
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,891
All right, kid?

330
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,090
Friend of yours?

331
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,289
What happened
after the cop got killed?

332
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,284
That's when things
really started to get bad.

333
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,007
- What the fuck's going on?
- Cop was onto us.

334
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,810
Found him in the toilet
with this one.

335
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,769
- So you just shot him?
- Yes, Billy.

336
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,365
That's where all the blood
came from.

337
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,851
- Mate...
- What do you care?

338
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,207
I don't give a fuck,
but I've got a funny feeling

339
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,522
that every other cop
in a 10-mile radius might.

340
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,444
Look, I've told you once already,

341
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,171
you want out,
there's the fucking door.

342
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,363
Maybe, if we're lucky,

343
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,727
he didn't make the call
before you got into him.

344
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,370
That's the spirit.

345
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,682
Now give our new friend here
the once-over.

346
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,842
I don't want any more surprises.

347
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,002
No, no.
No, no.

348
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,481
- Cell phone.
- I don't have one.

349
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,282
That's nice.

350
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,562
Almost time.

351
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,609
On your feet.

352
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,728
- I said on your feet!

353
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,651
Bollocks.
You, help him up.

354
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,007
Help him up.

355
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,801
- Charlie, come on.

356
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,962
Come on.

357
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,090
Off you go, then.

358
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,850
Give me the bag.

359
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,082
Keep an eye on 'em.

360
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,242
Come on.

361
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,842
For your face.

362
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,889
You, that's far enough.

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,082
Let's go.

364
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,768
It's 12:00.
Open it.

365
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,484
Back up! Get the fuck back!
Back in the fucking corner!

366
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,445
What the fuck's going on
back there?!

367
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,524
Looks like
a fucking road accident.

368
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,523
Cloud...

369
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,130
silver lining.

370
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,288
- Glad you came?
- Ask me that

371
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,364
if we get out of here
in one piece.

372
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,522
Off you go, then.

373
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,722
- Say aluminum.
- I don't want to.

374
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,611
Come on, but it sounds so sexy.

375
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,088
- Aluminum.

376
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,566
Now say herb.

377
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,210
Herb.

378
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,882
I love the way you talk.

379
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,690
Really?

380
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,291
- What about the way I...

381
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,886
Don't move! Drop it!

382
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,849
Don't try it, asshole.

383
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,249
Sit down.

384
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,124
Get outta here.

385
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,648
Sorry, love.

386
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,681
You don't pay your girlfriend
to clean up here?

387
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,161
What do you want?

388
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,721
- I need one more favor.
- We had a deal.

389
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,042
You said the last time
we were done.

390
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,044
You're gonna be interested
in this one.

391
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,043
Don't look so fucking upset,
it's easy.

392
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,965
I just need you to get me
a hard drive with some names on it.

393
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,963
Names?

394
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,851
- What names?
- Yours amongst others.

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,843
Mine?

396
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,404
Yours, too, I wager.

397
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,406
It's the big box of secrets
to keep everyone in line

398
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,643
and it belongs
to an associate of ours.

399
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,404
Yuri Mikhalev.

400
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,767
He may look like
a sweet old man,

401
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,571
but he runs organized crime
in Connecticut.

402
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,564
Behind all the rackets,
all the big jobs,

403
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,564
Mikhalev moving chess pieces.

404
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,007
That drive's his
get-out-of-jail-free card.

405
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,130
I wouldn't want it falling
into the wrong hands,

406
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,487
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen

407
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,085
in the next 48 hours

408
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,720
if the FBI raids his safe.

409
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,609
We've got a police informant

410
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,001
inside of Yuri's organization.

411
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,004
The FBI are gonna hit us.

412
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,686
It's on for the 12th,
you got that?

413
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,128
I don't understand
why he's not moving the drive

414
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,924
and I can't ask him
about the message

415
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,969
because I'm not supposed
to know about it.

416
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,851
I think Yuri's selling us out
to the Feds.

417
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,491
- Is there any money in it?
- You're gonna be robbing a joint.

418
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,361
You get me what I need
and everything else you find is yours.

419
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,766
- I'm gonna need my crew.
- No, no crew.

420
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,287
Is that understood?

421
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,368
You go in alone

422
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,091
two minutes before midnight.

423
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,651
Not a moment sooner.

424
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,007
Billy, it's me.
I need you to give Nigel a bell.

425
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,889
Tell him we've got a job
for tonight.

426
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,682
Don't trouble your little mind
with questions, Bill.

427
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,161
Just call Nigel
and tell him to be ready.

428
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,488
- Oi, are you fucking blind?

429
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,529
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow!

430
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,445
Not you, Bill, another cow.

431
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,284
I'll explain everything later.

432
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,849
Why aren't we wearing masks?

433
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,960
How many more times
do I have to fucking tell you?

434
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,041
It's a quick in and out.

435
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,806
This time tomorrow night we'll be
sipping cocktails in Costa Rica.

436
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,964
Why are we sitting out here at 11:30
if we're not going in till midnight?

437
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,805
Well, you'll be thrilled by a change
of plans then, won't you?

438
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,928
- What?
- We're going in early.

439
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,560
- Why?
- Because our generous employer

440
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,961
has told me, as so long
as he gets what he needs,

441
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,646
we can help ourselves
to all the afters.

442
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,320
And seeing as though
I'm not doing this

443
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,488
out of the kindness
of me fucking heart,

444
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,689
we're going in early
and we're doing watches and wallets.

445
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,241
Watches and wallets.

446
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,209
You have seen the shithole
we are gonna rob, right?

447
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,328
- Yeah, what's your point?
- My point, Derrick,

448
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,084
is it's highly unlikely to be filled

449
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,641
with Rolexes
and fucking Louis Vuittons.

450
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,723
Who's Louis Vuitton?
A footballer?

451
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,605
Nigel, do us all a favor
and shut up.

452
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,848
Right.

453
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,843
Hey, what's going on?

454
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,962
I'm tired of being in his pocket.

455
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,362
We get what he wants
outta that safe,

456
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,608
I say there's a deal to be made.

457
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,922
You wanna screw the boss over?

458
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,204
Don't fuck the plan
in the 11th hour, mate.

459
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,129
Don't worry about it, Billy.

460
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,527
He doesn't even know you're here.

461
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,722
Nothing personal, mate.

462
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,006
The whole fucking force
just showed up.

463
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,282
- It's on.

464
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,889
You, Bonnie!

465
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,930
- Come over here.
- No.

466
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,525
Answer it.

467
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,723
Hello?

468
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,851
It's the police.

469
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,404
Talk to them.

470
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,086
Bonnie Potroski.

471
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,570
I'm a waitress here.

472
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,929
He wants to know
if everyone's okay.

473
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,043
Yes, everything is fine.

474
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,969
Yeah, everyone's okay.

475
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,043
He wants to know
how many people are here.

476
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,361
- That's enough for now.

477
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,000
Back to where you were.
Go on!

478
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,846
I want the public at least
three blocks back from here.

479
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,451
Nobody gets in unless I clear it.

480
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
Looks like more rain's
on the way, sir.

481
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,730
Oh, perfect.

482
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,962
Good of you to join us.

483
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,248
- What's the situation?
- Perimeter's secure.

484
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,767
Snipers in position front and rear.
They got nowhere to go.

485
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,763
- Any visibility?
- No, sir.

486
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,809
Blinds are down
on all the windows.

487
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,008
So we have no idea
what's going on in there.

488
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,040
- Numbers?
- Well, we're a little light

489
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,401
on details,
but it's a late-night diner,

490
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,528
so at the very least
we got the staff in there.

491
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,887
I spoke to Bonnie Potroski,
a waitress.

492
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,281
She was very scared.
Someone was telling her what to say.

493
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,408
- Which was?
- She said everything was fine,

494
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,449
but we had reports of gunfire.

495
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,602
It could be really
fucking messy in there.

496
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,001
- How many gunmen?
- We think at least two.

497
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,128
On top of that,
we got one of our own in there.

498
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,521
This squad car was issued
to Will Tompkins.

499
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,287
And I know him.
20-year vet, good cop.

500
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,967
- You made any contact?
- No, but we got a suspect.

501
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,248
A Nicolas Davenport.

502
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,244
We ran his name. He just spent
three months in County.

503
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,085
- You think he's involved?

504
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,810
Maybe even running the show.

505
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,167
- Who's your informant?
- Stay on the phone.

506
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,362
One second, I gotta take this.

507
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,926
Anything else I should know?

508
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,687
We ran the plates
on the Cutlass. It's stolen.

509
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,968
All right, I make every call
from here on.

510
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,730
- That clear?
- What's your plan?

511
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,849
Get them talking.

512
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,963
The negotiator's about to start in.

513
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,691
Uh-huh.
Any idea on the suspect?

514
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,042
There's a Nick Davenport.

515
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,409
Just got out of county. Registered
address two blocks from the diner.

516
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,530
- 2240 Lincoln.
- He got any family there?

517
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,530
Yeah, his wife.
Amanda Davenport.

518
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,490
All right, well, keep me appraised.
I want this shit cleaned up.

519
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,565
It's okay, baby.

520
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,281
Here you go.
Direct line's right here, sir.

521
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,409
Just like last time.
Find out what he wants.

522
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,004
- Hello?
- With whom am I speaking?

523
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,481
- This is Bonnie.
- Bonnie, this is Jeff Porter.

524
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,130
I work with the police department.

525
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,521
This phone is a direct line to me now
whenever you pick it up.

526
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,246
I need to talk to
whoever's in charge in there.

527
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,687
He wants to talk
to whoever's in charge.

528
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,965
He says he doesn't wanna talk.

529
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,249
Tell him I can't give him what
he wants unless he gets on the phone.

530
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,727
He can't get you what you want
unless you talk to him.

531
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,721
- I'm listening.
- My name is Jeff Porter.

532
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,167
- What's your name?
- Look, the only thing

533
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,245
you need to understand is that
unless I get your full cooperation,

534
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,448
I'm going to redecorate the insides

535
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,683
of the Be Brite Diner
with pints of blood.

536
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,009
You have my full cooperation.
I wanna give you what you want

537
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,003
so nobody gets hurt, okay?

538
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,640
I wanna make that really clear.
I'm gonna try and help you out.

539
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,768
That's very fucking kind of you, mate.

540
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,527
I'm overwhelmed by
your compassion for my situation.

541
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,125
We have reports of gunfire.

542
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,203
Is there anybody in there
that's injured?

543
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,207
Look, if somebody's hurt,
let them come out,

544
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,203
then we can do business.

545
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,081
There are a lot of cops out here
who like to do this a different way,

546
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,128
so let's help each other out.

547
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,090
I'll tell you what,
as a sign of how reasonable

548
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,210
I'm prepared to be,
we'll let one out.

549
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,685
Thank you, appreciate that.

550
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,770
I'll send in two paramedics
with a stretcher. Is that okay?

551
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,410
Uh-uh, scratch that.

552
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,211
We'll take her out to you.

553
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
They're sending out
an injured party.

554
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,648
I want a wide area
around that door.

555
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,007
Back an ambulance up
about 20 feet away.

556
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,328
Not too close.
I don't wanna make them nervous.

557
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,403
Getting somebody out alive
will give us a better idea

558
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,403
of what we're dealing with.

559
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,482
Let's get you geared up.

560
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,130
Why you tell them
we're gonna send one out?

561
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,203
'Cause we are.

562
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,326
- Which one?
- Her.

563
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,448
She'll do nicely.

564
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,641
I'm not walking her out.

565
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,408
I will.

566
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,244
I'll do it.

567
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,331
Oh, yeah.
You missed my announcement.

568
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,881
I don't want any heroes,

569
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,250
but volunteers are welcome.

570
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,126
You take her out,
you don't say shit,

571
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,285
and if you're not back in 30 seconds,
it's bye-bye, Bonnie.

572
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,364
- Are we crystal?
- Clear.

573
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,011
Pick her up.

574
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,329
I'll be back.

575
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,324
All personnel, stand down.

576
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,881
Civilians exiting the building.
Stand down.

577
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,082
Maintain 20-foot radius.

578
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,725
It's over there.

579
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,285
Are you okay?

580
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,722
Talk to me.

581
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,640
You need to tell me
what's going on in there.

582
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,410
Is she all right?

583
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,610
Is anybody else in there hurt?

584
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,642
Is that your blood?

585
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,122
Talk to me, I'm right here.
I can give you what you need.

586
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,206
I can't talk to you.

587
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,566
She was going into cardiac shock.

588
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,286
That was Nick Davenport
and he's covered in blood.

589
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,761
- We gotta go in there.
- No, no. They sent someone out.

590
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,481
That's a start.
We need to keep talking.

591
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,005
I gotta remind you
there's a cop in there?

592
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,571
Do I have to remind you
who's in charge?

593
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,610
- Tompkins is my main priority.
- This is my operation, Barnes.

594
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,366
Trust me, we're a long way
from moving in.

595
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,484
Now tell me more about Davenport.

596
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,563
- I think he's one of them.
- Based on what?

597
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,405
What makes you think
he didn't volunteer to bring her out?

598
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,483
If you think that he was such a hero,
why did he go back in?

599
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,484
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a major fucking suspect.

600
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,726
There are an unknown
number of hostages being held,

601
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,167
but it is believed that
there is at least one

602
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,163
police officer among them.

603
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,800
- Sources inform us...
- Oh, my God.

604
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,040
...negotiators are on the scene
and are attempting...

605
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,447
Nick was just there
to talk to Patrick.

606
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,443
- ...again, very sketchy information...

607
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,450
Hi. Mrs. Davenport?

608
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,887
Is this about Nick?

609
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,960
Yeah, I'm afraid it is. I'm gonna have
to ask you to come with me, please.

610
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,008
You might wanna get a jacket.

611
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,608
You, come over here.

612
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,570
Answer it.
Tell them you've got demands

613
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,610
and if they don't cooperate,
the cop will be the first to die.

614
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,684
- No.
- Come again?

615
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,729
I won't do it.

616
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,565
- Really?

617
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,564
- Hello?
- Yeah, who is this?

618
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,961
I've got demands.

619
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,521
Specific demands.

620
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,728
What now?

621
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,362
- Hello, hello?

622
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,528
Now we wait.

623
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,731
- What is this place?
- Just come on.

624
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,802
Come on.

625
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,570
This is Jeff Porter.

626
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,041
We wanna help you
with those demands,

627
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,168
- but we need some way to communicate.
- Well, that didn't take long.

628
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,603
You go out there and you tell them
we need a SUV to take us to the airport.

629
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,604
Once we get the SUV,
he gets four hostages.

630
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,001
Tell him we need a jet and a crew

631
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,601
waiting on the runway
fueled up and ready to go.

632
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,684
And once we get on board,
he gets three more hostages.

633
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,525
- Got that?
- Yeah.

634
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,762
Good.
On your way, then.

635
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,126
Oi, same rules as before.

636
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,484
Got it.

637
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,401
- I'm unarmed.
- So am I.

638
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,086
SUV and a fucking plane?

639
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,561
- Are you out of your mind?
- It'll buy us time.

640
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,768
For what?

641
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,730
- Plan B.
- Which is?

642
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,770
Soon to be revealed, mate.

643
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,804
Let's just let him
keep them preoccupied, shall we?

644
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,807
- What's your name?
- Nick.

645
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,803
So how'd you get involved
in this, Nick?

646
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,088
I'm not involved.

647
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,129
I just met
my brother here for coffee.

648
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,930
You can ask him.

649
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,361
Is everyone in there okay?

650
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,966
No, they're not okay.

651
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,684
Do I look like I'm okay?

652
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,366
They want a SUV
to take them to the airport.

653
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,251
When they get the SUV,
you get four hostages.

654
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,687
And they want a jet
waiting for them on the runway.

655
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,731
When they get on the jet,
you get three more.

656
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,724
- The rest go with them.
- I'll see what I can do.

657
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,922
Make sure that SUV
gets here quick.

658
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,845
Hey.

659
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,002
So we can talk.

660
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,284
What did you say to him?

661
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,283
Exactly what you told me to.

662
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,807
You wouldn't be fucking me about,
would you, boy?

663
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,128
- No.
- Good.

664
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,844
Oi, Bill.

665
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,843
I'm having a piss.

666
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,127
We got plainclothes
going to Davenport's house.

667
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,884
Pick up his wife.

668
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,601
And this is interesting,
the guy's brother is Patrick Davenport.

669
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,684
- Who is Patrick Davenport?
- Internal Affairs.

670
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,161
You're kidding.
Get him down here now.

671
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,442
He's already on his way.

672
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,042
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you,

673
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,726
I'm Detective O'Reilly.
This is Detective Creedy.

674
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,689
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk

675
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,127
- to Mrs. Amanda Davenport.
- She's not here.

676
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,760
- Your guy already came and got her.
- What?

677
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,008
- Porter.
- O'Reilly here.

678
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,446
We're at Davenport's house.

679
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,888
Her mother says some cops
picked her up about 15 minutes ago.

680
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,044
- They identify themselves?
- We checked with dispatch.

681
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,328
Whoever did this,
they weren't cops.

682
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,804
What's going on?

683
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,601
A couple of guys pretending to be cops
picked up Davenport's wife.

684
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,922
I gotta take this.

685
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,570
Hey, you got an update for me?

686
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,688
A couple of detectives
went to Davenport's house

687
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,770
to bring in his wife,
but she was picked up already.

688
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,922
- I don't know by who.
- I've got her.

689
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,128
You just worry about
wrapping things up on your end.

690
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,009
Am I clear?

691
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,088
Why aren't we at a police station?

692
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,762
How long you've been married?

693
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,250
How long?

694
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,881
Almost two years.

695
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,644
Why don't you tell me
about the men

696
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,604
that your husband's
working with?

697
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,529
What men?

698
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,484
He's not working with anybody.

699
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,282
Thanks.

700
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,884
Want some water?

701
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,883
I get dehydrated,

702
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,003
so I like a lot of water.

703
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,922
Copy that.

704
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,004
- Lieutenant Davenport.
- What's the situation?

705
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,926
Well, your brother's
up to his balls

706
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,163
- in an armed robbery.
- At his usual haunt

707
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,408
that just happens to be
owned by Yuri Mikhalev?

708
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,960
Come on, Barnes.
He'd never do that.

709
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,889
I was just here with him
45 minutes ago.

710
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,407
Whatever's going down here,
he's got nothing to do with it.

711
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,850
What are you doing
still coming to this place?

712
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,048
You know you can't hang out
in a diner

713
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,850
owned by someone
like Yuri Mikhalev.

714
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,082
I like it.
I know everybody.

715
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,691
- You lost weight.
- No club sandwiches on the inside.

716
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,649
Yeah, it's not supposed
to be easy.

717
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,161
Look, Nick,

718
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,970
you made me look bad today.

719
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,283
I know.
I'm sorry.

720
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,851
How do you just not show up
for a job interview?

721
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,128
Amanda agreed to meet me.

722
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,930
What, so you just blow it off?

723
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,088
She's my wife, Patrick.

724
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,083
I'm doing everything I can
to make it all work out.

725
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,720
I get that,
but you don't let him know,

726
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,365
you don't call me,
that's not the way to start.

727
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,090
- I've got myself a gig lined up.
- With who?

728
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,890
- Some people that I met.
- Some people you met.

729
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,487
- Some people you met in prison, Nick.

730
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,211
I told you.
It's a legit gig, Pat.

731
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,051
- Jesus, Pat.
- Take it.

732
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,769
Thanks.

733
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,889
I gotta go.

734
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,329
- Everything's gonna work out, okay?
- Yeah.

735
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,728
Well, all I know is
there's a diner being robbed

736
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,961
and your brother's
in the thick of it.

737
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,566
Of course you wouldn't understand,
because there's real police work.

738
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,210
As opposed to what I do?

739
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,120
You've ruined the livelihood
of good cops...

740
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,686
- men with wives, their families.
- If they're good cops,

741
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,120
they got nothing to worry about.

742
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,362
And you should stay focused
for half a minute

743
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,727
on getting my brother and the rest
of the hostages outta there.

744
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,327
The negotiator Jeff Porter,
he wants to speak with you.

745
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,244
Thank you so much
for coming back.

746
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,687
I wasn't gonna leave you
here alone.

747
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,764
Yeah, but you could've surrendered
out there and you would've been safe.

748
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,489
I figured that if Amanda
was in this situation...

749
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,210
that I'd hope somebody
would come back and look after her.

750
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,604
It's gonna be okay.

751
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,008
Excuse me,
I really have to use the restroom.

752
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,202
It's a bit messy in there, love.

753
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,409
You don't let people use the restroom,
it's gonna get a bit messy in here.

754
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,169
Nigel, take her.

755
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,645
Not without me.

756
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,204
I beg your pardon?

757
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,886
I don't want her
going anywhere alone with him.

758
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,803
Who, Nigel? That's a bit
fucking offensive, isn't it?

759
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,251
He's a nice bloke.

760
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,641
- Aren't you, Nigel?
- Yeah.

761
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,122
Now sit down and shut up.

762
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,369
That's a good boy.

763
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,362
You all right?
What is it? What happened?

764
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,285
There's a dead body in there.

765
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,447
You know, Nick was just there
meeting up with his brother.

766
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,044
You wanna call him?

767
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,451
Yeah.

768
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,724
- Whose phone is that?

769
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,204
It's Charlie's private line

770
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,850
in his office.

771
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,002
On your feet now!

772
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,002
Come on!

773
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,329
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

774
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,801
Answer the phone.

775
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,644
Answer it!

776
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,131
Oh, my God.

777
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,168
- Come on.
- Hello?

778
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,368
Bonnie, it's Amanda. You okay?

779
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,171
No, they're right here
in front of me.

780
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,211
- Will they let me talk to him?
- It's for Nick, it's his wife.

781
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,887
Now why would the kid's wife
have the private line?

782
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,441
The cops put her up to it,
didn't they?

783
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,610
- Because?
- Because they think he's the mastermind

784
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,161
behind this whole fucking thing.
Now get him in here.

785
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,005
- Go on.
- That's not true.

786
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,687
- Nick would never...
- Shh.

787
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,730
Hmm, Bonnie, Bonnie.

788
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,485
You are a proper sort,
aren't you?

789
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,521
You've been very helpful.

790
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,282
Perhaps another time.

791
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,251
- It's your wife.
- Amanda.

792
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,210
- Are you okay?
- I don't know, are you?

793
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,251
Yeah, I'm fine, baby.

794
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,880
- Jesus, Nick, I'm scared.
- Don't be.

795
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,805
- How did you get into this?
- I'm not in this.

796
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,442
I was just meeting Patrick.
I would never do this to us.

797
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,202
I need you to believe me.

798
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,124
I had nothing to do with this.

799
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,282
Let me talk to him.

800
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,404
You have a very beautiful wife,
my friend.

801
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,564
And I understand that
very soon you're gonna be a father.

802
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,286
I would very much
like to see that happen,

803
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,330
but I also have the power
to see that it doesn't happen.

804
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,687
You got 30 minutes...
30 minutes from right now

805
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,126
to put the hard drive
back in the safe.

806
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,169
You walk out of there
with everything the way it was.

807
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,641
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

808
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,327
30 minutes or your wife,
your kid, your life, done.

809
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,482
You understand that?

810
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,082
I love you, too.

811
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,404
- Very touching.
- Who has my wife?

812
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,682
The police, who else?
Come on, on your way.

813
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,724
Oh, no, don't. Don't!
We need him alive!

814
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,723
If you ever pull a stunt
like that again,

815
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,723
I will kill this woman.

816
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,803
Yeah?

817
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,128
Come on.

818
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,170
As soon as we find her whereabouts,
I wanna know, that clear?

819
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,288
Can I talk to you privately
for a second?

820
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,442
- Give me a minute.
- Got it.

821
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,001
What I'm about to tell you
stays between us, okay?

822
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,609
I just found out the Feds
have an informant in the diner.

823
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,405
That informant was about to come
forward with something vital

824
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,170
to their whole operation.

825
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,721
An active informant
in the diner now?

826
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,008
- Who is it?
- I don't know,

827
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,889
and they won't say.

828
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,362
There's fear of a leak
in the department.

829
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,851
They gotta protect the guy.

830
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,729
The wrong people
find out who he is...

831
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,607
well, I don't need to tell you.

832
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,407
- Matthews.
- Hear me very fucking clearly.

833
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,289
The assholes who pulled this

834
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,363
cannot walk out of that diner.

835
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,602
Understood.

836
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,768
What about Davenport?

837
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,400
Same order.
We clean this up.

838
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,604
- Oi, where are you off to?
- I need the toilet.

839
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,649
- A number one or number two?
- What?

840
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,245
Because if it's a number two,

841
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,125
allow me to provide you
with a magazine to read.

842
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,651
What do you want me to do?
I need a piss.

843
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,564
Hurry UP!

844
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,364
Shots fired, shots fired!

845
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,726
Shots fired, shots fired!

846
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,524
The cops are trying
to come in through the back!

847
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,604
Everyone stay there
and be fucking cool.

848
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,325
Stay where you are!

849
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,768
Nick, what's going on in there?

850
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,649
- Nick?
- Come over here.

851
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,165
Pick up that radio.

852
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,970
You tell them if they even try
to come in here,

853
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,771
I will execute every last hostage.

854
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,127
The cops are trying to come in
through the back, man.

855
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,961
You promised us.
People are going to die.

856
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,561
- It was a mistake, Nick.
- Let me talk to him.

857
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,200
I'm gonna straighten it out.
Stand down!

858
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,443
Stand down!
Nobody go near the damn diner!

859
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,965
Back, get back!

860
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,088
Get us that SUV
and get us the hell outta here!

861
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,567
Back where you were.

862
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,200
Everyone stay calm.

863
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,248
- All right, Bill?
- Yeah, fine. You?

864
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,243
Never better.

865
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,920
SWAT tried to go through
the back door.

866
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,650
- Who gave the order?
- Nobody ordered it.

867
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,485
I'm in full command of this situation,
you understand that?

868
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,210
A couple of our guys went
to take a look and got made.

869
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,561
It was a mistake.

870
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,768
Those guys don't make mistakes,
they follow orders.

871
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,720
If you're trying to go behind my back,
it's gonna be a fucking problem.

872
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,842
Oh, come on.
We're in this together.

873
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,731
So what's going on?

874
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,645
I'm guessing it's a boy.

875
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,604
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

876
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,643
Knew it.

877
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,729
I have four sisters,

878
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,247
so you learn these things.

879
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,129
When you carry a baby low,

880
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,886
like you, it's a boy.

881
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,567
Bet your husband,
he's happy it's a boy, I bet, huh?

882
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,966
Yeah.

883
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,966
SUV's here.

884
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,405
Hey, Nick?

885
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,927
Tell him you're gonna come out
and check the SUV.

886
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,168
Make sure there's no surprises.

887
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,011
- I'm here.
- SUV's here.

888
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,969
Gassed up and ready to go.

889
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,122
You owe me four hostages.

890
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,370
I've gotta check it first.

891
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,489
I'm coming out.

892
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,803
I never got to have kids.

893
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,002
I'm sorry to say.

894
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,888
I lead a very quiet life.

895
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,327
It gives me time
to think about things.

896
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,963
I have this clock at home
that always helps me think.

897
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,051
It's a piece of ormolu.

898
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,645
Did you ever hear of it?

899
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,764
It's golden, French, 1800s.

900
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,082
It's a beautiful piece, beautiful.

901
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,208
But guess what they call it?

902
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,609
A death clock.

903
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,483
It's got these
two pudgy cherubs holding it.

904
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,490
All kinds of flowers.

905
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,608
It's very Louis XIV.

906
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,882
Everything's plated with gold.

907
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,609
This is back
when they used mercury

908
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,001
to plate the gold to the brass.

909
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,288
These poor schmucks,
they didn't know any better.

910
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,446
Once a clock was plated
and perfect,

911
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,682
they'd heat up the clock

912
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,803
to burn off the mercury,

913
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,327
and the room that they were in

914
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,451
would fill with poison gas.

915
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,286
Their hands, clothes,

916
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,801
their lungs...

917
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,088
it was a disaster.

918
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,607
Everyone who built these clocks...

919
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,081
these beautiful clocks...

920
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,089
died.

921
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,806
The clock makers,
the apprentices,

922
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,450
the children.

923
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,967
Their whole families, dead.

924
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,561
You got directions
on the dashboard

925
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,200
to a secure gate at the airport
where they'll walk you through,

926
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,210
but you still can do this
another way.

927
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,205
Is the jet ready?

928
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,802
I have a clean shot.
Waiting for a go.

929
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,883
There's been a short delay,
but it'll be ready by

930
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,441
- the time you get to the airport.
- How long?

931
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,524
- No more than an hour.
- That's too long!

932
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,648
There's nothing I can do
about that, Nick.

933
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,361
- The jet is not there.
- No, that doesn't work!

934
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,164
What's he doing?

935
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,607
Imagine that.

936
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,081
Imagine a man

937
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,810
mastering a craft that he hopes

938
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,685
will provide for his family

939
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,770
only to destroy
everyone that he loves

940
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,891
and kills himself, too.

941
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,810
- Who's got my wife?
- We're trying to locate her.

942
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,884
Answer me.
Where's my wife?

943
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,566
- Amanda's fine, Nick.
- That's bullshit!

944
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,121
I spoke to her,
someone's got her!

945
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,362
We don't know where she is now.

946
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,683
Jesus fucking Christ.

947
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,490
We need him back in here.

948
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,881
Oh, I'll just skip on out there
and pull him in, shall I?

949
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,928
- Shut up.
- God damn it,

950
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,969
I trusted you.

951
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,885
- You lied to me.
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky,

952
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,088
- Stand down!
- Stop!

953
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,648
It's pitiful to think about.

954
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,082
So...

955
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,963
I just sit

956
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,691
staring at my clock.

957
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,649
Do you think before the end,

958
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,928
before his last breath,

959
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,811
the clock maker had any idea

960
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,883
he was killing himself

961
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,765
and his family, too?

962
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,531
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Nick.

963
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,206
You wanna help these people?

964
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,844
You go in there and you end it

965
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,684
or someone's gonna die.

966
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,285
We have a direct threat.

967
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,362
Take him out.

968
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,089
No, no, no!

969
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,286
Oh, God! Nick!

970
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,169
Bravo Team,
you're clear to take the back door, go!

971
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,601
Stay down!
Everyone, stay down!

972
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,201
Stay down! Stay down!

973
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,484
Derrick, what's plan B?

974
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,290
This.

975
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,126
Derrick?!

976
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,804
Derrick?!

977
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,247
- Sorry, mate.

978
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,002
- Derrick?!

979
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,211
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

980
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,447
Derrick, please!

981
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,840
Put your gun down!
Put your gun down!

982
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,724
Freeze!
Let me see your hands!

983
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,929
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

984
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,570
I'm fine.

985
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,411
One of them's in the kitchen.
He's got a hostage. Go!

986
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,449
- Clear.
- Clear.

987
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,090
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

988
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,083
Move it, move!

989
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,730
- Clear.
- Clear.

990
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,531
They're killing the hostages!
Get in there, go!

991
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,409
Hurry!

992
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,211
Nick, Nick.
What is going on with Amanda?

993
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,203
Tell me what you know
and we'll find her.

994
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,444
Nick? Nick, talk to me.

995
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,324
Nick?!

996
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,851
Hey, that was
a hostage you shot,

997
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,445
for Christ's sake.

998
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,490
Officers, I'll finish this up.

999
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,208
Wow, Yuri, that was quite a fucking mess
we had on our hands there.

1000
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,203
It was three Brits
that came in and did this!

1001
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,646
Yeah, and Davenport
was the ringleader.

1002
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,041
Your man has his wife.

1003
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,771
That kid?
You've got shit for brains, Barnes.

1004
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,048
- He wasn't behind any of it.
- What?

1005
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,443
Give me your phone.

1006
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,565
- It's me.
- You okay?

1007
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,929
Davenport's not our guy.
He's just a pawn.

1008
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,202
Whoever pulled this
got the drive.

1009
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,771
Find him.

1010
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,769
What do you want me to do
with the wife?

1011
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,647
- Unit three, do you copy?
- Go, three.

1012
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,081
Did anyone come out
the back of the diner?

1013
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,846
Uniform they had hostage. Nobody else.

1014
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,048
Do you have eyes
on that individual now?

1015
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,328
- Negative.
- Fuck it.

1016
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,966
Tell them to check
the bathroom.

1017
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,566
- Check the bathroom.
- Copy that.

1018
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,005
We've got what appears to be
Will Tompkins' dead body here.

1019
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,488
He's got no shirt.
Repeat, he's got no shirt.

1020
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,566
The uniform that went out
the back was our perp.

1021
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,324
Find the son of a bitch.

1022
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,091
We'll get him, Yuri.
We'll get him.

1023
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,805
All emergency responders,

1024
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,009
diner suspect at large
driving a black and white.

1025
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,686
- PD fleet two...

1026
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,280
You understand this.

1027
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,842
You got 30 minutes... 30 minutes
to put the hard drive back in the safe

1028
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,846
or your wife,
your kid, your life, done.

1029
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,083
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1030
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,681
Watch where you're going,
you stupid bitch.

1031
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,320
You hear the siren?
Are you fucking deaf?

1032
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,322
Oi, are you blind?!

1033
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,244
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow.

1034
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,210
Get off your cell phone, lady.

1035
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,044
There you go, there you go.

1036
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,209
Hey, man, come back!

1037
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,408
Mike, he just ran out!

1038
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,449
Turn around.

1039
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,604
Call everyone.

1040
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,922
I want the bastard
who took the hard drive.

1041
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,362
- Hello?
- All right, Barnes.

1042
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,126
I've got your hard drive,
but now it's gonna cost you.

1043
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,449
- Who is this?
- Who's this?

1044
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,887
- Who the hell are you?

1045
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,562
You're the one who's got Lieutenant
Barnes's phone, but you're not him.

1046
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,486
You're speaking to Yuri Mikhalev.

1047
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,291
That's my drive you've got.

1048
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,727
Well, then this might be
both of our lucky day.

1049
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,730
Mrs. Davenport, it's over.

1050
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,882
Time to go home.

1051
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,682
Easy, mate, easy.

1052
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,283
Charlie was my friend.

1053
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,603
He bled to death in his own office.

1054
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,168
I knew him 30 years.

1055
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,448
You're that fellow with the fancy watch.

1056
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,921
- Yuri Mikhalev.

1057
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,048
Christ.

1058
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,240
If I would have known
it was you in there all night,

1059
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,442
I would've watched me
Ps and Qs.

1060
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,003
I should kill you right now.

1061
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,407
You could do that,

1062
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,450
but then you'd never see
your precious hard drive again, eh?

1063
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,365
Baby, I promise this is the last car

1064
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,170
I'm ever breaking into.

1065
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,561
As for your friend Charlie,

1066
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,529
my condolences,

1067
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,127
but I lost two of my colleagues
in that royal fuck up.

1068
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,931
It's not me you should blame,
it's Barnes.

1069
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,048
I am.

1070
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,361
I did.

1071
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,361
Boss, Barnes got the message.

1072
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,730
Unless you want to join him,
you better give me the drive.

1073
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,849
Money first.

1074
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,766
- He probably left it in the car.
- Happy hunting.

1075
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,651
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

1076
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,405
How do I know
you didn't make a copy?

1077
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,562
I barely had enough time
to ditch the cruiser

1078
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,165
when I got out of that diner.

1079
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,324
Who do you think I am,
Harry fucking Houdini?

1080
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,969
Oi, the money's light.

1081
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,407
This is the best I could do
on such short notice.

1082
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,643
Who do you think I am?
Harry Houdini?

1083
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,243
Hey, tell your dog
to put that piece away.

1084
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,482
This is a family establishment.

1085
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,927
We don't want
any unnecessary attention.

1086
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,407
Put it away.

1087
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,369
Barnes thought
you made a deal with the FBI.

1088
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,320
- He thought you sold him out.
- Barnes was an idiot.

1089
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,131
A lot of people suffered
because of your actions tonight.

1090
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,931
My men almost executed
the kid's wife.

1091
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,923
They were an unlucky couple.

1092
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,491
Wrong place at the wrong time.

1093
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,445
- What'd you do with 'em?
- The girl has been released

1094
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,688
and now the police know
Davenport had nothing to do

1095
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,571
- with what happened at the diner.
- Ended up all right, then, didn't it?

1096
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,167
By the way,
I am that fucking stupid.

1097
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,965
Right.

1098
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,005
Here's your hard drive.

1099
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,886
I told you
I didn't want any heroes.

1100
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,441
A lot of people are dead

1101
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,608
or will go to jail
because of that drive.

1102
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,046
Why don't you tell me about
the gig that Charlie gave you?

1103
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,331
I... I just had to give
a message to somebody.

1104
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,881
We know who you went to see.

1105
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,327
It's on for the 12th,
you got that?

1106
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,363
A friend of mine said
that the police were all excited

1107
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,881
about hearing something
that was on for the 12th.

1108
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,520
- So?
- There was nothing on for the 12th.

1109
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,569
There was no FBI sting.

1110
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,802
That was just a test.

1111
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,849
We knew someone was giving
information at the diner,

1112
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,162
we just didn't know who.

1113
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,447
It was you.

1114
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,728
You're the fuckin' rat.

1115
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,042
The FBI are gonna hit us.

1116
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,044
I want you to tell 'em
it's on for the 12th.

1117
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,521
Unfortunately for my boss,

1118
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,808
once Barnes got the message,
he got paranoid

1119
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,440
and set in motion
the clusterfuck at the diner.

1120
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,729
Thought I'd find you here.

1121
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,803
Come in,
I want you to see something.

1122
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,968
Come on, come on!

1123
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,644
Huh?

1124
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,922
- What do you think?
- Hey.

1125
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,889
It's not bad.
It's not bad at all.

1126
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,923
Thanks for doing this.

1127
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,287
I forgot how handy
having you around can be.

1128
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,929
Sorry I doubted you, man.

1129
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,969
Recovered as evidence.

1130
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,849
Try not to lose it this time.

1131
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,606
That hard drive you gave me
is gonna do a lot of good.

1132
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,890
You're in the clear, Nick.

1133
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,202
I pulled some strings.

1134
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,362
Thank you.

1135
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,247
- I'm gonna get going.
- Hey,

1136
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,721
any lead on the guy
who took me?

1137
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,645
No, but we'll get him.

1138
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,402
I'll see ya.

1139
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,562
Back to work.

1140
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,845
- Those are screws.
- I know.

1141
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,207
- I knew that.
- Ta-da.

1142
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,044
Springs.
