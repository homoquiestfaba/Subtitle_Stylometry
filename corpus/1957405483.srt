1
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:21,005
(ambient music)

2
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,429
- [Darcy] Leila once said
that somebody once said

3
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,643
that all stories end in death or marriage.

4
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,904
- Ugh!

5
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,569
- [Darcy] That's 'cause
somebody was a complete idiot.

6
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,570
- Sweetie, wait!

7
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,819
- You could argue that they're more

8
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,799
or less the same thing anyway,

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,803
but hey, this is Leila's story, not mine.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,823
- His note says, he's dead.

11
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,946
- He signed it,

12
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:09,669
and he dotted the I in his
name with a little happy face.

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,869
- From this day forward,

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,309
I swear to God that I will
never let some lying clown

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,489
tell me he loves me,

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,949
much less agree to marry him for it.

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,109
- Nonsense.

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,609
- I'll die first.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,319
- You'll go to Harvard first.

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,439
- [Darcy] Okay granted getting blown off

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,399
on your wedding day
sucks a pretty big one,

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,309
but you know, hunt him down and kill him,

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,723
don't go all hysterical.

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,639
I mean, what chick hasn't sworn off boys

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,779
at some point in her life.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,809
Really, they're like cigarettes,

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,229
you try out a few in
the woods behind school.

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,439
You puke, you give 'em up,

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,209
but right around that third jello shot,

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,110
they start to sound pretty good again.

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,719
And while we're at it,

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,269
what guy hasn't had his most tender lies?

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,613
Well, you know, burnt up.

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,640
What I'm trying to say is you get over it.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,683
Unless of course you're still a virgin,

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,183
then it can take awhile.

37
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,083
A long while.

38
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,268
(upbeat reggae music)

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,890
- Good morning, Paxil.

40
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:41,796
♪ Say the truth will reveal you now ♪

41
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:42,797
Brunch.

42
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,469
Wanna go to the park later?

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,882
(Paxil barks)

44
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:51,883
♪ You see their faces but you
never know their thoughts ♪

45
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:57,445
♪ Everyday me not done talking deep ♪

46
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,437
♪ So deep ♪

00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:04,438

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,869
- [Darcy] So 12 years
later and Leila Sweet

52
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,259
remains the poster child
for purity, gorgeous,

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,649
virtuous, clueless.

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,189
Lost in the sexual woods
with a big moral compass,

55
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,089
but without the thing
they put in the compass

56
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,259
to make it actually points somewhere.

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,459
And if on the bright side,

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,179
she has one male friend,

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,409
note that he's on the end of the leash,

60
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,624
and he's named after an antidepressant.

61
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,506
- Come Paxil.

62
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,215
Come on, he won't bite.

63
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,216
Come on.

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Good boy.

65
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:53,093
- What do you call this?

66
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:55,369
- (chuckles) It doesn't have a name.

67
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,959
- Where is Paxil?

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,139
- He's afraid of you.

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,549
- Well try it at least, dear,

70
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,389
it's full of vitamins and quite slimming.

71
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,989
- Is your sister joining us?

72
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,699
- She's on the phone with Donald.

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,619
- Oh yes, Donald.

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,809
- He's a very nice boy.

75
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,643
Good family.

76
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:12,009
- Can I have those toast.

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,239
- He's about to be our son-in-law.

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,179
- Must be great in the sheets.

79
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,353
- Ernest?
- What?

80
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,129
Like you're both having
thought the same thing,

81
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,889
or you probably haven't.

82
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,063
- Dad, what now.

83
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,072
Ew!

84
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:28,123
- It's quite seeming.

85
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,469
- Here we are.

86
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,359
So ready for the big day?

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,819
- I guess.

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,379
- It's going to be a beautiful ceremony.

89
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,839
I book Sin Andrews.
- Again?

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,179
- Ernest.

91
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,448
- You're quite a grouchy
uncle, aren't you?

92
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,282
- Well, ignore him.

93
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,199
You just fell off the
horse once, that's all.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,699
- I think she got bucked off.

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,149
- You're right again, sweetie.

96
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,859
In a great big billowing white dress.

97
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,589
- Okay, can I remind you all
that I am not marriage minded.

98
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,309
I hate love.

99
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,769
I hate weddings except for yours,

100
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,389
and I hate white dresses.

101
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,969
- Obviously, you burned
a perfectly good one,

102
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,863
to billowing gray ashes.

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,329
- Okay, I have to go.

104
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,430
I'm late for the park.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,333
Come on, Paxil.

106
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,597
- Oh, sweetie, no.

107
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,443
- How can you be late to a park?

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,713
- Bye!

109
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:30,266
(bouncy music)

110
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,269
(children playing)

111
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,529
- Listen to this,

112
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,319
researchers announced that male
dogs raised in New York city

113
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,199
are at an increased risk to
develop medical problems,

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,629
including anxiety, skin rashes,
depression, tooth decay,

115
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,030
hypochondria, and impotence.

116
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,467
But that's so sad.

117
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,024
Here you go.

118
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,348
- Thank you.

119
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:02,932
(bouncy music)

120
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,690
- Yours?

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
- Me?

122
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,639
No, mine.

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Paxil.

124
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,683
- Very fuzzy head.

125
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,819
- Yours?

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,489
- Oh, that's my sister's.

127
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,743
I steal them on Sundays.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,980
We were just about to leave.

129
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,309
I don't suppose you'd want to
get a cup of coffee with us.

130
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,858
- I wouldn't?

131
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:39,692
- You would?

132
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,519
- Oh no, I just wondering why you thought

133
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,609
that I wouldn't.

134
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,677
- So you won't?

135
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,389
- I actually don't do this.

136
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,240
- What?

137
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,549
- The talking to you part.

138
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,550
- I understand.

139
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,220
- Thanks though.

140
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
- Sure.

141
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,353
(peaceful piano music)

142
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:38,146
(car honks)
- Daddy!

143
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:42,179
(chiming music)

144
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:49,989
Daddy!

145
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:50,822
- Leila.

146
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,134
Hi, honey.

147
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:52,968
How are you?

148
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:53,968
Evy.

149
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,688
Hi, sweetheart.
- Daddy, what's in the box?

150
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,713
What's in the box?

151
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:00,464
(peaceful music)

152
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,619
- [Darcy] Somebody once said

153
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,603
that nostalgia is the rust of memory.

154
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,233
Now that one I agree with.

155
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,239
See, people's brains
are basically oysters,

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,509
all mucusy and gross,

157
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,629
but there's always a grain
of sand inside trying

158
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,239
to annoy the oyster into making a Pearl,

159
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,259
and not a bogus Pearl either.

160
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,779
One with some value.

161
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,843
One with some weight.

162
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,459
The kind you cast before swine.

163
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,460
- Come on, Paxil.

164
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,543
Of course, there is such
a thing as a false Pearl.

165
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,789
The ten of lords.

166
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,969
- You know, it looks like
the bartender vivisection.

167
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,233
- Oh.
- What?

168
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,124
- Good morning, boss.

169
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,099
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning, boss.

170
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,693
The help from slacker hell.

171
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,100
That's me with the Marlboro.

172
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,179
- Remind me to nominate
you employee of the month.

173
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,679
Remind you?

174
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,249
Isn't that, what's his job?

175
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,839
- Post-it.
- Prozac.

176
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
- Paxil.

177
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,429
- [Darcy] Then again, if this
guy was your only customer,

178
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,249
how hard would you work?

179
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,313
- Welcome to Sweets Muffin Shop.

180
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,970
Do you like to hear a
list of our muffins today?

181
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,729
- What's your problem?

182
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,053
- Leila wants us to be
nice to the customers.

183
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,099
- All right, Dottie,

184
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,633
let me hear a list of your muffins today.

185
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:48,653
- We have cranberry.

186
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,210
- I'll have one of those.
- Okay.

187
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,239
What happened to your arm?

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Did you get shot?

189
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,774
- It's a nicotine patch.

190
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:05,093
- Ah, like you don't
get enough from smoking.

191
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,409
- Hey, Leila.

192
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,729
Hello?

193
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,499
See you tomorrow,
Dottie, will you lock up?

194
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,019
- Sure, you wanna come
out with this tonight?

195
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,223
We're gonna get tattoos.

196
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,003
- I already have plans.

197
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,493
- All I said was hey.

198
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
It's like I'm invisible.

199
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,569
- Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

200
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,869
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

201
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,906
All mimsy were the borogoves,

202
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,703
and the mome raths outgrabe.

203
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,256
I remember that one.

204
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,756
- And the faintest idea what it means.

205
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:46,402
- I have a picture of
Evy and me here as kids.

206
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,973
- Yes, I know, dear, I
took it, you were six.

207
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,359
- Mammy, are you sorry
that you never had children

208
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,193
of your own,

209
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,899
- But I do, I have two
beautiful daughters.

210
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,122
- You know what I mean.

211
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,129
- I don't think children
were ever an option for me,

212
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,653
or for your uncle.

213
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,238
What's on your mind, sweetie?

214
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,849
- I want to have a baby.

215
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,362
- Immaculately?

216
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:11,446
- Virginally.

217
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,903
- Oh dear. (chuckles)

218
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,509
- [Evy] This is not a
pretty mental picture.

219
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,559
- [Leila] Gee, thanks.

220
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,189
- No, seriously, I can't
even get your clothes off.

221
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,329
- Evy?

222
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,899
- Leila, I'm sorry.

223
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,019
It's just that for 10 years

224
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,879
you have been locked
up tighter than a nun,

225
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,659
and now all of a sudden
you want the Kamasutra.

226
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,610
- Just the part that gets you pregnant.

227
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,519
- Okay.

228
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,449
- Well, you know there are working parts.

229
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,883
- The penis.

230
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,231
- Good.

231
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,815
(bouncy music)

232
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,710
- Make sure you lose the panties.

233
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,859
(Leila sighs)

234
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,069
What?

235
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
- Nothing.

236
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,689
- You're not wearing panties?

237
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,523
- No, I'm wearing underwear.

238
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,109
You don't see men running around in-

239
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,110
- Panties?

240
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,573
Maybe in a perfect world.

241
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
- Fine.

242
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,299
- Job.

243
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
- Excuse me?

244
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,159
- Occupation.

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,523
- I run a muffin shop.

246
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
- Gee, that's what I do.

247
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,409
- Shouldn't I be getting undressed now.

248
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,869
- Oh sure.

249
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,487
- The doctor will be beating
the door down any minute now.

250
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,423
(door opens)

251
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,837
(door closes)

252
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,838
(suspenseful music)

253
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:31,952
(door closes)

254
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,619
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

255
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,713
I'm Dr. Kirk.

256
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,373
- As in Beverly.

257
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,483
- Yes, my mother claims it's British.

258
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,349
This really is quite the
horrifying coincidence.

259
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,749
I could refer you to a colleague.

260
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,599
- No, thank you.

261
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,800
That won't be necessary.

262
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Horrifying.

263
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,059
- Not of course what I meant at all.

264
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,603
Embarrassing is what I meant.

265
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,653
I mean, for me, that is.

266
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,070
Do you know that's on backwards?

267
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,579
- I thought it was supposed to be.

268
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,179
- Ah, not here.

269
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,279
- Oh, well I could turn it around if-

270
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
- No, we'll manage.

271
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,147
So you'd like to start a family.

272
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:30,148
Now that's lovely.

273
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,969
I noticed you answered
the sex question, no.

274
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,970
- Yes.

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
- I see.

276
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,603
How long have you and your
partner been trying to conceive?

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,333
- I don't have a donor as of yet.

278
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,973
- Artificial insemination?

279
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,890
- No, thank you.

280
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:54,577
- Right?

281
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:55,411
I tell you what?

282
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,349
Let's start with a routine exam.

283
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,109
And when you leave, I'll
recommend an ovulation kit.

284
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,910
The instructions are on the package.

285
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,993
- Oh, sorry.

286
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
I was bored.

287
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,993
It can be erased.

288
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,929
- You wrote this?

289
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,063
It's a-
- Ben Casey.

290
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,005
- Yeah.

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,659
But I can't remember the one for birth.

292
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
- Doctor.

293
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,762
Doctor?

294
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,413
- Oh, yes, off course, I'm sorry.

295
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,053
Right, right.

296
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:40,293
(suspenseful music)

297
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,517
- Having trouble finding the.

298
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,189
- Your ears are on your neck.

299
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
- Quite right.

300
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,946
Would you be more comfortable
if the nurse were present?

301
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,440
- No, no, thank you.

302
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,761
(suspenseful music)

303
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,333
(bells tolling)

304
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,711
- Wait, did you lock it?

305
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:21,712
- Yeah, I locked it.

306
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,549
(door opens)
- You didn't lock it.

307
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,219
- But Leila gave me the wrong key.

308
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,537
- She didn't give you the wrong key.

309
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,309
- No, no, no. (indistinct)

310
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,294
- Is the customer in there?
- I don't wanna know.

311
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:37,139
- You were just in there.
(Dottie mumbles)

312
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,723
(bouncy music)

313
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,666
- Well, I understand that,

314
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,269
but I'm not the person
who rents out clowns.

315
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,809
- [Lady] But he's only
five years old right now.

316
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,680
I really need this to be special.

317
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,889
- I'm sure you want his
birthday party to be special.

318
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,890
Who wouldn't?

319
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,359
Hello?

320
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,269
I'm not the person who rents out clown.

321
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,989
You mistakenly called my number

322
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,699
when you were trying
to reach Clowns to Go.

323
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,939
Their number is the same as mine,

324
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,619
but in the 718 area code.

325
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,269
Hello, Mrs. Barrows.

326
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,046
Hello, hi, my name's Leila.

327
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,549
I'm not the person who rents out clowns.

328
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,829
You mistakenly called my number

329
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,099
when you were trying
to reach Clowns to Go.

330
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,079
See their number is the same as mine,

331
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,649
but in the 718 area code.

332
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,983
I get a lot of calls from
people looking for clowns, and.

333
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,019
- [Darcy] You know those
people who say get a life.

334
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,359
- Sure, I'll hold.

335
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,350
- [Darcy] Well, if you're single,

336
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,623
sexually challenged babe in the big city,

337
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,813
this is a life.

338
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,722
That is until an actual one shows up.

339
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:46,723
(suspenseful music)

340
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,049
- [Leila] I saw Evy yesterday.

341
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,599
- And how is your sister?

342
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,389
- Good, she's working
on another fish story

343
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,390
for the magazine.

344
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,689
- One uses the Ivy league education

345
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,909
I paid for her to write about food.

346
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,249
The other to serve it.
- Here we are.

347
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,049
- I think she's getting cold feet.

348
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,479
- Well, it's perfectly normal.

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,313
Well, that reminds me.

350
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,669
I have to take some
measurements for your dress.

351
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,808
- Oh, not today, Mammy, please.

352
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,529
- Now come on.

353
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,089
- I understand you've got a new doctor.

354
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,159
Are there any secrets in this family?

355
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,759
- How did you find him?

356
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,750
Handsome?

357
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,009
- Competent.
- Bull feathers,

358
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,399
he's a hunk.

359
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,959
- How would you know?

360
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,573
- Evy emailed his file.

361
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:49,668
- Oh God.

362
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,210
- If you can't give it up
for a cute single doctor.

363
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,443
I'll shoot your dog.

364
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,989
- He's not trying to pressure you, dear.

365
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,990
- Yes, I am.

366
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,773
- That place sucks.

367
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,093
When I say push,

368
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:03,449
you have to push hard,

369
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,499
and don't forget if there's
a little blood, okay?

370
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,209
- Will it hurt?
- For a little while.

371
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,009
Just make sure it goes all the way through

372
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,499
and catch the needle with the cork.

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,629
- [Dottie] Okay.

374
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,069
- Got any cream?

375
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,283
- Check the fridge.
- We're out.

376
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,750
Okay, ready?

377
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:19,584
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:24,510
- All right, one, two, three, go, ouch!

379
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,009
Oh, okay, good. Good, good, good.

380
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,843
Good.

381
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:32,139
Just let it stay until it ticks.

382
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,689
- Tell me if you think
I've got this right.

383
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,239
Attractive, intelligent
self-employed woman,

384
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,779
not 30, virgin, seeks potent,
genetically sound man.

385
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,259
25 to 44, short-term sex.

386
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,693
No romantics or commitment
secrets, please.

387
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,419
- She's hot.

388
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,170
(men chattering)

389
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,479
- So you mentioned in your questionnaire

390
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,379
that you have four kids.

391
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,800
Can I ask if you're
still in touch with them?

392
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,203
Well, as much as the next guy I suppose.

393
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,249
Well, you know, teenagers
have a mind of their own.

394
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,600
- So your wife has custody.

395
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,793
- You know custody, divorce.

396
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,063
You are divorced.

397
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,540
- Actually, where I come from,
I'm known as being large.

398
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,929
And do you want to see?

399
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,329
- No.
- No.

400
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,579
- Okay.

401
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,829
- I'll put the dog in
a pound for your baby.

402
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,017
I'll get you barking like a Coonhound.

403
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,966
- I'm just really horny.

404
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:51,800
(man barks)

405
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,923
- I don't shoot blanks full maple jacket.

406
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,053
- I once had an erection
for 19 and a half hours.

407
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,369
- You sure you don't want
to take a little peak?

408
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,793
- Also the idea of not paying
for sex is a new idea to me.

409
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,662
- You know, I almost didn't come over.

410
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,709
The whole thing just seems so,

411
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,810
I don't know clinical.

412
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,379
Then I realized the sacrifice
you were making for this baby.

413
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,443
I thought, well, maybe I could help.

414
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,163
Maybe I was chosen to help.

415
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,869
That the virgin of the Plains was risen,

416
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,949
and that I the foul spawn of indifference

417
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,793
had found a purchase on the honeyed trail.

418
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,552
(upbeat music)

419
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:51,523
(door buzzes)

420
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,829
- I'm sorry, no more men.

421
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,830
- [Eddie] What?

422
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,869
- No interviews.

423
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,220
- [Eddie] I don't want one.

424
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
- Who are you?

425
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,048
What are you supposed to be?

426
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:09,882
- What do you mean what?

427
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm Slappy the clown

428
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,063
Nothing rings a bell?

429
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,392
What kind of childhood did you have

430
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,029
that you don't know Slappy the clown

431
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,909
when he comes to your own front door?

432
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,289
- I heard of him,

433
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,369
I just thought he was cuter.

434
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,470
- I brought you these.

435
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,740
- Don't you frighten the children.

436
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,789
I just want to thank you for
referring all those calls

437
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,853
to Clowns to Go.

438
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,239
Hey you, tickles.

439
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,729
Fuck off!

440
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,179
- It's Slappy, okay.

441
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,283
And eat me, pal.

442
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,363
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.

443
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,430
Here.

444
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,530
- Bye.

445
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,863
(jolly music)

446
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,127
(window closes)

447
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,486
(suspenseful music)

448
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:28,269
- Oh, stay back, lady.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,479
Look, I'm sorry.

450
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,581
I just don't want any menus.

451
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:35,003
- Did I ask you if you
wanted any menus, lady?

452
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:37,219
I didn't ask you if you wanted any menus.

453
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,859
I don't care if you want menus.

454
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,747
- Well, I don't.

455
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:42,029
- Good, because I don't want to crawl

456
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,013
around like a reptile
passing the damn things out.

457
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:46,264
- Oh, poor you.

458
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,569
- Right, poor me.

459
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,149
If I don't hand these out, I don't eat.

460
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,089
- Well, if you'd bothered to read my sign,

461
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,069
none of this would've happened.

462
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,940
- I read your sign,

463
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,823
I ignored it and that's how I make money.

464
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,859
- And anyhow, aren't you a bit attractive

465
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,979
to be doling out menus for a living.

466
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,689
- What is that supposed to mean?

467
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,958
- Nothing, except you
could be like a supermodel.

468
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,873
- Then I definitely couldn't eat.

469
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:17,874
- Fine.

470
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,679
So what do you wanna be?

471
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,149
- According to my MFA, I am a poet.

472
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,259
- Really, I love poetry.

473
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Say one.

474
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,029
- Oh, what am I, a jukebox?

475
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,873
- Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

476
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,009
- We could go get coffee and muffins.

477
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,183
- Do you think I need a date?

478
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:43,184
(suspenseful music)

479
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,499
- Me, I'd have this guy in a bondage chair

480
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,459
with a rubber ball in his mouth,

481
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,463
but Leila's going the stale
coffee burnt pastry route.

482
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,700
We should probably have a talk.

483
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,579
Let me guess a donut.

484
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,693
- That's not mine.

485
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,149
- What are you looking at?

486
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,759
- Him.

487
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,289
- He's a friend.

488
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,329
- Okay, how'd you find a friend?

489
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,089
- On the street.

490
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,119
He's a starving artist.

491
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,683
- That explains the donut.

492
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,239
- It's not a donut and I
have to take it somewhere.

493
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,159
- So when he gets up, give
him whatever he wants.

494
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,090
- Don't worry.

495
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,889
- And then, you know, show him the ropes.

496
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,659
- We don't have ropes around here, Leila,

497
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,639
if we did, we'd hang ourselves.

498
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,609
- So what's he gonna do?

499
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,363
- What you do.

500
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:57,793
Do you think he can handle it?

501
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,270
- We're supposed to tell you

502
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,039
what to do around here.

503
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,619
- As you can see business, isn't an issue,

504
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,963
but there is something that
desperately needs doing.

505
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
- Which is?

506
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,709
- The boss.

507
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,569
- You have to tell her about
the birds and the bees.

508
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,629
- They fly.

509
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,219
- No, no, no, no, no.

510
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,933
You have to tell her how to get boned.

511
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,883
- Consider it done.

512
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
- You did her.

513
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,263
She has been crewed.
- Right here?

514
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,099
- Right here.

515
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,220
Six hours of good, hard, honest talking.

516
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,339
- Is that a slam?

517
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,589
- She was a bit confused about the penis.

518
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,809
- Who isn't?

519
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,939
- Straight up, you guys
make the worst muffins

520
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,319
I've ever tasted.

521
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,770
- The customer likes them.

522
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,546
- What?

523
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:12,547
(suspenseful music)

524
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:57,552
(Leila screams)

525
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,369
- I don't have an appointment.

526
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,493
- No please, come in.

527
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,855
- I'm sorry about Timmy.

528
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:15,749
He's mad at his mother for being pregnant.

529
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,680
- Me too.

530
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:17,880
- Let me get your towel.

531
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,682
- Here.
- Thank you.

532
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:28,979
Here, it's birth.
- Oh, you found it.

533
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,399
- It's kinda messy.

534
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,723
- Ah, well, usually is.

535
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,336
Huh!

536
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,350
Here, sit, sit.

537
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,933
Circles, I don't remember circles.

538
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,669
So I have your test results back,

539
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,149
and everything looks normal.

540
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,150
- I'm normal.

541
00:28:58,151 --> 00:28:59,508
- Well, not normal,

542
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,549
I thought that sounds like average

543
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,489
which of course I don't mean.

544
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,489
You're certainly way, way above average,

545
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,183
like I don't a spectacular.

546
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,719
The point being,

547
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,319
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be able

548
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
to have a child.

549
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,970
If you want to.

550
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:21,079
Would you like a grapefruit juice?

551
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,159
- Also?

552
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,319
- Also yes, you mentioned that-

553
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,449
- You read my chart then?

554
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,359
- I'm nearly through it.

555
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,189
You have wonderful penmanship.

556
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,429
- I suppose I was a little thorough.

557
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,919
- No, no, I learned you
have very good teeth.

558
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,769
Not that, that matters to me of course.

559
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,129
And that you had a fine education,

560
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,130
which you use to become a
waitress in a donut shop.

561
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,039
- Proprietor, muffins.

562
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,509
- That your height and weight are perfect.

563
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,483
- Not to mention your
skin, of course, your eyes.

564
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,490
Would you go out with me?

565
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,129
- I really can't.

566
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,037
- Of course not, I'm sorry.

567
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,249
- Not that I'm against it

568
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,779
just that it leads to, you know?

569
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
- Intercourse?

570
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,623
- You got pretty far in my chart.

571
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,929
- I was actually referring
to love and marriage.

572
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,529
Those two, I don't do.

573
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,659
The other thing,

574
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,533
well, I just haven't done yet.

575
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,373
That's why I'm here.

576
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,699
- That's not birth.

577
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,533
- What?
- What?

578
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:33,229
- Birth's not a donut.

579
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,099
It's an upside down triangle.

580
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,419
- Your source?
- The web.

581
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
Yours?

582
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,210
- A poet.

583
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,939
- I think we got a loser.

584
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
- Thank you, Jean.

585
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,183
- Well, I should go.

586
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,663
Timmy's probably at
there squirting things.

587
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,230
I just wanted to give
birth to you, the sign.

588
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,177
- Oh, yeah.

589
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:07,461
- Yeah.

590
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:08,677
(bouncy music)

591
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:09,678
Okay.

592
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,504
(door opens)

593
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,391
(door closes)

594
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:18,975
(bouncy music)

595
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:34,389
- Hey, hey, hey!

596
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,109
Timmy, this is not a toy, okay?

597
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,943
You understand?

598
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:41,520
You could seriously hurt
somebody with one of these.

599
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:44,933
(sighs) Ms. Peters here?

600
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,118
(bouncy piano music)

601
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,270
- Where did he get food?

602
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,049
Who's he?

603
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,189
- A stray, Leila adopted him.

604
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,193
- Hey, who are you?

605
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,463
- Strictly need to know basis.

606
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,503
- Where is Leila?

607
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:23,769
She's not upstairs.

608
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,219
- Sorry.

609
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,319
- Tight chip as usual, girls,

610
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,489
This place is like the
Microsoft of muffins shops.

611
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,490
- Thanks.

612
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:33,862
- Thanks too.

613
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,253
- You're skin and bones.

614
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,459
I'm gonna make you a tin roof.

615
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,199
It's your uncle's favorite?

616
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,563
Every bite could kill him.

617
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,293
- Mammy, are you kinda
like a woman, right?

618
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,360
- It's a good thing I love you, dear.

619
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,460
- You know what I mean?

620
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:01,339
You're softer than uncle.

621
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,390
- Thank you, sweetie.

622
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,100
- Do you still have sex with him?

623
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,683
- You do know that normal
people don't talk like this.

624
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,729
- But when you do does a
big bell go off or something

625
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,729
because I've interviewed some men,

626
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,563
and I don't think I have a bell, Mammy.

627
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,580
- It's just in a different key, dear.

628
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:28,263
You have to wait for the right song.

629
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,231

Mammy shooting winnings

Oh, I left you some goodies today.

Have you picked a guy yet?

668
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,510
Call me.

669
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:36,729
(machine beeps)

670
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,099
- [Man] Hi, my son is having
a birthday party on the 17.

671
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,142
- Hello?
- I was wondering

672
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:41,969
if you had someone who
makes balloon animals,

673
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,029
especially a pig.

674
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,329
Please let me know my number is.

675
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,330
- [Man] Hello?

676
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,533
Hello, are you there?

677
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,410
Hi.

678
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:54,732
- Who are you?
- It's me Slappy.

679
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,939
- (laughs) You're not Slappy.

680
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,639
He's got blue hair.

681
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,069
- All right, so I'm the gingerbread man.

682
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,499
Do you think I could come upstairs,

683
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,619
and change my clothes, please?

684
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,039
- Why?

685
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,629
- Because I'm a cookie.

686
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,590
- Hey you.

687
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:10,399
Yeah, you ginger snack.

688
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
- What?

689
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:12,283
- Fuck off.

690
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,230
- Do you have a business card?

691
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,453
Eddy, head clown.

692
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:28,249
(Paxil barks)

693
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,889
- Paxil, head dog.

694
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,890
I'm Leila.

695
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,859
Do you think I could use your-
- Oh yeah, sure,

696
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,399
it's right back there.

697
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
- Thanks, excuse me.

698
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,322
What are you having?

699
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,009
- Oh, (chuckles) I change my mind.

700
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,280
Would you like anything at all

701
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,923
along the lines of milk?

702
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,063
- Do you have anything
along the lines of tequila?

703
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,709
I've had a long day.

704
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,049
- There's a bottle up there, scotch,

705
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,879
but it's 10 years old.

706
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,949
And the label on it warns
you that it was 12 years

707
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,950
to begin with.

708
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,529
- Looks like you can use some too.

709
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,409
- Me?

710
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,289
(chuckles) No I haven't had any,

711
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,423
since I was 18.

712
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,999
Alcohol.

713
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,833
I got dumped.

714
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:02,649
I got depressed and I drank
a whole bottle of Blue Nun.

715
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,289
- Ooh!
- Mm-hmm.

716
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,990
- What kind of pecker head
would dump a babe like you?

717
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,530
- I bet you say that to all the girls.

718
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:16,244
(peaceful guitar music)

719
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,273
- What's with the guard dog?

720
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,939
- Ah, it wasn't as pretty as the Collie,

721
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,003
so they dumped him.

722
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,932
- Who dumped him?

723
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,723
- Some rich indifferent owners.

724
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,263
Some people shouldn't have dogs.

725
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,899
And those who truly deserved them,

726
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,900
can't have him.

727
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
- Like who?

728
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,729
- Orphans?

729
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,363
Orphans do not have beautiful
dogs with little red collars.

730
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,439
- And what about Annie?

731
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,490
- She's an exception.

732
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
She's a cartoon.

733
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,057
- So what are you having?

734
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,943
(sighs) What's good?

735
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,394
- Drink up!

736
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,260
Drink, drink, drink.

737
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,345
- Okay, thanks.

738
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,560
- In Okay...

739
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,490
Nepal.

740
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,474
- Lesotho.

741
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:28,558
- Oh, la, la.

742
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,196
Oh!

743
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,583
- There aren't any else.
- There's one.

744
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,443
- Okinawa.
- That's not a country.

745
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,419
Ah, that's another drink right there.

746
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,367
- No fair, you've played this before.

747
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,373
- All right, more ice.

748
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,079
I fed myself.

749
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
- Good for you.

750
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,590
- Have a girl.

751
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,369
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

752
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,253
Okay, don't pressure me.

753
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,960
- Wait, you're married.

754
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:16,675
- No.

755
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
- Gay?

756
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
- No.

757
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,890
- Well, help me out here, Leila.

758
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,543
- That's my sex life.

759
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:40,443
I'm like a total virgin.

760
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,323
Will you show me how.

761
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,699
- Well your lips were a
little, a little bit slack.

762
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,257
You might want to, ah.

763
00:41:58,367 --> 00:41:59,367
Just.

764
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:01,829
- No, show me.

765
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,956
(jazz music)

766
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:21,499
You'll do.

767
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,140

(Paxil barks)

783
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,167
Oh, I never would have gotten that.

784
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,119
- So you didn't actually have sex then?

785
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,349
- [Leila] No, not
according to the evidence.

786
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,350
- Well good.

787
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,899
Well, I mean, most people like

788
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,399
to at least remember their first time

789
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,039
so they can pretend years
later they enjoyed it.

790
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,849
- Look, I want tips, hard tips.

791
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,993
Hard as bullets.

792
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,929
I want it to be scary.

793
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,769
- Tips?
- Positions.

794
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,115
Good ones.

795
00:43:58,116 --> 00:43:59,229
- I have to answer you.

796
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,799
- You're my doctor.

797
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
- Yes.

798
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,142
Well, there's a school
of thought which believes

799
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:10,199
that the conception may
be more likely to occur

800
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,423
if one were to,

801
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,210
well, if you were to get up on one zone

802
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,820
or for us helping to maintaining
a sperm near the cervix.

803
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,229
- Sperm near the cervix.

804
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,653
- Then after you might
want to roll over on ones.

805
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:37,351
- Back?
- Good.

806
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:38,185
And so that your lungs,

807
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:40,949
your are up in the air.
- My legs.

808
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,950
- That will be fine.

809
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,403
- And?
- Gravity takes over.

810
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,799
- Gee, it doesn't sound like much fun.

811
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,513
- Speaking to yourself. (chuckles)

812
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,527
- Bad night, dear?

813
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:04,999
- I think I got drunk and kissed a clown,

814
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,353
- But that's wonderful.

815
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,509
- I went to the doctor.

816
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,083
- You don't need a doctor.

817
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,019
- It got worse at the doctors.

818
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,029
- It's about love, isn't it?

819
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,259
That sickly blue sheen under your skin,

820
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,029
and a fed of the heart
can be wretchedly blue.

821
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,879
People have perished.

822
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,629
- It's alcohol, not love.

823
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,463
- There's nothing wrong,

824
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,289
a little champagne in moderation,

825
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,949
and on the right occasion.

826
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,609
- What about a tidal wave of scotch?

827
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,509
- Washes away the inhibition.

828
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,719
Very instrumental in the
bedding of your uncle,

829
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,493
and look how that turned out.

830
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,063
Oh, Lord your uncle, the fitting.

831
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,909
- What's the fitting?

832
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,499
- Your baby sisters big day,

833
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,019
the maid of honor.

834
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,923
I left Ernest 10 in love car.

835
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,419
Today's the final fitting.

836
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,829
- When was the first?

837
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,269
- Well, honey, you're not the bride.

838
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,649
Well of course you, you will be one again.

839
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,423
Oh, where's everybody's coat?

840
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,273
- Just bring me a dress.

841
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:08,253
I don't even care if it fits.
- Come on.

842
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,313
Yumi Katsura waits for no one.

843
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,703
She outfitted the Nutcracker.

844
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,539
- I don't see how one person can forget

845
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,969
about another person when that
person is sitting downstairs

846
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,679
in a car for an hour.

847
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,429
- 20 Minutes, max.
- 40 bucks minimum.

848
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,430
- Where's Evy?

849
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,990
- You tell her.

850
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:36,890
- She's not in the mood.

851
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:38,667
- It's her wedding.

852
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,063
I'm not in the mood.

853
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,759
- The important thing is the only thing is

854
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,329
there is going to be a wedding.

855
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,292
- What about the dress?

856
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:47,771
- Tell her.

857
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,179
- You tell her.

858
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,180
- Tell me what.

859
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,679
No, absolutely not.

860
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,899
I do not wear gowns.

861
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,733
- You can and you will.

862
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,089
- Oh no!

863
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,519
- Don't worry, we'll
get it out in a jiffy,

864
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,259
and you're practically
the same size as Evy,

865
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,439
except for the rise,

866
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,934
and there is no rise.

867
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:13,119
And of course, it didn't like that is.

868
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,399
How do you do?

869
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,719
- Is this the joyful bride?

870
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,959
- No.

871
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,899
- Do I detect a future dress.

872
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,639
- You detect a bottle of scotch.

873
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,299
Where's the dumb dress?

874
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,539
- Please, excuse my extra niece.

875
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,388
She poo-poos love and marriage.

876
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:31,093
- Ah, the single sister of the bride.

877
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,520
Poor child.

878
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,549
- Well, this poor child will
also need something in white.

879
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,829
As we mentioned, we're
planning an all white wedding.

880
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,919
This one actually is a virgin.

881
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,584
The bride of course is not.

882
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:44,949
- (laughs) Ernest!

883
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,199
- Don't worry.

884
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,409
When a young woman puts
on a wedding dress,

885
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,830
even someone else's she's
positively transformed.

No, I'm not.

898
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:14,997
Yes, you are.

899
00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:16,363
No, I'm not.

900
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:17,714
Yes, you are.

901
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:18,798
No, I'm not.

902
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:24,744
Spartacus?

903
00:49:25,623 --> 00:49:26,683
- It's me Eddie.

904
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,396
- Wow, you look like Spartacus.

905
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:32,663
But then you look like a lot of people.

906
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,940
- Why are you crying?

907
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:39,416
- (sniffles) 'Cause I barfed
on my sister's wedding dress.

908
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:44,969
- You can tell me.
- I just did.

909
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,970
- Come on Leila.

910
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,963
You're trying to get me
to say that I'm crying,

911
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,003
or that I'm really crying
because I once as a kid,

912
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,253
and I once had parents,

913
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,793
and I once had secret hopes and dreams,

914
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,630
but I'm afraid that that's not it.

915
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,483
It's that I threw up on my sister's dress.

916
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,679
Well, my uncles will have it cleaned,

917
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,929
but still my sister,

918
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,109
my little baby sister has to get married

919
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,693
in dress that I barfed on.

920
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,330
Once you barf on it, they make you buy it.

921
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,363
- Bastards.

922
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:27,762
(upbeat music)

923
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:31,343
- One look, I'm talking about, one,

924
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,399
and suddenly I'm in this vortex

925
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,400
of some giant sucking
unfathomably forceful force.

926
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,049
- We're still talking
about the Virgin, right?

927
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,439
- It's more like a great
big thundering speed ball

928
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,533
of a rushing toady flood.

929
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,889
You know the feeling?

930
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:01,890
- Lust?

931
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
- Dread.

932
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,713
- The kind of dread the
perfect women inspire.

933
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,950
- I'm married.

934
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:14,089
- I should write five TV
show words on my blackboard,

935
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:14,923
and I run with it.

936
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:16,319
Boy, do I run with it?

937
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
- Let it out.

938
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:23,779
I don't completely remember last night.

939
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,780
- You were toast.

940
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,779
- Still I should thank you
for being such a gentleman.

941
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,709
- Well, you were tat on
conscious at the time

942
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,010
they have laws about that.

943
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,003
- Gee, you're like the perfect clown.

944
00:51:36,506 --> 00:51:38,053
- Well, I'm not a clown now.

945
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:41,919
- No, you're a vulcanized gladiator.

946
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
I saw the movie.

947
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,143
- Touch my chest.

948
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:49,459
- Oh, it's so cold and synthetic.

949
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,410
- But inside beats the heart of a lion.

950
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,763
- Nobel Roman.

951
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:57,433
- My sword is that your service.

952
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,293
- Would you be so shamelessly used.

953
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,663
- I'm Spartacus.

954
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,530
- You really do deserve to wear the skirt.

955
00:52:10,157 --> 00:52:13,158
(Leila laughs)

956
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,159
- Hands!

957
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:17,948
All right, here we go.

958
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:20,845
That's it.

959
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,513
- Good play, Donald!

960
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,783
Okay, what happened next?

961
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:25,829
Tell me the full details.

962
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,600
- So then he took off his helmet

963
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:29,815
- And?

964
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:34,059
- And he kissed me a lot, all over.

965
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,253
- And you were awake?

966
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
- That's so great.

967
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,840
Breast plate on or off?

968
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:42,692
- On
- Oh my God,

969
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,656
it's just like high school.

970
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:46,657
Did you touch it?

971
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,269
- I laughed at it.

972
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,799
- No, Leila, no!

973
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,879
- Well, he took it out,

974
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,143
I laughed and he left, that's all.

975
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,157
- That's all?

976
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,375
- I think that's probably enough.

977
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:05,376
(both laughing)
(men chattering)

978
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:07,799
- I love you, baby.

979
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,300
Yeah, come on now!

980
00:53:10,669 --> 00:53:12,563
- He's quite graceful.

981
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:15,351
He's rich.

982
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:18,313
And He's gorgeous.

983
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,190
He's perfect in bed.

984
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:27,271
Oh God.

985
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:31,465
(bouncy violin music)

986
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,159
- Hey, boss.

987
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,429
I haven't seen you in a while.

988
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,559
- Who are these people?

989
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,111
- Customers.

990
00:53:58,112 --> 00:53:59,493
- When do we get customer?

991
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,053
- Here's the deal Harvard,

992
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,779
from now on the menus is
whatever I decided to cook.

993
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,363
I said the price is according to words by.

994
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,259
Lawyers can no longer refer to eat here.

995
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,446
- Hey, I'm a lawyer.

996
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:17,340
Who is this guy?

997
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,309
- He hates that question.

998
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,310
How would you know?

999
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,339
- I get no salary,

1000
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,699
but 10% of the gross.

1001
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,979
We've closed on Wednesdays,

1002
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,889
because I don't like Wednesdays.

1003
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,419
And we are closed on Sundays,

1004
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,149
because I do like Sundays.

1005
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,793
But it's possible that I
will leave at any time.

1006
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,932
Do we have an understanding?

1007
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:42,959
- Are you wanted or something?

1008
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,459
- Good one, Donald.

1009
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,613
- Say yes, boss.

1010
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,059
- Can you get her here by 6:00 AM,

1011
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,039
nose ring set and shined.

1012
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,713
- Doubtful, very, very doubtful.

1013
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,469
So who is hungry?

1014
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,313
- I could eat.
- What about you?

1015
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,053
I don't know how to price your meal.

1016
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
- Leila.

1017
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,580
- Eddie.

1018
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,900
- Listen, I don't know what
got into me last night.

1019
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,573
I'm not used to being laughed at.

1020
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,823
- Some clown.
- Last night?

1021
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,139
It's a long story.

1022
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,939
- So this is Slappy.

1023
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,069
- All the good names were taken.

1024
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,660
Could we take this?

1025
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,239
- Listen Leila, I'm beginning to feel

1026
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,923
a little bit objectified here.

1027
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:37,603
- Well, Defender.

1028
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,739
- Oh, good children.

1029
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,240
- Are you really the Defender?

1030
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,799
- Sure why not?

1031
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,519
- Then you gotta help her.

1032
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,520
She's sick.

1033
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,729
- How is she?

1034
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,749
- Mainly Hypothermic it may kill a week.

1035
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,289
She'll be fine.

1036
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:00,249
- They always feel better
when they throw up on me.

1037
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,569
- Who you were again?

1038
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,299
- Eddie.
- Head clown.

1039
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,300
- Oh.

1040
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,759
So someone must be worried about you, huh?

1041
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,196
What's your name?

1042
00:56:11,197 --> 00:56:13,589
- I'm Jack, she's Red.

1043
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,763
Nobody's worried.

1044
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,319
- Okay, Red, that's a pretty name.

1045
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,506
Do you remember your address, hmm?

1046
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,319
- She zipped her lips.
- Really?

1047
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,379
You know, I once did that too.

1048
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,230
I once zipped mine for about a month.

1049
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,869
So where is the secret key?

1050
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,429
- It's a zipper,

1051
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,430
not a lock.

1052
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:32,593
- Huh, well.

1053
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,013
Okay, then what about you?

1054
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:38,049
What's your address?

1055
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,739
- Same as her is.

1056
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,339
We're twins.
- Huh?

1057
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,340
- Well, on that note, doc, Leila, kids,

1058
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,490
I'm off to write some wrongs.

1059
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,313
Is he your boyfriend?

1060
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:58,639
- I don't have boyfriends, Jack.

1061
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,459
- He's not really a superhero, you know?

1062
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,660
- Not by a long stretch.

1063
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,190
Here you go, sweetie, you want that?

1064
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
My dog?

1065
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,869
I was gonna mention him.

1066
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,669
- Hey, that's her dog.

1067
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,359
- Okay, will you take good care of him?

1068
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,399
Hmm?

1069
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,650
He's zipped his lips too.

1070
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,243
- Jack, Red, you're staying
with me tonight, okay?

1071
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,710
- You got cable?

1072
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,415
- I'm just gonna go tuck her in, okay?

1073
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,416
- Okay.

1074
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,860
- Your room is right there.

1075
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:47,224
Yeah.

1076
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,753
I'm just gonna wait here for a second.

1077
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,767
- Okay.

1078
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:06,463
- You know, make sure everything's cool.

1079
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:08,874
- I understand.

1080
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:12,739
- 'Cause you never know
what's gonna happen.

1081
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,197
- That's true.

1082
00:58:14,198 --> 00:58:15,498
- I'm not even that tired.

1083
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,329
- You're a brave guy, Jack,

1084
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,030
you took good care of your sister.

1085
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,093
Can I shake your hand?

1086
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,590
All right, you know, I was thinking that

1087
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:35,019
what if Red wakes up and you're not there?

1088
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,073
She might get scared.

1089
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,980
I know you'd rather have your own room,

1090
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:42,863
but you think for tonight and
my stay with her, protect her.

1091
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:46,093
Yeah?

1092
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:47,094
- Yeah.

1093
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:54,514
(peaceful piano music)

1094
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,509
- I may not be perfect at this,

1095
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,689
but I won't be mean,

1096
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:10,690
so please don't get anything
bad, or fatal, or indictable

1097
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,989
while you're here, or not here.

1098
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:19,203
Actually don't get
anything anywhere, okay?

1099
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,890
Amen.

1100
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,523
- Can you look after them, buster?

1101
00:59:28,675 --> 00:59:31,925
(peaceful piano music)

1102
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,146
- Are they asleep?

1103
00:59:39,147 --> 00:59:40,147
- Mm-hmm.

1104
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:44,903
- (chuckles) It's nice,
like a little story.

1105
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:47,576
- Yeah.

1106
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,559
When Evy and I were kids,

1107
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,029
we used to think our
father was an astronaut,

1108
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,980
'cause there was always spacesuits
laying around the house.

1109
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,959
His real job was to make
sure that the visors

1110
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,533
on the helmets didn't steam up.

1111
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,173
- Not everyone's a star.

1112
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,374
(thunder rumbles)

1113
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,709
- What's gonna happen to them?

1114
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,710
- I dunno.

1115
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,709
I'm gonna make some calls.

1116
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,860
- I was thinking that
they could stay here.

1117
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,559
- What about your mission?

1118
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,823
- Well, I can postpone that.

1119
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,629
Still, I think Eddie
is an excellent choice.

1120
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,019
He can name almost every country.

1121
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,553
- On Krypton?
- I'm serious.

1122
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,799
- Okay, seriously then I
would have to say the clown

1123
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,363
in question is not an excellent choice.

1124
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,680
He's less than excellent.

1125
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,413
In fact, actually it's insane.

1126
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,303
It is stupendously, mind-numbingly insane.

1127
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,089
You don't practice on children, Leila.

1128
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,663
You don't pick daddies off a Wheaties box.

1129
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,369
The only thing more idiotic

1130
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,350
than letting that guy touch you

1131
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,023
is letting him father your child.

1132
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,209
And the only thing dumber than
that is you having a child

1133
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,313
in the first place.

1134
01:01:21,466 --> 01:01:23,339
- Is that a medical opinion?

1135
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,389
No, no.

1136
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,390
Do you want one?

1137
01:01:27,837 --> 01:01:28,837
- No.

1138
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:41,169
- You know when I was about four,

1139
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,270
my mom was pregnant with my little sister,

1140
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,273
and she asked me if I
wanted to touch her stomach,

1141
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,719
and I burst out crying.

1142
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,020
'cause I thought that
she'd swallow this baby,

1143
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,280
and she was going to swallow me.

1144
01:02:00,334 --> 01:02:01,334
- So?

1145
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,113
- So she told me that she
loved me more than anything,

1146
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:10,388
that I had nothing to be scared of.

1147
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,819
I mean, the reason I know,

1148
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,570
I mean, I absolutely know

1149
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,579
that you can love somebody again, Leila,

1150
01:02:20,026 --> 01:02:21,976
is that you're so completely afraid to.

1151
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,106
- Why are you doing this to me?

1152
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,050
Please, I can't.

1153
01:02:42,866 --> 01:02:45,697
Look, I told you from the beginning.

1154
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:48,097
- No, I know, you don't do love.

1155
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,765
(chuckles) Wow!

1156
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:55,382
- I'm sorry.

1157
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,450
- Me too.

1158
01:03:01,314 --> 01:03:03,814
(door closes)

1159
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,387

(somber music)

1163
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,169
- Wheel of fortune.

1164
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,779
- This is a very lucky card.

1165
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,353
This means that you'll have a lot of luck.

1166
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,097
- All right steady, little flip.

1167
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:48,386
- I got a pancake.

1168
01:05:01,605 --> 01:05:03,129
(Beverly laughs)

1169
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,130
Hey you.

1170
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,930
You guys ready?

1171
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,010
- It's not done.

1172
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:15,239
(upbeat reggae music)

1173
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:18,671
Okay.

1174
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:20,421

1178
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:40,974
- Eddie, it's Leila.

1179
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,760
I just wanted to thank you
for what you almost did to me.

1180
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,639
Oh, and under the cape very impressive.

1181
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,799
I know I've seen videos.

1182
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,883
Certainly didn't mean to laugh,

1183
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,083
but this just isn't a
good time for me at all,

1184
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,449

- Sorry.

1210
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,179
- Stubborn little monster.

1211
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,623
She won't put on the dress or speak to me.

1212
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,079
- She's not much of a talker.

1213
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,233
- Oh!
- Are you?

1214
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:31,149
Huh?

1215
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,169
Come here you.

1216
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,849
- Do we know any of these people?

1217
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,223
- That's Dr. Beverly.

1218
01:07:41,402 --> 01:07:42,402
- Oh!

1219
01:07:44,971 --> 01:07:46,509
(Mammy knocks)

1220
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,110
- Leila is this the way you felt

1221
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,553
before you almost got married?

1222
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:52,940
- No.

1223
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,973
I felt perfect,

1224
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,733
and I felt beautiful.

1225
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,493
- Well, I fucked up.

1226
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
- Thanks.

1227
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,653
- No, that's good,

1228
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,233
because you were really
happy and the guy bailed,

1229
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,660
and I'm really drunk, (laughs)

1230
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,453
so this is good.

1231
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
This is fine.

1232
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:27,630
- You shave your armpit?

1233
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:30,704
I did.

1234
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:39,263
- Oh my God, you look like an angel.

1235
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:43,890
- Very nice.

1236
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,110
Could we get on with this?

1237
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:01,078
- Red.

1238
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:03,339
You're beautiful.

1239
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:07,858
- So are you?

1240
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,983
- Okay, holding our places
with sunshiny faces.

1241
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:27,043
- Leila, Leila.

1242
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,168
- Oh, now look at you.

1243
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:42,057
- Oh shit, I forgot to write my vows.

1244
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,390
We're supposed to write vows.

1245
01:09:46,374 --> 01:09:47,374
Gosh!

1246
01:10:08,748 --> 01:10:11,223
- (whistles) Little Harvard.

1247
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,393
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1248
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:32,059
- I'm amazed they still
let heterosexuals marry.

1249
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,929
Here's the groom at least here this time.

1250
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:35,930
- He's here.

1251
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,849
- When he'll be divorces
him and remarries.

1252
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:44,339
You do realize we will have
at least one more of these.

1253
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,791
- Your pessimism has no
place at this ceremony.

1254
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:49,292
- Mm.

1255
01:10:49,293 --> 01:10:52,293
(jolly organ music)

1256
01:11:23,038 --> 01:11:28,038
- Would you agree that the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

1257
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,070
- Absolutely, father.

1258
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,679
- Perhaps your bride might like a glimpse

1259
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,067
of your soul just now.

1260
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,329
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God,

1261
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,249
and in the face of this
company to join together

1262
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,693
this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

1263
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,650
You too.

1264
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,280
- Rough night.

1265
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,439
- Before we recite the traditional vows,

1266
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,599
I understand the bride and
groom have taken the time

1267
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,683
to compose something from their hearts.

1268
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,710
- Why do I have to go first?

1269
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,630
- Just read what you've written, son.

1270
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:28,110
I love you deeply

1271
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,990
like the deep snow.

1272
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,950
- Sometimes the hardest to fall for words.

1273
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,913
Any bride's declaration.

1274
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,020
Is she drunk?

1275
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,429
- You, there's a guy with a bee suit here.

1276
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,430
That's a bee.

1277
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,900
- Just forget it.

1278
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:09,890
Let's move on.

1279
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:11,870
Deep snow?

1280
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,379
- Well then if any man
could show just cause

1281
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,339
why these two may not
lawfully be joined together.

1282
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,969
Let him speak now,

1283
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,143
or else here after
forever holds his peace.

1284
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520
Anyone?

1285
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,179
Nope.

1286
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,679
- Excuse me.

1287
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,649
- Will thou Donald to take this woman

1288
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,459
to be thy wedded wife?

1289
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,299
Will thou love her,
comfort her, honor her,

1290
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,989
and keep her in sickness and in health

1291
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:45,540
as long as you both shall live?

1292
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,720
- I do.

1293
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,570
Wilt!

1294
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:55,289
- Will thou Evy take this
man because I wedded husband?

1295
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:58,779
Will thou love him, comfort
him, honor and keep him

1296
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,359
in sickness and in health

1297
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,263
as long as you both shall live?

1298
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:04,594
- Oh boy!

1299
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,793
- Just say I do, dear.

1300
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,923
Or I will.

1301
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,109
- Or something else.

1302
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,319
- Excuse me.

1303
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,863
- Is it too late to
forever not hold my peace?

1304
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,213
I mean to speak now?

1305
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,754
- Who is this woman?

1306
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:31,588
- Sister.

1307
01:14:31,589 --> 01:14:35,659
- Look Donald, I know this is a really

1308
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,159
tricky timing and everything.

1309
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,839
I mean, God, you've got
your whole family here,

1310
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,799
but look, Mike and I didn't
even make it inside the church

1311
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,400
at least Evy walked all the
way up here to tell you.

1312
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,819
- Tell me what?

1313
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,409
- That you're not the one Donald.

1314
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,209
You're certainly a one.

1315
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,699
Probably even the one to a lot of women.

1316
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,350
Evy says you really know
your way around a water bed,

1317
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:05,588
but you're just gonna have to
be somebody else's big one.

1318
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:07,466
- Oh, that makes it unanimous.

1319
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:09,829
- Louis, you're his father.
- What?

1320
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,229
- Anyway, I'm the last person

1321
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,113
who should say anything about love.

1322
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,300
But I know what it looks like.

1323
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,299
You see, it's this thing.

1324
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,593
It's this really,

1325
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:31,523
it's this thing that
gets under your skin and-

1326
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:36,243
- And what in me is dark illumines.

1327
01:15:39,178 --> 01:15:41,579
- Wow, that's great.

1328
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,279
Very medieval, but no,

1329
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,009
I was gonna say it's a hairball.

1330
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:50,099
It's unholy hairball,

1331
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,089
which rots, and festers,
and grows enormous,

1332
01:15:55,090 --> 01:16:00,090
so for like 12 years, you
don't lay a finger on it

1333
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,969
for fear that when it stops choking,

1334
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,833
and itching, and gagging you,

1335
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,473
you won't feel anything at all.

1336
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:13,829
And then one day a light bulb goes on,

1337
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,973
and you see,

1338
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,380
and you know,

1339
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,779
well, but your sister
shouldn't marry the man

1340
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,113
that she intended to.

1341
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,380
That's all.

1342
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,003
- She's right, Donald.

1343
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,139
If you think about it,

1344
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,473
you understand don't you.

1345
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:39,870
- I understand.

1346
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,827
I just don't know where to go.

1347
01:16:42,828 --> 01:16:44,933
- Well, don't go anywhere.

1348
01:16:47,055 --> 01:16:48,149
- We're unmarried, we're not dead,

1349
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,750
we can still get together later.

1350
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,509
- Well then if there are no more

1351
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,919
completely inappropriate surprises,

1352
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,859
perhaps now it would be fine
time to call these proceedings

1353
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,149
to a merciful close.

1354
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,609
- Wait, there's actually
just one more thing.

1355
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:06,660
- Of course there is.

1356
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,280
- When I was 17, I stood
outside of this very church,

1357
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,899
and swore to God that I would never again

1358
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,663
let anyone tell me they loved me,

1359
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,180
and guess what?

1360
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,683
Nobody has.

1361
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:28,539
Because the longer that the wall stood,

1362
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:32,703
the higher it got until no one
could knock it down anymore,

1363
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,780
least of all me.

1364
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:39,453
I've spent a long time
scared to let anyone in,

1365
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:44,269
especially the one who's hiding it there,

1366
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,383
behind the curtain.

1367
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,333
How about it? Beverly,

1368
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,049
will you love me?

1369
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,819
- Beverly, not in my church.

1370
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,469
- He's a man, reverend.

1371
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:57,899
He's a good and kind man.

1372
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,059
But even if you're a woman,

1373
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,149
I'd love him till death even dared.

1374
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,529
Beverly, will you keep me in comfort me

1375
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,513
in sickness and dubious mental health.

1376
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,270
Beverly?

1377
01:18:18,424 --> 01:18:21,174
- (laughs) Okay.

1378
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:28,078
(congregation applauds)

1379
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:35,260
(all cheering)

1380
01:18:38,887 --> 01:18:40,459
- What are you doing?

1381
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,889
Nobody's married.

1382
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,529
- We may never get this close again,

1383
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,249
so kiss me, darling.

1384
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,463
- Are you insane?

1385
01:18:55,552 --> 01:19:00,385
(man sobs)
(upbeat music)

1386
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:02,729
- [Darcy] As for the rest of us,

1387
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,393
no real change in forecast.

1388
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,359
The customer smokes and pines,

1389
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,889
but mostly smokes.

1390
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,969
- Hey guys, don't heat, all right?

1391
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,499
- [Darcy] Many men actually did manage

1392
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,009
to turn this dump around.
- Hey, my man, here.

1393
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,309
- [Darcy] All the while banging Evy

1394
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,373
who continues to date Donald.

1395
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,160
Dottie's in a millennium cult.

1396
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,189
Mammy our den mother is deeply in denial.

1397
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:32,709
Forever planning fabulous
weddings that will never come

1398
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,683
and fussing over the adopted twins.

1399
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,859
Ernest on the other hand,

1400
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,093
thinks children like dogs
should be seen and not heard.

1401
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,669
I don't know who that
guy is with the preacher,

1402
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,003
but he kind of smells.

1403
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,879
Me, I got stung by Eddie repeatedly

1404
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,433
until I realized I was allergic to bees.

1405
01:19:58,186 --> 01:20:02,478
- I have something for you.

1406
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:03,479
It's birth.

1407
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,573
- I have for you too.

1408
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,099
- [Dottie] Where are they going?

1409
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,163
- Boy, your dumb.

1410
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,009
- [Darcy] Wine comes in at the mouth.

1411
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:26,079
Love comes in at the eye.

1412
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,589
That is always shall no of truth

1413
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,119
before we grow old and die.

1414
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,959
I lift my glass to my mouth.

1415
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,713
I look at you and I saw it.

1416
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:36,329
That's Leila's favorite poem

1417
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,119
which she learned at Harvard.

1418
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,329
She says it's romantic,

1419
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:41,609
but I take it to me in
a guy who only love you

1420
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,610
when he's loaded.

1421
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,790
Which is why I have no plans for college.

1422
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,689
- I brought something for Leila.

1423
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,139
I got something for Leila.

1424
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,120
I was gonna bring it,

1425
01:20:56,121 --> 01:20:58,009
if she, you know to give her.

1426
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,410
I found this in the garbage.

1427
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,593
I think it was like a snowball.

1428
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:08,369
You know, it's New York city in here.

1429
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,009
It's New York and it was like water

1430
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:12,029
with snow in it and stuff,

1431
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,973
and it must have broke.

1432
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,063
I thought she would like.

1433
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:18,663
It actually plays the song.

1434
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:23,320
(chiming music)

1435
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,273
See, this is the empire
state building here.

1436
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:35,450
That's the Plymouth,
no, Chrysler building.

1437
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:40,149
And I love New York, man.

1438
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,350
I really loved New York,

1439
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,800
such a great town.

1440
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,989
I mean, love it when it snows in New York,

1441
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:49,069
you know, when it covers
all the shit and the grime.

1442
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,030
I wish there was snow still on it,

1443
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:50,977
she would probably like it,

1444
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:52,683
but still still plays the song.

1445
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,459
And there's times square,

1446
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,663
and some corner shops.

1447
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,293
There's a little cab right there.

1448
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,513
There's snow snowing in New York.

1449
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,271
And there was song too.

1450
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:14,653
Stars (mumbles) made it out.

1451
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,970
I'm coming today...

1452
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:24,573
New York,

1453
01:22:24,574 --> 01:22:28,023
New York, it's a hell of a town,

1454
01:22:29,682 --> 01:22:34,524
♪ Something's up and
the other things down ♪

1455
01:22:34,525 --> 01:22:39,359
♪ Now I'm gone to drive
in a cab with Leila ♪

1456
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,155
♪ All over town ♪

1457
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:46,239
♪ And we'll make it in this town ♪

1458
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:49,673
I love Leila, man.

1459
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,187
I really love Leila.

1460
01:22:51,188 --> 01:22:52,835
(tapes rolls)

1461
01:22:52,836 --> 01:22:54,507
- [Director] 15 is that a tape roll out?

1462
01:22:55,593 --> 01:22:58,343
(peaceful music)

1463
01:24:00,982 --> 01:24:03,565
(upbeat music)

1464
01:26:04,036 --> 01:26:06,703
(ominous music)
