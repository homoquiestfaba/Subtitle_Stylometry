170
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,069
I think Brian may have a point.

171
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:43,437
Thank you. Whoa, whoa, hey!

172
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,115
Come on, Jack. A woman's
color doesn't matter.

173
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,740
It's what's inside that counts.
Ah, see?

174
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,410
Now, did your wife tell
you that before or after

175
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,087
she unscrewed your dick
and put it in her purse?

176
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,022
TERRY: Don't listen to him, D.
Don't listen to him.

177
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,216
We here, Jack. No, no,
no, we're not there.

178
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,651
I'm not going out on the
sisters like you, Brian, okay?

179
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:00,087
My thing is, see, I just
haven't found the right one.

180
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,489
Just gotta look
harder, you know.

181
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,567
See, now I can dig that. What
I'm saying, though, fellas,

182
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,892
let's keep it real.

183
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,994
We're single, black,
professional men.

184
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,272
We're the cream
of the crop, right?

185
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,231
And I got to keep
it real for you, Brian.

186
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,865
We are the cream of the crop.

187
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,043
You the black sticky shit
on the bottom of the barrel.

188
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,504
(ALL LAUGHING)
My point is, fellas,

189
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,771
that we deserve the best.

190
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:20,408
And right now, the sisters
ain't up to the job.

191
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:23,977
Oh, no, no, see you're wrong. That's why when
I met Sheila, I just snapped her right up.

192
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,804
BRIAN: That and she got
pregnant on your ass.

193
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,291
That's true, D. That's true.
DERRICK: No, no, no, no, no.

194
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,792
It didn't have nothing
to do with that.

195
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:31,452
We were gonna get married
anyway 'cause we were in love.

196
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,455
Love. Now there is a word you
should look up in the dictionary.

197
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:38,192
It's after "ignorant" and
just before "stupid," stupid.

198
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,528
(LAUGHS) (ALL HOOTING)

199
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,630
* I'm trying to
get it fun tonight

200
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,164
* Whoa

201
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,999
* Was it any fun tonight?

202
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,368
* Whoa

203
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:49,470
* I wanna tear it up tonight

204
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,205
* Whoa.

205
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:52,340
We'll be at the bar.

206
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:54,074
Where's Terry? He's missing.

207
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,044
Probably went back to work to work
on that little temp if he's smart.

208
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,080
No, no, he will be here.
Trust me. He will be here.

209
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,916
Oh, damn.

210
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,352
Come on, B, why'd you do that?

211
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,354
I told you I'm done with them.

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,621
Hey, man, she looks kinda cool.

213
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,290
Just go and work your
Brian magic, man.

214
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,325
(SIGHS) You want me to work it?
Work it.

215
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,794
All right. All right. Check it out.
Check it out.

216
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,501
Um, excuse me. I'm sorry about
that little thing over there.

217
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,504
Mmm-hmm. I had the worst
day in court. Oh.

218
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,339
Oh, so you're a lawyer.
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,441
Oh, I used to work for a lawyer.
Really?

220
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:29,943
Yep. Cool. Hey, I'm Brian.

221
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,111
I'm LaMuzindah.

222
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:34,214
La Moo what? LaMuzindah.

223
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,949
Ah. It means,
"Goddess of light."

224
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:39,553
Oh, okay. Cool.
You know, do your thing.

225
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,291
You know what? You just look so...
So nurturing to me.

226
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:46,427
Hmm. Do you have any
kids, you know?

227
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:52,099
Oh, um, well, actually, I do.

228
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,201
You wanna see some pictures
of Tanesha and Tenaka?

229
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,212
I got 'em right here. Just one second.
I'm gonna get them.

230
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:57,771
No, no. Slow down with the kids.

231
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,239
Have a nice evening.

232
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,843
Tanesha and Tenaka.

233
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,612
The defense rests, fellas.

234
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:06,179
Forget you, then.

235
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,750
(CLEARS THROAT) Fellas, fellas, fellas.
Sorry I'm late.

236
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:12,453
Excuse me, bartender. I need
some of your best champagne

237
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,522
and five glasses to go around.

238
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:15,723
Champagne? Yes, yes.

239
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:17,157
It's always so crowded in here.

240
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:19,927
Yo, Terry, it's nice
of you to bring a date.

241
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,295
Right, right. Well, listen up.

242
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,764
Tonight is a little different.

243
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,733
Ready to do this? Mmm-hmm.

244
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,068
BeBe and I...

245
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,804
We're getting married. Pow!

246
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,406
(TERRY AND BEBE LAUGH)

247
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,141
Okay. Whoa.

248
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,478
Hey, hey, hey, Terry, look,
congratulations, baby.

249
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,447
Hey, good luck. Oh, thank you.

250
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,081
Congratulations, T.
Thank you, my man.

251
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:42,983
Damn, there goes my buzz.

252
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,318
Brian, what is your problem?

253
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,787
Now hold on, baby. It's okay.
Let me get this.

254
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,757
Oh, I'm gonna slide on out y'all way.
None of my business.

255
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,292
Look, Brian,

256
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,428
you and I, we have never
liked each other.

257
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,331
Okay, that's cool,
but understand this.

258
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,234
I will not take any
shit off of you.

259
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,638
I'm at the gun range
twice a week

260
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,340
and I'm licensed
to correct a nigga.

261
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,211
TERRY: All right,
come on now, baby.

262
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,013
I'm going to the ladies' room.

263
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,717
Did she just take my drink?

264
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,428
Yo, man, how you gonna diss my girl
right in front of me like that?

265
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,754
Yo, Terry, I'm sorry,
man. I was shocked.

266
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,566
Me, too. Shocked you didn't
get your ass whipped.

267
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,393
Terry, you always were the one who
said that you were gonna get married,

268
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,571
what, two minutes before you dropped dead.
That's what you said.

269
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:30,564
Yeah, man, I do remember that, but
that was a long time ago, man.

270
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:31,865
I have changed.

271
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,568
Look, fellas, I'm about to
be 29 years old in a minute.

272
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,303
I think it's about
time I settled down.

273
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,338
Wait, wait, now, 29, that's
not old, though, right?

274
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:41,341
No, it's not old. But how long
are you supposed to wait, man?

275
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,577
Wait a minute, I thought
this is what we wanted.

276
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,714
Didn't we talk about this? You know,
love, happiness and all that other shit.

277
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,517
Look, Al Green, love and happiness
is one thing, my brother,

278
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,652
but we're talking about
marriage here, man.

279
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:55,055
Take it from me. Marriage is not
something you just jump into, Terry.

280
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,901
Eighty, I mean, you know, you're wearing
a diaper, slobbering on yourself.

281
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,561
Jack, come on, man,
you are not old.

282
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:02,596
Now will you shut
your old ass up?

283
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,465
And two months
is barely enough time

284
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:05,799
to know if the booty is right.

285
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,568
Whoa, whoa, stop
all this nonsense.

286
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:08,955
What is this?
Piss on Terry Night?

287
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,204
Now, come on, Terry,
look, we're your friends.

288
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:12,573
We just want
what's best for you.

289
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,207
No, no, no, wait,
D, check this stuff.

290
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:18,579
BeBe is a good woman.
I love this girl.

291
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,648
I'm sure you do, but, man...
All right.

292
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:24,184
She does her own thing. She makes
good money at the phone company.

293
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,920
She got a job, yeah.
She got a job.

294
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,156
She's fine as hell. Hey, hey!

295
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:30,724
Nobody said nothing about that.

296
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,561
Thank you. Shit.

297
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,663
T, you're my boy. I love you.
I'm happy for you.

298
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,565
Congratulations. That's
what I'm talking about.

299
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,601
Thank you, J. Hey, me, too.
Best of luck, baby boy.

300
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,035
TERRY: Appreciate that, D.

301
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,004
Yo, Terry, you know
this is fucked up, right?

302
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:47,541
(LAUGHS) But you my man.
Congratulations.

303
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,343
Congratulations, man.

304
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,812
(SCOFFS) I don't
know why (LAUGHS)

305
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,690
but I'm gonna accept
that stupid shit from you.

306
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,483
Now I see the
champagne has arrived.

307
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,417
Now we do need
to be drinking it.

308
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,520
Yeah, a toast. I got the toast.

309
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,254
To our boy, Terry, here

310
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:04,558
and his beautiful girl, wearing
the hell out that red dress.

311
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,161
(LAUGHS) Okay! May they
have love, happiness...

312
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,197
ALL: And all that other shit.

313
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:12,065
JACKSON: All right.
ALL: All right.

314
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,937
Whee! Dr. Smith?

315
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:19,339
Dr. Smith? Dr. Smith! JACKSON: Hey!
How you doing?

316
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,843
I went down the slide by myself.

317
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,712
JACKSON: Do you want a lollipop?

318
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,122
How is she doing?
Is she feeling better?

319
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:27,657
(LAUGHS) She's doing much better.
How you been?

320
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:28,949
I've been all right.

321
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,818
I was just wondering
if maybe she...

322
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,855
Don't just stand there.

323
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,191
Do something.

324
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,933
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
Oh, that's good.

325
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,598
(CHUCKLING) That's perfect.

326
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,167
I like that.

327
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,204
Jackson Smith. How you doing?

328
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:52,873
I'm Denise.

329
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,475
Um, so what, do I have
potential, or what?

330
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,578
So, you know that
little girl, Jack?

331
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,479
Yeah, she's one of my patients.

332
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:00,981
I'm a doctor.

333
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,316
(LAUGHS) Why do you
say it like that?

334
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,485
Like what? Like, (IMITATING)
"I'm a doctor."

335
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:06,987
Like "I'm Zeus,
king of the gods."

336
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,622
Oh, no, no, I didn't
mean it that way.

337
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,526
I know you didn't. Um, I'm
a freelance photographer.

338
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:15,395
But I guess you could see that.

339
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:19,299
An artist. I like that.

340
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,302
What does your boyfriend think
about you being an artist?

341
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,873
That's smooth. But I, uh,
don't have a boyfriend,

342
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,908
and I'm not looking for one.

343
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,043
Good, 'cause I don't
have a girlfriend,

344
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:32,980
and I'm not looking for one.

345
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,348
Good.

346
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,324
(BOTH GRUNT)

347
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,327
(SIGHS) Oh, my God, girl.
You are going to wear me out.

348
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:48,672
(GRUNTING) Don't you
ever get tired?

349
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,198
Nope. (CHUCKLES)
(EXHALING FORCEFULLY)

350
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:54,534
You know, I shouldn't even be doing
this until after we get married.

351
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,369
I'm a good girl.
(LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES)

352
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:59,206
Okay, good girl. That was
real cute and everything,

353
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,541
but trust me, if you weren't
giving me some loving,

354
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,844
we might not be getting married.
Shut up, Terry!

355
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:06,079
I'm just keeping it
real, but I got needs.

356
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,547
Yeah, you got needs.

357
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,717
Yeah, you know daddy's
just playing with you.

358
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,151
(BOTH MOANING)

359
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:12,753
Mmm, you know what? What?

360
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,964
We need to get those invitations
out in the next couple days.

361
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:18,058
Oh, and my parents are going to
be flying in a few weeks before.

362
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,194
Oh, and the wedding planner needs
to know how many... Hey, hey, hey!

363
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,931
Will you hush? Can we
stay in the moment?

364
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,767
I know all of that. Who do you
think got this party started?

365
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,368
(CHUCKLES)

366
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,738
Girl, I cannot wait to make you Mrs.
Terry White.

367
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:32,706
(SIGHS)

368
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:39,980
Hey, whoa, okay,
now wait a minute.

369
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,449
You promised me that gun would
never make it up in this house.

370
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:45,518
I know. I'm sorry, baby. I forgot
to take it back after the range.

371
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:46,954
You know I hate that damn thing.

372
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,790
I know. Don't be mad.

373
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,659
I got something
to make it up to you.

374
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,827
Oh, yeah? What you got?
(CHUCKLES)

375
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:56,664
Oh, baby girl, come on. Hey,
look, as much as I like it,

376
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,042
unless you got some Viagra, Mr.
Chubby needs a couple of minutes.

377
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,134
No, he doesn't. Why not?

378
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:04,638
I got skills.
Well, hey. (CHUCKLES)

379
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,840
Come on, hey. Okay.

380
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:08,942
(EXCLAIMS)

381
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:11,054
Hey, girl, we got to get Janel some
new books to read her to sleep.

382
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:13,681
I got Dr. Seuss
coming out of my ass.

383
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,717
I know. She did
the same thing to me.

384
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:19,519
So, I suppose Terry's
having a bachelor party

385
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:22,122
with lots of naked ho's
running around there.

386
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,657
Yes, he is.

387
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,492
You know, I never
thought Terry would fall.

388
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,061
He got me feeling like
an old married man.

389
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:32,165
All this excitement over Terry is
a bunch of trouble for nothing.

390
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:34,902
First of all, he is
not the husband type.

391
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:38,438
He and that Brian have been bed-hopping
ever since we've known them.

392
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:39,606
Terry ain't shit.

393
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,909
And he's gonna
give that up? Please!

394
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:43,386
A crack-head would
have a better chance

395
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,545
at a weight-lifting
contest, okay?

396
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:48,515
(LAUGHING) You are funny!

397
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,751
Boy, that was a good one.
Crack-head, weights.

398
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:53,687
You crack me up.

399
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,622
(BOTH LAUGHING)

400
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,625
Well, it sounds like
the coast is clear.

401
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,093
Yeah.

402
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,594
(BOTH MOANING)

403
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,766
You go and express yourself.

404
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,568
Let me get that for you.
Oh, no! No, no.

405
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:10,437
No? No?

406
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,205
Come on, baby,
what is wrong now?

407
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:14,107
I'm just not ready.

408
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:16,543
What do you mean you're not ready?
Sheila, you promised!

409
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,346
But I've been thinking,
and I just...

410
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,414
I can't do it right now.

411
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:24,451
Oh, Sheila, come on now. We've
been married for three long years.

412
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,653
I know, but... But what?

413
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,589
It's nasty.

414
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,158
What the... (INAUDIBLE)

415
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,899
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna calm down.

416
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:41,401
Come on now. Come here. Oh, yes.

417
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,270
Yes, I know. (MOANING)

418
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:44,805
You're all tense and everything.

419
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,407
Look it... Relax. Relax.

420
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,576
Relax your jaws, too. Relax.

421
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:52,279
Yes. Yes. (MUMBLING)

422
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,414
See? Speak into the mike.

423
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,483
That's... See? See?

424
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,319
No, no, no, no. No? Oh, damn it!

425
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,230
You got me as hard as
Chinese arithmetic in here,

426
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:02,531
and you're bullshitting.
Derrick, wait!

427
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,357
Derrick, wait!
That's some bullshit.

428
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,394
Derrick, why did
you come in here?

429
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,197
What are you doing? Why are
you drinking at this hour?

430
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:14,434
Because I am a grown man and I
cannot get head from my own wife!

431
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,604
Why don't you just go into our
daughter's room and yell it to her?

432
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,373
Look, Sheila. We have
talked about this.

433
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,177
We went to the counselor. We bought
the books. You said you were ready.

434
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:27,347
I know. I know. But I was
eating a banana earlier today,

435
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,616
and I gagged on it.

436
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:30,918
Just don't gag on my banana,

437
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,619
we can get this
show on the road.

438
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,055
Derrick, honey, I can't.

439
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:36,223
See, I do it to you.

440
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,290
But I don't ask you to.

441
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:40,227
You do not stop me either.

442
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:43,463
Okay, well, fine. You don't
have to do it anymore.

443
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,650
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Sheila.

444
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,568
See, I don't mind doing it.
I even like it.

445
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:51,071
So, if I had a dick,
would you suck it?

446
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,207
What kind of question is that?

447
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:56,009
You ain't no man,
and I ain't no woman.

448
00:19:56,076 --> 00:20:00,280
Just answer the question. If I
had a dick, would you suck it?

449
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,249
Yes. Yes, I would
suck your dick,

450
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:05,018
wearing a Viking hat and a
Little League chest protector.

451
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,620
Derrick, baby, come here!

452
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:11,391
No, no. Baby. Derrick.
Derrick, honey, please.

453
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,562
Just... All my life, I was taught
that good girls just don't do that.

454
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,299
My mother used to tell me if I
did that, I would get cancer.

455
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:23,303
I am dealing with some serious
psychological barriers here.

456
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,738
Your mama? Girl, your
mama sucked so much dick,

457
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:27,074
she walk around on her knees.

458
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,076
My mother is a saint!

459
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,911
She must be Saint Suck-a-Dick.

460
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,113
Your mama is senile.

461
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,314
See, my mama got an excuse.

462
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,283
Your mama fucked
up for no reason.

463
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,161
You hit me with that pillow again, I'll...
What? What? What?

464
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:42,255
What, you gonna hit me? Go ahead.
Beat me, Ike. Beat me.

465
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,025
I'm gonna go watch television.

466
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,027
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

467
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:50,864
All right, have a banana. Hell, get
freaky with a peach for all I care.

468
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:53,901
Derrick, we have a daughter.

469
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,669
Are you going to advise her
to go down on her boyfriends?

470
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:00,640
Yes, I am. Right after I tell her
that sucking dick don't cause cancer.

471
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,176
Nasty old thing!

472
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:06,746
Oh! "Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
Suck my dick. Suck my dick."

473
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,216
It's good for your skin.

474
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:10,617
So, you've known me for a while,

475
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,585
and all of a sudden
you ask me out.

476
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:15,522
(CHUCKLES) What
took you so long?

477
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,925
(SIGHS) Well, you could say
I went looking for love

478
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:19,826
in all the wrong damn places.

479
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,694
(CHUCKLES)

480
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,230
Listen, um...

481
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:25,966
Jesse. Jesse.

482
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,901
Right. Right. Right.
(LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES)

483
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,070
I got some work to
do, baby, so I...

484
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:33,373
Oh, sure, I can go. I have
an early class tomorrow, so.

485
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,375
Right. Right.
What is that you teach?

486
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,345
Self-defense classes.

487
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:39,779
Karate. (LAUGHS) Karate.

488
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:42,649
Karate. Yeah, I remember.
I remember.

489
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:45,285
Look, Brian, I know this is sort
of spur of the moment and all,

490
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,288
but if you ever wanna hook
up again, just call me.

491
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:55,162
Hey, hey, hold up. Hold up.
Just sit. Relax.

492
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,330
You know, just relax. Okay.

493
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,567
Um, I have this amazing bottle of wine.
Would you like some?

494
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,036
Sure. Where is it?
In the kitchen.

495
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,805
Let me get... Oh, no, I got it.

496
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,578
(EXHALES FORCEFULLY) Oh.

497
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,880
Can you make me a sandwich
while you're in there?

498
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:15,115
JESSE: Okay.

499
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:16,683
(MOCKINGLY) Okay.

500
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,551
Oh, loving this. That's
what I'm talking about.

501
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,857
You know, um,

502
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:28,361
Denise, I hope you don't feel
nervous about us, you know,

503
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:31,831
doing it like this
on the first date.

504
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,833
Why would I be nervous?

505
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,005
Well, 'cause I picked you up, and
I got you into bed like this.

506
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,207
I don't want you to feel
self-conscious about that.

507
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:43,876
Really? Oh, okay. Well,
how about this? Yeah.

508
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:46,413
How about I picked you up and got
you in bed on the first date?

509
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,724
So, that would kinda make you a
little slut puppy now, wouldn't it?

510
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:52,585
(LAUGHS) I like that, but you
can't call a man a slut puppy.

511
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:55,088
And why's that?
It's redundant. (CHUCKLES)

512
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,393
No, actually, the only reason
why I brought that up is

513
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,196
'cause I kind of
have this issue.

514
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,066
What's that?

515
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,968
Well, it's like,
you know, it's...

516
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,640
(LAUGHS) Forget it. Forget
I even brought that up.

517
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:26,053
DENISE: Jackson, you okay?

518
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,155
What? Huh?

519
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,858
I can't talk about this.

520
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,234
Do you know why I
became a photographer?

521
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:44,037
Because you get to capture
all of life's moments.

522
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:47,740
All of the turning points
and freeze them.

523
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,810
Well, think of us as a picture.

524
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:53,746
And if you tell me your problem,

525
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:56,649
we'd be kind of making
a turning point together.

526
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,652
(CHUCKLES)

527
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,094
You crazy, you know that, right?

528
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:04,924
Yeah, everybody says that.

529
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,026
But I like that. I like that.
Yeah?

530
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:10,330
Okay, it's like this.

531
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,199
Once I meet a woman, right?

532
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:17,036
And I get to know her a little
bit, and we become intimate.

533
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:19,706
When we get into the
relationship part of it,

534
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,741
and we start talking
about commitment,

535
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:23,910
I just freeze up.

536
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:28,848
Yeah, see, and the only way I
know how to save myself is to

537
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,651
cut the woman out my life.

538
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,589
Damn. Well, I see how
that's a problem.

539
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:39,859
But you know, we all
have problems, Jackson.

540
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:41,728
You know, if life
were simple, we'd...

541
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,896
We'd all be doing something
else, don't you think?

542
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,533
(CHUCKLES) So wait.
So wait. You telling me that

543
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,111
you're not just gonna get
up, get your clothes on

544
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:49,636
and run like hell
up out of here?

545
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:51,838
No, no, no.

546
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,382
No, there's a lot
of interesting things

547
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:56,409
I could do with a man like you.

548
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:57,853
See, I thought you
were crazy before,

549
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:59,846
but I know you're crazy now.

550
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:02,415
Well, I'm just a sucker
for a naked man.

551
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:15,604
Come on, man. You got it.
Come on, man.

552
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:17,797
Yeah!

553
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,099
So, when do you start school, Cherie?
In June.

554
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,202
I'm gonna go early so I
can find a place to live.

555
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,672
Oh, I envy you. There are so
many fine men in college.

556
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,073
Excuse me?

557
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,109
Not that I care at all. (LAUGHS)

558
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:32,912
(JACKSON MOANS) Public intimacy?

559
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,881
I have never seen
my brother like this.

560
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:37,184
Girl, you must have
kryptonite in your pu...

561
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:40,320
Possession.

562
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:45,091
Oh. (LAUGHS) Hey!

563
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:46,598
Hey, there are my
beautiful children.

564
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,628
How you doing, sweetie? Hey!

565
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,297
Where's the rest of your outfit?

566
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:52,031
And you would be talking to?

567
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:55,001
You. I'm talking to you. You
shouldn't be dressing like that.

568
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,569
How very Freudian of you, Son.

569
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:58,037
Now I know I look good.

570
00:25:58,104 --> 00:25:59,639
You look fine, Miss Smith.
(SIGHS)

571
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,408
Thank you, baby.
Yes, you do, Mother.

572
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:04,711
Mmm, you know I was only
18 when I had Jackson.

573
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:05,845
Okay, not this story.

574
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,181
Mmm-mmm. I was nothing
but a baby myself.

575
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:11,117
Took me 10 months and 20 hours
of labor just to get him here.

576
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:12,661
And he ain't been
nothing but trouble...

577
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:14,086
nothing but trouble
ever since.

578
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:16,356
Yes, for the 100th time, we
know, all right? (LAUGHS)

579
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:19,091
Now, it's not about me. It's about Cherie.
She's starting school.

580
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:22,529
Hey, did you guys have your, you know,
female conversation about men yet?

581
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,697
Oops, I'll do it
right now. Sorry.

582
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:27,434
Come here, baby.

583
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,271
Cherie, a man only
needs three things.

584
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,074
Well, two of them is money.

585
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,644
(BOTH LAUGHING)

586
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,913
That's cute.
That's... That's cute.

587
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,751
You know, Denise, you're much nicer than
the other women Jackson usually dates.

588
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:46,085
Oh. Mama, please.

589
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:47,887
Mmm-mmm, don't fight
the truth, Son.

590
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,789
It'll make you grow old fast.

591
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,658
Not that I would know
with my fine self.

592
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,736
Okay, you know what? I know
better than to argue with women,

593
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,861
so I'm gonna go over here.

594
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,071
You guys can talk about
me behind my back.

595
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,464
I'll be cool. I'll be all right.

596
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,198
Hey, nobody talking about you.

597
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,801
We're talking about me.

598
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:03,270
Damn. Come on, y'all.

599
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:06,706
Can you believe Jack, Mama?

600
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,676
Asking you to tell me about men as
if there's some sort of secret.

601
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:11,611
Well, there is. Really?

602
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:13,313
Mmm-hmm, and I know what it is.

603
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,550
Wait. Not that I need to know or
anything, but, uh, what is it?

604
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:20,987
Well, it's really very simple.

605
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,391
There's one sure way to tell
if a man really loves you.

606
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:27,760
Come here.

607
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:32,265
When it's late and you're all hugged
up on the sofa and eating food

608
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:36,936
and watching TV, and you're
just all over each other.

(LAUGHS)

610
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:42,975
Well, if he will give you
his last piece of food,

611
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:47,314
the very last bite,
baby, that's love.

612
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:49,849
I like that. I like that.

613
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:53,252
Me, too. It's got
sacrifice, protection,

614
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,054
the sensuality of eating.

615
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:56,623
I learned all that
in my psych class.

616
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,558
Well, I learned it the hard way.

617
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,760
Hey, look what the wind blew in.

618
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:03,896

We've been waiting.

624
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,310
FRED: I'm sorry, baby.
I was busy.

625
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,379

stops before I got here.

627
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,082
Almost as good as me.

and teach you a thing or two.

mean nothing to you. (GASPS)

No, not "stanque hou,"
"stank ho."

Ho? Dead ho. Ignorant ho.

No, Mama. Have a good time.

That boy is 17 years old.

669
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,323
He had some women up in this house
acting a fool and having sex.

670
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,660
Ma, I told you, me and
Leshana was not having sex.

671
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,327
We was just watching TV.
Oh, yeah, right.

672
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:17,339
I guess, it was just raining condoms
outside your bedroom window.

673
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,442
What condoms? Or maybe two
squirrels was freaking with it.

674
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:20,833
Mama! Yo, Brian.

675
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,902
What, motherfucker?

676
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,613
They're gonna give you 40% of this
shit, man, let's do this thing.

677
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:27,740
Get outta here, man.
Don't you see...

678
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:31,611
I'm sensing some hesitation on your part.
I'll go for 50-50.

679
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,646
I don't like him
outside my house, Brian.

680
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,482
He's just... He's just
watching my car, Mama.

681
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:38,184
It doesn't matter. She don't
like nobody up in here,

682
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,186
except for them old-ass
ladies from church

683
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,465
who be coming here smelling like
old cheese and hot garbage.

684
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:44,724
Uh-uh. Oh, no,
you did not say that!

685
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,526
He did not say that!

686
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:48,904
I am two minutes away from whipping
your butt! Tyrel, just go outside.

687
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:51,063
Just go outside, all right?
Just watch my car.

688
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,532
Watch my car.

689
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,277
It's really good
to see you, Denise.

690
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,169
(SCOFFS) I don't know
how good it is, Fred.

691
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:58,413
So what do you think
we should do about it?

692
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:01,040
Nothing. We're not
gonna do anything.

693
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:03,519
You know, he doesn't have one
damn picture of you in his house.

694
00:31:03,543 --> 00:31:05,978
It's too late for
regrets, Denise.

695
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:09,015
You and I can't change
what happened between us.

696
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:10,550
So I think we
should just tell him.

697
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:13,085
No. No, I'll do it.

698
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,522
I'll do it in my own time, though.
Fine.

699
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:16,756
Hey. Hey!

700
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:18,157
You trying to steal my girl?

701
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,826
(ALL LAUGHING)

702
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:23,429
Uh, you know what? I'm gonna go
before your mom kills that girl.

703
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:25,031
I'll take Ursula her drink.

704
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:27,097
Nice meeting you, Fred. Nice to meet you.
All right.

705
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:31,037
Can I talk to you for a minute?

706
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:32,905
Yeah.

707
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:34,783
So, why'd you bring another
woman over to the house?

708
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:38,611
Hey, Son, (LAUGHS)
I have my own life now.

709
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:40,246
You know what I'm saying?

710
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,349
What do you think about Denise?

711
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,151
Oh, she seems nice.

712
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:48,154
Are you guys serious?

713
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,722
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

714
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:53,025
That's good. I'm happy for you.

715
00:31:53,092 --> 00:31:56,128
Now, you know Mama's gonna be upset
about this for at least a week.

716
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,897
Come on, Son.

717
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:59,799
Your mother and I are divorced.

718
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,968
And she understands that.

719
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:04,170
Yeah, but I still don't
get it, you know.

720
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:07,574
How can two people live together
and share together for 25 years

721
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,675
and then just leave?

722
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,877
You know why your mother
and I split, Son.

723
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:14,465
You know,
Terry's getting married.

724
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:19,018
Little Terry? Well,
he's big Terry now.

725
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:21,554
(LAUGHS) That's good news.
I'm happy for him.

726
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:24,991
Uh-oh. Now, come on, tell me.

727
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:26,669
You're not thinking about
taking that fall, too, are you?

728
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:27,994
Oh, hell, no.

729

that's not for me.

Oh, come on now. You can't judge
by looking at me and your mother.

732
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:39,872
Your mother and I had some
great years together, Son.

733
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:42,775

might be better than mine.

734

visit your old man sometimes?

at one of the dealerships.

Tyrel come live with me.

No.

756
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,935
I told you before
I'm not letting him go.

757
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:44,436
Why not? He's my brother.

758

Half-brother.

759
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:49,742
All I'm saying, Mama, is that
the boy is not happy here.

760
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,678
Okay? It's not like
his daddy's around...

761
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,846
Don't even bring up
that fool to me.

762
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,016
He left me for some white woman.

763
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,652
She's Hawaiian. If she
ain't black, she white.

Oh, so I just guess
Asian women...

769

Are white women who no
speak the goddamn English.

is just like your daddies.

I done heard that my whole life.

773
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,775
How long you gonna
look at us and see them?

774
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:26,378
I know what they did is wrong, Mama,
but me and Tyrel, we didn't do it.

Can't we get a little love?

776

I raised you. That's love.

777
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,452
Oh, really? Then prove it, Mama.

778
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:38,457
Can you give your son
a kiss and a hug?

779
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:43,229
You're too old for that now.

780

You acting crazy. Just stop it.

782
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:54,673
Mama, when was the last
time you gave me a hug?

783

What was it, 10 years ago?

784

When Tyrel gets
old enough, Mama,

00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:21,367
he's gonna come live
with his big brother.

791
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,935
He can get his love from me.

792
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,671

00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:27,305
I remember.

1009
00:45:27,373 --> 00:45:30,709
Well, at first I didn't understand
what you were talking about.

1010
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:33,712
But I understand now
what you meant,

1011
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,757
about how a person can make a
turning point in their lives

1012
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:37,749
where it changes
everything about them.

1013
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,819
And I've changed
like that, Denise.

1014
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:46,492
I've changed like
that because of you.

1015
00:45:46,558 --> 00:45:50,228
I want you to know, Denise, that
I am not afraid of a good woman

1016
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:53,399
and all that she
can bring to a man.

1017
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:55,425
And I'm not afraid to tell
you I love you, Denise.

1018
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:14,853
Now, did that make it
just a little bit easier

1019
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,888
for you to say what
you wanted to say?

1020
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:21,126
Yeah. Um, it did.

1021
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:24,563
Actually, it's not even
important anymore.

1022
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:29,568
I love you too, Jackson.

1023
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:31,269
Good.

1024
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:35,541
Really good.

1025
00:46:41,813 --> 00:46:43,014
You gonna eat that?

1026
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:44,650
Hmm? Oh.

1027
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:49,387
Yeah.

1028
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:52,891
(SIGHS) This it right
here. It's blazing.

1029
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,960
The spices and shit
was just right.

1030
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:58,196
Mmm, mmm.

1031
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:02,634
LOUISE: Here, baby.

1032
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,504
Oh, Louise, thank you so much for
letting me have my shower here.

1033
00:47:05,571 --> 00:47:07,172
Terry's mother loved it.

1034
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:08,740
No problem, sweetie.

1035
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:10,442
Fred's throwing
Terry's bachelor party,

1036
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:12,243
and I'm not about to be outdone.

1037
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,979
(ALL LAUGHING)

1038
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:18,450
Hey, Denise, you okay?

1039
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,852
Hmm?

1040
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:22,788
Oh, God, I'm sorry, um...

1041
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,356
I was just thinking
that lately Jackson

1042
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,258
has been saying all
of the right things,

1043
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,127
but I don't know
if he means any of it.

1044
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:30,261
Well, why do you say that?

1045
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,364
Jackson told me
that he loved me.

1046
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:35,133
Hey! How sweet!

1047
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,003
And then he ate the last piece of
chicken while we watched a movie.

1048
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:40,005
(ALL GROANING) Not good.
Not good.

1049
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:42,016
Hey, hey, hey, maybe I can
get Terry to talk to him,

1050
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,609
find out what he's thinking.

1051
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:45,219
He's got his head on
straight these days.

1052
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:48,346
Mmm, yes, Terry's gonna
make a fine husband.

1053
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:50,849
Now, y'all know that the
brothers are not going for that.

1054
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,685
Yeah, I was probably just overreacting.
I mean, It happens.

1055
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:55,721
Maybe Jackson was
just hungry, right?

1056
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:58,590
Not likely, baby.
It's a subconscious thing.

1057
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:01,793
I don't know why women always pay
for men's emotional failures.

1058
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,829
We do do that. We do.

1059
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:04,930
Mmm-hmm, don't we.

1060
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:06,331
Well, I know one reason.

1061
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:07,833
ALL: What?

1062
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:10,569
Well, damn. If we're gonna
get deep, let's go sit down.

1063
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:12,246
Right, bring the strawberries.
I got the strawberries.

1064
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,148
Getting married, I need to learn something.
Grab that champagne.

1065
00:48:14,172 --> 00:48:15,974
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

1066
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,680
All right, Denise,
I love my brother,

1067
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:23,314
but if he's giving you
mixed messages,

1068
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:24,916
just tell him to get
his shit together.

1069
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:26,952
Ooh, that was my
baby that said that.

1070
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:28,587
SHEILA: And you
know she's right.

1071
00:48:28,654 --> 00:48:30,598
That's what I do to Derrick.
That's why we're so happy.

1072
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:32,223
You gotta stand up to him.

1073
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,491
DENISE: No, I know. I know.

1074
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:36,061
Jackson is a good
man, I give him that.

1075
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:38,429
But I have worked too
damn hard to shape him

1076
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:41,032
into the man I've grown
to know and love,

1077
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,101
and I'm not doing
that shit again.

1078
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,303
Well, I'm not limiting
myself to brothers.

1079
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,139
I mean, I'll consider all men,
even those who are not black.

Like hell you will!

1081
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:52,644
But, Mama... Uh-uh,
who taught you that?

1082
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:53,945
Life.

1083
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:56,514
Brothers date all kinds
of women all the time.

1084
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:57,959
Why should we sit
around like idiots

1085
00:48:57,983 --> 00:49:00,786
waiting for them to bestow
their favors upon us?

1086
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:02,287
Screw that.

1087
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:05,090
A white man has all the
equipment and twice the cash.

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:13,632
And while we're on the
subject of other men, Mama,

1092
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:16,367
you need to get yourself a man
and stop pining away for Daddy.

Uh-oh! Okay, that's enough.

been drinking too much, come here.

goodbye to dependency.

I have myself.

till this very second,

too much me in you.

Now just sit down somewhere.

in order to objectify
a woman's sexuality

1110
00:49:52,638 --> 00:49:54,505
and turn us into property.

1111

If you accept that you have
one, then they own you.

she said the P-word.

and really tell him how you feel.

is always the best one.

scare this man,

and all that, but more.

even know who they are

kind of woman they want.

00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:25,156
'cause as you can see,
it is a stone-cold groove.

1177
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:26,524
I need to talk to you, Terry.

1178
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:27,859
Cool. What's up?

1179
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:31,196
Uh, without her.
You know, excuse me.

1180
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:34,032
All right, baby, don't go too far
now with my two little friends.

1181
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:35,533
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

1182
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,103
Ooh, did you see her?
She can breathe.

1183
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:39,971
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1184
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:42,240
So what's up, kid? Speak.

1185
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:43,775
Why are you doing this, Terry?

1186
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:46,311
Oh, come on, B. How many times
we gotta talk about this?

1187
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:47,612
I told you.

1188
00:52:47,678 --> 00:52:49,547
Because I think it's
about time I grew up.

1189
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:52,117
Don't do it. Don't do it, Terry.

1190
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:54,052
The brothers,
we got a friendship,

1191
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,921
a bond.

1192
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:57,932
And you, under the guise of
growing up, as you put it,

1193
00:52:57,956 --> 00:52:59,724
you about to throw it all away.

1194
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,592
And I'm looking
out for us, Terry.

1195
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:03,294
I'm protecting the brothers.

1196
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:06,364
(LAUGHS) Uh-uh.

1197
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,366
You know what your problem is?

1198
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,402
You never could hold your liquor
and you talk too damn much.

1199
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:12,914
Come on, man.
You wanna look out for me?

1200
00:53:12,938 --> 00:53:14,139
Mmm-hmm.

1201
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,774
Put the drink down
and bring your drunk ass

1202
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:19,310
and let's go look at some titties.
Come on, man.

1203
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:22,513
All right, man, when it all
blows up in your face,

1204
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:24,715
don't come calling me.

1205
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:26,251
I don't wanna hear about it.

1206
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:28,987
Hey, baby. Hi.

1207
00:53:31,222 --> 00:53:32,891
All right, B, that's enough.

1208
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,893
You my boy and I love
you, but this is real.

1209
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,228
You jealous, man.

1210
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:38,763
Yeah, yeah, you jealous.

1211
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,008
See, I know you. You wish you could
have somebody to care about.

1212
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:42,868
Don't try to tell me different.

1213
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:44,145
I'm gonna tell you
what I discovered,

1214
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:47,305
and it's why I'm doing
what I'm doing, man.

1215
00:53:47,372 --> 00:53:49,440
This world is full
of amazing women

1216
00:53:49,507 --> 00:53:52,110
waiting for brothers like
us who got it together.

1217
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:54,512
But it takes courage
to step up like that, B.

1218
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,214
Courage.

1219
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:58,116
(SCOFFS) See, look at you.

1220
00:53:58,183 --> 00:53:59,851
You don't know
nothing about that

1221
00:53:59,918 --> 00:54:02,078
'cause you can't seem to see
past your raggedy-ass dick.

1222
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:06,624
I don't know, man. You know, maybe
for you this is all there is.

1223
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:09,827
(SCOFFS) Goddamn, man,
and if that's the truth,

1224
00:54:09,895 --> 00:54:11,095
man, I feel even worse for you.

1225
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,434
Look, you're drunk.

1226
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:18,403
There's a party going
on here for me.

1227
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:21,306
Half booty, butt-naked women
running all over the place.

1228
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:23,341
I'm gonna try to
enjoy myself. I'm out.

1229
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,545
My dick is not raggedy!

1230
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,448
It's big.

1231
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,653
Don't be shy. I'm very
flattered that you picked me.

1232
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,455
Some nice-looking
women out there.

1233
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:39,524
Yeah, yeah, well... (CHUCKLES)

1234
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,827
I just wanted to, uh, you know.

1235
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:45,997
Yeah, I know.
What kind do you want?

1236
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:47,232
I do everything.

1237
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:49,000
"Everything."
What a wonderful word.

1238
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,368
(LAUGHS)

1239
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,938
I can even get a friend if you
really wanna have some fun.

1240
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:54,705
No, no, that, uh...

1241
00:54:54,772 --> 00:54:57,008
Ooh, that ain't
gonna be necessary.

1242
00:54:57,075 --> 00:54:58,743
Hey, you know what?
How about some head?

1243
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:02,080
Well, I guess you do
know what you want.

1244
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:03,414
Yeah, yeah.

1245
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:05,683
It ain't for me. It's for him.

1246
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,252
He's only got one eye.

1247
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:10,455
(LAUGHS) Oh, lord, he gives
me such trouble sometimes.

1248
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:14,192
Be careful now. He kinda swell
up when you make him mad.

1249
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:15,760
Poke you in the forehead.

1250
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:17,771
Hard to go to work with a big
dick scuff mark on your head.

1251
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:19,730
So you just be cool.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1252
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,901
You know, wait, wait.

1253
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:26,437
(SIGHS)

1254
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,143
You change your mind?
You want something different?

1255
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,444
Oh, no, no.

1256
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,780
Look, I can't do this.

1257
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,549
You're a beautiful girl,
but I'm here with you,

1258
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:40,385
and all I'm thinking is that.

1259
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:42,720
I wish you were my wife.

1260
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:50,261
A man can't make his dick do
what his heart can't handle.

1261
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:53,464
That is very profound.

1262
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:56,667
That'll be $50.

1263
00:55:56,734 --> 00:55:59,004
$50 for almost doing something?

1264
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,571
You must be a Republican.

1265
00:56:01,506 --> 00:56:03,108
(MONEY RUSTLING)

1266
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,144
But I like your style.

1267
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:07,412
Thanks.

1268
00:56:15,086 --> 00:56:16,354
Oh, shut up.

1269
00:56:17,188 --> 00:56:18,223
Oh!

1270
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:21,192
Whoa! Wait here!
Wait, wait, don't go.

1271
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:25,463
What's up, D? Did you do it?

1272
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,865
Nah, nah, I couldn't do it.

1273
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:30,601
Couldn't do what? Nothing.

1274
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:32,246
Uh, look, I'm gonna
go hang out in front.

1275
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,771
Please, tell me
he couldn't do her.

1276
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:36,474
He's not talking about that
thing that walked outta here.

1277
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,510
Good lord. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1278
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:41,946
This is what I'm talking about right here.
This is it, man.

1279
00:56:42,013 --> 00:56:44,549
This is nice of your dad
to let us use his place, too.

1280
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:47,285
What a party! A man
after my own heart.

1281
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:50,688
Yo, damn. He's still
freaky, though, huh?

1282
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,723
He got all the women
for the party, too.

1283
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,692
Mmm. Dirty old bastard. (LAUGHS)

1284
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,471
Did your girl get on your case about
coming here with all these women?

1285
00:56:57,495 --> 00:56:59,373
Brian, come on, man. This is me.
You know I handle mine, okay?

1286
00:56:59,397 --> 00:57:00,498
Don't lie to me, boy.

1287
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:03,701
I ain't talking about it.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1288
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,603
(BOTH EXCLAIMING) Oh, baby!

1289
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,173
I will beat your drunk ass, man.
This shit's Italian.

1290
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:09,999
Man, I've just had a
little bit to drink, man.

1291
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,609
Yeah, but you're drunk.
You're drunk.

1292
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:13,178
Hey, I'm nice.

1293
00:57:13,244 --> 00:57:15,846
I'm nice. I've been thinking
about some stuff, Jack.

1294
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:17,791
What do you think about this one?
Oh, that's good.

1295
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:19,417
You know, if we didn't
need sex (GROANS)

1296
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:21,052
we really wouldn't want women.

1297
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,996
(LAUGHS) Man, you got issues.
You know that, right?

1298
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,555
You just gotta
think about it, man.

1299
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:26,657
Just think about what
I'm saying to you, baby.

1300
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:28,735
You know, Brian, you're gonna have
to stop this cynical attitude.

1301
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:31,929
You know what I'm saying? I mean,
look at me. I was a lost cause, man.

1302
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:34,999
You know, I was having nightmares
and shit about commitment.

1303
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:36,401
Uh-huh.

1304
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:37,944
Then I met Denise, and she
turned my life around.

1305
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:39,837
No, she turned
your ass out, Jack.

1306
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:42,140
Hey, hey, call it what
you like, but I'm happy.

1307

(CHUCKLES)

1308
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,910
What about you, Brian?

1309
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:47,812
(SCOFFS) I'm drinking,
man. I'm cool.

1310
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:50,681
I just wanna have some
fun at this party.

1311
00:57:50,748 --> 00:57:53,518
We've only been here a couple of hours.
You know what I mean?

1312
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:55,052
Hey, I'll meet you downstairs.

1313
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,088
I'll see you in a sec.

1314
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:58,589
Yeah. (SIGHS)

Hi, Fred. It's Denise.

Thanks for being
so understanding.

1320
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:13,438
I've decided to tell
Jackson about us.

this message. Bye.

Hey, baby. You know,
I was hungry.

1325
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:25,650
I thought we could
go get something to...

1326
00:58:25,716 --> 00:58:27,956
I heard the message you left
at my father's place tonight.

1327
00:58:31,656 --> 00:58:33,291
Jackson, I was gonna tell you.

1328
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,561
Oh, you were gonna tell me. Oh, okay,
so, uh, so when were you gonna tell me?

1329
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:39,430
On our honeymoon?

1330
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:40,941
What about Father's Day? Does that
sound about right, Father's Day?

1331
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:42,733
Give me a chance to explain.

1332
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,146
There's no need to explain, okay,
'cause I know what happened.

1333
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:47,138
It happened because
you're a woman

about herself,

Hey, hey, now,
I did not say that word.

1338
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:59,884
But it does seem to be floating around
somewhere up in here, don't it?

1339
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:04,355
Okay. Okay, look. You have every
right to be angry, Jackson.

1340

But listen to me. Your
father and I got together

1341
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,492
long before you
and I ever even met.

1342
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:09,436
He is my father. It doesn't
matter when you slept together.

1343
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,196
Oh, is that what you think?

1344
00:59:11,262 --> 00:59:13,307
Oh, come on now, okay. We slept together
on the first date, remember that?

1345
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,651
Now, my father, he's an old-school player.
I know he hit it.

1346
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,144
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

1347
00:59:17,168 --> 00:59:18,312
Oh, I don't know what
I'm talking about?

1348
00:59:18,336 --> 00:59:19,896
So what're you saying?
He didn't hit it?

1349
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:25,543
Okay, Jackson,
let's not do this.

1350
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:27,945
Let's not let this
come between us.

1351
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:30,415
Come on now, Denise, all right?
It's real simple.

1352
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,750
All you gotta say is, "No,
Jackson, he didn't hit it,"

1353
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:34,619
or, "Yes, Jackson, he hit it."

1354
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:37,455
(SCOFFS) You are so blinded
by your dislike for Fred

1355
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:39,666
that you wouldn't believe a damn
thing I said to you anyway.

1356
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,226
Fred?

1357
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:44,128
Okay, well, I think I just got
my answer about you and Fred.

1358
00:59:46,997 --> 00:59:48,132
Okay, you want an answer?

1359
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,476
Yeah, I want an answer.
All right, here you go.

1360
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,901
Fred and I met a long time ago,

1361
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:53,471
went out on a few dates, but
we did not have sex, okay?

1362
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:54,539
You didn't have sex? No.

1363
00:59:54,605 --> 00:59:55,606
Did you kiss him?

1364
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:58,443
Yes. Oh, okay,

1365
00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:00,211
so now we're getting
somewhere. Okay, okay.

1366
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:03,248
So did, uh... Oh, no, no. I'm not
about to be interrogated about this.

1367
01:00:04,649 --> 01:00:06,150
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1368
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:12,657
You made a commitment to me for
the first time in your life.

1369
01:00:12,723 --> 01:00:15,260
What are you just gonna
walk away from all of that?

1370
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:17,762
No. I'm walking away from
a woman who lied to me.

1371
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:18,939
All right? Who
deceived and hurt me.

1372
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:21,131
That's what I'm
walking away from.

1373
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:23,301
I'm not gonna give you
what you want, Jackson.

1374
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:24,869
I'm not gonna let
you just dump me.

1375
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,547
Oh, you're not gonna
just let me dump you.

1376
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:28,682
Okay, what, you wanna dump me?
Is that what you wanna do?

1377
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:33,744
No. No. I'm gonna make you do
what's really in your heart.

1378
01:00:33,811 --> 01:00:35,780
I'm gonna make you love me.
(LAUGHS)

1379
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:39,116
(STAMMERS) That's cute. That
little reverse psychology trick.

1380
01:00:39,183 --> 01:00:41,552
You know, but try that
on a brother with a GED.

1381
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:43,788
All right? 'Cause it
gets none right here.

1382
01:00:43,854 --> 01:00:46,657
There's no trick to it,
Jackson. It's the truth.

1383
01:00:46,724 --> 01:00:50,060
You need me in your life just
as much as I need you in mine.

1384
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:53,998
So, you can take me
with all of my flaws,

1385
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:56,467
or we can just both
be miserable.

1386
01:00:57,335 --> 01:00:58,403
Hey.

1387
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:07,612
Okay, look, I know that
you're scared, Jackson.

1388
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:09,856
I know that every time someone has
said "I love you" in your life,

1389
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,115
it's turned out bad.

1390
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:13,181
Okay, now you don't know
what you're talking about.

1391
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:18,389
Your mother,
all your old girlfriends.

1392
01:01:18,456 --> 01:01:19,857
Your father.

1393
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:26,030
I know I should have told you about
all of this a long time ago.

1394
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:29,133
But don't use that as an excuse
to go back to the way you were.

1395
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:35,973
Come on. Please.

1396
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:47,585
Let yourself out.

1397

Hey, uh, my key don't work.

1445
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:50,608
Yes. I changed the locks.
I don't know you anymore.

1446
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:53,310
When you're the man that I
married, then you can come back.

1447
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:56,380
Open the door, woman!
I live here, too!

1448
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:59,917
Okay, how about you stay
here and I'll go call LAPD?

1449
01:03:59,984 --> 01:04:03,554
You know they're real sympathetic to
black men in domestic situations.

01:04:39,156 --> 01:04:41,792
I just stopped by for a minute.

1462
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:43,828
Who you got coming over?

1463
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:46,063
Now, instead of being
all up in my business,

1464
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,970
how come you ain't out somewhere trying
to get back together with Denise?

1465
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:51,401
Oh, believe me,
you don't wanna know,

1466
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:53,971
'cause she is
definitely not the one.

1467
01:04:54,038 --> 01:04:57,742
Ooh, you looked just like your
daddy when you said that.

1468
01:04:57,808 --> 01:05:00,277
And you just found
a way to make me leave.

1469
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:02,312
Your father's coming
by here tonight.

1470
01:05:05,282 --> 01:05:06,817
How long has this been going on?

1471
01:05:06,884 --> 01:05:08,385
Since your sister's party.

1472
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:11,055
He came back to apologize
for bringing that girl.

1473
01:05:12,289 --> 01:05:14,258
And you know I was looking good.

1474
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:15,502
Well, let me tell you
something about daddy

1475
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:18,362
and your little
golden girl, Denise.

1476
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:19,797
They had a thing together.

1477
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:22,867
I know. You know?

1478
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:24,669
And you don't care?

1479
01:05:25,736 --> 01:05:27,071
No.

1480
01:05:27,137 --> 01:05:29,039
'Cause nothing happened
between them.

1481
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:33,343
It was before she met you.

1482
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:37,247
And your father is charming and
handsome and all those things.

1483
01:05:37,314 --> 01:05:39,259
And did it ever occur to you
that she might have seen

1484
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:41,652
the same qualities
in you, Jackson?

1485
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,297
I can't believe she sucked you in
with that "nothing happened" stuff.

1486
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,923
She's not the one who told me.

1487
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:49,093
She tried, but I didn't let her.

1488
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,128
Your father had already
told me everything.

1489
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:53,063
Oh, nobody cared
enough to tell me.

1490
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:56,667
(BOTH SIGH)

1491
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,178
Well, what makes you think
that you can trust him

1492
01:05:58,202 --> 01:06:00,070
anymore than I can trust her?

1493
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:02,472
He didn't have
to tell me, Jackson.

1494
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:03,774
And I know him.

1495
01:06:05,743 --> 01:06:07,503
Mama, you're gonna have
to stop seeing Daddy.

1496
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:11,181
And do what?

1497
01:06:11,248 --> 01:06:12,717
Hmm?

1498
01:06:12,783 --> 01:06:15,119
You're gone.
Your sister's leaving.

1499
01:06:15,185 --> 01:06:18,455
I'm throwing parties here every other
night just to have people around.

1500
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:21,558
Your father and I are comfortable
with each other, Jackson.

1501
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:24,829
And I do have my needs.

1502
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,296
Oh, Mama, not the needs.

1503
01:06:26,363 --> 01:06:27,932
(LAUGHS)

1504
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,102
Now, I know that
you still love him,

1505
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:35,505
but you're gonna
have to let him go.

1506
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:38,876
No. I won't let him go.

1507
01:06:40,978 --> 01:06:44,414
We had a marriage,
love and children.

1508
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:48,052
And nothing is
stronger than that.

1509
01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:50,688
Okay, and then what?

1510
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:53,800
He's gonna come around here and get you
all excited about getting back together.

1511
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:57,294
And he's just gonna run and
break your heart again.

1512
01:07:02,132 --> 01:07:03,300
Maybe.

1513
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:06,937
But I can handle that.

1514
01:07:15,813 --> 01:07:17,581
That girl loves you.

1515
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:21,786
What you gonna do about it?

1516
01:07:29,193 --> 01:07:30,728
I gotta go.

1517
01:07:38,168 --> 01:07:39,888
DR. THELMA: So, do you
still think about her?

1518
01:07:40,905 --> 01:07:42,740
Yep, every day.

1519
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:48,913
Do you still think that she and
your father were sexually intimate?

1520
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:51,181
I don't know.

1521
01:07:53,217 --> 01:07:55,419
Probably not.

1522
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:58,856
Well, if that's the case, then
why don't you go back to her?

1523
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:00,991
Talk it out?

1524
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,929
I just don't have it in me. You
know, I get too mad, too scared.

1525
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:08,298
Let's explore that.

1526
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:10,811
You know what, Doc? No offense, but
this is gonna be my last session.

1527
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:12,636
You're giving up? I mean, I...

1528
01:08:12,703 --> 01:08:14,414
I know love's supposed
to be this beautiful thing,

1529
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:15,572
but I just can't get with it.

1530
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:18,208
I go up, love goes down.
I go left, love goes right.

1531
01:08:18,275 --> 01:08:21,145
I say I'm ready, love says, "Not yet.
She dated your father."

1532
01:08:22,913 --> 01:08:25,615
Maybe there is love out there,
but it's running from me.

1533
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:29,086
I can't keep chasing it.

1534

1535
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:35,559
Is that the kind
of existence you want?

1536
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,594
Life without love in it?

1537

hear about you and Sheila, man.

but that's life.

to jam up a brother like that,

books like Waiting to Exhale.

I'm gonna write a book.

Boy, you are retarded.

1553
01:09:30,114 --> 01:09:32,358
You always gotta use that word
like it's synonymous with women?

1554
01:09:32,382 --> 01:09:34,819
I use the word 'cause
it applies, man.

1555
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,386
You need to check yourself.

1556

the ladies some love, man.

1673
01:15:05,882 --> 01:15:08,051
They're meeting with the
wedding planner tonight.

1674
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:09,853
See, it's starting already.

1675
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:11,888
See, you put your boys
on the back burner.

1676
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:14,124
Then more and more,
you just don't care.

1677
01:15:14,191 --> 01:15:16,926
The next thing you know, you're
wearing an apron, washing dishes

1678
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:19,463
and you got a feather
duster up your ass.

1679
01:15:19,529 --> 01:15:22,299
Why do all your stories end with a
feather duster up somebody's ass?

1680
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:24,201
What is... Ah, this guy.

1681
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:25,602
Don't listen to him.

1682
01:15:27,171 --> 01:15:29,339
Ah, damn. Hey, look, Jack,

1683
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,041
turn around slowly and
look who just walked in.

1684
01:15:38,715 --> 01:15:39,983
Hi, guys.

1685
01:15:41,385 --> 01:15:44,354
Denise. Hey, um,

1686
01:15:44,421 --> 01:15:46,556
you wanna go somewhere and talk?

1687
01:15:46,623 --> 01:15:48,701
No, and I don't really think
that's gonna be a good idea.

1688
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:50,360
Ooh.

1689
01:15:50,427 --> 01:15:51,561
This is Ceyno.

1690
01:15:51,628 --> 01:15:53,730
Ceyno, that's Jackson, uh,

1691
01:15:53,797 --> 01:15:55,665
Derrick, and that
would be Brian.

1692
01:15:55,732 --> 01:15:58,268
Denise, I see our
people, honey. Let's go.

1693
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,369
Oh, that's right.

1694
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:01,471
You know what? Nice to
see you guys again.

1695
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:07,777
He's not her type. Is he white?

1696
01:16:07,844 --> 01:16:09,413
Look, she's just
trying to get me mad,

1697
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:10,656
(SCOFFS) but I'm
not even stressing out.

1698
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,382
No, no, I think he's Asian.

1699
01:16:12,449 --> 01:16:14,093
You know what, it's the oldest
trick in the book, right?

1700
01:16:14,117 --> 01:16:16,362
She brings some other cat up in here.
She don't care about you.

1701
01:16:16,386 --> 01:16:19,223
I pretend like she don't care about me.
I'm not buying it.

1702
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:21,057
Maybe he's Latino
or one of them Indians.

1703
01:16:21,124 --> 01:16:23,126
What difference does it
make what race he is?

1704
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:25,495
So Jack could know how
pissed off he should be.

1705
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:27,931
But Jackson is
not mad, all right?

1706
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:29,141
I just wanna go talk
to him for a minute.

1707
01:16:29,165 --> 01:16:31,268
Whoa, whoa, scooter.
Come on, now. Hey, hey.

1708
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:33,446
Don't do that, man. That's what
she wants you to do, Jack.

1709
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,039
Yeah. Besides, the boy might know karate.
Right, Brian?

1710
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:38,408
Very funny, Derrick. You know
what we should do, fellas?

1711
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:40,043
There's a lot of
ladies up in here.

1712
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:41,621
Let's get our little party on.
You're right about that.

1713
01:16:41,645 --> 01:16:42,988
I'm feeling you with
that right there.

1714
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,514
DERRICK: Hey, uh, you know,

1715
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:46,182
it is an epidemic in here.

1716
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,784
Check this out. What?

1717
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,858
Oh, I know she didn't
just diss me like that.

1718
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:56,526
Coming up in here with Amistad.

Give us free.

1720
01:16:58,428 --> 01:17:00,497
This joint is hot
tonight, let me tell you.

1721
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:02,566
Hey, that's it. I'm out.
Can we get this check?

1722
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:03,967
Okay, it's coming.

1723
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:05,369
No, man, I ain't leaving.

1724
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:06,803
Jesse ain't running
me out of here.

1725
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,081
You know what I just realized?
I am separated from my wife

1726
01:17:09,105 --> 01:17:10,940
and yet I'm doing better
than both of you two.

1727
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:12,842
(LAUGHING) BOTH: Shut
the fuck up, all right?

1728
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:14,911
Don't me mad at me. I didn't
tell y'all to do this.

1729
01:17:39,403 --> 01:17:41,971
Well, all right. The separation
agreement is complete.

1731
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,851
Hey, what's up, man?
You all right?

1732
01:17:54,918 --> 01:17:56,686
No. No, I'm not all right.

1733
01:17:56,753 --> 01:17:58,488
What's going on, man?
Talk to me.

1734
01:18:01,691 --> 01:18:03,360

Terry, no, man, no.

1737
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,636
J, man, look, I can't do it.

1738
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:14,103
(SIGHS) I can't do it, J.

1739
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,542
Look, I was cool
until a few days ago.

1740
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:21,110
But, man, I was at work.
I looked at the calendar.

1741
01:18:21,177 --> 01:18:23,347
I realized this wedding
is two weeks away, man.

1742
01:18:23,847 --> 01:18:25,749
Two weeks.

1743
01:18:25,815 --> 01:18:28,352
Nah, man, I can't. I'm making
a big mistake marrying BeBe.

1744
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:29,995
It's just cold feet, man.
You'll get over that.

1745
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:31,588
Mmm-mmm, it's not cold feet.

1746
01:18:31,655 --> 01:18:33,790
I'm telling you.
I'm not ready, J.

1747
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:36,326
Terry, why? You're supposed to
have your shit together, man.

1748
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:37,661
I know.

1749
01:18:38,795 --> 01:18:41,498
J, I did, man. I did.

1750
01:18:41,565 --> 01:18:44,401
You know, I thought it was time.
You know what I'm saying?

1751
01:18:45,869 --> 01:18:47,212
I don't know, man.
I think I was doing this

1752
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:48,581
'cause I was trying
to make myself believe

1753
01:18:48,605 --> 01:18:50,840
I could move on with my life.

1754
01:18:50,907 --> 01:18:52,284
But, man, every time
I looked in the mirror,

1755
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:54,511
I realized that
shit wasn't true.

1756
01:18:56,846 --> 01:18:58,615
So how did BeBe take
it when you told her?

1757
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:06,022
You didn't tell her? Yeah, I told her, J.
Of course I told her,

1758
01:19:06,089 --> 01:19:07,957
when I left her a message
on her machine, man.

1759
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:09,493
On her answering machine?

1760
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:10,903
Terry, you left a message
on her answering machine?

1761
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:12,407
Yeah, yeah, I left
her a message, man.

1762
01:19:12,462 --> 01:19:13,939
Why don't you back off
me just a little bit?

1763
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:15,875
Hey, don't scream at me, okay?
This is your fucked-up shit.

1764
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:18,902
(SIGHS) All right, I...
My bad. My bad.

1765
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:20,804
Look, she already
heard the message.

1766
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,472
She called me 10 times today.

1767
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,376
Man, you got anything
stronger than this shit here?

1768
01:19:26,443 --> 01:19:27,720
You know what?
I'm calling the fellas.

1769
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:29,779
No, no, don't call nobody, man.

1770
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:31,857
Hey, at a time like this, you
need to be with your boys.

1771
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:33,517
J, don't call Brian
'cause I already know

1772
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,084
what his sorry ass is gonna say.

1773
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:38,087
(LAUGHS) I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.

1774
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:40,289
Whoo!

1775
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,827
Brian, fuck you.

1776
01:19:43,893 --> 01:19:46,530
I'm sorry, Terry, but I did, man.
I know you.

1777
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:48,765
You don't wanna
get married. Come on.

1778
01:19:48,832 --> 01:19:52,201
And the way you dropped her on the
answering machine, that was brilliant.

1779
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:55,939
Move on, Brian. Have some
sympathy for the man.

1780
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:59,643
Hey, hey, hey, Terry?
I know how you feel.

1781
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:04,147
Look, um, I never
told you fellas this,

1782
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:07,451
but the only reason I married
Sheila was 'cause she was pregnant.

1783
01:20:07,517 --> 01:20:09,586
Oh, we knew that. Come on, man.

1784
01:20:09,653 --> 01:20:11,488
All right, look, the point is,

1785
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:14,658
we fell in love later
and the shit was good.

1786
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:17,761
Yeah, I had second thoughts,
thirds and fourths, too.

1787
01:20:17,827 --> 01:20:20,964
Terry, you've got to search your soul and
find a reason to go back to that girl.

1788
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,267
BRIAN: Derrick, please. How can you even
say that after what Sheila did to you?

1789
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,945
All right, all right,
so I made a mistake.

1790
01:20:25,969 --> 01:20:28,472
But I made that
mistake like a man.

1791
01:20:28,538 --> 01:20:30,049
I stood up for what
was right at the time,

1792
01:20:30,073 --> 01:20:31,908
and Terry here
should do the same.

1793
01:20:31,975 --> 01:20:34,210
No, no, see, then he'd be
cheating BeBe and himself.

1794
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:35,979
You need to think
about this, Terry.

1795
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:38,147
Come on, Jack. What kind
of friends are you two?

1796
01:20:38,214 --> 01:20:39,883
Terry's gotta do
the right thing here.

1797
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:41,518
Terry needs to run like hell.

1798
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:43,665

do this for Jack, all right? Cool.

I'm sorry.

Denise dated my father
before we hooked up.

Denise boned your father?

1808
01:21:07,811 --> 01:21:11,481
No. She said it was just a date,
but, uh, she kept that shit from me.

1809
01:21:12,482 --> 01:21:13,659
When I found out,
I couldn't take it.

1810
01:21:13,683 --> 01:21:15,619
I just had to cut her loose.

1811

Yo, man. I don't
blame you for that.

1812

Yeah, but I thought I had something
special with Denise, you know?

I lost it.

Ain't no loss, Jack. If she
boned your father, she's a ho.

is wrong with you?

you talking about?

off like a firecracker.

BRIAN: They gotta start putting
that straight in the wedding vows.

1834
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:09,739
I mean, love, honor, obey
and slob the damn knob.

1835
01:22:09,806 --> 01:22:11,074
For sure.

1836
01:22:13,543 --> 01:22:16,145
Hey, yo, fellas, you know what?
I've been doing some thinking.

1837
01:22:16,212 --> 01:22:18,815
We come out here,
we talk a whole lot of shit,

1838
01:22:18,882 --> 01:22:20,049
complaining about the honeys,

1839
01:22:20,116 --> 01:22:22,451
what they want,
what they don't want.

1840
01:22:22,518 --> 01:22:24,688
I mean, you know, maybe the
ladies ain't the problem.

1841
01:22:24,754 --> 01:22:26,856
You know what I'm saying?
Maybe we're the problem.

1842
01:22:26,923 --> 01:22:28,658
(SCOFFS) Get out of here, man.

1843
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:30,035
What the hell type of shit
are you talking about?

1844
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:31,327
Just feel me on this, D.

1845
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:32,596
All I'm saying is maybe we need

1846
01:22:32,662 --> 01:22:34,263
to check our own shit
just a little bit.

1847
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:37,366
If you don't come your
shabbado-for-electric- boogaloo ass on.

1848
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:42,271
Hey, whatever. You go home and spank
your monkey. That's some lonely shit.

1849
01:22:42,338 --> 01:22:44,240
That's why you got desert dick.

1850
01:22:45,508 --> 01:22:47,644
JACKSON: So, how's
BeBe doing, man?

1851
01:22:47,711 --> 01:22:49,412
She's terrible.

1852
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:52,816
I think she came by the apartment
this morning, crying and screaming.

1853
01:22:52,882 --> 01:22:54,718
I mean, carrying on.

1854
01:22:54,784 --> 01:22:56,929
Man, I had to run out the back
door just to avoid her ass.

1855
01:22:56,953 --> 01:22:58,421
She was acting
all kind of crazy, J.

1856
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,590
Well, I can't blame her,
Mr. Telephone Man.

1857
01:23:00,657 --> 01:23:02,434
You probably called her ass
collect, too, didn't you?

1858
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,560
You ain't funny, man.
Shut up. (LAUGHS)

1859
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:06,295
Then she followed
my black ass to work.

1860
01:23:06,362 --> 01:23:08,097
Had me hiding out
in the janitor's closet.

1861
01:23:08,164 --> 01:23:10,309
You're gonna have to stop doing
that shit, man. I'm serious.

1862
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:13,369
You owe that woman the respect of telling
her face-to-face what the deal is.

1863
01:23:13,436 --> 01:23:15,805
Man, I know this and I will,
but you not hearing me.

1864
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:18,574
BeBe was on some
different shit, J.

1865
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:21,344
Look, I'm gonna talk to her,
but she needs to chill out.

1866
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:22,988
I just need a little
more time, that's all.

1867
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:24,714
Yeah, a little time. All right.

1868
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:27,092
Yo, man, we're gonna get carjacked in
a minute. Where are you taking me?

1869
01:23:27,116 --> 01:23:30,119
Man, we got to get Brian's issued ass.
For what?

1870
01:23:30,186 --> 01:23:32,355
Man, his car is all jacked up.

1871
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:35,158
Shit, you know how many
times I told his punk ass

1872
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:36,559
to move up out
this neighborhood?

1873
01:23:36,626 --> 01:23:37,837
Nah, it's not the
neighborhood, man.

1874
01:23:37,861 --> 01:23:39,829
Some woman is stalking him.

1875
01:23:39,896 --> 01:23:42,298
Get the fuck out of here.
No. Yes, I'm serious.

1876
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:43,805
And the messed-up
part about it, man,

1877
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:45,534
he's messed over so many women,

1878
01:23:45,601 --> 01:23:46,961
he don't even know
which one it is.

1879
01:23:48,504 --> 01:23:50,606
SHEILA: Ooh, ugly! Ugly! Ugly!

1880
01:23:50,674 --> 01:23:52,776
These are not photos
I put in my magazine.

1881
01:23:52,842 --> 01:23:54,543
I don't know where
you got these from.

1882
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:58,414
Hire a good photographer. You're
in charge of hiring that.

1883
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:01,617
Could you guys excuse me
for a minute? Thank you.

1884
01:24:07,657 --> 01:24:08,892
(CLEARS THROAT)

1885
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:14,664
I just, uh, thought
I'd come by and say hi.

1886
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:18,567
No reason we can't
be civil to each other.

1887
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:24,540
Hey, for what it's worth, I'm sorry
about all those nasty things I said.

1888
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:27,076
I mean, we gotta be around
each other for the baby,

1889
01:24:27,143 --> 01:24:31,047
so, uh, I was hoping we could
be adults about it when we do.

1890
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,685
All right.

1891
01:24:35,752 --> 01:24:39,188
I went out last weekend with
my girlfriends to a club.

1892
01:24:39,255 --> 01:24:42,458
Kind of a freedom
celebration-type thing.

1893
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:45,628
Freedom?

1894
01:24:45,695 --> 01:24:47,230
I don't think
I should hear this.

1895
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,265
(STAMMERS) And this
guy asked me to dance.

1896
01:24:49,332 --> 01:24:52,936
What guy? Just some guy
and he asked me to dance

1897
01:24:53,002 --> 01:24:56,740
and I just started crying.
It freaked him out.

1898
01:24:56,806 --> 01:25:01,010
Then, you know, my girlfriends told
me it was natural to feel that way.

1899
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:03,747
And then they started telling
me stories about their exes.

1900
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:08,584
And, baby, these women have been disrespected
in ways you couldn't even imagine.

1901
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,054
And I'm sitting there,
I'm thinking to myself,

1902
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,689
"All my husband wanted
was to make love to me"

1903
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:15,391
"and to take care
of his mother,"

1904
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,426
and I just felt so stupid.

1905
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,910
What are you saying, Sheila?

1906
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:28,471
I'm saying I was wrong, Derrick.

1907
01:25:28,537 --> 01:25:30,439
And I love you so much.

1908
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:33,267
You mean the world to me, and I didn't
realize how much that was worth.

1909
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:39,348
You know, I...

1910
01:25:39,415 --> 01:25:41,450
I tried to hurt you by
bringing Mama to live with us

1911
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,661
without talking it
over with you.

1912
01:25:42,685 --> 01:25:43,820
Yes, you did.

1913
01:25:43,887 --> 01:25:45,154
Hey, I apologize.

1914
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:46,489
Okay.

1915
01:25:47,723 --> 01:25:50,526
And if it's okay with you,

1916
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:53,162
can I be your husband again?

1917
01:25:53,229 --> 01:25:58,601
Oh, baby, I forgot how cute
you are when you get mushy.

1918
01:25:59,335 --> 01:26:00,603
(MOANING)

1919
01:26:08,144 --> 01:26:10,179
Okay, wait, wait. Go lock the door.
Lock the door.

1920
01:26:10,246 --> 01:26:11,314
Lock the door.

1921
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,282
Don't you threaten me
with a good time.

(EXCLAIMS) Hell, no.

Goddamn.

What's up, fellas?

1931
01:26:49,785 --> 01:26:50,830
Hey, I like the paint job, man.

1932
01:26:50,854 --> 01:26:52,889
Yeah, it's kind of sweet, kid.

1933
01:26:52,956 --> 01:26:54,934
Come on, man. You always in your drawers.
Get dressed.

1934
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,893
All right, man. Let
me get out this suit.

1935
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,327
You gotta get a maid.

1936

For real.

1937
01:26:59,495 --> 01:27:01,430
Hey, I had one.
It didn't work out.

1938
01:27:01,497 --> 01:27:02,541
You had sex with her,
didn't you?

1939
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:04,500
Uh, she was fine.

Get down, get down, get down!

1942
01:27:09,405 --> 01:27:11,274
B, I told you to move
out the damn projects.

1943
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,808
Why you yelling at me, man?

1944
01:27:12,876 --> 01:27:14,386
I ain't the nut out there
shooting up the neighborhood.

arguing and call the cops.

and talk to her.

out like no punk.

that girl know how I feel.

01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:41,337
she won first place
in a marksman contest?

What?

Look, if she wanted to shoot us,

1974
01:28:06,595 --> 01:28:08,031
she would have shot us by now.

1975
01:28:08,097 --> 01:28:09,274

I want Terry!

to me for a minute, okay?

the person that you want,

01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,438
Yes, I would suck your dick with a midget
and a throw pillow attached to my ass.

2169
01:38:16,505 --> 01:38:19,675
You know, I'm gonna go.
I gotta go give shit. Okay.

2170
01:38:19,742 --> 01:38:21,544
You gotta go shit. (LAUGHING)

2171
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:23,822
See, it's all that messing with
them gold-digging booger bass.

2172
01:38:23,846 --> 01:38:25,480
That's what it is. (LAUGHS)

2173
01:38:25,548 --> 01:38:28,016
Try for big daddy. Come on now.

2174
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:30,953
Just bob and weave on the
ball head, champion.

2175
01:38:31,019 --> 01:38:33,188
Girl, I would suck your dick
till your head caved in.

2176
01:38:33,255 --> 01:38:35,057
I reject my pussy. Say it again.

2177
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:37,125
I reject my pussy. The pussy?

2178
01:38:37,192 --> 01:38:38,894
Say, "Hi, Barnabas." No.

2179
01:38:40,529 --> 01:38:43,365
(INDISTINCT)

2180
01:38:43,431 --> 01:38:46,501
Sheila, you got me hard as three
Jaguar payments. This is bullshit.

2181
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:50,072
Yeah, early for a fuck,
late for everything else.

2182
01:38:50,138 --> 01:38:52,074
Girl, it's good
for your complexion.

2183
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,853
You didn't think your mama's skin looks so
good 'cause she got Indian in her, do you?

2184
01:38:54,877 --> 01:38:56,645
Look, honey, I'll show
you my technique.

2185
01:38:56,712 --> 01:38:57,780
Okay, do it, do it, do it.

2186
01:38:57,846 --> 01:38:59,314
Give me that bottle.

2187
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,151
(LAUGHING) I can't!

2188
01:39:03,218 --> 01:39:06,054
That ain't no firewood
you messing with.

2189
01:39:06,121 --> 01:39:07,723
Stop when you smell the smoke.

2190
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:10,492
(WHOOPS) Misery is
a motherfucker, ain't it?

2191
01:39:10,559 --> 01:39:11,994
Girl, your mama
sucks so much dick,

2192
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,762
she's got kneepads
sewn on all her dresses.

2193
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:16,765
You could do it. Come on.

2194
01:39:16,832 --> 01:39:19,802
Don't be scared
of the one-eyed serpent.

2195
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:21,436
(YELLS)

2196
01:39:21,503 --> 01:39:24,106
Yes, I would suck your dick wearing
a seventh-grade jockstrap,

2197
01:39:24,172 --> 01:39:26,709
doing the ham bone to the
theme from Green Acres.

2198
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:29,144
You wouldn't have to use that
Noxzema if you do it right!

2199
01:39:29,211 --> 01:39:30,545
What? Oh!

2200
01:39:32,047 --> 01:39:33,882
You getting
some muscles, ain't ya?

2201
01:39:33,949 --> 01:39:36,628
If I had a picture of Queen Latifah taped
to my head and a sparkler in my ass.

2202
01:39:36,652 --> 01:39:37,886
Baby!

2203
01:39:38,654 --> 01:39:41,323
Oh! I'll be right back.

2204
01:39:41,389 --> 01:39:43,291
Your mama's a freak.

2205
01:39:43,358 --> 01:39:44,402
Hell, I'd have been your daddy,
but the line was too long.

2206
01:39:44,426 --> 01:39:47,162
Dead ho, question-mark ho.

2207
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:48,363
Have a good time.

2208
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:51,433
French? LOUISE: No, not French.
English!

2209
01:39:51,499 --> 01:39:52,835
You don't understand
none of that?

2210
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:54,569
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

2211
01:39:54,637 --> 01:39:56,905
I oughta kick that bitch's ass.

2212
01:39:56,972 --> 01:39:58,607
Eating a half bag of Pop Rocks

2213
01:39:58,674 --> 01:40:01,376
and watching the director's
cut of Dusty's Treehouse.

2214
01:40:01,443 --> 01:40:05,547
Hey, don't be scared. That ain't
no eclipse. It's just me.

2215
01:40:08,516 --> 01:40:09,952
(BOTH MOANING)

2216
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:14,757

2217
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:16,925

2218
01:40:21,363 --> 01:40:24,767
Oh! Suki, suki now.

Anybody else got some refelat...

2220
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:29,437
Anybody got some revelations?

2221
01:40:29,504 --> 01:40:32,607
I'm scared to zip up my pants. I will
fuck around and start to spark...

2222
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:36,478
(MUMBLING) What I'm
saying is, my dick...

2223
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:37,880

2224
01:40:39,848 --> 01:40:42,384
