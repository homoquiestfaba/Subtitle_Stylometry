1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,284
Life, as you know it,
is stealing from you.

2
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,116
Literally. Minute by minute,
surcharge by surcharge...

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,094
the ubiquitous convenience of modern
life is bleeding you dry.

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,158
Nickel by nickel.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,997
Chump change.

6
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,427
The dime you don't even bother bending
over to pick up on some sidewalk...

7
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,965
is the very same dime you get
"bent-over" for by all these "services. "

8
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,294
You call 41 1,
that'll cost you. 50c.

9
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,940
You want to actually PLACE that call,
that'll cost you an additional.49c.

10
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,849
That adds up
to guys like you and me.

11
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,644
By the end of the week, the day before
payday, I've got 20 bucks to my name.

12
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,112
But don't even think about trying
to withdraw your money.

13
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,513
It cost me $ 1. 50
to get my twenty dollars.

14
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,088
I only have $ 1 8. 50 after the freakin'
A TM takes its cut...

15
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,193
which means I don't have twenty
dollars, I have insufficient funds.

16
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,601
That's why I'm here!

17
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,966
Now, listen closely because
I'm about to tell you a secret.

18
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,359
How to beat the "system"...

19
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,606
and take charge of
the surcharge in life.

20
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,995
Shit! That hurts! Son of a...

21
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,572
-I couldn't care Iess you whinny Iittle...
-Whoa there skippy.

22
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,108
If I wanted more verbal abuse, I'd call
some customer service center somewhere.

23
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,705
Sorry, didn't catch that Iast part?

24
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,122
Was that, "Sorry for being a bitch...

25
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,423
I'II be nice now?"

26
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,324
Ouch! You...

27
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,806
-Ok, Iet's start over.
-Good idea.

28
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,967
What do you want?

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,676
-My twenty bucks.
-I think we covered that.

30
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,615
True.

31
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
So, what's your name?

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,082
Jason, Jason Taylor.
People call me Jinx though.

33
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,122
What's your name?

34
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,233
-Jessica.
-Jessica. Nice name.

35
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,059
You kind of Iook Iike a Jessica.

36
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,628
-Ok. So... what's next?
-What do you mean?

37
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,372
What are you going to do?

38
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,374
I don't know.

39
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,642
I mean, well, I don't know.

40
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,917
-You don't know?
-No, not exactly.

41
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,486
Not exactly?

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,855
What's next?
What is your next step?

43
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,079
i.e. Evaluate. Execute. Exit.

44
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,156
What is your plan?
Have you got a plan?

45
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,791
Did you ever think of devising
a plan in a situation Iike this?

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,193
Maybe you ought to have a plan.

47
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,230
-Oh, boy.
-You know. No! Oh, God...

48
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,983
What's this?

49
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,012
Oh, sorry about that.

50
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,758
That's what they call a cell phone.

51
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,956
-Thanks.
-What are you going to do?

52
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,796
-Um, hello?
-Hello?

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,601
-Hello.
-Hello.

54
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,375
-Hello? Can you here me?
-Who's this?

55
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,072
-I asked you first.
-Excuse me?

56
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,812
-I said, who is this?
-I heard what you said.

57
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,519
So, who is this,
to whom am I speaking with?

58
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,592
-More importantly, what do you want?
-I don't know.

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,188
-You don't know?
-My twenty bucks.

60
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,160
Let's start over,
let's just say my name is Simon.

61
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,024
Ok, good enough for me.

62
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,335
So, Simon, what's the deal?
How do we do this?

63
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,131
How do we do this?

64
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,908
Well...

65
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,904
you tell me what you want,
i.e. your demands.

66
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,341
Then I give you what's
called a counter-offer...

67
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,951
giving you part of what you want,
but not everything...

68
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,914
so I hold a decent
bargaining position...

69
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,725
to deliver what it is I want.
Got it?

70
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,357
-I don't think I like your attitude.
-That 'a boy...

71
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,895
now you're beginning
to get the feel!

72
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,961
I want my twenty bucks...

73
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,530
and safely get out of here!

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,766
What we have here
is a symbiotic relationship.

75
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,208
Now we're cooking 'cause you want out
of there and I'd Iove to be in there.

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,116
And in the spirit of negotiation...

77
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,686
I would Iike to see you dead...

78
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,747
and you'd Iike to get out safely...

79
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:01,493
so Iet's meet in the middle
and just have you come out.

80
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,895
-What do you say? Big boy.
-You're kind of brutally blunt...

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,260
and to tell you the truth,
it's a bit unsettling.

82
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,097
I'm not so sure about this.

83
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,471
Whatever. Do we have a deal?

84
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,873
I would love to accommodate you,
except the seeing me dead part.

85
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,139
But, I didn't lock this door...

86
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,469
it sealed itself when
the alarm went off...

87
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,576
and I don't know how to open it.

88
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,883
And that's my problem, how?

89
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,820
I'm trapped in a vault.

90
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,652
I want out! I want...

91
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,656
Mind if I speak with him?

92
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,821
-What?
-Mind if I speak with him?

93
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,098
Yeah, sure,
wait, no, I mean no.

94
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,359
What are you talking about?
You are not running the show.

95
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,638
-I am running the show now.
-Ok. You're running the show.

96
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,839
Simon, he's running the show now.

97
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,514
I said no talking on the phone.

98
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,243
Please tell her everything is fine.

99
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,434
Just wait for now.

100
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,682
He says everything is fine, just...

101
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,614
Wait. Everybody hold on a minute!

102
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,431
May I make a suggestion?

103
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,538
Fine. Why not?

104
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,000
Tell him I can open the door...

105
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,436
but you won't allow me...

106
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,612
to until he guarantees
you safe passage out.

107
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,646
She can open the door, but...

108
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,689
I heard her. It's a good plan.

109
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,351
I give you my guarantee. 100%.

110
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,456
Hold up here. How can you open this
ten-ton solid steel bank vault door...

111
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,331
and why should I trust you?

112
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,058
See that computer?

113
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,434
That particular computer is tied
into the entire security system...

114
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,811
of this and every other branch
of Union Federal...

115
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,347
why do you think
it's kept in a vault?

116
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,450
Hey, what am I gonna do to you?
It's not Iike I've got a gun or anything.

117
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,684
Fine.

118
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,766
It's called "exploding noema".

119
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,601
It's a theory of psychoanalysis
to describe the exact moment...

120
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,005
when the brain can't
reconcile the difference...

121
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,216
between its perception of what should
be versus the reality of what is.

122
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,309
Kinda Iike drinking from what you
thought was one thing...

123
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,919
you actually drink
cigarette butts and beer.

124
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,247
Well that moment should
be over now...

125
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,665
and your brain is facing the reality
that if you get up from that chair...

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,336
this Iittle gadget of yours will be
Iots of Iittle gadget pieces.

127
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,307
Stop!!! PIease. PIease.

128
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,379
That is our way out of here.
That is our key.

129
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,584
Literally.

130
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,309
Ok, now what?

131
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,476
We talk. You're a smart
and extremely capable woman.

132
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:28,152
I'd even go so far to say,
a serious force to be reckoned with.

133
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,014
You obviously know
what you are doing.

134
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,247
And I'II be honest, the only
authority I have here...

135
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,564
is a stolen Palm Pilot
and a roll of pretty durable tape.

136
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,098
But that's everything
now, isn't it?

137
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,999
So, you and I are going to talk.

138
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:50,206
You're going to give me frank and honest
answers without any attitude. Got it?

139
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,678
Yes. I do.

140
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,685
Ok then.

141
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,884
What's this all about?

142
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,581
She doesn't know.

143
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,747
-What was that?
-She doesn't know.

144
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,255
She's equipped with the codes, but
isn't briefed on what to do or the plan.

145
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,427
She's a hired gun.

146
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,169
-You're Iying.
-No. He's not.

147
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,005
-You're Iying.
-No. I'm not.

148
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,178
Ok then, now what?

149
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,944
What you're going to do is...

150
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,854
I was saying...

151
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,492
Look here you...

152
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,070
Ok, please, one moment.

153
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,999
Please... Iet's start over.

154
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,338
That's beginning to be
our theme 'round here.

155
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,667
So, shoot. T ell me
what I need to know.

156
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,140
Tell me how I can
get out of this vault...

157
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,245
in a way that serves
my best interest.

158
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,119
Namely alive.

159
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,526
Ok, there are key codes stored
in the Palm Pilot...

160
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,126
that's rather precariously
in your possession.

161
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,067
The codes are for the computer terminal
Iocked inside the vault with you...

162
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,097
and on that computer,
with the correct code...

163
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,236
is the central electronic automatic
Iocking control for the vault door.

164
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,666
And the master Iock-release...

165
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,809
for every safety-deposit box
you see around you.

166
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,711
That a' boy, now we're cooking
with gasoline.

167
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,254
Was that so hard? I mean really.

168
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,254
Yes. Yes, it was actually.

169
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,854
Shake it off Simon.

170
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,592
Now that we're a Iittle better informed
with a bit of an attitude adjustment...

171
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,798
Iet's revisit my original question.

172
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,862
How do we do this?

173
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,404
Not bad.

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,169
-Excuse me?
-The way you played that. Not bad.

175
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,799
Do you think I Iaid it
on too thick there in the end?

176
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,600
-You blew it.
-I thought you just said...

177
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,299
I know I did, but then you blew it.

178
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,649
I'm sorry, what's that?

179
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,716
I mean, could you feel it?
That moment?

180
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,618
You had Iife by the balls.
You were in charge.

181
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,063
Hey Simon. I'm gonna have
to call you back.

182
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,267
You see! There, again.
The spark. Living Iife!

183
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,331
You, just then. Hanging up.
You just did it.

184
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,676
Seriously. I mean that's how Iife
gets the better of us.

185
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,105
It ends up running rough-shod
over us in small doses.

186
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,436
For example,
why pay $1.50...

187
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,304
to have access to
your twenty bucks? Screw 'em!

188
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,150
Exactly!

189
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,483
Think about it. They put
in an ATM machine...

190
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,322
basically does the work of, I dunno,
dozen people or more per branch.

191
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,092
And?

192
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,025
So, the bank Iays these people off...

193
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,024
saving entire years worth of salary...

194
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,232
for dozens of people per bank,
per machine...

195
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,327
not to mention the money saved...

196
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,160
not paying these people's
insurance, benefits...

197
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,976
bonuses, pension,
welfare, taxes, nothing.

198
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,644
-Yeah?
-And for all this profit...

199
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,669
they have the audacity
to charge us $1.50...

200
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,711
every time we use their
machine for our money.

201
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,179
-And it doesn't stop there. Surcharges...
-Yeah.

202
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,677
-Service charges...
-Yeah.

203
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,027
Late fees, roaming fees...
Nickel and diming us to death.

204
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,416
I mean, "Roaming fees" in addition
to your phone bill on cell phones...

205
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,686
that are meant to roam?

206
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,194
That's why they call
them "mobile phones," right?

207
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,570
And Iate fees on DVDs that cost more
than it would to just buy the movie!

208
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,268
Crime by any other name.

209
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,679
It is a crime.
A crime of convenience.

210
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,777
We're in a state of
financial emergency!

211
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,883
-Hello?
-This is 91 1 Emergency.

212
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,320
Hey, it's me, I'm the one who
called just over a half-hour ago.

213
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,454
I'm ok, but I'm still locked
in the bank vault.

214
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,535
Brian DeGepse here.

215
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,991
This is 91 1 Emergency...

216
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,499
dispatch ready to patch
you through, officer.

217
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,843
Go for DeGepse.

218
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,148
This is Brian DeGepse, commanding
officer, Emergency Response unit...

219
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,616
-who am I speaking with?
-Jason Taylor, sir.

220
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,151
AIright Mr. Taylor, first,
I've been briefed...

221
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,093
but I need to know if
you are still safe and secure.

222
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,255
You could say I'm safe.

223
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,015
Now, outline the situation, please.

224
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,831
I'm safe because I'm IN the safe.

225
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,165
I got the joke. Sir.

226
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,808
I don't want to alarm you in any way,
but this is not a Iaughing matter...

227
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,137
there's nothing funny...

228
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,872
I'm sorry, did you just say,
"there's nothing funny...

229
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,281
about he sit onion?"

230
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,783
Excuse me?
Don't mess with me Mr. Taylor.

231
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,093
Yes, I can hear you.

232
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,000
Can you... ear... me... ow?

233
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,928
Ear what? Oh, hear you? No.

234
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,098
Can you hear me now?

235
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,467
Look, find the spot with
the best reception...

236
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,912
-Sorry.
-And don't move. Hear me?

237
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,678
I can't...

238
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,377
Look for a good zone.
I'll do that.

239
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,609
-What d'ya got?
-The guy is nobody.

240
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,817
Couple a parking tickets,
a DUI on a scooter...

241
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,557
-and he works at Starbucks.
-Right.

242
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,556
-Can you still hear me?
-Ok, I think I've got a good spot.

243
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,553
Hello? Are you ok?
Do we have any injuries?

244
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,403
I think we may have a fatality if
someone doesn't get his ass off me!

245
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,734
Fine. Fine. Everything's fine!

246
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,779
Nothing to see here.
Move it along.

247
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,904
I swear to God, I'II kill you...

248
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,042
with my hands tied behind
my back if you don't stop right now.

249
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,884
Is your safety compromised,
are you in danger?!

250
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,705
I've been "compromised" alright,
but he's the only one in danger!

251
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,191
Who the hell is that
and what's going on?!

252
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,647
I just had
to subdue the hostage sir.

253
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,291
Hostage? Who in the hell
do you have hostage and why?

254
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,920
She's one of "them" sir and I
didn't mean to take her hostage...

255
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,687
she was in here
when I ran for cover.

256
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,092
So, I forcibly
subdued her into custody...

257
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,028
and that's when the vault door
automatically closed on us.

258
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,700
What a crock.

259
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,437
That's a...

260
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,869
Hey that's...

261
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,235
yu... ear... me now?

262
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,114
I'm not buying that. At all.

263
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,088
-In fact, that was pathetic.
-Really?

264
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,016
Try crinkling a paper bag over the
mouth piece next time. Works great...

265
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,461
So, what's the situation?

266
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,884
We're fine, unless you count being
Iocked in a vault...

267
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,321
with armed
assholes outside the door.

268
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,269
-Excuse me?
-No, I didn't mean YOU people.

269
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,901
Excuse me?

270
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:34,710
PIease don't tell me you're black
or something. I'd never, I...

271
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,440
I am.

272
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,287
May I speak with him this time?

273
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,798
-Hello?
-Yeah? Hello.

274
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,233
You're going to have to forgive my
friend here. He's confused.

275
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,602
Just an innocent mistake.

276
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,638
He's really quite a sweet guy...

277
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,175
but he's having a really bad day.

278
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,637
You know those days?

279
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,810
I understand. This is a
stressful situation...

280
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,468
for any civilian, mam.

281
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,874
I've seen it all before.

282
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,949
I am sure you have.
Your job must be fascinating!

283
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,561
Well... excuse me Miss,
who exactly are you?

284
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,820
You see, there's been a huge
misunderstanding...

285
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,721
You see I was accessing
my safety-deposit box...

286
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,726
when the alarm went off...

287
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,070
I was so frightened
and flustered...

288
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,734
when Jinx here ran in and...

289
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,639
Wait...

290
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,941
-Who the hell is Jinx?
-That'd be me, sir.

291
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,434
PIease, continue.

292
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,804
So, in the ensuing confusion...

293
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,719
Jinx here mistook me for being
a part of the hold up...

294
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:54,152
did what a good man does
and took control of the situation.

295
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,514
But, we've cleared that up now...

296
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,329
and just want out of this awful vault
as soon as you can help us.

297
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,152
Ok miss, just hang in there.
Help is in progress.

298
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,660
Thanks.

299
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,131
I'm going to have
to call you back...

300
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,872
I think we're running
low on batteries.

301
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,907
So, what are you going to do?

302
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,647
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

303
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,027
How's it going?

304
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,292
Not good. Not very good.
Not good at all.

305
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:13,668
I'm talking impasse, a serious
catch-22, a "Mexican stand-off."

306
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,796
Basically... We're fucked!

307
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,069
How's that AIIexor working out?

308
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,242
I dunno.
Prozac, XENIX, Wilburton...

309
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,777
just another serotonin
up-take inhibitor.

310
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,956
My doc thinks this'II work better...
I don't think it's working at all.

311
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,831
In fact, it's got me a touch speedy.

312
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,500
No worries, the "situation"
is in hand.

313
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,098
Okay.

314
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,933
-Which situation?
-Never mind.

315
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,333
Go watch the guard.

316
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:57,805
Do you mind having a Iook
at my gun first?

317
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,473
-What?
-My gun.

318
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,045
I think it's jammed again.
I took apart the clip-Ioader...

319
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,477
firing pin,
and reassembled the repeater...

320
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,741
But it's still jamming.

321
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,488
-And then you know...
-Just, go pretend to guard the guard.

322
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,759
No problem. Will do.

323
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,669
Shit.

324
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,939
It's about time!

325
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,844
Thank you...

326
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,506
that tape was really
beginning to kill my wrists.

327
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,678
I always keep my end of the deal.
A show of good faith, right?

328
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,755
So, what are we going to do here?

329
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,619
I don't know,
what are we going to do?

330
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,589
Seems Iike we're both
Iiving now, huh?

331
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,027
A bit on the edge... for me.

332
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,395
But I gotta admit,
I kind of Iike the view.

333
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,364
Living?

334
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,441
What is it that you Iive to do?

335
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,783
As far as I can tell, this is it.

336
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,177
You don't always get to choose the
monumental moments in your Iife.

337
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
They choose you.

338
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,493
And when they do,
you take what you can get.

339
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,304
-Hello.
-Hello.

340
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,597
-Hello.
-Hello, can you hear...

341
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,010
-Yeah, I was just saying hello.
-Funny.

342
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,740
-Not really.
-What the fuck's going on?

343
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,713
He's got the codes.

344
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,579
Okay. How about you?

345
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,354
I'm tied up.

346
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,730
So, here's what you're going to do.

347
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,052
You're gonna get me
safe passage out of here.

348
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,435
We'II talk terms Iater.

349
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,236
A show of good faith right?

350
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,112
I always keep my end of the deal.

351
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,779
What are you gonna do now?

352
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,759
-I think I just did it.
-Yeah?

353
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,557
Yeah.

354
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,171
Officer DeGepse here.
How're you two holding up?

355
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:43,103
I'm not holding up anything.
That'd be the guys outside the vault.

356
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,618
Okay, then, what's your status?

357
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,345
I think my status and your status
are the same status.

358
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,677
Sort of stuck in a status.

359
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,319
Still locked in a vault.
Unable to get out.

360
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,716
Surrounded by armed robbers
who would love to get in.

361
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,050
Even if they could get into the
vault, they certainly can't get out...

362
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,193
because they're surrounded by you
who would love to throw them in prison.

363
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,726
Which I don't think
is part of their plan.

364
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,500
That seem about right to you, sir?

365
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,863
Fuck!

366
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,066
Yeah, that sounds right.

367
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,067
Well, hang in there,
while we continue to try...

368
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,072
to establish communications
with the suspects.

369
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,243
You want help?

370
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,902
Thank you but we have
the matter well in hand.

371
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,740
Do you have their phone number?

372
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,816
No. They usually try
to establish contact with us...

373
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,454
some time around this point.

374
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,027
Maybe you should just call them.

375
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,265
Thank you for your advice...

376
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,967
but we'II have to wait for them
to communicate with us.

377
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,828
-Okay?
-All right...

378
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,866
but if you need the numberjust
holler and I'll give it to you.

379
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,718
I saw them leaving.

380
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,424
Not anything particular
Not suspicious.

381
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,925
It's just that... he...

382
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,692
What was that?

383
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,768
It's just... he was kind of hot.

384
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,004
Any new developments?

385
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,270
Right.

386
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,715
Hello. DeGepse again.

387
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:36,053
-Hey, there, what's up?
-You said you have their phone number?

388
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,256
Yes. Yes, sir.
That's affirmative, sir.

389
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,058
You want it now?

390
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,369
Yes. That would be helpful.

391
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,510
-You got a pen, pencil?
-Just give me the number.

392
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,796
Uh, it's 367-9389.

393
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,805
337-9389. Got it.

394
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:02,715
No, no, no. It's 367-9389.

395
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,850
It's a six...

396
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,719
31 0 area code. Ask for Simon.

397
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,258
Simon. That's his name?

398
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,655
I asked the same exact question.
I think he's using a fake name.

399
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,165
We're not too worried
about that right now, are we?

400
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,566
I guess not.

401
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,067
Yeah. Anyway, ask for Simon.
Tell him Jinx gave you the number.

402
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,137
I'II do that.

403
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,114
Fuck.

404
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,076
I saw that.

405
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,285
That is why I got a good Iook at him.

406
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,793
-Distinguishing features?
-Don't you have something better to do?

407
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,558
He's calling Simon.
Keep him busy for a while.

408
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,867
Good. We can use that time.

409
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,004
So what's the deal?
What's they key to all this?

410
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,209
You know, what is it?

411
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,403
Well, first of all,
it's not keys, it's codes.

412
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,273
That's the deal.

413
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,506
I thought I was getting
the hang of this.

414
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,455
I didn't exactly major
in felony philosophy.

415
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,993
Okay. Well, you see all these
safety deposit boxes.

416
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,483
Each one belongs
to an individual bank customer.

417
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,958
Not the typical sentimental valuables,
love letters, or some kids Play Do art.

418
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,898
This is a central bank.

419
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,170
They hold all the shit people
want to keep safe.

420
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,900
The only problem is...

421
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,674
you have to individually break in
to every to box to get the contents.

422
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,707
Well, we've got a choice.

423
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,376
We can try and physically
break into every box...

424
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,548
or we can electronically
break into one box.

425
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,123
Right.

426
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,558
Hey, whoa there. Chatty.

427
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,189
Professor Felony...

428
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,003
giving a master's Iock Iecture.

429
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,476
You care to elaborate a bit.

430
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,303
-We have our ways.
-And what way would that be?

431
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,176
-Ways.
-Ways? Just ways?

432
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,112
Yeah, I'm feeling
pretty confident now.

433
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,876
-We just got 'em, okay?
-No, it's not okay.

434
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,790
It's not okay at all.

435
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,424
This so solid plan of yours,
it just went south. Didn't it?

436
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,290
I am being held hostage in a vault...

437
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,151
conspiring to do God knows...

438
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,036
what with my captor-slash-you know,
partner. Whatever you are.

439
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,991
I don't what I'm doing. I don't even
know what I'm partners in...

440
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,909
except sharing a Iocked vault.

441
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,001
Don't "huh" with me. I'm
supposed to be the "huh" guy.

442
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,451
I'm supposed to be the one who's
clueless about how to rob a bank not you.

443
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,688
My end of the deal was to get
your ass out of here. Your alibi.

444
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,950
And, if you haven't noticed...

445
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,552
we're a far cry from two
city blocks out of this mess.

446
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,122
Which just so happens to be the
missing part of your full-proof plan.

447
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,150
In return, you provide a wealth
of criminal knowledge...

448
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,660
from your B.A. degree
in Bachelor of Armed Robbery.

449
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,471
So that's the deal. And if that's not
the deal, then we have no deal.

450
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,670
So, deal with it.

451
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,539
You hungry?

452
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:25,079
I was stopping to get a bite
and I stopped at the ATM.

453
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,523
My twenty bucks.

454
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,562
Sweetie, you must
be running on fumes by now.

455
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,302
Yeah. I... I am, thank you.

456
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,011
Now, seriously,
where did you get the codes?

457
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,306
Come on. Where did they come from?

458
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,546
Seriously?
Seriously, I don't know.

459
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,486
-How does that work?
-I'm just a hired gun...

460
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,918
The codes were texted to Simon...

461
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,087
and they were beamed to my phone.

462
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:09,225
Who texted? You mean someone
else sent the codes?

463
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,062
Some guy.
It's all very anonymous these days.

464
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,528
It's the best way to
do business. You know, it's safe.

465
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,259
If you don't know anything about them.
They don't know anything about you.

466
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,971
You can't turn each other in.

467
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,242
We're freelancers. Temps, of sorts.

468
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,140
You sound Iike you just
answered a help wanted ad.

469
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,834
It's exactly Iike you answered
a help wanted ad.

470
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,683
Off the Internet actually.

471
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,015
What do you think half those useless
blogs are really about?

472
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,616
You need somebody to do a job...

473
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,287
you need plausible deniability.

474
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,888
You post a topic.
Pre-arranged site.

475
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,990
Seemingly meaningless, random.

476
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,218
You don't think we're a bunch
of disorganized thugs...

477
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,203
in a hideaway, do you?

478
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,256
No, I guess I never really
thought about it.

479
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:52,698
Exactly. Who's going to monitor the
Duran Duran fan forum chat room...

480
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,201
when there's real crime
out on the streets.

481
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,648
Did you just say Duran Duran?

482
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,342
Yep.

483
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,620
Why not Zepplin?

484
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,576
Everybody Zepplin is a forum
for CIA counter-terrorism.

485
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,814
You gotta be kidding me.
Zepplin are spooks...

486
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,119
and Duran Duran are an eighties,
pretty-boy...

487
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,968
bad ass crime syndicate?
That is just not right.

488
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,837
No, it's absolutely true.
If someone posts "Looking for...

489
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,597
"A View To Kill, "...

490
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,171
that means "Assassin Wanted."

491
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,343
If someone posts
"Are You Hungry Like the Wolf'...

492
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,176
that means hired hands for a bank job.

493
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,239
And so on.

494
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,452
So you're saying Duran Duran...

495
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,049
is at the center of an international
crime syndicate.

496
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,760
I seriously doubt Nick Rhodes or
Simon Le Bon are actually involved...

497
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,665
But it's not a bad place to hide,
now is it?

498
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,899
Did you just say "Simon"?

499
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,668
Yeah, see. I told you.

500
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,403
-This is weird.
-Not really.

501
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:05,644
I mean, forget about
porn sites and dot coms.

502
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,347
Crime really is what pays.

503
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,337
And the Internet business
is booming.

504
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,414
You just can't buy a stock,
you have to steal it.

505
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,392
Okay, fine. Whatever.
But why Duran Duran?

506
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,792
Why?

507
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,292
Why not? Anyway.

508
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,266
Anyway. Simon gets the codes.
We get in here.

509
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,061
They hold the place down while
I do my computer work.

510
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,427
The boxes are open. We grab and go.

511
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,763
So the guy who sent
the codes gets a cut, huh?

512
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,575
It's almost civil really.

513
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,836
Exchange a few numbers
for a percentage.

514
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,478
It's just a surcharge
of a different name, I guess.

515
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:45,820
Well, this particular guy
just wanted a PIN number.

516
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,849
PIN number?

517
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,985
AII I want to know
is who gave you my number...

518
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,782
That's not important right now.

519
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,619
What's important is the safety
of the people you have inside.

520
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,489
Us safely resolving
this situation.

521
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,064
Whatever.
Jinx gave them up, didn't he?

522
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

523
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:09,206
Cut the crap! That Iittle punk
gave you my cell number. I know it.

524
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,938
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

525
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,714
Do you think I'm an idiot, huh?

526
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,809
You're going to tell me you
triangulated my cell phone number...

527
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:23,283
without knowing my TTY frequency
or even carrier for that matter?

528
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,729
Just admit it!
Jinx gave you my number.

529
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,061
You're only on the Iine because
it's the only move you've got.

530
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,195
You can't resolve the situation.
And worse yet, worse yet...

531
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:41,809
a civilian knows more about
what's going on then you do.

532
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,381
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

533
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,241
Under no circumstances...

534
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,017
am I authorized to disclose
that information.

535
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,158
But I'd be happy to exchange myself
for a safe hostage release.

536
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,686
Then we can discuss
this matter further.

537
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,374
-My God!
-What the hell was that?

538
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,742
GIock 1 9 semiautomatic.
That's not good.

539
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,485
-You can't.
-Oh, you're right.

540
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,420
Listen, Iisten.

541
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,517
Let's take this down
a few notches all right?

542
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,435
That get your attention, officer?

543
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,396
Listen, I hear you.

544
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,998
Now, I said...

545
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:50,375
I said tell me
who gave you this number!

546
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,648
If you want to see...
Fuck! Hold on.

547
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,752
We're holding.

548
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,270
We're holding.
No one's doing anything.

549
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,586
No, I mean hold on I got another
call coming in.

550
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,285
Hello.

551
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,386
-What the hell was that?
-That wake you up, did it?

552
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,657
You shut it. I'm the one asking
the questions here.

553
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,519
If you ever want inside
here and me out...

554
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,525
you're gonna tell me
what the hell that was.

555
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,299
That was a GIock...

556
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,691
Your phone just broke up on me.
I missed that Iast part.

557
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,165
Don't even start getting
attitude with me.

558
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,942
I happen to know exactly
what kind of gun that was.

559
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,473
I want to know what's going on.

560
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,882
That was me.

561
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,369
Fuck! I don't think that was me.

562
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,651
I think you've got a call coming in.

563
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,259
I do. Hold on. Hello.

564
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,313
We heard gun shots.
Is everyone all right?

565
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,990
Yeah, we're fine in here.
I don't know about outside.

566
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,624
I'm trying to find out.

567
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,897
What? Are you talking to Simon?

568
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,754
Yeah, he's on the other Iine.

569
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,864
Aren't you supposed to be
on the phone with Simon?

570
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,001
I am. I was. I'm on hold.

571
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,233
Hold on a second. I'II flash you in.

572
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,872
No, no, that's not a good idea.

573
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,303
-Simon, are you still there?
-Yeah, I'm here.

574
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,840
Great. Hold on.

575
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,055
-Hello.
-DeGepse here.

576
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,823
I think everyone's on the Iine.
Is everyone here?

577
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,857
-Here.
-I'm here.

578
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,053
AII right. I think we should
all try to work together here.

579
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,319
And work on some issues, okay?

580
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,164
-I think that...
-I think we...

581
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,069
-I think that...
-I think we...

582
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,637
Come on guys.
Don't get shy now.

583
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,865
Simon, is there something
you wanted to say to the officer?

584
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,569
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,294
You see, Officer DeGepse,
Simon says he's sorry.

586
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,939
-Wait. I didn't mean...
-Simon, shut it.

587
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,848
Officer DeGepse, do you
accept Simon's apology?

588
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,675
-Officer Degepse?
-Yes?

589
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,912
Good, you see. Simon apologized
and the officer graciously accepts.

590
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,948
No. No.

591
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,477
Wait!

592
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,882
As Iong as we're making progress...

593
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,090
I say we move ahead
and release a few hostages...

594
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,520
just as a show of good faith.

595
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,968
I will gladly nominate myself just
to get the ball rolling.

596
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,056
What do you guys say?

597
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,392
Now wait just a second.
There's ways to do this.

598
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,706
No, I think it's a good idea.
I'm all for it.

599
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,057
Who is that?

600
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,893
I don't know. Aren't you on the phone
with everybody who's anybody around here?

601
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,156
-What does the Caller ID say?
-I don't have Caller ID.

602
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,532
Answer it. Wait, wait, wait.
Just a second.

603
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,266
Hello.

604
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,798
Hello? Is anybody there?

605
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,574
-Who is this?
-You're the one who called. Who is this?

606
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,183
Who was it?

607
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,751
I don't know. Wrong number, I guess.

608
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,885
Hello?

609
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,056
Hello?

610
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,297
Okay, he just hung up on me twice.
That's just rude.

611
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,003
Hello. Hello?

612
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,972
Are you still there?

613
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,609
Hey, guys, I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

614
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,238
Just keep chatting amongst yourselves.

615
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,309
So?

616
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,149
Hey, don't Iook at me.

617
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,458
AII right, then.

618
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,263
Nick here. What's taking so long?

619
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,717
Hey, it's the guy you
keep hanging up on.

620
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,498
-Shit.
-So, your name's Nick, huh?

621
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,669
Maybe.

622
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,269
-Well, is it?
-No.

623
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,076
Oh, weird, total Deja vu right now.

624
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:50,181
Never mind. So, uh. Are you
Jessica's boyfriend or something?

625
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,312
Look. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

626
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,053
You have the wrong number.

627
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,888
-You called me.
-Right, then.

628
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,763
Uh, I had the wrong number.
Sorry to trouble you. Bye.

629
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,825
Hey, stop calling me.

630
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,399
-No.
- What?

631
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,071
No. I said, no.

632
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,378
You can't just say no.

633
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:22,778
Yes, I can. No. You see?
No. No. No, no, no...

634
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,284
Who are you?

635
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,343
I'm glad you asked. Jason Taylor.
People call me Jinx.

636
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,986
So it seems Iike I've taken
the first step.

637
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,894
"I'm on a hunt down after you."

638
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,795
Nick. Nick Rhodes.

639
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,560
What's going on here? Who are you?

640
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,069
What do you know? How do you know?
What's the deal?

641
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,235
That's been my theme ever since
I Iocked myself in this fricking vault.

642
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,542
You? You're in the vault?

643
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,177
Yeah, that's what I said.
Am I getting bad cell reception?

644
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,908
I know a spot up in the corner
if you really want me to go up there.

645
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,650
Who are you?

646
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:03,349
Jinx. And I think we've covered that.
Who are you? Nick.

647
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,388
God!

648
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,093
What?

649
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,633
What?

650
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,235
He did it again.
I hate this guy.

651
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,105
If I see your men any closer
than twenty-five yards...

652
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,070
I'm putting holes in these
walking body bags.

653
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,602
I hear you. I hear you.

654
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,814
Excuse me, but I think you'd better
answer that. It could be Jinx.

655
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,219
Yeah, yeah, You're right. Hold on.

656
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,616
Hello, Jinx. How's it going?

657
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,557
I think we're making real
progress out here.

658
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,093
Hey, Jinxy. Is that you?

659
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:46,897
Is there anything you might want
to tell or say to me?

660
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,648
Anything to tell? Like an update?

661
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,475
Something like that.

662
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:09,191
Things are going fine. Just fine.
maybe a Iittle bit behind schedule.

663
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,992
Anything in particular
slowing things up?

664
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,366
-Like?
-Some guy locking himself in the vault.

665
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,497
Who somehow has full knowledge
of our identities...

666
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:28,763
our cell numbers, and has
the ability to dial 91 1.

667
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,270
Handing you a first-class
pass to ass class...

668
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,651
in the federal penitentiary.
That sort of thing.

669
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,013
Okay, we do have
one small dilemma.

670
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,717
Quite similar to the one
you just described.

671
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,956
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

672
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,129
Not really.

673
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:53,635
Okay, is there anything else you not
like to add, then that I should know?

674
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:58,640
Well, you know the guy you just,
you just described.

675
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:09,015
He's taken one of our people
hostage in the vault.

676
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,411
And uh... We're uh...

677
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,221
We're Iocked out with no way in.

678
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,728
Thank you.
I truly appreciate your candor.

679
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,068
And a tactical analysis?
What would that currently be?

680
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,472
-Fucked.
-Great.

681
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,928
Okay, let me get back
to you with a backup plan...

682
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,708
that should solve a few problems.

683
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,647
Really? That'd be great.

684
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,416
Maybe not.

685
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,530
-Hello.
-I want to make a deal.

686
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,003
A deal.

687
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,272
I do.

688
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:17,403
As I figure it, 50% of something is
a lot better than 1 00% of nothing.

689
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,572
Yeah... and?

690
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,176
And frankly, "nothing"
is all I've got right now.

691
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,044
So, what do you want?
What's it going to take?

692
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,124
You know what. Hold that thought.
I'II be right back.

693
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,690
-Hello.
-I want to make a deal.

694
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,085
Come again?

695
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,966
I think we may have gotten
off on the wrong foot.

696
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,960
I'd like to start over
and introduce myself. I'm Nick.

697
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,266
I'm calling to
cut you in on this thing.

698
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,598
So a deal, okay.

699
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:55,779
So what's the deal with a deal, Nick?
It is "Nick," isn't it?

700
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,579
I apologize for the pseudonym.

701
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:03,782
It's not that I don't trust you,
it's just sort of an occupational hazard.

702
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,394
Oh yeah, I...
I understand. I get it.

703
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,030
It's not Iike my name's
really "Jinx" either.

704
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,761
It isn't?

705
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,599
No. It is. It is my name.

706
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,206
Hey that's okay.
Perfectly valid.

707
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,327
Anyway, what can I do for you, Nick?

708
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:25,077
Jinx, we have a bit
of a situation here.

709
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,475
And I think it's down to you
and me to figure this thing out.

710
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,653
You and me? Okay.

711
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,086
I'm going to put the cards
on the table.

712
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,716
You have something I need.
Information.

713
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,664
Information my associates are
no longer in a position to offer.

714
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,219
I propose we adapt, evolve,
grow some balls.

715
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:50,798
Walk ourselves out of this quagmire.
I'll cut to the chase. What do you want?

716
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,532
My twenty bucks.

717
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,070
I'm sorry.
Did you say twenty bucks?

718
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,374
I don't want to be rude...

719
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,382
but I think you might want
to revise that number.

720
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,453
You think? Like what?

721
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,789
Like look around you.

722
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,686
I'd add a few zeroes to that
twenty-dollar figure of yours.

723
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,165
And I just walk out with everything.

724
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,585
You don't want any
piece of this money?

725
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,868
All I need is for you to walk
over to the computer terminal...

726
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,598
and generate a PIN number
for me. Easy as pie.

727
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,739
Same arrangement
I had with them.

728
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,371
"If it ain't broke
don't fix it, " right?

729
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,779
"If it ain't broke..."

730
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,849
Right. Yeah.

731
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,191
So, I walk.

732
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,925
And you have no problem selling
out Simon and Jessica.

733
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,160
And whoever else just
for a Iittle info?

734
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,287
This must be a pretty
valuable PIN number.

735
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,967
Things change.
We adapt, right?

736
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,801
-Bullshit.
-What?

737
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,009
I said bullshit.

738
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,247
You had no intention of Ietting these
guys out of here! Did you, Nick?

739
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,776
What are you talking about?

740
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,472
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Right?

741
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,175
In fact, that reminds me
of something a friend once said.

742
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,616
"Breaking" into a bank
is what screws you...

743
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,531
because "breaking in" takes time
and time is what gets you caught.

744
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,063
So how do you rob a bank
without "breaking in?"

745
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,058
Unlock everything at once?
Fast and efficient?

746
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,269
Use this computer, a few codes,
then grab and go?

747
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,200
I don't think so. If you knew
enough to get these codes...

748
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,565
and what to do with...

749
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,448
then you knew this vault door would
seal up as soon as an alarm was tripped.

750
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,446
You're trapped.

751
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:47,416
So, while the codes seem Iike a good
idea, they're nothing more than bait...

752
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,319
just means to some other end for you.

753
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,463
In other words,
the codes are bullshit.

754
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,429
It's really about
that innocent Iittle PIN...

755
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,128
which I'm betting is worth
a lot more than anything else in here.

756
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,574
But the only way to get
that PIN is in this vault.

757
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,036
I don't know, just a working theory.

758
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,975
All right there, Columbo...

759
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,480
you seem to be answering a lot of unasked
questions for an "innocent" bystander.

760
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,448
What the hell are you getting at?

761
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,281
Hey, it's not for nothing...

762
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,721
but I didn't ask to be Iocked
in this frickin' vault!

763
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,654
AII I ever wanted was
my twenty bucks but no!

764
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,726
Some greedy bastard
decided it was a great idea...

765
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,758
to increase his
bank's profit margin...

766
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,760
fire tellers to
lower corporate costs...

767
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,433
close branches, install
endless A TM machines...

768
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,591
surcharging my ass
to kingdom-come...

769
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,032
until I can't afford
my own twenty bucks.

770
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,809
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

771
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:45,902
I'm glad you asked.

772
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,872
"Insufficient Funds"
means I had to walk...

773
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,808
my ass into the only Union Federal
I could find to withdraw my money...

774
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,712
but it was already having a large
withdrawal made, i.e. being robbed...

775
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,147
which was perfectly fine by me...

776
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,979
until some jack-ass pointed
a gun at me.

777
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,145
This guy gets all jumpy,
tries to blow my head off...

778
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,449
his gun jams and I run
for cover in this vault...

779
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,424
which proceeds to lock behind me
locking me in this vault...

780
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:09,235
where I literally run into some super
hot chick whom I'm trapped with...

781
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,395
which sounds great except she
proceeded to punch me in the face...

782
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,535
ruining my otherwise
wonderfully boring day...

783
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,478
and wasting my pedantically
precious time.

784
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,373
Bummer.

785
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,985
So screw it, screw service
fees and screw you!

786
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,179
You and all the corporate
"convenience" criminals...

787
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,748
are equally fucked
in your high- tech heists.

788
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,113
You can't keep screwing
guys Iike me...

789
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,288
and then add a surcharge for it.

790
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,156
I'm taking charge of the surcharge.

791
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,126
In short, blow me. I want answers.

792
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,430
You are having a bad day.
Please, go on.

793
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:49,004
The real question is, how do you get in
this vault without getting trapped in it?

794
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,866
My guess is, you don't do it at all.

795
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,734
You don't care...

796
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,000
if your anonymously
hired guns get trapped...

797
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,336
as Iong as they are in the vault.

798
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,445
Because as Iong as
you had someone in the vault...

799
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,888
you had what you wanted, almost.

800
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,511
-So, fuck you, I'm hanging up.
-No. Fuck you!

801
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,016
You're not hanging up.
You know why?

802
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,983
Because you don't have your
four precious Iittle numbers.

803
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,418
-What the...?
-Jessica. Name's Jessica.

804
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,093
I'm one of the ones you
set up to screw.

805
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,031
-Yeah. It almost hurts, doesn't it?
-What?

806
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,328
I'm glad you asked,
it's called "Exploding Noema."

807
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,591
It's a theory about the moment...

808
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,996
you can't reconcile
the difference...

809
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,363
between your perception
of what should be...

810
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,300
versus the reality of what is

811
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,407
I find, completely screwing someone
with a classic double-cross...

812
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,304
only to find they're
now your only hope...

813
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,570
will pretty much
explode your noema.

814
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,407
But, I'm betting that
moment's past now and...

815
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,323
I'm betting you're more
in the dealing mood.

816
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,856
You want your precious PIN?
There's gonna be a surcharge.

817
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,130
-So, what's it going to be Nick?
-Okay.

818
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,647
Jessica, are you okay?

819
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,150
I'm fine.

820
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,913
I think someone cut
the power in here.

821
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,250
You think?

822
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,025
Who cut the power then,
and why, what's going on...

823
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,588
you know, that sort of thing?

824
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,864
I don't really know,
but it's not good.

825
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,971
Nick, we're gonna have
to call you back.

826
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,139
We have to fix this. I don't have
a handle on this whole thing...

827
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,103
but it's pretty apparent that
our fate and any possible fortune...

828
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,049
is in that computer.

829
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,616
Nobody panic, okay?

830
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,981
Let me make a phone call.

831
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,627
-Oh, hey there.
-Hello?

832
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,386
Hey, what happened?

833
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,465
I don't know, I've been on hold
this whole time with you.

834
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,257
Are you trying to keep me waiting?

835
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,421
I have to admit...

836
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,272
nice negotiation tactic...

837
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,003
you had me going there for a while.

838
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,510
No. I just forgot about you.

839
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,045
How did you forget about me?

840
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,250
I was... busy, that's all.

841
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,981
Busy? You're Iocked in a vault.

842
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,751
What the fuck could you be doing
to keep you busy?

843
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,752
You worry me now, Jinx.

844
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,993
Oh, I'm sorry
really. Please, don't worry.

845
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,656
Officer DeGepse was just
talking me through this crisis.

846
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,695
It's been very stressful for me.
I didn't let him know anything really.

847
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,130
I figured you'd want me
to keep him waiting while you...

848
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,599
And I make some sort of a deal.

849
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,669
Okay. Okay.

850
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,443
Good thinking Jinxy.
That was good.

851
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:47,479
AII right, it's you and me.
About that deal...

852
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,711
Well, first, what happened?

853
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,354
It's frickin' dark in here.
I think they cut the power.

854
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,422
Don't sweat it. They just do this
to be intimidating.

855
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,728
First order of business
is that we reach an agreement.

856
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,462
Then we'II negotiate with the cops...

857
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,640
free some hostages in exchange
for putting the power back on...

858
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,634
Hold on. Hold on.

859
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,873
Hold on I think my batt...
Fuck!

860
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,412
Fuck! Fuck!

861
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,047
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

862
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,750
Fuck! Fuck!

863
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,698
Think he's trying
to communicate with us?

864
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,415
Hello?

865
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,452
Officer DeGepse here.
How are you two holding up?

866
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,317
Oh, hey there. Yeah, we're okay.

867
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,081
Any change of status in there?

868
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,878
It's pretty dark in here.

869
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,226
Eyes are just starting to adjust.

870
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,193
-Uh, not really.
-Good. Good.

871
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,732
I need you to sit tight and...

872
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,799
We need him to turn
the power back on or we're screwed.

873
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,159
Sorry, what was that?
I missed the Iast part.

874
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,872
I said, do you have any other
way of contacting Simon?

875
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,842
He says he has no way
of contacting Simon?

876
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,642
-Why?
-Good question. Uh. Why?

877
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:27,587
Because this Simon character has tossed
his phone for no apparent reason...

878
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,915
his actions are growing
increasingly irrational...

879
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:34,556
and I would like to prevent any
regrettable incidents before they occur.

880
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,692
Unfortunately, I now have no
way of contacting him.

881
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,496
AII right, we'II see what we can do.

882
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,464
What do we do?

883
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,499
We can't ask for Simon's
help because...

884
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,931
we'd have to make him a deal.

885
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,265
And making a deal with Simon
is pointless...

886
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,740
because Iike it or not,
at this point, he's shit out of Iuck.

887
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,885
We could... ask for Simon?

888
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,316
DeGepse here.

889
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,456
I got through to Simon.
He has a few demands.

890
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,521
He says he's finished
negotiating and...

891
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,196
unless you give him something,
you know, as a show of good faith.

892
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,861
Go ahead, what are his demands?

893
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,833
One. He wants a civilian chartered
helicopter on the roof within 1 5 minutes.

894
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,466
Two. He walks with half the money
and no one gets hurt.

895
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:29,270
And three, he wants the power on so
he can get the show on the road.

896
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,379
Personally, I wouldn't give
that schizoid asshole anything...

897
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,243
unless it was something
totally useless, Iike...

898
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,555
I don't know, like turning
the power back on.

899
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:41,457
I'II try to convince him that turning
the power on is, just a start.

900
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:47,029
May as well try, he sounds desperate
and willing to throw it all away.

901
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,702
You say he sounds desperate?

902
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,706
You really think he's to
the point of throwing it all away?

903
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,764
I told you they were trying
to tell us something...

904
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,303
with that whole "chucking-the-cell
phone-at-your-head" thing.

905
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,186
Tell them the power will
be back on in a minute.

906
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,960
*TIP 8
DON'T GET GREEDY*

907
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,802
That's a start. Get what's
his name back on the phone...

908
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,371
and I'II get this thing booted up
and ready for whatever.

909
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,939
Hello.

910
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,409
So, Iisten up.

911
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,903
Believe me when I tell you
this whole thing is going south.

912
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,637
So, whatever it is
you were planning to do...

913
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,110
I'd suggest we do it...

914
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,680
and whatever deal
we need to make...

915
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,282
I suggest we make it...

916
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,284
or none of us are going
anywhere or getting anything...

917
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:49,354
anytime soon, except maybe ten
to twenty in San Quentin.

918
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,658
So, what's it going to be?

919
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,726
Good to hear from you too.

920
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,196
Dude. Shut it.

921
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,891
The police cut the power.
No power, no computer...

922
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,899
no computer, no point.

923
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,936
You count on that Iittle hic-up?

924
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:06,404
God. Really?
No. I didn't.

925
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,140
Well, you can thank me Iater.
It's back up for the moment.

926
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,873
Unless you tell me what our Iittle
team here is about to do...

927
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,245
this whole thing's going
to be over before it began.

928
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,591
Is the computer on?

929
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:19,881
I believe we're good.

930
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:23,832
Enter that number in the "Personal
Identification Number" sub-menu.

931
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,534
In that page, you'll see four digits
corresponding to an A TM card.

932
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,260
Click that option...

933
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,299
and read me the four digits
that appear in the box.

934
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,970
It is that easy.

935
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,240
-No. It's not.
-I'm sorry?

936
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,006
Last time I checked,
there's no "I" in "team"...

937
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,214
or "felony grand theft
of a federal reserve bank."

938
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,520
You get that number
and you're gone.

939
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,027
That PIN number belongs
to an ATM card I don't have...

940
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,052
which belongs to an account I don't
have. So unless you can find...

941
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,659
a way to share your Iittle
high-tech heist you're stuck.

942
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,956
I suggest you begin by telling
me what we're stealing.

943
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,029
And the clock's ticking.

944
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,868
Okay. Fine.

945
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,609
Nickels and dimes.
Lots of them.

946
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,240
What? Why?
Why are we stealing change?

947
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,216
Why? Because I could.

948
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:18,318
Getting greedy with what you want
to steal will only get you caught.

949
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,555
You have to ask yourself "why"
you think you can get away with it.

950
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,226
Know "why" and the "what", "where"
and "how" will follow.

951
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:33,702
Okay, so how are we gonna rob a bank
and actually get away with it?

952
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,737
Ever notice how everything has
some piddly-ass surcharge added?

953
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,534
Yeah. Now you're speaking
to the choir, my friend.

954
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,773
Now I need you to listen closely
and be really honest here.

955
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:44,631
Shoot.

956
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,911
Do you always balance
your checkbook?

957
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,644
-I've done it.
-Yeah, right.

958
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,110
Even if you do, have you ever checked
to see if a bank didn't charge you...

959
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,014
a surcharge for an ATM transaction?

960
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,154
You had me at checkbook.

961
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,462
Which brings us back to "why. "
It's simple.

962
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,692
The world is too complicated
to keep track of.

963
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,490
Life is made of a million moments,
trans actions...

964
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,531
passwords and pin-numbers
to memorize.

965
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,302
It's not that we don't
want to keep track...

966
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,440
it's just that it's not worth
our time until you add it up.

967
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,539
How do we rob a bank and
why will we get away with it?

968
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,987
Add up the chump change.
We're stealing surcharges.

969
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,186
And it's missing money
no one is missing.

970
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,050
What about the bank missing?

971
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,695
-We have a problem.
-Yeah, that's what I said.

972
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,355
No. It's another kind of problem.

973
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,826
I wasn't planning on
getting Iocked in here.

974
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,692
We've been in here for hours.
I couldn't hold it forever.

975
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Of course.

976
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,033
Well.

977
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,478
I just won't Iook.

978
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,476
AII right...

979
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,822
wait, I've got an idea!

980
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,912
-Nick, hold on.
-What's going on?

981
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,359
Don't ask.

982
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,889
What are you doing?

983
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,304
No way!

984
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,682
Beggars can't be choosers, man.

985
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,935
So, what about
the bank noticing?

986
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,514
Okay. Well, like I said,
you never rob the bank...

987
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,152
at least not noticeably.

988
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,990
Stop it...

989
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,424
So, what if, for every dozen
ATM transactions...

990
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,320
you simply divert one surcharge
into an account already set-up...

991
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,461
within the bank.
Nothing more than missing nickels...

992
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,835
and no way to track it.

993
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,689
Yeah. I'm all for
the economics Iesson...

994
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,801
but what are we really
talking about here?

995
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,936
Honestly?

996
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,606
This is the only choice you have if
you ever wanna see any of that money?

997
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:02,044
Okay. Eight million two hundred sixty
six thousand five hundred dollars.

998
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,551
Can you hear me now?

999
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,153
-That's a Iot of transactions!
-Those nickels and dimes add up.

1000
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,956
And no one's on to you?

1001
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,594
Why? The stolen money never
left the bank.

1002
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:24,539
The irony is, it is all just sitting
in legitimate Grant Liberty accounts.

1003
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,676
-Waiting to be withdrawn.
- That's right.

1004
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,528
As Iong as you have a valid
PIN number to those accounts...

1005
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,605
you can just slowly withdraw it...

1006
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,970
using nothing more than an ATM card.

1007
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,078
-No one would ever notice!
-How to rob a bank.

1008
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,848
And actually get away with it.

1009
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,375
If I'm not mistaken,
we'd better work out a deal...

1010
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,452
before there's nothing
worth working out.

1011
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,713
So, you give us
your account numbers...

1012
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,686
and we'II assign the PIN
to a new ATM card.

1013
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,088
No deal.
If I just give you the accounts...

1014
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,558
Giving you the accounts
is like giving me the PIN.

1015
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,971
No guarantee the other
won't take off with it all.

1016
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,172
Okay. What now?

1017
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,146
Somebody just has
to trust somebody.

1018
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,387
I don't suppose my good
word would be sufficient?

1019
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,617
Honor among thieves and all that?

1020
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,423
Wait.

1021
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,521
"Insufficient funds."

1022
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,558
That's what got my ass into
all this in the first place.

1023
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:30,132
-Yeah! Your twenty bucks, surcharges.
-No. My PIN.

1024
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:33,706
We assign my PIN number
to "Nick's" accounts.

1025
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,162
That way only I know my PIN...

1026
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,373
and only "Nick" has the card
and the accounts.

1027
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,737
And?

1028
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,548
You see, you can't use the
ATM card without my PIN number...

1029
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,850
and without the card and
the accounts, the PIN is useless.

1030
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,511
We don't have to trust each other.

1031
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,116
We can meet and use
the two together...

1032
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,117
and go our separate ways.

1033
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,988
Works for me.

1034
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,597
Just hold on to that idea.
I'd better get this.

1035
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,936
Hello?

1036
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,065
AII right the power has been up
for over ten minutes now...

1037
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,502
and still no word
from anybody in there.

1038
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,451
-Have you heard anything?
-Uh, not really, well, you see...

1039
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,414
What? I didn't know what else to do.

1040
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,087
I think we're out of time.

1041
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,621
Hey, what's up?

1042
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,982
This is it. It's now or never.
Either we go with Jinx's plan...

1043
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,286
or that money just sits
in the bank forever.

1044
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,794
Okay, you're right. A couple a million
bucks is better than none, right?

1045
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,224
Just go to the computer...

1046
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,165
do what I told you before
you have Jinx enter his PIN.

1047
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,337
AII right.

1048
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,356
Jinx. What is it?

1049
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,696
I don't know. What if we get caught?
What if we end up serving Iife?

1050
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,600
Life?

1051
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,765
Right.

1052
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,230
See, I don't know about you, Jinx...

1053
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,903
but this hasn't felt Iike
much of a Iife to me.

1054
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,641
Just some anonymous hired hand.

1055
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,077
Is this my Iife?
This for the rest of my Iife?

1056
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,374
Is your Iife about
$1.50 surcharges...

1057
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,417
playing bitch-boy to every Simon
and Grant Liberty?

1058
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,295
When are we going to make
some choices of our own?

1059
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,167
Today has been...

1060
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,834
different.

1061
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,237
I think this is it.

1062
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:56,383
You know, I think this is Iife.
Choices Iike this.

1063
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:04,122
You know, our Iives aren't some
big monumental moment.

1064
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,189
It's a choice here,
and a choice there.

1065
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,430
Life is made up Iike that,
of these tiny moments.

1066
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,435
I think I'm sick of this Iife.

1067
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,339
So...

1068
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,315
How big can we make
this moment Jinx?

1069
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,415
And get a Iife.

1070
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:36,823
Are you insane?
This is a tiny moment to you?

1071
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,323
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1072
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,192
It's a big moment.

1073
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,000
It's a... yeah.

1074
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,537
But the principle's the same.
Make a choice. What are we gonna do?

1075
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:53,965
What are you going to do?

1076
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,275
I'm going to get my twenty bucks...
and then some.

1077
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,143
Right. Yeah.
Let's do this.

1078
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,378
Enter your PIN.

1079
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,155
So, this Iittle box is the key
to our fortune, huh?

1080
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,293
There. That's it.
We're done. Now what?

1081
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,037
Now, we go.

1082
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:30,969
Excuse me... guys? It just occurred
to me. We have a problem.

1083
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,512
-What's up?
-Well, you have no way out.

1084
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:40,519
-What?
-Well, she doesn't have a way out.

1085
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,445
What do you mean? She's got
the scam with the cops.

1086
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,315
They think she's one of the hostages.

1087
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,924
Okay, well, that doesn't solve
the "Simon problem. "

1088
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,192
Even if you wait until
the cops storm the place...

1089
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,795
he's not going quietly.

1090
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:59,673
He can easily turn her in when he
finds out she's not busted with him.

1091
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,808
No, no. Not after all this.

1092
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,845
Hold on.

1093
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,584
Officer DeGepse here.

1094
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,279
I'm sorry my signal died,
but I'm back in a good zone.

1095
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,265
Great, any news?

1096
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,050
Simon says he appreciates
your show of good faith...

1097
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,764
and in return, he's willing
to release two hostages.

1098
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,867
-Me and Jessica.
-No shit? Really?

1099
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,641
Okay, okay, we got you covered.

1100
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,108
We got you covered. Look.
Okay, Iook. Listen...

1101
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,520
make your way out slowly
and we'II take care of the rest.

1102
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,291
This will all be over soon.

1103
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,121
So, I'II tell Simon you're ready
for the release.

1104
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,421
Now, we're cooking with gasoline.

1105
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,125
-Do you have any way of reaching Simon?
-Yeah, I can call Roger.

1106
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,473
-Who?
-His muscle.

1107
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,831
The other guy on the team.

1108
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,968
He gave me his number in case
there were complications.

1109
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,078
I think this qualifies
as a complication.

1110
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,873
Nick, we're gonna call you back.

1111
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,445
-Hello?
-I gotta talk to Simon.

1112
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,444
He's kinda busy at the moment.
Who is this?

1113
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,423
Roger, put him on the phone.

1114
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,992
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me, Jinx.

1115
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,528
Hey Jinx, what's up?

1116
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,201
I have to admit
you've really got me worried now.

1117
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,872
Sorry for the wait,
but we better make a deal fast.

1118
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,269
-I got off the phone with DeGepse.
-What did he say?

1119
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,002
He says that if they don't see
cooperation from you within 5 minutes...

1120
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,805
they are storming
the place with SWA T.

1121
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,185
Shit! Shit...

1122
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,611
Shit! Shit...

1123
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:55,781
Shit! Shit...

1124
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,118
Shit!

1125
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:58,782
Shit!

1126
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,994
Okay.

1127
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,171
-What do they want?
-You're not going to like it.

1128
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,967
What?! What is it?

1129
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,237
They want at least one
hostage released and...

1130
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,340
And what?

1131
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,374
One of you has to turn yourself in.

1132
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,753
Fine. They can have Jessica.

1133
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,229
Really?
You'd turn her in? Just Iike that?

1134
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,185
What do I care? You want out
and I want in.

1135
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,919
Take Jessica as your insurance...

1136
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,632
and the cops get their
precious negotiation pawn.

1137
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,837
Sounds Iike a plan.

1138
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,676
What's wrong?
This is our way out.

1139
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,966
That might be the sweetest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

1140
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,632
Really?

1141
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,793
Right. Let's get
the hell out of here.

1142
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,429
What are you doing?

1143
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,161
I'm setting up our next rendezvous
outside this vault.

1144
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,669
Really? Is that a second date?

1145
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:02,774
You'd better tie me up.

1146
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,213
So Simon still thinks
I'm still your hostage.

1147
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,754
You wish.

1148
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,723
You want to help me with this?

1149
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,523
Is this good?

1150
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,163
That's good.

1151
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,708
All right, I'm coming out.

1152
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,677
I don't want any trouble!

1153
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,818
I imagined you taller.

1154
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:30,669
Fuck me, Jinx. Nice Attitude!
You've come a Iong way today.

1155
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,087
I can't go out there Iike this.

1156
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,761
I'm supposed to be a hostage
Iike you, not your hostage.

1157
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,062
They're gonna know something is up.

1158
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,564
You're supposed to be my hostage
for Simon's sake...

1159
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,405
if we want to get away with this.

1160
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,045
What do you suggest we do?

1161
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,348
Be careful that thing's Ioaded.

1162
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:21,510
Shit.

1163
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,491
Wait one fucking minute you two!

1164
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,844
Go, come on.

1165
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:00,651
Put your gun down!

1166
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,629
Put that gun down, motherfucker!

1167
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,660
Move.

1168
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,766
Move, motherfucker!

1169
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,112
Do you understand me?

1170
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,277
You have the right to remain silent.

1171
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,938
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

1172
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:33,053
Do you understand the rights
I have just stated.

1173
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,959
Out of the way, come on.

1174
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,232
Got it.

1175
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,197
Oh can you hear me?

1176
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,392
Damn. How about now?

1177
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,707
Yes, loud and clear.

1178
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:50,140
Good, okay, where were we?
Chump change.

1179
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,372
The dime you don't even
bother picking up is...

1180
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,169
the same dime we
all get bent- over for.

1181
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,950
So, surcharge the surchargers!
I agree.

1182
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,954
But there is one flaw
in your plan.

1183
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,525
Oh, a flaw in my plan?

1184
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,017
If we've got the PIN
and you've got the accounts...

1185
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:12,125
what happens next?
What happens when we meet?

1186
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,102
Trust the fatal flaw.

1187
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,431
Well, there's only one answer.

1188
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,638
Did you know that statistics say
that 98% of all convicted criminals...

1189
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,136
have successfully committed
at least one previous crime...

1190
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,241
before they were caught?

1191
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,980
That means almost everyone gets
away with it at least once!

1192
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,248
They had a good thing. But no,
they had to go try their luck again.

1193
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:41,151
Oh. By the way, tip 10...

1194
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,324
Know when to walk away.
