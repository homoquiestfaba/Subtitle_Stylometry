1
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,604
We've just gotten
information regarding another attack...

2
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:44,844
by the Convenience Store Killer.

3
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,668
Issues, man. Issues.

4
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:48,590
The killer has struck again,

5
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:51,279
this time in the Santee Alley
district in downtown L.A.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,200
The serial killer's...

7
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:00,654
I mean, the way he kills people...

8
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,878
Of course I am worried.

9
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,862
As a parent,
what am I supposed to do?

10
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:10,794
What if the killer decides
to do home invasions next?

11
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:15,278
The authorities still have no leads...

12
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:19,176
because, yet again,
the surveillance tapes are missing.

13
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,249
Police remain baffled,
still unable to find hard evidence...

14
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,200
exposing the identity of the killer.

15
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,803
He's probably just some punk fool...

16
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,749
with too much imagination.

17
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,926
Police discovered
four bodies earlier this morning.

18
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,487
All of them had been tortured
and brutally murdered.

19
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:18,414
The mayor's office has announced
an increased reward of $500,000...

20
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:23,023
for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of the serial killer.

21
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,978
Pinche Mona.

22
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,944
Mona, no, you don't.

23
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,187
Donny. No wonder
he's so fucking fat.

24
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,293
Asshole.

25
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,350
Got yourself
a nice tan, Jimmy.

26
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,227
Huh? Oh. Yeah.

27
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:03,923
Weather sucked.

28
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,381
Hmm. Must've been
why you came back early, huh?

29
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,967
When do we get to see
the vacation pictures?

30
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,030
Didn't take any.

31
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,363
I didn't bring
a camera.

32
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,667
What about the one
on your cell phone?

33
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:18,768
What?

34
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:32,402
- Jacko? Man, I knew it. Come on.
- Damn, Donny.

35
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,387
- Let's go.
- I ain't doing a damn thing.

36
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,308
Man, what the hell you doing?
I ain't done a damn...

37
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,226
Let's go.
You know the rules. Get out.

38
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,578
- Aw, man.
- If you come in, I swear to God...

39
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,416
Man, how many times
I got to tell you? You are banned.

40
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,722
Oh, come on, Donny.

41
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,155
One little can
of dog food?

42
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,254
I mean, you wouldn't want old Skippy here
to go hungry, would you?

43
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:57,641
He ain't had nothing
to eat in three days.

44
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,746
Come on, Donny.

45
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,113
All right, man.

46
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,763
You're a good brother.

47
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:10,477
What was that? What...
Give me that.

48
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,257
Give me that!

49
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,803
Shit.

50
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,185
Those motherfuckers.

51
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,695
- Give me it.
- No, you ain't.

52
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,339
Get... off... of... me.

53
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:50,993
- My booze.
- Asshole.

54
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:54,483
- Don't slam my door, bitch.
- Put it on my bill, you cheap bastard.

55
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:57,869
- Is there a problem here?
- Donny, just go back inside.

56
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,856
Just give me
my fucking money.

57
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:02,799
You got half.
The other half was if you swallowed.

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
Hey, why don't you give
the lady her money, okay?

59
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,684
Stay out of this, you fat fuck.

60
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,187
Just give her the money!

61
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,429
Huh?
Make me.

62
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,120
Jesus!

63
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,882
The first one's
on the house.

64
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,120
The next one
she'll put on your tab.

65
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,786
You're fucking dead.

66
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:22,194
Really?

67
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,142
Jesus!

68
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,918
This...
This ain't over yet.

69
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,681
Fucking little bitch! You fucking
goddamn American piece of shit!

70
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,300
Eh, fuck you!

71
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,364
Thanks, Morty.
Sure. No worries.

72
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,443
What happened there?

73
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,571
I can't even start.

74
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,994
What am I gonna do
with you, Marie? Just leave.

75
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:57,907
And you, get the hell outta here,
you pervert. Never come back.

76
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,534
Steve, here's the stuff.
I couldn't wait until tomorrow.

77
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:02,636
You're late.

78
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:06,250
Jimmy.
What? What?

79
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,750
You okay?

80
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,492
Why can't you get
a normal job?

81
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,339
Don't judge me, Donny.

82
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,542
I have rent to pay.

83
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:48,079
- Oh, God.
- What?

84
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,979
Last bit.

85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,282
Hmm.

86
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,162
You gonna pay for that?

87
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,760
If you ask me, you picked
the wrong time of year to be...

88
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,446
- in the store-selling business, Steve.
- I'm not asking.

89
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,906
Well, you really wanna
unload this stuff?

90
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,981
You got to make it something
that people wanna buy.

91
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:23,185
Let me guess. This another one
of your sales pitches...

92
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,106
to try to get me to buy more shit
from you, right?

93
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,339
No, it's not a sales pitch.
This is friendly advice.

94
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,676
Remember the first rule
of retail:

95
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,982
your store is only
as good as your stock.

96
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,687
Nothing wrong with my stock.

97
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,596
No, you don't, Jimmy.

98
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:46,868
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

99
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,871
Ah, Donny Doughnut.
Glad you could join me.

100
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,558
Just so we're clear, I'm deducting
from your paycheck this week...

101
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,890
three sugar glazed,
two chocolate, six creams.

102
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,450
Oh, and a new front door.

103
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,314
Hey, Steve, come on, man.
That was an accident.

104
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:02,580
Oh, there'll be an accident,
your fat ass doesn't fix that door.

105
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:06,710
I swear, the killer's got a thing
for liquor stores.

106
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:09,526
Four victims last night.
You should've seen the owners.

107
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,441
The asshole wouldn't
find it as funny...

108
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,746
if he would start getting
brain-dead delivery guys.

109
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:16,820
I heard the reward
is now half a million.

110
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,989
That would be
a good vacation, huh, Jimmy?

111
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,384
Whatever.

112
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,542
Screw the reward.
If I knew who the killer was... Ah!

113
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:38,325
- You'd pass on half a million bucks?
- Nah. I'd collect.

114
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,009
But they didn't specify
if they wanted him dead or alive,

115
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,873
so I guess he'll get his due.

116
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,338
Oh, yeah?
What do you have in mind?

117
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,451
Well, you know,
that guy, um...

118
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,929
from that movie, Jimmy, you used to watch
when you were a kid, hombre.

119
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,182
- The guy with the messed-up face.
- Who, Freddy?

120
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:55,798
No, no, no. The other guy. You used to
dress up as him and jump out on your ma.

121
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,642
- Oh, Leatherface.
- Leatherface.

122
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:00,755
Yeah. Remember him?

123
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:02,707
I mean, he was on the money,
but his technique...

124
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,133
He used to ram the meat hook
right between the shoulder blades,

125
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,566
giving 'em a lot of leeway for kicking
and screaming and carrying on.

126
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,928
See, what you do is you hang 'em
upside down like a regular animal.

127
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,972
You ram the meat hook
low through his back,

128
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:16,468
legs spread, cleft
of his ass cheeks exposed.

129
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:18,484
Ooh, sounds kind
of kinky to me.

130
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,589
Of course. Everything sounds kinky to you.

131
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,724
Anyway, what's the first thing you do
when you're sawing wood?

132
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,832
You mark a line with a saw
so you can get a straight cut.

133
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,971
That's the crack
of this guy's ass.

134
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,787
You line up the blade, fire that baby up
and...

135
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:37,270
It sounds like if you're gonna go through
all the trouble to string this bastard up,

136
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,138
it would be a waste
to just finish him off just like that.

137
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,658
What would you do besides
licking him to death?

138
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,222
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

139
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:46,099
What would I do?
Uh... let's see.

140
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,468
Ooh. I'd pull his eyes out.

141
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,606
- Ooh, that's original, Mona.
- Ha, ha, ha.

142
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,469
Fuck you too.
Ha, ha, ha.

143
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,390
You got a sick plan, Steve.

144
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,310
Where you gonna get tools
like that?

145
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,711
Are you kidding, man? This place was a
turn-of-the-century butcher shop.

146
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:00,824
Most of the original shit's
still down in the basement.

147
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,389
You're kidding.

148
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,718
No, really.
Cleavers, knives, meat hooks.

149
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:08,726
Scary-looking shit.
Just what that prick deserves.

150
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:11,223
So, what's wrong with putting
half a million bucks in your pocket?

151
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,624
- Uh... nothing.
- Mm-mm. Absolutely nothing.

152
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:18,803
A Caribbean cruise. Ooh, a new crib
in a decent neighborhood.

153
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,940
- Oh, and a new pimped ride.
- Acting lessons.

154
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,862
- Mmm.
- And a big house in Malibu,

155
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,511
with a fireplace
and a view of the ocean.

156
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,545
Mmm. Ah.
What would you do, Jimmy?

157
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,853
A guy like that's
nothing but vermin.

158
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,701
Yeah, but how
would you kill him?

159
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:43,153
Well, he's still
hanging upside down, right?

160
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,903
I'd wrap him up
in Saran Wrap,

161
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,145
fucking head to toe,
like a big chunk of dope.

162
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,472
Then I'd cut him up.

163
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,037
Cut him up really bad.

164
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:57,942
Let that plastic baggy fill up
like a used condom.

165
00:11:57,943 --> 00:12:01,432
Let that son of a bitch
choke in his own filthy blood.

166
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:04,083
Freako.

167
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:08,212
Well, before this goes on,
I will bid you adieu before I hurl.

168
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,734
Bye, Morty.

169
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:15,352
Ah. Hey, what
would you do, Jess?

170
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:18,966
- Finished.
- Hey, they locked us in.

171
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,816
Oh. I couldn't kill anyone.

172
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,841
Hypothetically, Jessita.

173
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:27,670
Let's say you're cornered. You or him.
Do or die. What would you do?

174
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,194
Cut off his head, I guess.

175
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,231
Who's that?

176
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,435
Jimmy, give me the bat.

177
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:49,137
- Whoa!
- Steve! Steve! Donny!

178
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:55,637
- Who the hell was that?
- What he look like?

179
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:57,365
I don't know, man.
I was talking to Jimmy.

180
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,216
He had a hat on.

181
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,602
All right, everybody,
get back inside.

182
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:12,975
Hey, uh,
you don't think...

183
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,137
Get out of here, Morty.

184
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:24,114
- Stay. Stay. Please stay.
- I need to make rent, Donny.

185
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,515
Join us for the game tonight.

186
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,079
I don't know the first thing
about poker.

187
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,223
Oh, Texas Hold 'Em is easy, Jess.
You'll learn it in no time.

188
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,593
Besides, Steve
will be wasted soon.

189
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:36,218
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

190
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:38,552
So, who's playing poker?

191
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:41,244
Well, Jess is thinking
about joining us tonight.

192
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,343
Well, as long as she's
got money for the pot.

193
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:50,008
- Steve, don't be such a pig.
- I'll spot you 50 bucks.

194
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,056
Maybe you'll get lucky.

195
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:53,557
- Okay.
- Okay, everyone,

196
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,620
collect your purchases.

197
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:57,369
Form an orderly line.

198
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,668
Jimmy, you're on the register
while I set up upstairs.

199
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,735
Oh, and Mona owes 9.25
and Jess 12.20.

200
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,656
Hey, who says
I owe nine bucks?

201
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:07,576
Well, let's see.

202
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,529
One Mississippi Mud Sandwich,
two fudge bars.

203
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,122
Oh, and those chocolate éclairs
you snuck in your bag last Wednesday.

204
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,103
Hey.

205
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,086
How does he know
about last Wednesday?

206
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:20,248
I told you. He's got VCRs
wired up to those things.

207
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,161
Well, they're damn well hidden if he has.
Believe me, I have checked.

208
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:27,189
He doesn't trust any of us.
He's just an asshole.

209
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,090
Give me the usual.

210
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,118
I got him wrapped around my finger.

211
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:50,231
- I know all of Steve's tricks.
- Oh, yeah?

212
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,929
Very funny, Jimmy.

213
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,552
Huh? Oh.
Sorry.

214
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,650
You even have
the same doughnuts every night.

215
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,634
You okay?

216
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:04,439
I'm all right!
Donny, can you take over for me?

217
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,122
- I got to take a leak, man.
- Sure.

218
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,251
T.J.

219
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,640
Yeah. It's me. Jimmy.

220
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,007
No. Look, I can't get
into all that now.

221
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,857
When can you come by?

222
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,732
I'll pay for the damn cab.

223
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:32,372
I'm dying here, man.

224
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:35,383
Well, how soon is soon?

225
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,386
One hour? Two hours?

226
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:42,291
Okay.

227
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,106
Okay.

228
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:49,244
Look, I said okay, didn't I?

229
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,684
- Steve. Hey...
- Hey, Jimmy...

230
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,608
What the fuck did I tell you?

231
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,973
That if I ever caught you calling
his scumbag again, I'd fuck you up!

232
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:59,116
No. Wait. I just needed a little
something to take the edge off...

233
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:00,471
- just a little methadone.
- Methadone?

234
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:02,892
Goddamn it, you were on that shit
in rehab and you still fucked it up...

235
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:04,699
- by bringing in dope!
- Ow!

236
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,615
- Goddamn it!
- Ow! Leave me alone, Steve.

237
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,688
The deal with your mother was that if you
goddamn work here you got to be clean!

238
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:10,968
- I was clean!
- When?

239
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:14,042
- Yesterday!
- Should we do something?

240
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:17,660
Who's gonna stop him? You?

241
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,731
What the hell is it
all about anyway?

242
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,408
Where do you think Jimmy's been
this past week?

243
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,670
Hawaii.

244
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,752
Comes back whiter
than a nun's tit,

245
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,634
- and you think he's been to Hawaii?
- That's what Steve told me.

246
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,554
Steve put out
the whole Hawaii story...

247
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:33,019
because he's embarrassed
there's a junkie in his family.

248
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,940
Jimmy was in rehab.

249
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:37,917
Yeah, and it looks like he got himself
kicked out by the sound of it.

250
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,991
You are worthless, goddamn it!

251
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:43,257
Hey, let's just go on upstairs.
Come on.

252
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:46,329
Someone should talk
to the goddamn mirror for once!

253
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,731
- Steve, I'm feeling sick, man.
- Sick.

254
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,715
Come on, you got
to understand. Steve.

255
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:53,340
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- I got a dependency, man.

256
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:57,032
- Shut the fuck up.
- Come on. Please, Steve. I need my phone.

257
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:01,236
- Oh, you want this? Yeah? You want this?
- Yes. Yes, please.

258
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:06,523
What the hell
did you do that for?

259
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,593
I'm off the clock, Steve.
Let me out.

260
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:17,049
We're playing poker.

261
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,283
I don't wanna play poker, Steve.
I just wanna go home.

262
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:23,708
I don't think so. We're gonna have us
a good old-fashioned lock-in.

263
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,629
What? You're gonna keep me
prisoner here?

264
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,545
Don't think of it that way.

265
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,625
We're gonna have some fun,
play some cards, have a couple of drinks.

266
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,547
You could even win
some cash.

267
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,767
Then after a fine evening of
entertainment, you can stay here...

268
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:36,349
- with your old Uncle Steve.
- No!

269
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,062
You'll be ready for work in the morning.
You'll already be here.

270
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:43,959
And we'll do this every night until you
feel better, how does that sound?

271
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,324
Get your ass upstairs.

272
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,859
What are you looking for,
his porno collection?

273
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,842
No. I was
just checking.

274
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:21,979
I think Jimmy was right
about those VCRs.

275
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,900
They're coming.

276
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,663
For once, I actually feel glad
Steve's got all this surveillance stuff.

277
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:31,576
- What?
- All these cameras.

278
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,939
I mean, they've got to be
some sort of deterrent, right?

279
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,045
I guess.

280
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,879
Hey, hey.

281
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:50,651
- It looks like my lucky night.
- Ah. Who's the dealer?

282
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,955
- What?
- Whose turn is it to deal?

283
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,886
- Toss those babies over here.
- Uh-uh. We'll cut for it.

284
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:03,194
Oh!

285
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,626
All right, let's see
the color of your money.

286
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,595
Color of my money is green.
Give me 50.

287
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,067
This is for me and Jess.

288
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,334
- OK, and I'm gonna call tonight, alright?
- Don't worry about it.

289
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:18,866
Tuesday's my slow night.
Got it. You okay, Jimmy?

290
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,555
He's all right.

291
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,635
He just picked today
to quit the smokes.

292
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:25,565
Jimmy's quitting smoking?

293
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:28,029
Yeah. He was being
a real pussy about it.

294
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,357
Like you'd know.

295
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,617
God, I've quit smoking
a hundred times.

296
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:38,171
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

297
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:40,892
Hey, Steve, what are you gonna do
once you sell this dump?

298
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,068
- I got a plan.
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:45,181
Why don't you enlighten us?

300
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,480
Well, a couple of my ideas
I would have to run by a patent office...

301
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,972
before I start shooting off
my mouth.

302
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,053
Wait. You're gonna become an inventor?

303
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,955
What are you gonna invent, Steve?

304
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,677
We're closed!

305
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,598
Is anyone
expecting company?

306
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,837
Wait. Didn't Sadie say
that she'd drop by?

307
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,297
Oh, yeah. Shit.

308
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:07,911
I thought we were playing cards,

309
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:09,462
- or what?
- She owes me money.

310
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:13,725
- Is it her?
- I can't see from here.

311
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:16,281
Let me borrow your cell phone
for a second, Jess.

312
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,715
Fuck! I must've left it in Teddy's car.

313
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,666
- What's wrong with yours?
- I'm outta credit.

314
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,587
Incoming calls only.

315
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:28,669
You know, I don't think
it really is her. I think it...

316
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,869
- Are we playing cards or what?
- Okay. Okay! My goodness.

317
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,519
Come on. So tell us
what you're going to invent, Steve.

318
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,695
Burger joints.

319
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,387
Hey.

320
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,307
I hate to piss
on your Cheerios, Steve,

321
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,261
but I think Ronald McDonald
may have beat you to the punch.

322
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:46,205
Okay.

323
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,990
What's the most fucking
annoying thing in the world?

324
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:51,103
I'll tell you.
You're out shopping, right?

325
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:54,777
And you got to take a leak. And the only
place around is a McDonald's.

326
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,051
So you go inside
and some clown says,

327
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:59,036
"Sorry, man. The restroom's
for customers only".

328
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:01,245
And you go, "Well, I'm a customer.
I eat here all the time.

329
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:02,430
I mean, not just now,
but you know".

330
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:05,014
And the guy goes,
"Yeah, well, that's what everybody says".

331
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,960
And you go, "Look, asshole.
You see this lump of shit? See this?

332
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:11,929
"I didn't grow this baby grazing
at the fucking salad bar at Vegans R Us.

333
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,332
Let me use the goddamn john".
The guy goes, "You know what?

334
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,318
Take a hike, or I'm gonna call security".
What do you do?

335
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,933
You either punch the guy out
or piss your pants, right?

336
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,751
You show him your
burger facility reward card.

337
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:26,269
One Big Mac or its equivalent...
say, a Filet-O-Fish and fries...

338
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,277
equals one stamp on your card
equals one complimentary piss.

339
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:32,284
Supersize it and you get one free
complimentary shit as well.

340
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,463
Yeah, laugh it up, asshole.

341
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:37,535
But where are you gonna be this time
next year, apart from the fucking morgue?

342
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:40,160
Whatever, man. I got plans.

343
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:43,291
Yeah? Like what?
Well, tell me. Like what?

344
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:47,547
Uh, so the burger facility reward card,
that sounds like an interesting concept.

345
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,175
I'm telling you,
it's got the potential to be huge.

346
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,638
But let me tell you something
about McDonald's.

347
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,623
They pulled that bathroom stunt
on me so many times,

348
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:55,567
I've taken my business
elsewhere,

349
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:56,831
- in principal.
- Oh, please, Steve.

350
00:21:56,832 --> 00:22:00,860
I have seen your car, and it is full
of empty McDonald's cartons.

351
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,422
That's why I said "in principle",
brainiac. Of course I still eat there.

352
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,342
They're the only ones
who have the Big Mac.

353
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:08,512
But inside, I'm no longer
the loyal customer I used to be.

354
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:11,071
I don't owe them shit. You think
I'm the only one that thinks that way?

355
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:13,153
Thousands who have strayed
from the path...

356
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,292
because McDonald's was too cheap
to let them use their...

357
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,926
- Hello. Nurse Moore speaking.
- Let me tell you something.

358
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:24,352
Once the first burger joint takes it on,
they'll all have to take on it.

359
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:26,496
What is your choice
of pleasure?

360
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,192
- Uh-huh.
- Burger facility reward card.

361
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:31,484
I guess I'm qualified to do that.

362
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,787
- Ooh.
- Hey.

363
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,157
- What the hell's going on?
- I'm just showing her how to play, man.

364
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:39,198
- She's never played before.
- Well, don't, man.

365
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,311
There's money on the table,
for Christ's sakes.

366
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:43,231
Oh, what do
I look like?

367
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,271
- Well, I'm 27.
- In the '80s.

368
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,573
I will beat your ass.

369
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:52,223
I'm 27,
with long auburn hair...

370
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:56,894
that people say complements
my milky white complexion.

371
00:22:56,895 --> 00:23:02,018
And underneath my tight,
tight nurse's uniform,

372
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,016
I'm wearing a 40 double-D cup bra.

373
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,767
What happened? Fast shooter?

374
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:12,031
- Mm-mm. His wife just came in.
- Oh, please.

375
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:15,235
So, do you ever get a guy...
You ever get him, like, mixed up?

376
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:19,358
You have some guy call you, and he, um...
he wants you to be a policewoman...

377
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,013
- and wants you to handcuff him?
- Mm-mm. I'm a professional, honey.

378
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:25,248
Caller I.D. tells me
what I'm supposed to be.

379
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:27,359
You should run it like 911.

380
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,599
You know,
start a service like...

381
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,841
"For blow jobs, press 1.

382
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,760
"For handjobs, dial 2.

383
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:35,541
"For back door, press 3.

384
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,718
And for missionary, press 4."
How boring... missionary.

385
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:42,062
No, seriously. Have you gotten
a guy calling in. He's calling from...

386
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:44,696
- I don't know, across...
- Ey, Ey, what's with all the questions?

387
00:23:44,697 --> 00:23:46,945
What, are you trying to
compete with her?

388
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:49,667
There might be a niche in the market
for fat clerks with a doughnut fetish.

389
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,837
Oh, don't get all snippy
'cause you're losing.

390
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,494
Yeah, loser.
Read 'em and weep, guys.

391
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:56,542
Hey.

392
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:59,135
Kiss my doughnut hole.
Like this.

393
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,498
Oh, God. Jesus, Steve,
you're disgusting.

394
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:01,762
I'm disgusting?

395
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:04,483
You're the one who said you were
gonna blow him when he turned 25.

396
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,620
I said I'd organize his party.

397
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:09,246
- What?
- And thanks for spoiling the surprise.

398
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:29,279
All right,
coming around the horn. Jimmy.

399
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,200
Steve.

400
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,218
I need another beer.

401
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:36,125
Does anyone want anything else
from downstairs?

402
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:42,207
All right.

403
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,625
Thanks.

404
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,953
Mona Moore
will give you more pleasure.

405
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,969
Oh!

406
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,987
It's Clyde.

407
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:57,182
I've been a bad girl,
haven't I?

408
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,711
You saw the light
from under the door...

409
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:01,761
when you were making
your rounds.

410
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:04,449
You opened the door
and caught me.

411
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,369
That's right.

412
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,082
You caught me stealing
the petty cash.

413
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,413
What, again?
That's the third time this week.

414
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:15,360
You caught me
fair and square.

415
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:17,887
No, the guy's
got no imagination.

416
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:20,832
You're not gonna tell on me,
are you, Clyde?

417
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,754
Mm-hmm.

418
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,251
So, why doesn't the company
check the phone bills or something?

419
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:29,057
Oh! He's the night guard.
He's got keys to all the departments.

420
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,103
Never uses
the same phone twice.

421
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,377
Please don't tell
on me, Clyde.

422
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,258
There's got to be some way
I can make it up to you.

423
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,339
I.R.S. headquarters.
It's a lot of fucking phones.

424
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,117
Yeah, that's where all our money goes...

425
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:44,255
funding jerk-off lines.

426
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,522
Mm-hmm.

427
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,354
- Did you hear that?
- I'll do anything, Clyde.

428
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,148
- Who...
- I told you we're closed!

429
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,130
Oh, Clyde, please.

430
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:59,006
Not the panties as well.

431
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,440
What do you want me
to take my panties off for?

432
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:03,969
So he can wear 'em
underneath his uniform.

433
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,498
Will you shut the fuck up?

434
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:08,578
Oh, Clyde.

435
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:10,529
That didn't sound like
it was coming from the front.

436
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,660
Is that wide enough, Clyde?

437
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:16,160
Sounded like it was coming
from the side door or something.

438
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,769
Don't worry about it.
This place is locked down.

439
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,113
Oh, no, Clyde, please.
Don't ask me to do that.

440
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,987
Don't make me beg for it.

441
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:29,309
- What the fuck was that?
- I feel so humiliated.

442
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:33,408
It's nothing. Play, play.

443
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,550
Okay. I'll say it.

444
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,795
Give it to me, Clyde.

445
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,291
Give it to me now. Yes.

446
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:42,850
Yes! Oh, Clyde.

447
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,836
You know how I like it.

448
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,127
Oh, yes, Clyde. Oh, yes.

449
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,751
It's just some kids
trashing a car.

450
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,569
Put it
in my dirty mouth.

451
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,995
You wanna hear
what it sounds like, Clyde?

452
00:26:56,996 --> 00:27:00,192
Damn it, Donny. You're as bad as Steve.

453
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:03,233
Mmm.

454
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:07,292
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
You like that, Clyde?

455
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,093
Are we playing cards
or sucking dicks here?

456
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,558
It's her job, Steve.

457
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,909
Yeah, well, this is my job, but you don't
see me bringing in the customers...

458
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,421
- and giving them blow jobs.
- You're the boss.

459
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,776
Mmm. Mm-mm.

460
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:21,825
Oh!

461
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,609
Oh! Mmm.

462
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,043
- What the fuck was that?
- I'll check it out.

463
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:30,916
- Sit down.
- Geez Louise. I'll go, okay? My goodness.

464
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,836
And stay outta that
freezer down there.

465
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,752
Haven't you had enough ice cream
for one night?

466
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,858
Ah, fuck you too.

467
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:44,899
Please, Clyde,
I'm just a secretary...

468
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,819
trying to earn a living.

469
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,797
I needed the money.
I made a mistake.

470
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,867
Haven't I suffered enough?

471
00:27:57,795 --> 00:27:59,938
Please, Clyde.

472
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,725
Not with the nightstick.

473
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:04,933
Okay, Clyde. Okay.

474
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,456
You're the boss.

475
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,273
Yeah. I'm doing that.

476
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:12,956
I'm leaning over the desk.

477
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:19,709
Yeah. I've got my dress
pulled up real high.

478
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,737
Yeah. I see you
coming at me...

479
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:28,034
with that big ol' nightstick.

480
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:30,116
You're coming at me,

481
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:34,724
and I'm spreading my legs
real wide.

482
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:40,763
Yeah. I'm still here, Clyde.

483
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:44,066
Oh, Clyde. Oh, baby.

484
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:48,034
I know it's wrong.
It's so wrong, but it feels so right.

485
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:51,302
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh, I think I'm gonna...

486
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,374
Ooh! Oh my God,
I think I'm gonna...

487
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:14,755
She's been gone a while.

488
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:17,790
Stop worrying, will ya?

489
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:49,726
Shit!

490
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:55,492
Jimmy. Fucking asshole.

491
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,663
Where the hell are you?

492
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:06,719
Jimmy, I'm gonna give you
5 fucking minutes! Then I'm outta here!

493
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,360
Fuck! Shit.

494
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:12,863
What was that?

495
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:19,131
I don't hear anything.

496
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:22,085
- Please, Steve, can you just go...
- Donny Doughnut,

497
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:25,797
haul your ass downstairs
and see what's keeping Money Mona.

498
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:28,998
Why me?
Because I said so.

499
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:33,249
And if she's got her head in that freezer
again, tell her I'm gonna kill her.

500
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,916
Mona,
what are you doing?

501
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,447
Mona?

502
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,211
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

503
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,976
Still talking to that Clyde guy.

504
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:09,343
That guy must have balls
like fucking watermelons, huh?

505
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,342
Hey, Steve, there's something wrong
with that camera.

506
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,004
Yeah, right.

507
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,383
What is with that camera?

508
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:20,584
A minute ago, it was all out of focus.
Now look at it.

509
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,594
Ah, shitty Chinese junk.

510
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:28,006
And where's Mona?
Something's not right.

511
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:32,384
Five minutes ago, the kid saw her
still milking that security guy.

512
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:49,127
Mona?

513
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,944
You there?

514
00:33:51,945 --> 00:33:54,471
Mona?

515
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:02,534
Steve, the lights are out
down here!

516
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,511
- What?
- The lights... they're out!

517
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:07,432
Find the fuse box!

518
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,570
It's in the stockroom
just behind the door!

519
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,738
Thanks, Steve.

520
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,651
Mona?

521
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,595
Where the hell are you?

522
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,973
I swear to God,
if you're gonna jump out at me,

523
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,993
I have pepper spray,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

524
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:28,137
Holy... Oh, shit!

525
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:30,090
Oh, Donny!
Oh, God! Jess!

526
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,835
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, you crazy...

527
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,358
What do you mean,
she just got in a cab and left?

528
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,040
Like I told you, some asshole
was blaring his horn.

529
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,377
I look out the window.
I see a cab outside.

530
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:44,631
Next thing I see is Mona coming out
through the side door,

531
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:48,139
gets in the cab, cab takes off,
end of fucking story.

532
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,982
You sure it was Mona?

533
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:55,048
Feeling better?
Who else is it gonna be?

534
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,969
I don't know, but it just doesn't make
very much sense.

535
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,208
I mean, why would she leave
without telling us?

536
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,994
I know. She was out of money.
She wanted back in the game.

537
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,907
Maybe decided to pay this Sadie chick
a visit, you know.

538
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:08,038
No, no. Wait. Hang on.
You said that we were locked down here.

539
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,144
- How could she have gotten out?
- That bitch took my keys.

540
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:13,514
- What?
- I remember.

541
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:15,977
When she got in the cab, I looked
for the keys. The keys were gone.

542
00:36:15,978 --> 00:36:18,251
Wait. None of this
makes any sense.

543
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:21,926
Did you see any of this?

544
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:24,519
I'm gonna call her.

545
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,792
- How are you gonna do that?
- Give me your cell phone.

546
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:29,547
- I don't got one.
- Well, what about the phone downstairs?

547
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:31,945
Phone company cut me off
months ago.

548
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:35,562
Jesus Christ, Steve.
Jimmy?

549
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:38,828
Wasting your time.

550
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,744
No, I know he has one.
I saw him use it earlier.

551
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,272
Not anymore, he doesn't.

552
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,640
Pissed me off earlier.
Tossed it out the window.

553
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:46,571
Then go get it.

554
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,034
Well, I don't have the fucking keys,
do I?

555
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:53,227
- So we're locked in here.
- Ah, the blonde finally got it.

556
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,264
You mean we're locked in here and there's
no way of letting anyone know?

557
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:59,979
Well, now you know why I'm so pissed off
at your stupid fucking bitch friend.

558
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,187
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

559
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,104
- So, how far away is this Sadie?
- I don't know.

560
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,398
A couple of blocks, I guess.

561
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:08,363
If Mona's gone to get money,
she's gonna come back, yeah?

562
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:10,731
Let's just play some cards
to pass the time.

563
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,482
Good idea.

564
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,494
Is he okay?

565
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,040
Ah! Fuck!

566
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,403
Hey, dick splash,
we're playing cards.

567
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:38,060
He doesn't have to play
if he doesn't want to.

568
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:49,346
You're not even looking
at your fucking cards.

569
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,501
All right,
let's see 'em.

570
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:07,108
He cleaned me out.

571
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,909
Fuck! Fuck!

572
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:15,148
- Damn it!
- Ever seen anybody get so pissed off...

573
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,070
after winning
a shitload of money?

574
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,209
Can't say that I have.

575
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,129
Settle down, will you?

576
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,882
- Let's finish the game.
- Just let him be, Steve.

577
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:26,917
I said let's finish the fucking game!

578
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:36,328
Oh, geez!

579
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:38,603
Oh, Christ, Steve,
this place is infested!

580
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,933
It's only a little roach,
you fucking pussy.

581
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:45,126
The game's over anyway.
We're both outta cash.

582
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:49,837
I know how you can
make your money back.

583
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,038
Oh, yeah? How?

584
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:55,108
Strip poker?

585
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:58,956
Come on.
You can make your money back.

586
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:01,839
I don't need money
that badly.

587
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,759
No.

588
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:20,614
N... N... No.

589
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:32,524
Come on, Jessita. I haven't seen
a decent pair of tits in decades.

590
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:35,374
Don't hold your breath.

591
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,026
Could you stop eating
those damn doughnuts!

592
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:03,086
Get 'em off me!
Leave me alone!

593
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,197
Jimmy, there's nothing there!

594
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,680
Man, I don't know what's wrong with him,

595
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,562
freaking out like that.

596
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:14,027
Maybe it's called
"going cold turkey".

597
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:16,076
Oh, come on, Steve,
everyone knows.

598
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:17,585
There's no point
trying to keep it a secret.

599
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:19,149
It's his mother, you know.

600
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,670
It would kill her.
She would fucking die, you know.

601
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,289
I don't know what to do.

602
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:39,722
Donny.

603
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:45,100
I'm just a joke to you.

604
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,501
Look, I'm sorry!

605
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:49,607
I just don't like to see you
do this to yourself.

606
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,976
Those doughnuts
are gonna kill you.

607
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,306
Yeah? What are those,
vitamins?

608
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:00,813
I don't know. You just never
stick up for yourself.

609
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,117
I mean, show some fucking
self-respect, for Christ's sake.

610
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,535
"Donny Doughnut".

611
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:10,025
How long are you gonna let people
keep calling you that?

612
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:22,694
Oh, God.

613
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,224
What the fuck is your problem?

614
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:36,967
Look! There on the screen!

615
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:40,616
Oh, sweet Jesus!

616
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:44,272
I saw it.

617
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:47,664
I saw it, and it's down there
in the stockroom.

618
00:43:47,665 --> 00:43:50,225
I saw it!

619
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:52,398
There's nothing there,
pinche loco cabrón!

620
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:54,127
What did you see, Jimmy?

621
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,391
King cockroach.

622
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:58,927
Chichis Christ.

623
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,944
It's not funny!

624
00:44:00,945 --> 00:44:03,761
We need to get him help!

625
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:06,450
Where the hell is Mona?

626
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:08,397
Down there in the stockroom.

627
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,206
- King fucking cockroach?
- Yes.

628
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:15,662
And it was big.
Like a man.

629
00:44:15,663 --> 00:44:17,744
And his face...

630
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:20,144
Oh. He was all
shiny and black,

631
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:23,725
with these horrible
bug eyes.

632
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:28,431
And its mouth...
Oh, God!

633
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,216
Its mouth was just
a slit...

634
00:44:31,217 --> 00:44:33,424
with tiny little roach teeth.

635
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:35,857
And it was grinning
at me!

636
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:39,343
Jimmy, you're freaking out.
You're hallucinating!

637
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,582
You didn't see it.
You didn't...

638
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,202
I didn't see it
because there's nothing there.

639
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,496
Look, it's all part
of the withdraw symptoms!

640
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,461
I know what I saw!

641
00:44:48,462 --> 00:44:50,890
It's down there
in the fucking stockroom!

642
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:57,647
Organizing the others.

643
00:44:57,648 --> 00:45:01,103
Preparing for the attack.

644
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:02,941
Jimmy, what attack?

645
00:45:02,942 --> 00:45:06,513
Come on, man!
Don't you see what's going on?

646
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,881
They got us trapped
in here!

647
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:12,237
First they got Mona,
and now they want to get us.

648
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:15,632
They didn't get Mona, man.
She left in a cab.

649
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:20,242
Wake up, man!
Mona didn't get in any fucking cab.

650
00:45:20,243 --> 00:45:22,668
Mona's nothing
but roach food.

651
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,484
They got her.

652
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:28,387
But they're not
gonna get me.

653
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:31,023
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

654
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:33,039
Hey!

655
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,337
Sit the fuck down,
you fucking pussy.

656
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:37,906
Stop fucking telling me
what to do!

657
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:40,391
All my life you've been
pushing me around. "Do this, Jimmy".

658
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:44,526
"Do that, Jimmy". "Fuck you, Jimmy".
Well, fuck you, you...

659
00:45:44,527 --> 00:45:46,799
- You bullying piece of shit!
- Stop it.

660
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,121
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do? Huh?

661
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,572
Jimmy, chill out.

662
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:53,649
You're not even my dad,

663
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,601
and you've been pushing me
and pushing me,

664
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,930
treating me like a slave
in this fuckin' shit-hole!

665
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:02,256
Well, don't worry!
I'm gone! Outta here!

666
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:04,778
Good luck with
the fuckin' roaches!

667
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:08,524
Steve!

668
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:54,828
Get out of here!

669
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,525
It's only a roach.

670
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,641
Jesus.

671
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:58,603
Shoo! Shoo!

672
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:05,397
Shoo!

673
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,451
Oh, God.

674
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:19,950
I'm trapped like a rat
in a fucking maze!

675
00:48:26,388 --> 00:48:28,722
Get away from me.

676
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:31,052
You filthy fucking vermin!

677
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:35,476
I'm not afraid of you!

678
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:39,479
Do you know what I do
to filthy little insects like you? Huh?

679
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,804
I squish 'em!

680
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:47,155
I was only joking.

681
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:50,676
I wouldn't kill you.
I wouldn't.

682
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,597
Really.

683
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:55,254
Oh, please.

684
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,388
Please.

685
00:48:58,419 --> 00:49:00,498
I wouldn't do that!

686
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:04,981
What do you want from me?
Please!

687
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:07,853
What do you want from me?

688
00:49:21,012 --> 00:49:24,308
Where does he get his balls
to talk to me like that?

689
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:28,689
23 years I've looked after his sorry ass,
and this is how he repays me?

690
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,410
And now he's wrecking the joint!

691
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,294
Guys, check this out.

692
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:45,420
God, he's pitchin'
a shit fit.

693
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:50,291
- I'm going down there.
- You're not going anywhere.

694
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,600
Help me.

695
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:58,607
I'm not gonna have
any store left.

696
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:24,910
- What is it?
- I saw someone down there.

697
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:28,470
I swear to God, I saw somebody
at the deli counter.

698
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:30,647
- Sure it wasn't Jimmy?
- No, Jess, it wasn't Jimmy.

699
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:33,106
It was a guy in a black coat
with a thing on his face.

700
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:35,987
- King cockroach maybe?
- It's not funny.

701
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:37,908
Are you sure
you saw someone?

702
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,149
Yeah, Jimmy,
and he's wrecking my store.

703
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,511
Oh, yeah? Where is he, Steve?
'Cause he disappeared.

704
00:50:43,512 --> 00:50:46,544
- Just like Mona disappeared.
- Ah, Christ.

705
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:52,014
- What?
- He's down in the basement.

706
00:50:53,525 --> 00:50:56,533
Steve, please!
Don't go! I'm begging you!

707
00:50:56,534 --> 00:50:58,582
Something bad is gonna happen.
I can just feel it.

708
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,950
Yeah, his mom's gonna kill me
if he breaks his crazy neck.

709
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:02,496
Steve, man, come on.
Don't go down...

710
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:03,860
You're gonna go down there
without anything?

711
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,780
Don't you have a gun
or something?

712
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:09,295
With a nut-job like Jimmy
on the premises? Give me a break!

713
00:51:12,245 --> 00:51:14,806
Happy now? If you wanna
do something, look at the monitors,

714
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,366
and if you see
anything, yell.

715
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,538
Steve!

716
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:31,952
Christ, Jimmy.

717
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,492
There.
By the deli counter.

718
00:52:25,493 --> 00:52:27,952
- What is it?
- I don't know.

719
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:30,129
Here, see if you can get it
up on the full screen.

720
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,895
I'll try.

721
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:51,800
Okay, zoom in on that.

722
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:56,348
- Donny...
- Uh... It's my first time.

723
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:57,999
There's nothing there anyway.

724
00:53:01,397 --> 00:53:04,849
Jimmy, that you?

725
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:15,376
- What?
- The meat slicer... it's gone.

726
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:23,672
- Steve, get up here now!
- Why? What is it?

727
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:26,361
Someone's just taken
the meat slicer!

728
00:53:26,362 --> 00:53:29,076
Take it easy. It's just Jimmy
trying to creep me out.

729
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:31,477
Asshole left a trail of ketchup
leading down to the basement...

730
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:33,430
trying to make it look
like blood, the dickhead.

731
00:53:33,431 --> 00:53:35,537
Steve, come on!

732
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:39,493
He used to pull this shit,
all the time when he was a kid...

733
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:40,858
I'll be right back, okay?

734
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:42,932
Keep watching the monitors.

735
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:52,465
Fuck, Jimmy!

736
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:04,855
Jimmy.

737
00:54:04,856 --> 00:54:07,344
Jimmy! You down there?

738
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:12,946
Ooh, he must have passed out,
all the blood he lost.

739
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:23,672
Can't you get the camera
to follow him?

740
00:54:23,673 --> 00:54:25,906
That's what I'm trying to do.

741
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:44,051
Hmm. Looks like
we're having a party.

742
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:51,575
Asshole.

743
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:53,592
Ooh, Jimmy!

744
00:54:53,593 --> 00:54:55,511
I'm so scared.

745
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:57,912
My asshole
is so puckering.

746
00:54:57,913 --> 00:55:00,947
Spooky, spooky!

747
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:15,352
I see you, shithead.
Right behind the packing cases.

748
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,485
I followed your trail
of ketchup, dickhead!

749
00:55:29,274 --> 00:55:31,413
So,

750
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:33,619
wh... what do they
call you?

751
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,847
Jerky Face?

752
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:42,417
Or, uh... maybe just
Jerk-off for short?

753
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:48,339
Hey, you can stop
clowning around now, okay?

754
00:55:52,088 --> 00:55:54,194
I was just trying
to be a dad.

755
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:06,428
It's still no good.

756
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,534
Try the button on the left.

757
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:11,730
Oh, my God!

758
00:56:13,465 --> 00:56:16,018
- What the f...
- No.

759
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:21,299
Please.

760
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:25,464
You don't have to do this!

761
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,088
Please! Please!

762
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:31,128
Please.

763
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:34,132
You don't have to do this.
Please.

764
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:42,105
Let me go!

765
00:56:42,106 --> 00:56:45,971
You fucking creep!
Let me go!

766
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:50,517
No! Oh! Oh!

767
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:55,447
Leave him alone, you fucking bastard!
Leave him alone!

768
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,106
You fucking asshole.

769
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:05,275
No! No! No! No!

770
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:27,994
Look what he did to him!
Look at what he fucking did to him!

771
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,689
Okay. The basement door has a dead bolt!
We can lock him in there!

772
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:38,295
We can lock... Okay. Holy shit.
Donny, come on!

773
00:58:10,525 --> 00:58:12,309
Shit!

774
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:17,786
Help!
Somebody help us!

775
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:19,354
Help! Help!

776
00:58:19,355 --> 00:58:22,489
- We're being attacked!
- Help, please!

777
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,763
What do we do now?

778
00:58:24,764 --> 00:58:27,324
- We're trapped in here.
- Wait.

779
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,657
Who's usually the first person
in here in the morning?

780
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:32,092
Morty. Morty. He drops off
the papers around 5:30.

781
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:35,448
We're just gonna have to
hold out till then.

782
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,380
Somebody fucking help us!

783
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:42,844
The killer is in here!
Fucking help!

784
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:44,796
No one's coming.

785
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:46,966
We're on our own.

786
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:51,637
- Wait. Let's find a weapon.
- Okay.

787
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,365
Oh, my God,
we're gonna fucking die!

788
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,285
We're gonna fucking die!
We're gonna fucking die!

789
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,969
For Christ's sake!
Donny, we're not dead yet!

790
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,386
Oh, my God.

791
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:25,307
I see what he's doing.

792
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:27,931
He's killing us in the ways
that we said we'd kill him.

793
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,315
Oh, my God.

794
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:58,453
Come on, come on.

795
00:59:59,258 --> 01:00:02,013
I see it. It's in her hand.
Oh, my God.

796
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:04,254
- She's fucking frozen solid.
- The battery's dying.

797
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:07,871
God, she's gotta have the keys on her
somewhere. Come on.

798
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:10,138
Hello? Clyde!

799
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,177
Listen to me.
This battery's about to die.

800
01:00:13,178 --> 01:00:16,439
No, listen. We're trapped in a shop
with a killer, and...

801
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:20,700
No, this isn't Mona!

802
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,135
What do you mean,
I've got a cool style?

803
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:27,355
This isn't some jerk-off line,
you fucking moron!

804
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:30,839
There's nothing. No keys. Jimmy...
Jimmy's got the keys! I'll be back.

805
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:35,517
No, Mona's dead.

806
01:00:35,518 --> 01:00:38,426
And we're gonna be dead too unless
you stop asking these stupid fucking...

807
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,885
Are you whacking off?

808
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:50,157
- 911. What's your...
- Hello? Hello?

809
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:54,584
Fuck!

810
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:01,621
Jess, I found them.

811
01:01:02,399 --> 01:01:04,728
Donny, run! Upstairs!

812
01:01:31,614 --> 01:01:33,532
Help!

813
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:35,518
Can somebody hear me?

814
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:38,494
Somebody
fucking help us!

815
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,185
Hide. Hide.

816
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:43,617
Oh, shit!

817
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:45,301
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

818
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:58,489
- Shit! He's coming.
- Fuck, fuck.

819
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,807
What?

820
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,179
- Now what?
- Shh.

821
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,306
Do you think he's gone?

822
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:02,368
I don't know. I don't know.
I didn't see him...

823
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:03,969
I didn't see him
go right downstairs.

824
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,939
I didn't hear him
go back downstairs.

825
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,837
Do you think it's safe
to open the door a little?

826
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:45,152
Jess, listen.

827
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:47,648
I'm sorry
I got you into this.

828
01:04:47,649 --> 01:04:49,568
It's okay, Donny.
Don't...

829
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:51,489
It's not your fault.

830
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,556
We'll get out of this.

831
01:04:58,271 --> 01:05:01,400
What was that?

832
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:06,146
Wait, you heard that, right?

833
01:05:06,147 --> 01:05:08,386
Was it him?

834
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,562
It sounded like it was coming
from downstairs.

835
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:12,982
It sounded like
a truck pulling up.

836
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:17,406
It must be Morty.

837
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:19,808
What do you think he's gonna do
when he sees the store's closed?

838
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:22,682
Did you call the police?

839
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:26,146
Jess, Jess, don't...
Jess, don't, don't!

840
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:28,253
- Don't...
- Donny, just stay here.

841
01:05:34,016 --> 01:05:36,321
Steve!

842
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:39,490
Steve, you drunken bum, wake up!
Come on! It's time to open up!

843
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:42,338
- Morty!
- Well.

844
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:45,213
I see Steve put his wallet
where his mouth is. I like that.

845
01:05:45,214 --> 01:05:47,229
We were attacked last night.

846
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,471
- It was that serial killer.
- What?

847
01:05:49,472 --> 01:05:51,188
Jess, if this is some kinda joke...

848
01:05:51,189 --> 01:05:52,354
- or something...
- It's not a joke!

849
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:54,394
Jimmy and Steve and Mona
are dead.

850
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:57,314
What? Are you kidding me?

851
01:05:57,315 --> 01:05:59,042
He's downstairs!
Call the cops now!

852
01:05:59,043 --> 01:06:00,862
Okay, okay.

853
01:06:00,863 --> 01:06:03,167
Give these to them.

854
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,185
Tell them Donny and I
are trapped upstairs.

855
01:06:05,186 --> 01:06:08,066
- You sure he's still downstairs?
- Yes!

856
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:11,170
And this is the guy with the 1/2-a-million
dollar reward on his head?

857
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:13,539
- Morty, just get the fucking police!
- One second.

858
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,870
- One second.
- Morty!

859
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,247
He's in the basement. He's got
some sort of power tools going on...

860
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:35,552
- down there.
- Oh, no. Don't you even think about it!

861
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:38,753
If he's in the basement,
I can lock him in!

862
01:06:38,754 --> 01:06:40,898
Are you crazy?
Listen to me!

863
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:44,219
Jess, I could really
use that reward.

864
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,269
What's going on?

865
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,193
He's after a piece
of that reward money.

866
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:54,113
What?

867
01:06:54,114 --> 01:06:56,162
He thinks that he can
lock him in the basement.

868
01:06:56,163 --> 01:06:59,228
- There's no door!
- Exactly.

869
01:07:53,058 --> 01:07:56,832
Jess, listen, if he wants to be a hero,
it's his funeral, okay?

870
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,075
Jess, we are safe here.

871
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:02,660
- Yeah, we're safe, but what about Morty?
- Jess, please.

872
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,580
There's a killer down there!

873
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,725
Jess, we have to think
about ourselves.

874
01:08:06,726 --> 01:08:09,407
Jesus, Donny,
we should help him!

875
01:08:09,408 --> 01:08:11,130
Wait... Jess, wait.

876
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:15,165
Fuck! Fuck.

877
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:24,413
Jesus! Jess!
You scared the hell out of me!

878
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:25,531
What the hell are you doing?

879
01:09:25,532 --> 01:09:28,295
He's down there!
I hear him walking around!

880
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:29,825
Are you sure?

881
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:31,748
One hundred percent.

882
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:34,203
Look, let's put some boxes here
and pen him in.

883
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,454
Yeah.

884
01:09:51,494 --> 01:09:53,412
We got the fucker.

885
01:09:53,413 --> 01:09:56,934
Now I wonder half a million bucks
split 3 ways is gonna be?

886
01:09:56,935 --> 01:10:00,481
We got him!
Donny, we got him!

887
01:10:06,308 --> 01:10:08,509
- Jess, it's Morty!
- What?

888
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,046
Cleanup on aisle three.

889
01:11:41,061 --> 01:11:43,269
Come on.

890
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,933
Is he dead?

891
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,041
I don't know.
Let's hurry.

892
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:52,169
Donny!

893
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,397
Donny! No! Get up!

894
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:57,824
You can't do this to me now!

895
01:12:50,376 --> 01:12:52,938
Mmm.

896
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:56,772
I almost won me a goldfish.

897
01:12:56,773 --> 01:13:00,511
Donny Doughnut.
Look at you, huh?

898
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:04,768
I knew those doughnuts
were gonna be the death of you.

899
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,840
Let me go.
Let me go. Let me go.

900
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:10,759
Donny.

901
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,886
Donny Doughnut.

902
01:13:14,596 --> 01:13:17,284
Where's Jess?

903
01:13:17,285 --> 01:13:19,878
Where's Jess,
you sick fuck?

904
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:22,529
Watch the language
there, Doughnut.

905
01:13:24,616 --> 01:13:26,722
She's right behind you.

906
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:44,329
You didn't have to kill her,
you sick fuck!

907
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:46,694
You didn't have to kill her!

908
01:13:46,695 --> 01:13:48,677
Sick?

909
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:50,783
I'm sick?

910
01:13:54,857 --> 01:13:58,056
No, everything I did tonight to them...

911
01:13:58,057 --> 01:14:01,443
is what they said they were gonna do
to me if they caught me.

912
01:14:01,444 --> 01:14:04,775
But I have the "get up and go"
to get it done.

913
01:14:04,776 --> 01:14:06,695
Hmm?

914
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:10,281
You're a fuckin' lunatic!
You're a fuckin' lunatic!

915
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:12,386
I'm a lunatic?

916
01:14:13,418 --> 01:14:17,478
For 25 years, I've been hauling
shit around here.

917
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:20,870
For 25 years, I've been listening
to losers like yourself...

918
01:14:20,871 --> 01:14:23,910
talk about how you're
gonna be big shots.

919
01:14:23,911 --> 01:14:26,343
About your dreams.

920
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:29,224
You know what?
I thought about my dreams.

921
01:14:29,225 --> 01:14:33,123
Yeah, what about me?
This little voice in my head...

922
01:14:33,124 --> 01:14:35,941
It said,
"What do you wanna do?

923
01:14:35,942 --> 01:14:38,438
What were you born to do?"

924
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:41,864
- You're a twisted fuck, you know that?
- Hmm? Twisted?

925
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:47,337
Hmm. The difference
between you and me, Donny boy,

926
01:14:47,338 --> 01:14:50,079
is that I have a work ethic.

927
01:14:52,712 --> 01:14:54,817
So,

928
01:14:57,063 --> 01:15:00,394
Donny Doughnut.

929
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,314
Hmm.

930
01:15:02,315 --> 01:15:04,454
What am I gonna do with you?

931
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,330
Hmm?

932
01:15:08,328 --> 01:15:10,720
I've been thinking about this.

933
01:15:11,431 --> 01:15:14,858
How am I gonna...
finish you off?

934
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:16,778
No, wait. Wait!

935
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:18,890
Wait, wait, wait,
w... w... wait.

936
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:22,149
Wait? Wait?
Wait, wait, wait?

937
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,710
No. There's no waiting.

938
01:15:24,711 --> 01:15:26,945
I'm behind schedule
as it is.

939
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:31,876
If you kill me,
you'll never get what you came for.

940
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:38,559
Really?

941
01:15:39,303 --> 01:15:42,370
And what is it
that I came here for?

942
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:46,409
You watch it, don't you?

943
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:49,450
On tape, after.

944
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:52,619
You'll never find 'em
'cause he hides 'em...

945
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,722
all of 'em.

946
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,224
- You're lying.
- Yeah?

947
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:03,620
Why would I lie
at a time like this?

948
01:16:06,347 --> 01:16:10,657
It's no fun if you can't watch
the instant replay, right?

949
01:18:21,226 --> 01:18:23,187
What I wanna know...

950
01:18:23,188 --> 01:18:26,988
where the hell all these fuckers learned
to get so creative, huh?

951
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:29,036
I know. There's gotta be some kinda
serial killer university...

952
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:32,237
- they're not telling us about.
- And what they did to that store owner...

953
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:35,274
Gross, man. Damn!

954
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:39,017
Hey, that's nothing compared to
what I would do to that son of a bitch...

955
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:41,004
- if he ever got into my store.
- Yeah.

956
01:18:41,005 --> 01:18:43,565
Oh, yeah?

957
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:45,739
What do you have in mind?

958
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:05,066
# Don't hate the game
Don't hate the player #

959
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:09,322
# Better watch your mouth
'cause what you say might kill ya #

960
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:13,322
# Some want the fame
I have no shame #

961
01:19:13,323 --> 01:19:15,725
# I'm just justified
for takin' lives #

962
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:18,125
# So please forgive me #

963
01:19:18,126 --> 01:19:21,960
# I know the place
the day, the time #

964
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:25,802
# Get ready for
your demise #

965
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:29,643
# I listen to
every word you say #

966
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:32,684
# The time is near
and I'm ready to play #

967
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:36,459
# Don't hate the game
Don't hate the player #

968
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:40,298
# Better watch your mouth
'cause what you say might kill ya #

969
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:44,459
# Some want the fame
I have no shame #

970
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,700
# I'm just justified
for takin' lives #

971
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,939
# So please forgive me #

972
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,782
# Hold it together, man
You're falling apart #

973
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:56,619
# You must be nervous
'cause I see your heart #

974
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:00,620
# Makes no difference
why you're feeling this way #

975
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:03,501
# Look in my eyes
See I'm goin' insane #

976
01:20:03,502 --> 01:20:06,542
# So let's play
Who is ready for the game #

977
01:20:06,543 --> 01:20:08,463
# Keep your head up high #

978
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:10,377
# It's your turn, don't cry #

979
01:20:10,378 --> 01:20:12,457
# Oh, who's ready to die #

980
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,377
# Now I'm comin' for you #

981
01:20:14,378 --> 01:20:17,100
# I know exactly what to do #

982
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,021
# So tell me how you want it #

983
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:22,862
# Don't hate the game
Don't hate the player #

984
01:20:22,863 --> 01:20:26,856
# Better watch your mouth
'cause what you say might kill ya #

985
01:20:26,857 --> 01:20:30,859
# Some want the fame
I have no shame #

986
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,940
# I'm just justified
for takin' lives #

987
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:35,687
# So please forgive me #
