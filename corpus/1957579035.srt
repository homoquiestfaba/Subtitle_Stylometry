1
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,619
Is there something wrong
with the prototype?

2
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,510
No, it's working perfectly well. Too well.
That's part of the problem.

3
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,139
We're still tapping deep-core oil and
mineral reserves as per specifications.

4
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,640
Yes, but we're going beyond the agreed-upon limits.
I'm warning you, Alan.

5
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,155
If you dig too deep, the
ramifications will be irreversible.

6
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,540
Good. Important safety tip. I'll
make sure they don't dig too deep.

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,160
- And how are you gonna oversee that?
- That's what I do, Brian.

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,300
Trust me on this.

9
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,980
<i>Keep up the good work.</i>

10
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,730
It's me.

11
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,379
So, Mr. Simmons,
I hope we can work things out.

12
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,280
Bob, you want to head down to electrical?
We got a little problem with 17.

13
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,300
Thanks.

14
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,040
At least we know you work.

15
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,430
Mr. po, this is the main unit.
Ah.

16
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,919
May our futures shine bright
with fortune, Mr. morrissey.

17
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,950
Gentlemen, I suggest
you clear the area.

18
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,450
Brian, what the hell
are you doing?

19
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,450
Jesus.

20
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,959
Oh, Jesus.

21
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,709
Get out! Move! Move! Everybody
clear the building! Get 'em out!

22
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,210
<i>Get them out! Everyone move, move, move!
Get out now!</i>

23
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,219
What the hell are you doing?

24
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,720
You are throwing away 15 years of research,
15 years of friendship on a bloody whim!

25
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,980
I tried to talk to you, Alan.
You wouldn't listen.

26
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
You lost sight
of what's important.

27
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,250
You sold out. You are crazy!
Jesus!

28
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,699
We are losing
1,000 barrels a day.

29
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,199
Keep your pants on.
These things take time.

30
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,199
But your men, they are crazy.
They're exploding the wrong well.

31
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Bedecker!

32
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,209
Bedecker!

33
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,709
How's it hangin', bri?
All right.

34
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,209
Gonzalez here thinks you're
putting it in the wrong hole.

35
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,210
Really? Oh, that's what my
ex-wife used to tell me.

36
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,230
Go talk to Sam.

37
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Come on.

38
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,250
Hey, Sam. Hey, Brian,
you ready to rock?

39
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,739
Gonzalez here seems to think we might have
put the dynamite down the wrong well.

40
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
What'd make you think that?

41
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,260
The well outside is 50 meters
from the one that is on fire.

42
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,250
You got a well on fire?

43
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm just pullin' your chain,
buddy.

44
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,759
First of all,
we ain't usin' dynamite.

45
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,259
We're usin'
a directional shape charge.

46
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,759
And second, that well out
there, that ain't a well...

47
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,260
'Cause it's drier
than a nun's noodle.

48
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,780
Damn, I'd like to meet the chowderhead
who told him to drill there.

49
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,270
That was me.

50
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,769
Why, hell's bells, son.
That was a damn good call.

51
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,770
Saved us lots
of dangerous work.

52
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,279
See, at the bottom of this
magnificently useless hole...

53
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,279
Is a very useful fissure.

54
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,780
Now how'd you know
that'd be there?

55
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,660
Anyhoo, this ol' fissure runs
at a 22-degree diagonal slant...

56
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,159
That lines up perfectly with the
bottom of this here active well,

57
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,165
which is, at the moment, doin' a pretty
good impersonation of my butt...

58
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,660
After eatin' a bowl of that diabolical
menudo they serve on that truck.

59
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,669
Got any questions?

60
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,680
H-how do you know that
the fissure's angle is correct?

61
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,170
If I told you that,

62
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,190
I wouldn't be makin'
the big bucks, now would I?

63
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,190
All right. Here we go.
Fire in the hole.

64
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,469
All right. Break's over.
Let's get back to work.

65
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,970
<i>Pena, no smoking.</i>

66
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,489
- <i>It's impossible. How did he know?
- Sam?</i>

67
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,990
Hell, I stopped tryin' to figure
him out a long time ago.

68
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,509
Six, zero, four.

69
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,009
I've got exterior temperature
reading of 604 degrees celsius.

70
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,509
Speed and depth?

71
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,520
Sixty percent speed at twenty kilometers
per hour, sixty-two clicks down.

72
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,040
Your position's well within
the safety parameters, Mac.

73
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,029
- Six, six, two.
- Well, that's just peachy keen.

74
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,030
We've got 662 degrees outside
and climbing.

75
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,045
Now, maintain course, Mac. We've got you
within five minutes of the target reserve.

76
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:13,539
- <i>Seven, zero, zero.
- Seven, zero, zero.</i>

77
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,040
Repeat. Seven hundred degrees
exterior temperature.

78
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,060
I'm shuttin' this puppy down.

79
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,570
Damn it! Get me morrissey on the horn.

80
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,069
What's up?

81
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,569
Exterior temp.
Mac shut her down again.

82
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,569
Am I gonna have to get
a bloody shovel...

83
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,570
And dig down there and kick
his little white ass myself?

84
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,090
It-it-it's... he's the skipper.
He called it.

85
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,079
Patch me through.

86
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,079
Patch him through on 14.

87
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,580
Morrissey, go on 14.

88
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,600
What's wrong?

89
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,090
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

90
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,610
We hit yellow line exterior
temperature, 700 degrees.

91
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,099
I shut down for protocol.
Screw protocol.

92
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,599
The heat shields are rated
to take twice that.

93
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Nine-fifty and climbing.

94
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,109
- Hold on.
-

95
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,109
what are you saying?
Speak English.

96
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,609
What
are you saying? Speak English!

97
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,610
Run up the temp. Get out!

98
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,125
Too hot! Have to get out!
Jesus.

99
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,619
What's happening? What's happening?
Somebody talk to me.

100
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,620
- What's our e.T.A.?
- We should be there in five minutes.

101
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,130
It's spiking,
1,500 degrees celsius.

102
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,149
Jesus Christ.

103
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,155
What happened?
What happened, people?

104
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:01,649
I don't know. I got something.

105
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,150
On screen.

106
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,159
Everybody, clear out!

107
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,290
Now!

108
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,170
Oh, no. No. Tell the pilot not to land.
Tell him not to land!

109
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Don't land. Yes, sir.
Let's get it up.

110
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,570
Pull up, Mac!
Pull up!

111
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,849
Altitude. Get up!

112
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,850
Altitude! Get it up!
Come on!

113
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,245
Here's to the best damn wildcatters
in the whole damn world.

114
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:32,740
Here's to risking your life to make
some other asshole rich. Hear! Hear!

115
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,249
I think that we should
strike out on our own.

116
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,755
I think that we should
find our own damn oil,

117
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,749
drill our own damn well and make
our own damn selves rich.

118
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,250
Oh, see.
That's a good idea.

119
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,270
Have to call my investment
banker in the morning.

120
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,759
Hey, we could save our money.
We could bank it all together.

121
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah? How much you got saved from
your last paycheck, bed wetter?

122
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,269
<i>By the way, this is your round.</i>

123
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,270
- Would you just...
- Oh!

124
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,279
- Would you put it on my account?
- Oh!

125
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,785
Here's the budding young
capitalist with his hand out.

126
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,780
- "I need some money."
- You're pathetic.

127
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
There you go, honey.
Keep that.

128
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,789
Well, who knows?

129
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,300
Maybe one of these days
one of us will win the lottery.

130
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:23,790
The lottery.
To the damn lottery.

131
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,799
What is that?
The mother ship?

132
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,300
No, it's okay.
Just ask for directions.

133
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,310
Uh, you folks lost?

134
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,819
Y-yeah.
As a matter of fact, we are.

135
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,819
Um, we're looking for...

136
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,070
Guadelupe de Las, uh, cruces.
Uh, cruces.

137
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,079
Oh, man.
Guadelupe de Las...

138
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,079
You really are lost.
You got a map?

139
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,579
If we had a map,
we wouldn't be lost.

140
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,580
You know, I said to Henry to
please stop a few hours back...

141
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,345
So that you could get directions,
but you wouldn't, would you?

142
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,340
- <i>So here we are, lost, and...
- I don't speak Spanish, darling.</i>

143
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,340
No, no, no. It doesn't matter if
you don't speak Spanish, honey,

144
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,860
because...
Directions are pictures.

145
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,850
<i>Well, no need to fight.</i>

146
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,350
Uh, go back about 20 Miles
to this crossroad,

147
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,360
turn left, head due east.

148
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
You should get there in say... well,
I don't know... two or three days.

149
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,369
- East?
- Where the sun rises, sweetheart.

150
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,370
Yeah, I know where the sun rises, dear.
I got it.

151
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,370
- You sure, darling?
- I'm sure.

152
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,379
Dear.
Thanks for the help.

153
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,379
- Y'all on your honeymoon?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

154
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
<i>Lucky guess. You know,
the rosy glow of happiness.</i>

155
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,639
<i>Hey, you, uh,
done with that paper?</i>

156
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,139
Uh, well, I'm still working
on the crossword, so, um...

157
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,640
Give him the paper, lily.

158
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,149
Darling, it's my...
Crossword. Now.

159
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,149
- Sweetie. Thanks.
- Sure. Thank you.

160
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Good life!

161
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,170
Why do you always tell me
what I'm supposed to do?

162
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,659
Whew!
Mm.

163
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,160
- I give it a few weeks.
- I give it a few days.

164
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,669
- I give it a few minutes.
- Hey, give me the comics.

165
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,670
There aren't any comics.
This is the <i>New York tribune.</i>

166
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,679
What the hell kind of fish wrap
doesn't have funny pages?

167
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,685
A grown-up newspaper.
Here. Look at the sports.

168
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,679
I'm an arts-and-leisure man
myself.

169
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,180
Really? Never would've
figured that. Oh.

170
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,200
I am a man
of sublime refinement.

171
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,190
Yeah.

172
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,699
Shit.

173
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,699
Hey, where are you goin'?

174
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
What happened?

175
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,220
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.

176
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,369
Is he in?
Sir.

177
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,870
<i>Sir, you can't go in there.
Sir!</i>

178
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,870
Hope you're happy
with yourself.

179
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,370
What are you doing here? You
rebuilt the u.S.D.M., didn't you?

180
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,890
Yeah, what do you expect me to do?
You destroyed the whole damn thing.

181
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,879
Congratulations. You just triggered
global destabilization.

182
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,380
Come on, Brian.
That's just a theory.

183
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,389
Don't give me your shit! Brian,
you need psychological help!

184
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm calling the police. What about
that island where you were drilling?

185
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,389
Just disappeared?

186
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,390
Should I call someone?
I'll take care of this.

187
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,900
There have already been
earthquakes along the rim...

188
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,899
Emanating out from where
the island used to be.

189
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,400
It's clear and damning
as a fingerprint, pal.

190
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,409
Really?
You can't prove any of this.

191
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,910
Maybe not now, but if
my simulations are right,

192
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,425
there are gonna be other quakes
in southeast Asia,

193
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,920
South America, central America,
on up to north America.

194
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,919
I've already contacted
a.P. And CNN,

195
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
given them times,
places and magnitudes.

196
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,440
Right now I'm probably the biggest nutcase
on fire, but when this happens,

197
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:41,930
they're gonna be real interested
in talking to me... and you.

198
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,450
There's still time, Alan.
We can stop it.

199
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,960
Maybe we should talk.

200
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,449
We've stepped up work
on the series two version...

201
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,950
Of the u.S.D.M.
At our facility in hainan.

202
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,959
China? Yeah, the island
off the Gulf of tonkin.

203
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,959
That's where
we're headed for now.

204
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,959
R&ds have indicated that the vehicle
should be up and on-line...

205
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Within a few hours
of our arrival.

206
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,470
It's good
to have you back, Brian.

207
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,969
I'd like to meet the guy who
tried to duplicate my research,

208
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,589
'cause whoever he is,
he's got his head up his ass.

209
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,589
- Her ass.
- Ah.

210
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,840
Brian Goodman, meet the head
of our research and development,

211
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,860
Dr. Allison... Saunders.
M.I.T., right?

212
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,350
Yeah, I've, uh, seen a few of
your papers in the journals.

213
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,370
Really?
Mm-hmm.

214
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,359
I'm impressed.
So what did you think?

215
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,860
Never finished one.

216
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,129
So it's a tight
time-frame signature.

217
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,630
At 3:39,
the drilling catastrophe.

218
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,130
At 4:05, the Tsunami
hits Japan's Southern coast.

219
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,639
Quakes here,
here and along here...

220
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,639
All due to the
destabilization of the pacific.

221
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Yeah, the pacific rift.

222
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,649
<i>See, according
to my calculations,</i>

223
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,160
we have approximately 48 hours before
the, uh, next trembler hits,

224
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:24,150
somewhere in the vicinity of,
uh, central America.

225
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,159
If it happens,
we might know in 48 hours.

226
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,159
If it does happen, you
might as well say your prayers.

227
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,659
What?
This thing gets worse?

228
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,160
<i>Well, the continents,
as we know them...</i>

229
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,180
Let's just say it would be a good time
to invest in the map-making business.

230
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,670
- That could really happen?
- In theory.

231
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,680
Other models show
a relief in pressure.

232
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,190
In fact, it may have already
happened with the previous events.

233
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:51,179
Maybe. Maybe not.

234
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Okay, fine. What do you geniuses
think you can do about this?

235
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,689
We take the series two vehicle
from the hainan facility.

236
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,195
We drill three deep core Wells
here, here and here.

237
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:04,189
That should vent the tectonic
pressure and stabilize the plates.

238
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,190
You gotta be kidding me!

239
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,210
Now, you know, I don't have to take this.
No, no, no, no, no.

240
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,199
You've just breached
the mantle.

241
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,199
The earth's core is like an engine
that's whining full-out in neutral.

242
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,700
If you drill those holes...
What'd you call them? Vents?

243
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,709
You might as well
call them afterburners.

244
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,710
You've just created directional
propulsion, like a jet,

245
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,210
only you've dropped the engine
from neutral down into drive.

246
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
You've just accelerated the hell
out of what you started.

247
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,219
Okay, Mr. wizard.

248
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,220
That's Dr. wizard to you.

249
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:42,229
Dr. wizard. Now that you've trashed
my idea, do you have a better one?

250
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,730
I can only think of one.

251
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,150
How far down are we?
About 300 meters.

252
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,655
A nuclear bomb?
Are you out of your mind?

253
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,649
No, not <i>a nuclear bomb.
We need a series of them.</i>

254
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,650
We need to synchronize detonations
of precise seams along the plates.

255
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,665
How do you plan to set off
a synchronized detonation?

256
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,659
You Daisy-chain them
with fiber optics.

257
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,659
And that should initiate a subtectonic
wave form which should...

258
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,160
Shift the pacific plate
several Miles in a few minutes.

259
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,175
Do you have any idea
what that will do?

260
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:38,170
Well, it should drive the
plates right into the java trench.

261
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,670
And that would cool the mantle.
Jesus! Exactly.

262
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,679
Well, would it work? Yeah.
Yeah. It might.

263
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,679
But where exactly do you expect to
get these devices? Nukes-r-us?

264
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Unfortunately,
I hadn't gotten that far yet.

265
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll take care of it.

266
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,730
This way.

267
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,719
What do you mean
you'll take care of it?

268
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,230
One phone call to our friends in Beijing,
and we'll get whatever we need.

269
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,239
And by the way, I've got some
people in mind for the crew.

270
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,750
All right.

271
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,250
Well, there she is.

272
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,759
God, I'm good.

273
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,259
Please. False modesty doesn't
become anyone, least of all you.

274
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,760
Gotta give credit
where credit is due.

275
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,270
Thank you.

276
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,290
When it's due.

277
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,150
Let's get to work.

278
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,159
I see you've made
some modifications.

279
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,660
Yeah. It took six months to recover
your project data and your notes...

280
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,169
And another year
to get past your design flaws.

281
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,175
You're not much of a practical engineer.
Well, thank you.

282
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,669
These heat shields? Uh-huh.
Same as the space shuttle.

283
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,670
With a few
chemical modifications,

284
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,179
it increases the specs
to 2,500 degrees centigrade.

285
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,680
How do you deal with the
communications at these depths? Mmm.

286
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,180
We hook it in up top, and
we reel it out as we dig.

287
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,189
Two coffee cans and a string.
I love it.

288
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,690
Primitive, but with
the various strata of minerals,

289
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,710
it's the best thing
we've been able to come up with.

290
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,699
That's brilliant.
Sure you didn't go to Cal tech?

291
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
I had a full ride at m.I.T.

292
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,700
Why would I want to go
to a second-rate institution?

293
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,709
What? Hold on.
What's that flash for?

294
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,709
You know, I don't know.

295
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,210
It was one of the modifications
per the Chinese specs.

296
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,710
No. You've misunderstood my question.
Let me rephrase.

297
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,230
What is a flange with seedings for explosive
bolts doing on the back of a u.S.D.M.?

298
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:44,219
They said something
about a cargo hold.

299
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,720
What would a drilling machine
need a cargo hold for?

300
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,740
Look, it was an easy
alteration, so I made it.

301
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,245
Ally's bringing a simulator on-line so
you can get up to speed with the stick.

302
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,739
We figure 12 hours
to work with the crew.

303
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Okay, good. That'll give you
eight hours of prep time.

304
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,249
And, uh, 12 hours
to seed the bombs.

305
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,260
What's the e.T.A.
On the nukes?

306
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,249
They're already airborne. I reckon five
hours from Beijing. Where were we?

307
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,750
- Seeding the bombs.
- Okay, so that gives you 12 hours...

308
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,770
To clear before detonation
with a two-hour safety margin.

309
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,760
Two hours?

310
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Morning, gentlemen...
And lady.

311
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,269
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Chang, physics;

312
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,269
<i>Dr. lu, seismology;</i>

313
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,270
<i>Dr. Lee, demolition.</i>

314
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,290
<i>I thought you should get to know
each other, since you'll be...</i>

315
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,280
Simmons, could I have
a word with you?

316
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,419
What is it?

317
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,920
Who are these guys?
This is your team.

318
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,929
This is...
What happened to my guys?

319
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,430
These people have been trained
and cleared with security.

320
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,445
Why do I get the feeling
that their security clearance...

321
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,439
Is more important
than their training?

322
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,440
You know it's not like that. We wouldn't
pick these people if they weren't...

323
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,450
This is the backup crew
from the last mission.

324
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,470
And we all know how well
that went.

325
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,489
Now, Mr. lu, we're gonna
need to pinpoint the fissures...

326
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,990
And pressure points right here
along this Ridge, okay?

327
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,505
Now the explosions
will basically act like...

328
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,999
Pushing the first domino
in a long line of dominoes.

329

00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,350
<i>Huh?</i>

496
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,879
T.K. Four, two, ones...
And an eleven thirty-eight.

497
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,880
It is gonna be so hard
to go back to c4...

498
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,400
After playin' with you guys.

499
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,389
Halloween's over, Alan.

500
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,890
I'm coming along, Brian.
No way.

501
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,905
Look, this is my machine.
If I don't go, no one does.

502
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:14,399
Look, everyone on the team is qualified to
be on the team. That is the bottom line.

503
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
- No. The bottom line is people have been
-

504
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,409
my father, my brother, you.

505
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,909
I made this mess, Brian.

506
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,909
I need to be part of the cleanup team.
It's that simple.

507
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,910
I'm not gonna let you risk your life.
Well, do it as a favor then.

508
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,419
- Do me the favor of letting me come along.
-

509
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,430
Brian, I've never asked you for anything
before in my life. I need this.

510
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,920
You did ask me
for something once.

511
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,940
Yeah, well, you know. Copying
your homework doesn't count.

512
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:44,929
Mm-mmm.
Michelle's phone number,

513
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,930
and I gave it to you.

514
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,950
Yeah, but... that was no favor.
Believe me.

515
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Thanks a lot, man.

516
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,460
Yeah.

517
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,470
All right. Let's get
this show on the road.

518
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,960
Start the countdown.
Yes, sir.

519
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,020
Any of you kids gotta go
to the bathroom, I'd do it now.

520
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,519
Sam, composition.

521
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,520
<i>Ninety-three percent shale and a pinch
of obsidian, just to make it a bitch.</i>

522
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,530
Ten, nine, eight,

523
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,539
seven, six, five,
four, three...

524
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,539
Two, one.

525
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
Initiate drilling generator.

526
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,560
- What do you say we put this bucket of bolts into drive?
- Rock and roll.

527
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,070
- Yee-haw!
- Do it.

528
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,839
Fifty-six degree
inclination.

529
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
All right.
Take it to 60.

530
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,360
Speed and heading? Eight Miles
an hour, north, northwest.

531
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:33,849
- Rodney, watch the cabin pressure.
- I'm on it.

532
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,850
- <i>Sam, composition.
- Granite, 77%.</i>

533
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,370
Ten percent shale and, oh, thirteen percent nickel.
Short pocket. Hang on.

534
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,510
Fissure comin' up.
Heading two degrees starboard.

535
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,519
Let's level her out.

536
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,519
Depth?

537
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,519
Four point three kilometers
at seventeen kph.

538
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,530
Comin' in on the first drop
point in three, two, one.

539
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,039
All right, Rodney.
You're up.

540
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,050
Hey, you got a please for me? You're gonna get
an ass-whippin' if I hear any more back talk.

541
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:34,540
Yes, sir.

542
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,049
How ya enjoyin' the ride,
blue eyes?

543
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,049
- Yes, it's-it's good.
-

544
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
bombs away.

545
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,570
I have always
wanted to say that.

546
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,720
Drilling telemetry, 70% output.

547
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,735
Eighty-five, ninety-seven
and stasis holding.

548
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,729
Sam, give me a read
on those compositions.

549
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,230
Ninety-two percent granite,
four percent limestone.

550
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,250
Set pitch at
point zero, zero, four.

551
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,760
Alan, you got
a depth reading back there?

552
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,249
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
Four point eight.

553
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:52,750
- Four point eight, one? Four point eight, two.
- What?

554
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,270
Four point eight, three.
Four point eight, four.

555
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,769
Eight, six. Rodney, offset
the cabin pressure.

556
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,275
<i>Delay that. We're at
one point two atmospheres.</i>

557
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:07,769
- I said offset the pressure.
- One, two. I'm looking right at it.

558
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,770
Then it's malfunctioning. Use your head.
You know the depth.

559
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,285
Calculate it.
I'm running diagnostics.

560
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,779
There's no time.
Offset the pressure.

561
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,779
They're 4.89. What the
hell's he waiting for?

562
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,280
- Ally, what are the calculations?
-

563
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,789
one, six.

564
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
I fixed it.

565
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,330
Number two on the hit parade.

566
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,829
Somebody wanna tell
me what that was all about?

567
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,829
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

568
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,830
All right, Rodney.
It's all you.

569
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,080
I don't know what happened.

570
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,090
We need to recalibrate.

571
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,090
Give me an update. They just
deployed the second device.

572
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,599
Goodman, how's that vehicle
holding up?

573
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Just some minor
software problems so far.

574
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,615
Any seismic readings
we should worry about?

575
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:37,609
There's been a series of small movements in
the South China sea, but nothing abnormal.

576
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,610
Nothing abnormal? You gotta
keep us informed, okay?

577
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,125
- You just do your job. I'll do mine.
- That's fine.

578
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,119
But we need to know
about any disturbance.

579
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Are we understood?

580
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,139
Man, it is hotter
than Dutch love in here.

581
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,139
Rodney, are those heat shields intact?
Uh, yeah. They're fine.

582
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,640
Why the hell is it
so hot in here?

583
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,149
Oh, the heat synch's
aren't cycling.

584
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,149
Sam, what's the exterior temp?

585
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,650
Two, four, zero degrees.

586
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,660
It's grinding.
We must be caught on something.

587
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,169
Shut all stations down now!

588
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,170
- Why did they stop?
- I don't know, sir.

589
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,190
Goodman, what the hell's
goin' on down there?

590
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,179
Just give me a second.

591
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,179
All right. What in the
hell's goin' on here?

592
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh, looks like a chunk of
corundum busted that u-joint.

593
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,200
Can we fix it? I don't know.
Looks pretty bad.

594
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,189
Ally?
We gotta try.

595
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,189
All right. We got a major problem here.
We just blew a tire.

596
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,190
I want Saunders and another man
on it right now.

597
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,699
You got it. I'm on it.
I'm going.

598
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,699
<i>No way. For Christ's
sake, I'm in this too.</i>

599
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Can't you just trust me?
It's not it, Alan.

600
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,220
<i>Rodney, you wanna give her a hand?
Yeah. Sure.</i>

601
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,730
Hey, watch out for heat buildup
in them walls. Magma flow?

602
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:27,219
I don't like
the way this looks.

603
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,219
Watch your back.

604
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,220
Wanna keep an eye
on the cabin pressure?

605
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,290
Get me a time frame.

606
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,280
Goodman, how long's
it gonna take?

607
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,780
As long as it takes.

608
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,300
Desk jockey.

609
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,290
Damn, it's hot in here.

610
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,330
The u-joint is toast.

611
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,319
How long's it gonna take?
Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

612
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,820
I'll tell you what. Make it 15 and Mr. wizard
will show you his favorite magic trick.

613
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,829
I thought that was
Dr. wizard.

614
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,830
Rodney, pick up
the speed, dude.

615
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Thank you.

616
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,849
<i>Man!</i>

617
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,849
What's goin' on?
Oh, I don't like it.

618
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,850
Here we are down nearly 200 kilometers
and there's no sign of mantle density.

619
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,359
Look there.
You're right.

620
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,860
Flow channel.

621
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,860
Exactly. What else? What else?

622
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:47,169
I'm gettin' heat fluctuations
all over the place. Shit.

623
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,169
Let me use that.

624
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,670
All right, guys.
Wrap it up now.

625
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,190
We're almost done.
Another minute.

626
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,680
All right. I'm gonna go back
and look at the rear tread.

627
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,210
This kettle's about to pop.

628
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,199
Look, I said get the hell
outta there right now!

629
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
Oh, my God!

630
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,979
They're down.
Pocket's breached.

631
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,480
Jesus. Brian!
Brian!

632
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,500
Philippines.
Mount pinatubo just blew.

633
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,990
Tell them to move outta there.

634
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,990
Brian!
Don't open that hatch.

635
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,010
Brian, they're already dead!
Brian, you gotta save the ship.

636
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
Comp check. Bedecker's
trapped in the flow.

637
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,020
I don't see Saunders.
We gotta go, man.

638
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,510
I gotta see for myself.

639
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,519
Goodman, come in. Goodman?
Anybody in the cockpit, come in.

640
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,020
This is the u.S.D.M. We have a serious problem.
We're trying to fix it.

641
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,029
Morrissey,

642
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,029
I want that vehicle
moved outta there right now.

643
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,530
We do not leave our people.

644
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,050
Morrissey, can you hear me?
Morrissey?

645
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,059
Morrissey, get outta there.
This vehicle ain't budgin'.

646
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,070
You can't move it
from up there, sir.

647
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,079
The girl's dead. Get outta there.
Morrissey!

648
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,090
All right, Sam,
get us the hell outta here.

649
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,100
You got it, Brian.

650
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,600
Okay, let's get this
moving, Sam. Come on.

651
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,490
You okay?

652
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,489
Rodney. I know.

653
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,490
It's okay.

654
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,010
Come on, now.
We gotta get outta here.

655
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,530
You okay?

656
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,520
She's fine.

657
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
We clear the magma flow?

658
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:48,540
We cleared the flow. We're coming
up on drop point number three now.

659
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:52,530
Okay, shut her down.

660
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,539
Bedecker was
one hell of a wildcatter.

661
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,040
Yes, he was.
None better.

662
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:12,550
It's me.

663
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,570
Goodman, it's Simmons.
What went wrong down there?

664
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,060
We lost Rodney.

665
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,060
Look, mount pinatubo just blew.

666
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,569
What?

667
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:32,569
Mount pinatubo.

668
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,570
That means
we're just about out of time.

669
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,090
Was there any damage
to the vehicle?

670
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,080
No, we're just fine.
Thanks.

671
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,590
Who are these partners
of yours anyway...

672
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Who care more about the safety
of the vehicle than our lives?

673
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,599
I guess it's pretty obvious now
they're not Chinese businessmen.

674
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,110
I guess I knew all along.
I decided to turn a blind eye.

675
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,609
They're the Chinese government.

676
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,110
Jesus, I ain't no big fan
of the U.S. government,

677
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,130
<i>but I'd draw the line
at being a traitor.</i>

678
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,620
What's their agenda?

679
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,119
Agenda?

680
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,620
Once the mission is successfully completed,
they're gonna take control of the ship.

681
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,140
- And use it as a weapon?
- Yeah.

682
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,139
Let me ask you this.

683
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,639
Is there any way that they can
detonate those nukes from up top?

684
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,640
No...

685
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,155
They could do it
through the fiber-optic line.

686
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:50,649
I'll just cut that bastard. No, no,
you can't do that. It's a fail-safe.

687
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,650
A dead-man trigger. If you cut that line,
it starts a countdown... five minutes.

688
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,170
<i>No way we can clear
the blast area after that.</i>

689
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,160
That never seemed the least bit
suspicious to you?

690
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,660
My back was up against
the wall, Brian.

691
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:08,180
We gotta get moving.
We're running outta time.

692
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,169
Someone's going to have
to deploy the nukes.

693
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,670
You know, I can handle it. I'm going
to need you at your station.

694
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,179
You too, Sam. We're comin' up on the
most critical of the drop points.

695
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,180
Well, that leaves me.

696
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,200
Well, I guess
we don't have any choice.

697
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,690
Let's get it movin'.

698
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,699
The devil you know.

699
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,710
You said it, brother man.

700
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,840
Device number three.

701
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,349
Deployment is a go.

702
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,860
- Third device deployed.
-

703
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,370
it's for you.
Beijing.

704
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,860
I'll take it in the ready room.

705
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,869
Mr. Simmons,
I trust we are on schedule.

706
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,870
Yes. Yes, we are.

707
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,379
We, uh, had some technical problems,
but they've been solved.

708
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,379
Three of the four devices
have been deployed.

709
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,880
What about our other
technical difficulties?

710
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,889
That's been taken care of.

711
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,890
We would be very disappointed if the
vessel doesn't come back into our hands.

712
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,900
Very disappointed.

713
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,910
I can assure you, colonel, that if we
don't recover the unit, no one will.

714
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:51,400
I hope so, Mr. Simmons,
for your sake.

715
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:16,929
- Hey, Brian, you got a minute?
- What's up?

716
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,429
That drillin' generator can dissolve
pretty much anything? Just about.

717
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,930
- What are the exceptions?
- Crystalline structures mostly.

718
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:26,439
Emerald or topaz. Corundum.
<i>Carbon?</i>

719
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,939
Coal, yeah.
Diamonds, no.

720
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,940
I think we got a problem. Why?

721
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,480
Unbelievable.

722
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,969
Unbelievable.

723
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,970
Uh-huh.

724
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,979
Wow.

725
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,479
What are you gonna do?

726
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,480
I don't know.

727
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,989
Talk about your solitaires.

728
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,989
Must be Miles wide.

729
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,489
Well, if it's quartz,
maybe we can dust it.

730
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:20,990
Oh, that's not quartz.
How do you know?

731
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,999
Trust me, I'm a woman.

732
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,010
We'll have to make sure. We'll
have to go out and get a sample.

733
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:27,000
How long will it take?

734
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Well, take a lot less time than
it would to navigate around it.

735
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,520
Sam.
Yep.

736
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,550
Hello, kitty!

737
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,540
Wow.

738
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:15,060
She was right.
This ain't quartz.

739
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,550
How much does it weigh?

740
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,550
Fifteen pounds.

741
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,559
Let's not get too excited,
old buddy.

742
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,060
Don't forget.
We may not make it.

743
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,609
We've got a real problem.

744
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:20,610
At current speed, it should take
us 11 hours to drive around it.

745
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,630
That's great. By that time, Las
Vegas will be a beach resort.

746
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:35,000
- Yeah?
- We're gonna have to take a long detour.

747
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,510
Reports from California. They just had
a major episode along the coast.

748
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:41,999
I got some more bad news
for you, Goodman.

749
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,500
Your California prediction
just came true.

750
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,520
You got enough time down there to
deploy those other two devices?

751
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:53,509
We're going to have to burn the
engines to keep on that time frame.

752
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:57,010
Just do what you have to do,
and keep me posted.

753
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:00,525
We have an additional problem, the
fiber-optic communications line.

754
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:05,020
What about it? They'll run out of cable
before they finish seeding the bombs.

755
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,029
How much is left?
Seventeen kilometers.

756
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:12,030
If he maintains full speed, they'll
be gone in less than an hour,

757
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:16,030
which will initiate
the countdown sequence.

758
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,545
Who signed off on that?
On what, sir?

759
01:08:18,546 --> 01:08:21,539
On the specs, the fiber-optic specs.
Who signed off?

760
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,540
Colonel po did, sir.

761
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,049
You sure about that?

762
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:32,549
Yes.
Something wrong?

763
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,550
No.

764
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:55,070
If we don't get those nukes set, there's
not gonna be much to go home for.

765
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,090
You sure these engines
can take the pressure?

766
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:00,079
They can take it.

767
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,579
We're pushing her hard, but she should
hold out long enough to outrun the blast.

768
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,580
Revvin' up on
position number four right now.

769
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,600
All righty.

770
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,100
All right, Alan, break's over.

771
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,100
I'm on it.

772
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,630
Four little piggies away.

773
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,650
One fat boy to go.

774
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,140
Bring up the communication camera
and patch me into the pod.

775
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,140
Doin' it now.

776
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,650
<i>Morrissey.</i>

777
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,150
Don't worry. They can't
see you or hear me.

778
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,660
- What do you want, Darryl?
- We have a little problem.

779
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,680
Something that might
dissolve our partnership.

780
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,669
You know,
now that you mention it,

781
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:33,169
dissolving our partnership
isn't such a bad idea.

782
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,170
You can keep the Chinese.
I'll take my business elsewhere.

783
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,190
You won't be taking
your business anywhere.

784
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,180
Stop playing games, Darryl.

785
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,180
<i>I'm not playing games.
Watch this.</i>

786
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,700
<i>That detour you took cost you
more than time, my friend.</i>

787
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,440
Oh, Jesus!
Je...

788
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,960
What the hell's going on?

789
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:02,449
The countdown for fat boy's
been initiated.

790
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,950
Someone shut off the alarm!

791
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:14,460
That limey bastard cut that fiber-optic cable.
He's the only one back there.

792
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,469
This is not making
any sense at all.

793
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,480
Take over the controls.

794
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,729
What the hell
are you doin' to us?

795
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:36,730
I messed up. I really did lose
sight of what was important.

796
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:40,745
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Oh, no, no. Can't do that.

797
01:11:40,746 --> 01:11:43,240
I said let's get
out of here. Now!

798
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,749
Back up!
Stay there.

799
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,749
Don't move any closer.

800
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,750
What are you gonna do,
kill us all?

801
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,259
You still don't trust me, huh?

802
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,760
Just leave me here, Brian.
No way.

803
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,259
Shut up and listen to me
for a change.

804
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,260
I can buy you 20 minutes by tying up the
system with a diagnostics program.

805
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,769
But I'm gonna have to baby-sit that myself.
That's the best I can do.

806
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:14,270
It's up to you guys.

807
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,790
Brian,

808
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,279
for once in my life,
you know...

809
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,780
Just for once...

810
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,290
Let me be the hero.

811
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,290
You don't have
to do this, Alan.

812
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,290
Oh, yeah.

813
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,290
Yeah, I do.

814
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:35,290
Alan!

815
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:09,840
Shut her down, Sam.
Someone jettisoned the bomb pod.

816
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,340
I'm gonna get back there
and see what's going on.

817
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:28,360
What are you doin'? Going to
see what happened to you.

818
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:30,350
Get back to your stations.

819
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,850
Where's morrissey?

820
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,359
He's baby-sitting.
He's what?

821
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,360
I'll tell ya about it later. Let's
just get this thing out of here.

822
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:58,885
Hey, Brian, I want to bring something up
on your screen. You see those channels?

823
01:13:58,886 --> 01:14:02,879
They carry magma from the mantle on up to
the lithosphere and then up to the surface.

824
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,380
There's only one way to put any serious
distance between ourselves and that blast.

825
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,895
- Don't even say it.
- We could ride the lava flow to the surface.

826
01:14:09,896 --> 01:14:12,889
Oh, my God. You guys are nuts!
Mama don't surf?

827
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,890
You designed those heat shields.
Time to put them to the test.

828
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,905
They haven't been rated
for that kind of sustained heat.

829
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:21,899
- Have you got any better ideas?
<i>- Look, we got 16 minutes.</i>

830
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:25,900
Sam, find me a lava flow.
Yes, sir.

831
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:29,159
Ten, nine, eight,

832
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,659
seven, six, five, four,

833
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:37,660
three, two, one.

834
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:42,169
What happened?

835
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:44,170
No detonation.

836
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,679
All right, people, listen up.

837
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,679
Unless you have a level five
security clearance,

838
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,679
I want you out of this building
right now.

839
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,180
- Let's go!
-

840
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:00,200
I want every document in this room shredded.
You understand me?

841
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:02,189
Yes, sir.

842
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,730
- I got a heat source.
- What's the heading?

843
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,750
- Two o'clock, one click.
- All right. Hold on.

844
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,030
Hold tight.
It's really gonna get rough now.

845
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,550
Yeah!

846
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,830
Hold on!

847
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,979
- Mr. Simmons.
- What is it?

848
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980
We have detonation.

849
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,990
Hold on!

850
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,790
Ally, you okay?

851
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,799
Are we okay?

852
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,299
What a rush.

853
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,310
- Whoo! We made it!
- Oh, we're okay.

854
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:00,309
Let's get outta here.
Yeah. We made it.

855
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:03,680
I'm gonna try to get somebody
on the horn down here.

856
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Hey, Brian, I got
the coast guard on the horn.

857
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,710
Brian?

858
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,720
Hey, Brian, coast guard needs
to talk to mission commander.

859
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,729
Brian?

860
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:50,240
Y'all up there?

861
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,799
Colonel po!

862
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,300
I didn't expect you
to fly down here yourself.

863
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:09,815
We were unable to retrieve the unit,
but we did manage to destroy it.

864
01:21:09,816 --> 01:21:15,310
Satellite reconnaissance reported both
American and Russian elite naval teams...

865
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,819
Recovering the craft
this afternoon.

866
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:21,319
How do you explain this?
That's impossible.

867
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,320
There's no way in hell that ship
could have escaped that explosion.

868
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,829
Nevertheless, Mr. Simmons,

869
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:32,330
it has come to pass.

870
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,839
What are you saying,
that it's my fault?

871
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,339
You forget, colonel, that it was you
who signed off on the fiber optics.

872
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,400
I say we drill right there.
I'm the oldest.

873
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,920
And I say we drill right here,
and I've got a phd.

874
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:55,410
Well, I got two phds, and I say
the old man here is, uh...

875
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,419
Oh, that is so typical.

876
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,430
- Wrong. You're dead wrong, Sam.
- Wrong?

877
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,419
Oh, Brian. Now, you've looked at this.
Look at it for real.

878
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,920
Look at this structure. Forget the map.
Come over here.

879
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:08,429
Let me show you something.
<i>Sam?</i>

880
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,929
Don't "Sam" me.
Just hear me out.

881
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,929
Sam? There will be no
oil east of this.

882
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:15,430
See where that green place is? There's no oil in here.
Sam, you're a chauvinist.

883
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,580
Let's get this show
on the road.

884
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:41,590
You just do your job,
and I'll do mine.

885
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:52,100
Michelle... the phone number,
and I gave it to you.

886
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,110
Yeah, that was...
That was no favor, believe me.

887
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,860
So, can this monkey read?

888
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,250
All right.
Now you can land the plane.

889
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:24,250
I hope so, Mr. Simmons,
for your sake.

890
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,900
♪ Something tells me ♪

891
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,409
♪ You're not here
about the noise ♪

892
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:47,409
Is that right?
