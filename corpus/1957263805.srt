00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,275
All right, thank you.

00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,651
Hi, how are you, beautiful?

00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,753
There you go, hot and waiting
for you.

7
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:38,586
Thank you so much.

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,622
- [Waitress] Good night.
- Thank you.

00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:40,822
[Waitress] Good night.

10
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,957
All right, let's shut it down,
huh?

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,594
Oh good, going home.

12
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,097
Okay, motherfuckers, let's go!

13
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:52,101
Give me what I want or I'll
give you what you don't want.

14
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:55,237
Give the money right
now, you wop, let's go.

15
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:58,641
Hurry up!

16
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,144
Okay, okay, please.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,315
Hurry up, give it to me.

18
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,117
All right, all right,
you got what you came for.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,819
[Waitress] Leave.

20
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,354
What the fuck you looking at?

21
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,324
That's not all the money.

22
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,861
What the fuck you said?

23
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:19,994
That's not all the money.

24
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,997
The old wop got a safe in the
back.

Okay, okay.

What the fuck you waiting on,
let's go.

This shit is not a game.

Get out my way!

31
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,214
Little nigger, where is the
safe?

32
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,114
Second bottom drawer
of the file cabinet.

00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,784
Jump to it, motherfucker,
let's go.

Okay, okay.

35
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,188
Get the money, cracker nigger!

36
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,222
I will kill your woman.

37
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:48,857
Just give him the money!

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,326
Hurry the fuck up and get my
money!

39
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:54,328
Put the money in the bag, all of
it.

40
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,098
God, I hate to rob you, my
niggas, yes.

41
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:57,965
Let's go!

42
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:58,833
Hurry, Roberto!

43
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:01,736
Nigger, today, listen to your
bitch.

44
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,137
I got shit to do.

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,238
Give me my fucking money.

46
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,740
Any more money left?

This is one nice fucking
piece.

Like my wife, almost too
fucking pretty to shoot.

50
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,928
I'll tell you what, I'll
take the lot of them.

51
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,831
Go see Frankie in the back,
he'll set you straight.

52
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:31,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you
going, heh?

53
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on, I open up the joint in
an hour.

54
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,237
You think I want my
customers to look at these?

55
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:38,339
Hey, hey, hey!

56
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,274
There he is, this is him.

57
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,745
Look who's here, the man of
the hour.

58
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,179
How you doing, kid?

59
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,214
What's your name?

60
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:46,348
Bernard James.

61
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,248
Bernard, heh?

62
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:51,086
I tell you the truth, I
appreciate what you did, kid.

63
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:53,955
But the truth be told, if
you didn't open your mouth

64
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,759
about the safe, we wouldn't
be here in the first place.

65
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,993
What the fuck were you thinking
about,

66
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:02,498
jeopardizing my fucking money
for fucking pizza money?

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,467
Roberto gave me a job to
help take care of my mom.

68
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:08,002
I like Roberto, he's a good man.

69
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,441
I like you, kid.

70
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,443
I like a kid who stands up for
his friends

71
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,110
and takes care of his mother.

72
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:17,445
You're good in my book.

73
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:22,551
But one thing I'm not too crazy
about is your name, Bernard.

74
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,987
I don't know, you don't
look like a Bernard.

75
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,491
What do I look like?

76
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,327
There was a guy I
come up with years ago,

77
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,129
he didn't take shit from nobody.

78
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,464
He saved my life once, God rest
his soul.

79
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:39,167
He had fucking steel balls just
like you.

80
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,171
His name was Dutch.

81
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,772
How about we call you Dutch?

82
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,876
Dutch, yeah, it'd be
an honor, Mr. Cerrone.

83
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,446
All right, Roberto, hook
him up with the chop shop

84
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,513
in North Newark, all right.

85
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:53,448
All right.

86
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:55,516
Let the kid start earning for
a living.

87
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,517
You hungry, kid?

88
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,921
I got a guy in the back
fix you a fucking plate

00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:01,422

curl.

interrupted while eating.

103

see me at my office.

matter.

[Dutch] Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:25,466
You're a drug dealer.

110
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,302
Does that scare you?

111
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,137
I'm a criminal defense
attorney, Mr. James,

112
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,372
very little scares me.

113
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:33,542
This is a certified check.

114
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,977
You're incredibly naive if
you think you're the only rich

drug dealer in New Jersey who
needs my services, Mr. James.

116
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,482
Ms. Nichols, I'm not being
arrested for selling narcotics.

117
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:42,684
What are you being arrested
for?

118
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:43,551
[Dutch] Being black.

119
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:44,419
That's not a crime.

120
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,687
Who's being naive now?

121
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,091
Black men are incarcerated six
times the rate of white males

122
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:51,360
if they're not killed first.

123
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:54,029
That's your defense because
white people get away with it,

124
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:54,963
you should too?

125
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,232
Oh, if you think it'll work,
I'm game.

126
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,670
I appreciate the offer, Mr.
James,

127
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:03,638
but I don't think I can
represent you.

128
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,872
Any particular reason why not?

129
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:08,242
No, but you haven't given
me a good reason why I should.

130
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,543
Well, Johnny Cochran wasn't
available.

131
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,245
And you're not very funny.

132
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:14,348
Oh, no disrespect to Johnny
Cochran, God rest his soul.

133
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,650
I meant it as a testament
of your legal skill.

134
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:17,785
The system is corrupt,

135
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,321
I just happen to care a little
bit more

136
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:21,789
than the people who work in the
system.

137
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,559
Oh, I think it's a
little bit more than that.

138
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,693
You're a true believer.

139
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,566
People of color are incapable
of receiving equality

140
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,369
of justice in the
American judicial system.

141
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:36,271
Sound familiar?

142
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,441
Fundamental principles
of the Sixth Amendment

143
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:42,576
are systematically undermined
by racism, economic disparity

144
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,013
and political oppression.

145
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,615
Are these your words?

146
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,383
How'd you get that?

147
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,384
It's good, it's better than
good.

148
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,386
I know what it is, I wrote
it second year Harvard Law,

149
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,489
what's your point?

150
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,590
We both believe in justice.

151
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:58,727
Now, I've been to prison, Ms.
Nichols.

152
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,495
It's not a pleasant place
and I'm never going back.

153
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,432
If I can't get a fair
trial with you in court,

154
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:05,434
I'll hold court on the streets.

155
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,367
That would be suicide.

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,037
No, it would be self defense.

157
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,672
What exactly are you being
charged with?

158
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,376
I think they'll know better
than me.

Cuff him.

162
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,532
He better look as good as he
does now

163
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:39,867
after he gets to booking.

164
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,303
Who the hell are you?

165
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,671

Good morning, you're
watching Wake Up New Jersey.

glad you could be here.

169
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,761
Let's get right to the top
story of the day, shall we?

170
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,899
It has now been six months
since alleged drug dealer,

171
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:14,168
Bernard Dutch James was arrested
at a New Jersey restaurant.

172
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,505
Now, ironically, Mr.
James was not picked up

173
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,206
for a drug-related offense,

174
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,742
rather this is more serious than
that.

175
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,511
He's been charged with
orchestrating the mass bombing

176
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:26,147
of a New Jersey police
station that led to the deaths

177
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,417
of 27 good officers and the
wounding of scores more.

178
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,387
It's an act many are calling
terrorism.

179
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,491
Now, Bernard James has always
denied these accusations

180
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:39,528
through his attorney, Michelle
Nichols, who just so happens

181
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,896
to be our guest on the program
today.

182
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,098
[Michelle] Thank you for
having me.

183
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,766
Now, I gotta say, Michelle,
when our viewers found out

184
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,270
that you were gonna be on the
program,

185
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,804
our social media pages basically
shut down

186
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:53,675
with the sheer amount of
comments people were leaving.

187
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,642
[Michelle] Well, I don't
know if that's good or bad.

188
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,645
[David] Well, I've
been going through a lot

189
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:59,780
of these comments and many of
them are less than flattering

190
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:01,616
towards you and your client.

191
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,684
And a good number of
them aren't even suitable

192
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:05,886
to air on television.

193
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,755
Does that worry you?

194
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,924
You know what worries me

195
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:11,359
and it should worry your
audience, too?

196
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,862
The Constitution mandates that
everyone should be afforded

197
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,731
a good and capable defense, not
just...

198
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:18,433
Yo, turn this up.

199
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,636
People get caught up in the
sound bytes on the internet

200
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,237
and suddenly volunteer

201
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,905
to abandon their Constitutional
rights

202
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,742
because they're not aware of the
facts.

203
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,610
[David] Well, here we go.

204
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,411
What are the facts?

205
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,314
[Michelle] Anthony Jacobs
knows that William Brent

206
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:35,917
is responsible for this
heinous crime, yet he insists

207
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,220
on using the powers of the
district attorney's office

208
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:40,454
to persecute Mr. James.

209
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:43,857
But District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs believes your client

210
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,227
is complicit with the
actions of William Brent.

211
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,462
Well, you know what?

212
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:50,298
I believe I can fly, but the
judicial system doesn't operate

213
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,232
on what we believe.

214
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,534
It's about what you can prove.

215
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,703
And there is no evidence
of any malfeasance

216
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,271
or of culpable intent by Mr.
James.

217
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,640
You do need evidence.

218
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:00,708
Just because a person has been
arrested,

219
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,245
you can't automatically
conclude they're guilty.

220
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,714
[light music]

221
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,650
Documents were sent over.

222
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,718
When did this happen?

223
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,386
We're going in right now,
I gotta call you back.

224
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,554
Michelle Nichols, saw you on
TV.

225
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:14,655
You did an amazing job.

226
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

227
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,859
We want the Wake Up New Jersey
piece

228
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,462
on all social media sites
and local news outlets.

229
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,898
Wait, I gotta call you back.

230
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,468
[light music]

231
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,972
[Bailiff] All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

232
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,614
[Judge] You may be seated.

233
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,249
Bring in the jury.

234
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,493
Is the state ready to proceed
with its opening statement?

235
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:56,730
Hello, I am District
Attorney Anthony Jacobs

236
00:11:56,764 --> 00:12:01,503
and I wanna thank you for
your attendance today.

237
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:06,440
I know some of you may deem
my gratitude unwarranted

238
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:10,045
because let's be honest, if
you didn't have to be here,

239
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,814
you probably wouldn't come,
right?

240
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:13,715
And I agree.

241
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,017
I'd much rather be playing golf

242
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,453
or going to my child's piano
recital

243
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,655
or just enjoying a quiet day at
home.

244
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:26,828
But I can't 'cause this is my
duty, just like it's your duty

245
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,332
to assure your fellow
citizens will remain safe,

246
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,934
just as it is the police to
do the same for you and I,

247
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:35,036
our civic duty.

248
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,073
But above and beyond our civic
duty,

249
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:41,976
above and beyond the inconvenience
duty sometimes imposes

250
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,579
on the dutiful, therefore it is
our right.

251
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:48,049
It is your right to be safe in
your home.

252
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:50,552
It is your right to
oversee the justice system

253
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:53,054
and it is your right to
be heard as citizens,

254
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,891
even if the uncivilized play
mockery

255
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:58,492
with our sense of security.

256
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,429
Now, we're all God-fearing
human beings and those of you

257
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,565
who aren't, well, you wouldn't
be here

258
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,100
if you didn't recognize the law.

259
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,070
And you certainly
wouldn't be sitting there

260
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,007
if you didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

261
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,146
So I say to you, what if
I could present to you

262
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,415
the very embodiment of wrong?

263
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:25,552
Would you hesitate to
look wrong in the face?

264
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,055
Would you banish wrong from our
society?

265
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,491
Would you turn away from guilt

266
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:32,694
if it was staring you right in
the face?

267
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,596
Well, I'm gonna give you that
chance.

268
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:38,098
Because I'm gonna prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

269
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:42,971
that Bernard James is the
embodiment of this city's wrong.

270
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:46,640
He is the root cause of fear
that is prevalent in this city

271
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:50,578
and the degradation of our civil
order.

272
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:54,049
It all stems from the
actions of this one man.

273
00:13:54,982 --> 00:14:00,388
Bernard James is an
instigator, an agitator

274
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,089
and head of the organized crime

275
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:05,893
that has terrorized New
Jersey for the past 12 years.

276
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:09,663
You have a chance to look evil
in the face and in the name

277
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:13,602
of the state of New Jersey,
you say one word, guilty.

278
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:28,417
Thank you.

279
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,021
As the day is drawing long,
we'll continue these proceedings

280
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:35,088
tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

281
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:35,957
Your honor.

282
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,058
Thank you, Ms. Nichols.

283
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,193
Relax.

284
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,128
[Judge] Court is now
adjourned.

285
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,261
And let Jacobs'
statement be the last thing

286
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,665
the jury remembers before
they go to sleep tonight?

287
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,634
Don't worry about it.

288
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,837
[phone ringing]

289
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,973
[Voicemail] Hi, this is Lady
D.

290
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:55,609
I'm not available to
take your call right now.

291
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,579
Please leave a message at the
tone.

["Burning Down the House"]

293
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,703
[Assistant] Dutch had assembled
a young team of raiders

294
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:25,506
from all over New York
to steal cars as a kid.

295
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,674
And he was arrested and sent

296
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,242
to Mountain View Correctional
Facility

297
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,112
for trying to steal a
dozen BMWs at the port.

298
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,114
BMWs?

00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,864
Y'all wanna make this shit
interesting?

301
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:53,233
Shit, shooting motherfuckers,
that'll make it interesting.

302
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,136
Shit, that's your answer for
everything.

303
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,872
What's better than that,
Angel?

304
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:59,006
Money.

305
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,041
What you thinking, Dutch?

306
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,310
I'm thinking whoever
has the fastest time,

307
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:05,679
the other three throw them a G
apiece.

308
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:09,217
Ooh, extra three grand, I'm
in.

309
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,321
All right then, let's do it.

[Craze] Yes, sir.

315
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,845
Everybody give Angel her
share.

316
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:12,646
She did that.

317
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a
minute.

318
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:17,318
Y'all know I was way faster than
Angel.

319
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,386
Yeah, you would've been

00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,954
if you didn't waste time
picking up random bitches.

mad at you, man, 'cause look,

I ain't mad at you, go ahead.

00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:30,898
Yeah, come over here.

I got you, you know I got you.

00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:32,967
I ain't tripping about that.

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,368
Mine is in there.

00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,675
- Good, you?
- Good.

00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:42,777
You remember Qwan, Angel and
Craze.

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,111
Hey, how are y'all doing?

00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:47,181
Oh man, we doing real good.
[Qwan laughs]

You got a minute, I need to
talk to you.

Yeah, whatever you want.

Hey, bartender.

$100 to the bartender.

you.

Nah, no, no not at all.

I think you been doing a great
job.

347
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,967
In fact, they wanted me to give
you this.

Damn, I don't even know
what to say, but thank you.

And there's more, all right.

350
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,379
He's taking you out of the car
business

351
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,014
and putting you into narcotics.

352
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:20,848
Man, what you mean he wanna
take us out

353
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,815
of the car business?

354
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,684
No, no, no, it's a
good thing, all right.

355
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:26,286
With your street connections,
it just makes sense.

356
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,056
You're gonna be working under
Frank.

357
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:29,823
You're gonna be making 10 times
the money

358
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,358
and have 10 times the
responsibility.

359
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,261
You think you can handle that?

360
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:36,363
Man, they haven't invented
a hustle I can't handle.

361
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,732
But what about my team?

362
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:38,732
Yeah, hire whoever you want.

363
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,467
There's enough money to
go around for everybody,

364
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:44,405
but if they shit on you,
that's your problem.

365
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:47,841
If they shit on us,
that's your problem, too.

366
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:53,280
And Frank is okay with that?

367
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:55,082
Comes from Fat Tony.

368
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:57,251
Frank doesn't have a choice
in the matter, all right.

369
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,486
But there's this guy.

370
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,490
He's got a 1956 Bel Air
Coupe, a real beauty.

371
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:03,890
Frank tried to buy it from the
guy,

372
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:05,193
but the guy wouldn't budge.

373
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,364
It would go a long way to
smooth things out with Frank

374
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,300
if you could get him that car.

375
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,902
You just tell me where
it's at and it's yours.

376
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,739
According to Frank, the
guy goes to Joe's Steakhouse

377
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:22,711
every day at 7 like clockwork,
parks with the valet.

378
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:25,914
You can consider it done.

379
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,883
Congratulations.

380
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,751
You've come a long way, kid,
huh?

381
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,822
I gotta give it to him,
he never thought small.

382
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:38,893
[dramatic music]

383
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,363
Hello, Mrs. Jasmine.

384
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:44,299
How are we doing?

385
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:46,399
I see you're doing well.

386
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,102
- Thank you.
- Absolutely, welcome back.

387
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:49,904
[Jasmine] Thank you.

388
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:50,538
[Sir] Park up front.

389
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,905
Always, yes sir.

390
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,178
[dramatic music]

391
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,353
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

392
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,422
Can you help me get a
package out of my trunk?

393
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,891
Sure, where's it at?

394
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,060
- Right in here?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,263
Where's it at right here?

396
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,164
What the...

397
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,135
[dramatic music]

398
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,392
[sirens wailing]

399
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,828
[Qwan] We've been set up.

400
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,564
Get out of the car.

401
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,867
Out of the car, face forward.

402
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:53,533
Face forward!

403
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,001
Get down, get down.

404
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,304
Spread out, put your
hands behind your head.

405
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:01,274
Another kid was arrested
with him, Eqwan Taylor.

406
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:02,577
He was sent to Jamesburg.

407
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,477
Gladiator camp.

408
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,115
Eqwan Taylor was just added
to Jacob's witness list.

409
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:10,251
He's the reverend at First
Street Baptist Church

410
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:11,484
in Los Angeles.

411
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,555
Jacobs is using Taylor to
introduce Dutch's criminal past

412
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:15,923
to the jury.

413
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:16,623
Then we're gonna take a hit.

414
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:17,558
Maybe not, do we have anything

415
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,126
to impeach the good reverend's
testimony?

416
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,995
Nothing yet, but our
investigators

417
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:22,997
are still in LA working on it.

418
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,365
Get them to work faster.

419
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:27,100
In the meantime, I'm gonna
gut Jacobs' first witness.

420
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:34,242
[DA] Can you state your
name for the court, sir?

421
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:35,209
Kenneth Jackson.

422
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,445
[DA] And where do you
currently reside?

423
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,583
In a halfway house off of
Broad Street.

424
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,886
And do you know Bernard James?

425
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,021
Of course I do, who don't?

426
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,324
He's sitting right over there.

427
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,594
And when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

428
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,328
- Objection.
- [Judge] Overruled.

429
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,531
Again, when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

430
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,568
Not until he came to Mountain
View.

431
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,435
And that would be Mountain
View

432
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,672
Correctional Facility, right?

433
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:05,639
[Kenneth] Yes, sir.

434
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,476
And can you describe
Bernard James's stay

435
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:10,478
at Mountain View correctional
facility?

436
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:14,080
Well, from the jump, Dutch
came in like he had something

437
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,951
to prove, like he had
a chip in his shoulder.

438
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,551
He wasn't inside five minutes

439
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:20,688
and he was already stirring up
shit.

440
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,925
[dramatic music]

441
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:26,359
So Bernard James came into
prison a violent person,

442
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:27,227
is that correct?

443
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,597
I mean, he wasn't a killer or
nothing,

444
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:32,433
but he definitely made his
presence known.

445
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,334
And I respected that.

446
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,405
Was there any gang
activity at Mountain View?

447
00:22:37,437 --> 00:22:40,040
Everybody was in a gang, if
that's what you wanna call it.

448
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:41,241
It was just cliqued up.

449
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:46,180
I mean, they got together
on a county versus county

450
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:50,017
or a city versus city basis.

451
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,918
Narc, nigga.

452
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,087
Fuck off me, man.

453
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,423
Sometimes it's street
versus street basis.

454
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:57,190
It depended on where you were at

455
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:58,659
to determine who you were with.

456
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:03,463
Now, I'm gonna ask you

457
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,999
was Bernard James involved in a
gang?

458
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:14,107
Everybody was, especially him.

459
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:16,210
[DA] Especially?

460
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:18,178
Dutch ran Mountain View.

461
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:21,516
And if Newark was brought
up, he would be frontline.

462
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:25,153
He was the man, bottom line.

463
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:29,523
Thank you.

464
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:32,592
Your witness.

465
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:36,163
Mr. Jackson, you
testified that everybody

466
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,697
at Mountain View was in a gang.

467
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:38,598
That's right.

468
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:45,272
So were you in a gang?

469
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:49,576
Like I said, everybody was.

470
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,311
And if one gang member had a
problem

471
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:54,248
with another gang member,
they would do anything

472
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,050
to take them out, right?

473
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,085
Wasn't no picnic.

474
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,053
You had to do what you
had to do to survive.

475
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:01,388
[Michelle] Like what?

476
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:03,024
Whatever it took.

477
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:03,724
Lie?

478
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,094
That's the least of it.

479
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,662
[Michelle] Kill?

480
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:11,098
Guards won't let you kill
nobody, but short of it.

481
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,165
Good for them.

482
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:14,401
Are you from Newark?

483
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:17,338
No, ma'am.

484
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,773
I'm from North Bergen
Township, Hudson County.

485
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,777
A lot of tough guys
come out of North Bergen.

486
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,146
[Kenneth] You'd be surprised,
ma'am.

487
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:26,280
Are you a tough guy?

488
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,216
Let's just say I can hold my
own.

489
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:33,421
And you and Mr. James
were in a rival gang

490
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,289
at Mountain View, right?

491
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,590
What are you talking about?

492
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:39,693
You said earlier that
inmates at Mountain View

493
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,396
got together on a county versus
county

494
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:44,764
or city versus city basis.

495
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:47,801
Mr. James is from Newark,
you're from North Bergen,

496
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:50,538
therefore you're rivals, right?

497
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,173
We wasn't homies or nothing
like that

498
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,040
if that's what you asking.

499
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,541
That's why you're here
testifying today

500
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,211
because you and Mr. James were
rivals

501
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:58,611
and a gang member will do
anything

502
00:24:58,645 --> 00:25:01,281
to take out a rival gang member,
right?

503
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:02,482
I don't know what you're
talking about.

504
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:04,184
So it wasn't true when you
say lying is the very least

505
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,519
you would do take out a rival
gang member?

506
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,854
Were you lying then or were you
lying now?

507
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,589
Which is it, Mr. Jackson?

508
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,425
Objection, argumentative.

509
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:12,426
[Judge] Sustained.

510
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,263
Mr. Jackson, one last
question.

511
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:20,233
Where are you staying
while appearing in court?

512
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,303
The district attorney's
office put me up at the Hilton.

513
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,371
I'd imagine the Hilton is a
lot nicer

514
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:26,740
than the halfway house on Broad
Street.

515
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:27,907
[DA] Objection.

516
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:31,779
Withdrawn, I'm done with
this liar, I mean, witness.

517
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,683
[light music]

518
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:47,661
Jacobs.

519
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:51,566
Gah, shit, it was supposed
to be done an hour ago.

520
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:53,667
What time?

521
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,669
5:30, it's gonna be ready.

522
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:57,637
But look, if I can't make
it, let's just leave the keys

523
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:58,905
at the service department.

524
00:25:58,938 --> 00:26:00,406
Yeah, I know.

525
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,576
All right, bye, thanks.

526
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:05,179
I'm going to visit Roc and Angel

527
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:06,413
and I'm gonna make them a deal.

Yeah, look, I know how
much Dutch meant to you.

579

Took you out of that
hellhole on Dayton Street,

580
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,440
but you were young,
impressionable.

doing.

Dutch do the same for you?

the women wanna be me,

nothing is going to be able

that there are 27 police
officers dead

597

someone to answer for it.

And that is gonna be Bernard
James.

me?

That you have a shitty boss
that makes you work too much.

That trials aren't won by
clients, they're won by lawyers

602
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:21,962
and you're gonna win it for him.

That would be true if
our client was anyone else

but Bernard James.

00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,535
His presence commands attention

take their eyes off him

daring to find him guilty.

gonna be that reason.

00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,495
You let them lock you
up like you was a dog.

705
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:58,132
And you expect me to write you.

706
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:00,934
You must be crazy, boy.

707
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,070
What I got to say you
don't want me to write.

708
00:37:05,604 --> 00:37:08,107
You let them take you away from
me.

709
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,909
And you didn't do nothing about
it.

710
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:12,879
And yeah, all that shit
that you bought me,

711
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:14,114
I left it where it was.

712
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:17,017
I let it rot, I left it.

713
00:37:18,984 --> 00:37:21,521
All that bullshit you
traded your freedom in for,

714
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:22,888
you think I want that?

715
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,824
You think that's what I want?

716
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:26,160
You think I wanna keep that?

717
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,964
["Ain't No Way"]

718
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,307
I ain't going back.

719
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:45,278
You damn right you're not
going back.

720
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,546
I'll kill you myself.

721
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:49,348
I'll kill you myself.

722
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:52,919
Get off of me, get off of me.

723
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:59,960
You go get what them people took
from you.

724
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:04,997
Go back and get what the
people took from you.

725
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:10,236
Bernard.

726
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,180
Your mother seems like
a special type of woman.

727
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:21,848
Imagine being raised by her.

728
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,250
At some point in the near
future,

729
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,986
we're gonna finish this
conversation.

730
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:28,287
I could offer you protection.

731
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:29,990
[Michelle] I'm good, trust me.

732
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:33,393
Look, I didn't know they
were gonna come after you

733
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:34,594
to get to me.

734
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,164
You're doing a great job,
you can't lose your cool now.

735
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:39,899
I win 98% of my cases,

736
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:41,934
run a six-minute mile with a
.45.

737
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:44,136
The last thing I'm gonna
do is lose my cool.

738
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:47,607
Good night, Mr. James.

739
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:53,180
[dramatic music]

740
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:14,201
[dramatic music]

741
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:46,366
[elevator dinging]

742
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,268
Fuck you, Monte Carlo.

743
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:50,703
[guns firing]

744
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:02,149
[dramatic music]

745
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,488
Boy, Qwan wanna holla at you.

746
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,223
What fat boy want?

747
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:12,258
[Craze] I don't know.

748
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,292
All right.

749
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:21,501
[Craze] He ready for you.

750
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:24,338
[dramatic music]

751
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:33,347
What up?

752
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:38,117
Hey, I appreciate everything
you done for me, Dutch,

753
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:41,688
but I be waking up sweating
tears.

754
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,556
I can't tell the
difference between the two.

755
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:47,493
And it's so many people out
here dying, it's too many.

756
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:49,495
I be thinking somebody gonna
kill me

757
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:51,731
or my mom or my sister.

758
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:54,700
Don't you ever have thoughts
like that?

759
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:56,502
No.

760
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,508
Well, I do, man, I think about
it a lot.

761
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,344
I couldn't live with
myself if I did something

762
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:07,014
that would cause pain to my
family.

763
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:10,817
It ain't in me no more, Dutch,
it ain't.

764
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,587
If I said it was, I'd be
frontin'.

765
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:17,723
Ain't no future in that.

766
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:23,328
I know, man, so yo,
I'm moving out to L.A.

767
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,664
I'm gonna stay with my aunt.

768
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:30,703
[soft music]

769
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:59,598
I told you he wasn't
built for this shit.

770
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:03,235
He knows too much, way too much.

771
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:04,203
We shouldn't have let
him walk out of here.

772
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:05,439
Let me take care of that.

773
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:07,640
What he gonna do?

774
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:09,876
Nothing but go to California

775
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:11,811
and become some preacher or some
shit.

776
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:14,513
Let him go.

777
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,718
Shit, if that's what he
wanna do, all glory to God.

778
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:25,825
[soft music]

779
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:39,739
Do you solemnly swear

780
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:41,807
that the evidence you're
presenting today is the truth,

781
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,544
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

782
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:45,410
I do.

783
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:46,312
You may have a seat.

784
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,751
State your name for the court.

785
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:53,752
Reverend Eqwan Taylor.

786
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,787
[DA] And where are
you currently residing?

787
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:57,656
In Los Angeles, California.

788
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:00,193
I'm the reverend of First
Street Baptist Church.

789
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:02,394
[DA] And where did you
live prior to California?

790
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:03,530
Right here in Newark.

791
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:06,566
And were you ever connected

792
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:08,401
to the defendant, Bernard James?

793
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:11,303
Yes.
How so?

794
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,305
We were friends.

795
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:14,374
In fact, isn't it true

796
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:16,309
that you and Bernard James
were in prison together

797
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:17,644
for grand larceny?

798
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:18,544
Yes, sir.

799
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:23,583
Have you ever heard of
a man name Azugol Kazami?

800
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,252
Yes.

801
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:27,286
How so?

802
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:29,888
Bernard and I had
discussed killing Kazami.

803
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:33,693
Objection, your honor, Mr.
James has never been charged

804
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,761
with the murder of Azugol
Kazami.

805
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:36,628
A point I'm sure you'll make
clear

806
00:43:36,662 --> 00:43:38,564
in your cross, counselor,
overruled.

807
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:45,737
So Reverend, in your best
ability,

808
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,973
can you share with us
the conversation you had

809
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:50,776
regarding the murder of Azugol
Kazami?

810
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:55,515
Look, what I'm about to put
y'all up on

811
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,816
ain't like shit we ever did
before.

812
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,353
So if y'all ain't bout
it, y'all can bounce.

813
00:44:00,385 --> 00:44:01,553
Man, why you talking
to us like that, Dutch?

814
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:02,588
You know we down.

815
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,325
Oh yeah?

816
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,727
I'm taking over the drug trade
in Newark.

817
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:12,097
What the fuck, Dutch?

818
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:13,765
What you gonna do, compete with
Kazami?

819
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:14,667
Nah.

820
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,738
We kill Kazami.

821
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,809
Kill Kazami?

822
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:25,611
I ain't saying you
wrong or nothing, Dutch,

823
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:28,580
but killing dude, he'd murc us

824
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:29,982
if he thought we was
thinking about sticking him,

825
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:31,084
let alone killing him.

826
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,586
We don't know where he
lives or how to get to him.

827
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:34,787
He's married and got a kid.

828
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,723
Boom, that's how we get to
him.

829
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:40,559
What, we gonna kidnap
his girl and his kid?

830
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:41,761
You wanna snatch her?

831
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:43,663
She know what she signed
up for when she got with him,

832
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:47,667
but nah, Kazami ain't breaking
his neck over no bitch.

833
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,368
We get her to set him up.

834
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:51,903
She ain't gonna turn on her
meal ticket.

835
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:53,373
Sugar Ray will flip her.

836
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,709
That wannabe pimp
motherfucker?

837
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:58,377
Yeah, Sugar Ray ain't going
for that.

838
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,912
Sugar Ray like money
just like anybody else.

839
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:02,415
He'll do it for the paper.

840
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:09,655
Reverend Taylor, Reverend
Taylor, are you all right?

841
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:12,258
Yes, I'm good, I'm okay.

842
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:14,860
You need a break?

843
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:17,764
Yeah, I think I need a moment.

844
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:21,434
Your honor, short break for my
witness.

845
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:23,869
[Judge] This court stands
for a 30 minute recess.

846
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:26,606
[gavel banging]

847
00:45:31,676 --> 00:45:34,013
["Rockstar"]

848
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:40,486
What were we talking about?

849
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:41,587
Kazami.

850
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,522
Right, right, the African.

851
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:44,823
[Dutch] Mm-hm.

852
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,595
I don't know about that, man.

853
00:45:49,562 --> 00:45:50,830
It may be too hard.

854
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,464
Come on, man, anybody could
get got.

855
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:54,766
Yeah, that shit go both ways.

856
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,935
Didn't Kazami get two
hits put out on him?

857
00:45:58,903 --> 00:45:59,938
They missed twice.

858
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:03,809
What the fuck make you
think we can get him?

859
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:06,479
Well, that's why we need you,
Sugar Ray.

860
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:07,814
His broad's the weak link.

861
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:08,948
They always are.

862
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:10,950
If anybody can bag him, it's
you.

863
00:46:10,982 --> 00:46:12,751
Now, shit, the mob might miss
twice,

864
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:14,354
but everybody know Sugar Ray
don't.

865
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:15,955
You trying to gas me up.

866
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:19,459
Of course, Sugar, I'm the Sugar
Man, of course I don't miss.

867
00:46:19,492 --> 00:46:22,662
[Sugar Ray laughs]

868
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:24,629
That's to show you we real
about this.

869
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:27,566
And if you go at Simone and
miss, my word,

870
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,702
my car is yours.

871
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:39,111
The beamer in front?

872
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,012
Yep.

873
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:46,685
See, Kazami, he can give
a bitch everything she want

874
00:46:47,986 --> 00:46:49,455
except that understanding.

875
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,658
That's when the Sugar Man come
into play,

876
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:54,160
you know what I'm saying?

877
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:57,097
See, I'm the shelter to a bitch
storm.

878
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:00,399
Gotta create the storm.

879
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:01,100

out of.

his bitch daddy or something.

Ay, you got some panties on?

889

So Sugar Ray suggested it,

890
00:47:28,227 --> 00:47:30,763
even though he wasn't
serious about you doing it?

891
00:47:30,796 --> 00:47:33,698
Objection, the district
attorney can't possibly expect

892
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,600

Sugar Ray was thinking.

thought Sugar Ray was serious?

All right, let's get it.

905
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,982
The murder of Mr. Smith
not only served as a message

906
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:26,785
to Kazami but to the rest of the

[dramatic music]

912
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:07,193
The stronger message
was that he was willing

to do anything to get
what he wanted, anything

914
00:49:09,928 --> 00:49:14,733

said, Simone fell apart.

with.

Yeah, but how long are
we gonna have to wait for?

926
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:45,832
Kazami makes my skin crawl
every time he touches me.

927
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,669
You know, I wouldn't be able to
see you

work out.

you gotta believe me.

get an argument from anyone

if you decided to quit.

943
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:32,244

944

we do,

00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,716
there's no chance of us winning.

947
00:50:36,749 --> 00:50:37,684
It's problematic for me

948

prosecution.

am.

how you make your money.

it's not gonna stop you

injection.

957
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:12,952
I wanna talk to you about the
deal.

958
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:16,287
Y'all needed me to crack a
bitch.

959
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:17,990
You know me, I crack five
bitches

960
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:19,290
like I crack five knuckles,

961

you know what I'm saying and
ball my fist.

962
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:26,832
So it's only right,
50/50 split, 50/50 deal.

963
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:31,269
I hear what you saying.

964
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:32,338
I mean, we did call you.

965
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,273
So I'm cool with a 50/50
split under one condition.

966
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:39,078
Conditions?

967
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:40,113
You come with us.

968
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:42,682
I mean, 'cause we could look and
come back

969
00:51:42,714 --> 00:51:43,948
and tell you anything.

970
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:45,117
Now, if you feel shitted on,

971
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,119
that could ruin a beautiful
partnership.

972
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:52,891
I ain't got a problem with
that.

973
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:54,260
So can we get to business?

974
00:51:58,129 --> 00:52:00,198

Miami.

after all this shit go down.

know me.

I roll alone.

978
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:06,238
Now, Kazami, if he don't trust
the bitch,

979
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,874
what the fuck I look
like trusting the bitch?

00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:09,807
You know what I'm saying?

981
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:11,209
So I feel like her and Kazambi
should go

982
00:52:11,243 --> 00:52:12,912
on the trip together without me.

00:52:14,412 --> 00:52:16,748

in Newark, one in Elizabeth.

two guns waiting for us.

00:57:38,736 --> 00:57:41,539
[dramatic music]

1057
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:51,050
Are we good?

1058
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:52,483
Yeah, damn right, we good.

1059
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,086
Told you.

1060
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:56,055
[Craze] Yeah, we got your kid.

1061
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:56,756
It's over.

1062
00:58:00,725 --> 00:58:02,328
I have no further questions.

1063
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,798
[Judge] Your witness, Ms.
Nichols.

1064
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,767
I should cross examine him.

1065
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:10,669
Yeah.

1066
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,274
Defense has no questions, your
honor.

1067
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:25,117
Hey, Craze [foreign
language], what is it with you?

1068
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:26,350
Why the stone face?

1069
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:27,285
[foreign language]

1070
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:28,152
Shh.

1071
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:30,189
You did have a problem with
Kazami,

1072
00:58:30,222 --> 00:58:31,557
but you ain't got that problem
no more.

1073
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:32,490
[Fat Tony] What?

1074
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:35,393
- [Fat Tony yelps]
- Whoa.

1075
00:58:35,426 --> 00:58:37,261
Now I know why they call you
Craze.

1076
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:39,597
What are you a fucking
psycho walking around

1077
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:41,634
with this fucking head in this
bag?

1078
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:44,470
Your man, Lil Frankie right
here,

1079
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:47,605
yeah, he couldn't finish the
job.

1080
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:49,307
So we did it as a favor.

1081
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:51,843
Roberto, what is it
with these fucking kids?

1082
00:58:51,877 --> 00:58:54,313
Here, here, get rid of this
shit.

1083
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:57,515
Get rid of that, just
get it out of here.

1084
00:58:57,548 --> 00:59:00,251
I gotta admit, though, you
know what?

1085
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:03,222
This fucking Kazami's been a
thorn in my side for years.

1086
00:59:03,254 --> 00:59:06,591
You got a guy we've been
trying real hard to get.

1087
00:59:06,624 --> 00:59:09,894
So for that, I guess we owe you
a favor

1088
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:13,632
and I think I know what that
favor is.

1089
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:16,834
I think you guys wanna take
over the drug trade, right?

1090
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:19,671
And you need us to
provide police protection,

1091
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:21,573
so you could be bosses.

1092
00:59:21,606 --> 00:59:24,209
Is that the long and the short
of it?

1093
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:26,644
And you got yourself a friend,
believe me,

1094
00:59:26,678 --> 00:59:28,747
as long as you live.

1095
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,682
Smile, will you?

1096
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:32,350
You want me to call Detective
O'Neal?

1097
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:33,284
That's a good idea,

1098
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:34,519
tell him they're with us now,
all right.

1099
00:59:34,553 --> 00:59:35,354
Come on, let's go munch.

1100
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:37,689
Whoa, whoa, I got something to
say.

1101
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:40,526
I'd take a bullet for the
both of yous right now,

1102
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,194
you know that.

1103
00:59:42,227 --> 00:59:43,729
I don't trust these mulignans.

1104
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:45,930
They're animals, they speak a
language

1105
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:48,333
I don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

1106
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:50,434
And that head in a duffel bag,

1107
00:59:50,468 --> 00:59:52,538
it's gonna come back
to bite us in the ass.

1108
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:53,772
And let me tell you something
right now.

1109
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:55,773
I'm going on record with you,
Tony, I am not taking a fall

1110
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:56,975
for these fucking niggers.

1111
00:59:57,008 --> 00:59:59,611
And I'll wack the both of them
right now, it's what I do.

1112
00:59:59,644 --> 01:00:01,479
Do I fucking stutter when I
talk, heh?

1113
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:02,347
Did you not just hear me?

1114
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,783
Did you not hear me give him my
word,

1115
01:00:04,816 --> 01:00:06,350
you know what my fucking word
is?

1116
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:07,584
But what is it with you, heh?

1117
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:10,222
Smarten up, all right, stop
being so fucking color blind.

1118
01:00:10,254 --> 01:00:11,323
Change with the times.

1119
01:00:11,356 --> 01:00:13,524
I know where we can get
some good veal and peppers.

1120
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:15,593
Oh, look at this, what is
this Mount Everest here?

1121
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:16,728
Jesus Christ.

1122
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,929
Holy shit!

1123
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,499
Who hired this kid?

1124
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,604
["Let's Get It On"]

1125
01:00:33,245 --> 01:00:36,515
We should take a vote,
you know, to gauge things.

1126
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:38,316
That's against the rules.

1127
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,751
Yeah, but save a lot of time

1128
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,419
once you get into deliberation.

1129
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:45,624
I'm sorry this process
is inconveniencing you,

1130
01:00:45,656 --> 01:00:47,825
but we haven't heard everything
yet.

1131
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:50,629
I've heard enough, that boy is
guilty.

1132
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:51,897
Don't y'all feel the same?

1133
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:55,600
Anybody don't feel the way
Henry does?

1134
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:58,302
Don't get me wrong, I think
he's guilty

1135
01:00:58,336 --> 01:01:02,540
of a lot of things, just not
what he's being charged with.

1136
01:01:02,573 --> 01:01:05,543
I like his lawyer, I wanna
hear what she has to say.

1137
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:10,515
["Let's Get It On"]

1138
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:19,290
["She Wildin'"]

1139
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:50,923
Yay!

1140
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:55,693
There she go.

1141
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,562
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

1142
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,966
["She Wildin'"]

1143
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:04,602
What's up, birthday girl?

1144
01:02:04,635 --> 01:02:06,971
Look at the birthday girl.

1145
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:08,506
Hi.

1146
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:09,641
Go ahead, make a wish.

1147
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:16,514
[party applauding]

1148
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:17,982
These are Angel's Charlies.

1149
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:19,483
They're down for whatever.

1150
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,620
Oh yeah, let's get down to the
whatever.

1151
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:23,589
Wait, wait, wait, glasses,
glasses.

1152
01:02:24,656 --> 01:02:25,857
For sure.

1153
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,059
Everyone, now look, in the
seven years I've been released

1154
01:02:28,093 --> 01:02:29,728
from prison, we've been more
successful

1155
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,829
than most motherfuckers do in a
lifetime.

1156
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:34,966
Now, I'm not just talking
about the street oglers.

1157
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,535
The entertainment, the
fashion, the restaurants,

1158
01:02:37,568 --> 01:02:40,004
like this one here, Mr.
Cerrone's blessed me with.

1159
01:02:40,772 --> 01:02:43,375
Angel has been instrumental in
all of it.

1160
01:02:44,575 --> 01:02:46,510
Now, this is Angel's night,

1161
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:50,848
but none of this could've
happened without all of you.

1162
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,551
You're my brothers, you're my
sister

1163
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:55,386
and I owe all you motherfuckers.

1164
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:57,655
- Family.
- Family.

1165
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,727
Now let's get to the
everything.

1166
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,795
Come on, Dutch, let's take a
picture.

1167
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:05,763
Oh, you know I don't
like being in no pictures.

1168
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:07,131
Come on, just one.

1169
01:03:07,164 --> 01:03:08,466
Come on, I'll take it.

1170
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:11,970
Come on, Dutch.

1171
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:18,743
Ay, how was that party?

1172
01:03:20,412 --> 01:03:21,747
Fire.

1173
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,714
It was lit.

1174
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:25,117
Lit, Angel brought
out all the bad bitches.

1175
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:25,983
[Craze] All of them.

1176
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:26,984
[Zoom] All of them.

1177
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:29,053
Man, the traffic on
the highway was so bad,

1178
01:03:29,086 --> 01:03:31,922
I ain't going up to Bmore no
time soon.

1179
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:34,526
Shut yo ass up, if it
wasn't for them crab cakes

1180
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,595
you ordered, we would've
been there on time.

1181
01:03:36,627 --> 01:03:37,595
[Zoom] Uh, there go the truth.

1182
01:03:37,629 --> 01:03:39,664
Man, I wasn't the only
one eating crab cakes.

1183
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:41,867
You had crab cakes, too.

1184
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:43,602
You know she expect the
whole family to be there.

1185
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:45,636
She gonna kick your ass.

1186
01:03:47,638 --> 01:03:50,107
Hey, fellas, what's happening?

1187
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,008
Where's Dutch?

1188
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,746
Roc, let me talk to you.

1189
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:03,888
You know what one of
the most dangerous parts

1190
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:05,490
of our business is?

1191
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:08,527
It's not aiming too high that
you miss it,

1192
01:04:09,861 --> 01:04:11,797
it's aiming too low that you
reach it.

1193
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:16,135
Buona fortuna, lots of good
fortune.

1194
01:04:17,669 --> 01:04:19,703
I wanna make you rich.

1195
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:22,773
I want you to come with me
and be part of my family.

1196
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:27,812
Dutch, he's nothing
without me, he's washed up.

1197
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:30,481
What, Dutch, that's my
brother.

1198
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:31,783
We been down for life.

1199
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,787
Loyalty, you feel me?

1200
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:38,089
Loyalty, I love that.

1201
01:04:39,723 --> 01:04:43,995
I just hope that Dutch cares
about your little clique

1202
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:45,430
just as much as you do.

1203
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:48,167
Do you feel me?

1204
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:53,205
[dramatic music]

1205
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:57,008
Think about it.

1206
01:05:02,814 --> 01:05:04,516
I don't trust them Italians.

1207
01:05:05,517 --> 01:05:07,719
Dutch think Frank had something
to do with that stolen car

1208
01:05:07,752 --> 01:05:09,188
that y'all got locked up in.

1209
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:11,756
I know what Dutch think,

1210
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:14,058
but I don't think they
had nothing to do with it.

1211
01:05:14,091 --> 01:05:16,060
But Dutch is always on point,
so...

1212
01:05:18,863 --> 01:05:21,566
Fake ass Tony Montana
Italians.

1213
01:05:21,598 --> 01:05:23,702
[crew laughing]

1214
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,937
That nigga said Tony Montana.

1215
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,973
At this juncture, the
prosecutor has painted

1216
01:05:28,006 --> 01:05:31,176
an incredibly unflattering
picture of you to the jury.

1217
01:05:31,209 --> 01:05:33,245
Now mind you, it has
nothing to do with the case

1218
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:35,080
and I'll cover it in my closing,

1219
01:05:35,113 --> 01:05:37,281
but we have to put on a
defense and we'd be idiots

1220
01:05:37,314 --> 01:05:39,850
to think that we can unring that
bell.

1221
01:05:39,883 --> 01:05:41,519
And we not idiots?

1222
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:43,922
I go out of my way not
to look like an idiot.

1223
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:46,258
So it would be good for you
to have someone speak well

1224
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,926
on your behalf.

1225
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:50,828
If not, change the perception
that Jacobs has presented

1226
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:53,097
but at least question it.

1227
01:05:53,964 --> 01:05:54,832
Right.

1228
01:06:02,106 --> 01:06:05,209
Is there anyone that can
say good things about you?

1229
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:08,080
Dozens, but they're all dead
or in jail.

1230
01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:10,749
That's not good.

1231
01:06:11,582 --> 01:06:15,854
No childhood friends, impartial
third parties, girlfriends?

1232
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:17,789
No.

1233
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:20,025
[Michelle] No significant
other of any kind?

1234
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:23,894
In my lifetime, Ms. Nichols,
I've had my share of women,

1235
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:26,196
but no, I've never been in a
relationship.

1236
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,899
- No?
- [Dutch] No.

1237
01:06:32,102 --> 01:06:34,271
Jacobs won't be done with
putting on his witnesses

1238
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:37,309
until the middle of next
week, so give it some thought.

1239
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:39,344
Thank you.

1240
01:06:39,377 --> 01:06:41,547
Sure, I'll see you tomorrow.

1241
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:43,781
Yeah.

1242
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:47,051
Dutch, hey, come on over here.

1243
01:06:47,084 --> 01:06:49,153
Ladies, this is the owner.

1244
01:06:49,187 --> 01:06:50,221
- Hi.
- Hey.

1245
01:06:50,254 --> 01:06:51,089
Give us a minute.

1246
01:06:51,122 --> 01:06:51,990
Have a seat.

1247
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:56,961
I love what you did to this
place.

1248
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:57,896
Thanks.

1249
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,931
But I have been hearing some
rumblings.

1250
01:06:59,964 --> 01:07:01,900
Yeah, what sort of rumblings?

1251
01:07:01,932 --> 01:07:05,102
Frank thinks that the
restaurant should be given

1252
01:07:05,135 --> 01:07:06,338
to someone in the family.

1253
01:07:07,138 --> 01:07:09,641
Well, I'm like family with Mr.
Cerrone.

1254
01:07:09,673 --> 01:07:13,010
So Frank could go see him
if he has a problem with it.

1255
01:07:13,044 --> 01:07:15,113
I don't have a horse in this
race.

1256
01:07:15,146 --> 01:07:17,281
I just wish you should
give me a little something.

1257
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:20,151
Yeah, yeah, I'll cop
you a bottle of champagne.

1258
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:21,017
What kind you drink?

1259
01:07:21,051 --> 01:07:24,055
That's not what I'm talking
about.

1260
01:07:25,189 --> 01:07:28,193
You know what I'm talking about.

1261
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:31,229
Give me a little info
on one of your rivals,

1262
01:07:31,261 --> 01:07:33,030
it'll make me look good.

1263
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:36,033
Yeah, well I don't snitch
on anyone, anywhere, anytime

1264
01:07:36,066 --> 01:07:37,702
or under any circumstance.

1265
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:40,672
You might wanna rethink that.

1266
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:44,977
Just did, the answer's still
no.

1267
01:07:45,943 --> 01:07:46,812
You take care.

1268
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:49,982
["Again"]

1269
01:07:54,051 --> 01:07:55,287
Y'all went, what?

1270
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,793
I got one and a pimp.

1271
01:08:03,627 --> 01:08:07,832
Hello, nuh-uh, Tamika, no,
no not today, okay, girl.

1272
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:09,100
I have money on this game.

1273
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:13,304
And you over there eye
fucking dude, Tamika.

1274
01:08:13,336 --> 01:08:14,372
I'll be right back.

1275
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:17,142
There she go.

1276
01:08:20,778 --> 01:08:22,312
Come on, Nina, you gonna pay or
play?

1277
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:23,415
I ain't got all day.

1278
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:25,115
How am I gonna play?

1279
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:27,252
I mean, you see my partner ran
off hoeing.

1280
01:08:31,756 --> 01:08:33,223
I could play.

1281
01:08:33,257 --> 01:08:34,192
Come again?

1282
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:36,662
I can play until your
partner comes back.

1283
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,296
What's up, boss?

1284
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:44,035
Sure, if he's forfeiting.

1285
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:52,444
So I got five and a possible.

1286
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:53,811
What you got?

1287
01:08:53,845 --> 01:08:54,945
I'm sorry, excuse me?

1288
01:08:57,114 --> 01:08:58,382
How many do you have?

1289
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:02,953
Oh, yeah, I got two.

1290
01:09:05,757 --> 01:09:06,925
Put us down for eight.

1291
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:10,429
[Zoom] Eight out the gate,
somebody's feeling lucky.

1292
01:09:13,864 --> 01:09:16,734
Thank you, nice doing business
with you.

1293
01:09:22,272 --> 01:09:23,141
Seriously?

1294
01:09:25,443 --> 01:09:27,912
Didn't you just see me play all
hearts?

1295
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:29,481
I thought you said you could
play.

1296
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:32,017
My fault.

1297
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:36,821
It's been fun, but I have to
go.

1298
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:39,757
Stop, come on, Nina.

1299
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,363
Yo, how much she lose?

1300
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:46,263
500.

1301
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:49,900
I don't know where he is.

1302
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:50,901
I don't wanna fucking wait.

1303
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,403
What are we, a couple
of jerk offs over here

1304
01:09:52,436 --> 01:09:53,537
- waiting for...
- There he is.

1305
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,774
Hey, it's the fucking Ly
brothers, Hugly and Ugly.

1306
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:59,077
Ha-ha, funny, come on, let's
go.

1307
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,312
I went to see Dutch like you
sent me.

1308
01:10:01,345 --> 01:10:03,515
Yeah, he hands me a bag of
money.

1309
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:04,481
I said, what's this?

1310
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:05,784
He says it's a start.

1311
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:07,017
A start, I say.

1312
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:09,487
Let me tell you something, you
stupid black son of a bitch,

1313
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,055
you know what your problem is?

1314
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:13,190
You took what another man
earned.

1315
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:14,359
You tried to build your
foundation

1316
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:15,926
on another man's reputation.

1317
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,198
I told them this, you forgot
the one thing in our business.

1318
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,800
You live and die on you and you
alone.

1319
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,903
I mean, sure I know he's
crazy, a little more ruthless,

1320
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:27,272
he had to be, I'll give him
that, okay.

1321
01:10:27,305 --> 01:10:28,439
But he plays by his own rules.

1322
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:30,474
He doesn't play by our rules.

1323
01:10:30,507 --> 01:10:32,209
He pisses me off.

1324
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:36,047
So then I told him, now
I got you by the balls.

1325
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,182
And I'm gonna keep squeezing and
squeezing

1326
01:10:38,216 --> 01:10:39,484
until I get fucking blood.

1327
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:41,051
And then I'm gonna crush you

1328
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:43,221
like the piss ass nigger that
you are.

1329
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:44,388
And he just stands there, he
looks at me,

1330
01:10:44,422 --> 01:10:46,223
he doesn't say anything, he's a
chump.

1331
01:10:46,257 --> 01:10:47,525
[Roberto] You done?

1332
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:48,359
[Frankie] Yeah.

1333
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:49,526
What is your fucking problem,
huh?

1334
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,596
Those guys make us a ton of
fucking dough, all right.

1335
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:54,531
Nobody's gonna connect them
to us, so just re-fucking-lax

1336
01:10:54,565 --> 01:10:55,700
and forget about it.

1337
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:57,869
It's a lot of fucking money
and it goes in my pocket.

1338
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:59,037
What's your fucking problem,
huh?

1339
01:10:59,070 --> 01:10:59,904
What the fuck is your problem?

1340
01:10:59,937 --> 01:11:00,739
[Roberto] You're my fucking
problem!

1341
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:01,439
- Fuck you!
- All right, all right.

1342
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:02,140
[foreign language], all right.

1343
01:11:02,172 --> 01:11:05,108
That's it, finito, all right.

1344
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:06,543
If this keeps up, we're gonna
sit down

1345
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:09,513
with the old man, all right.

1346
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:11,382
You're gonna get slapped on the
wrist, maybe more than that,

1347
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:12,382
all right, Frank?

1348
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:14,185
You ain't going to see
him again, all right.

1349
01:11:14,217 --> 01:11:15,485
You don't deal with them anymore

1350
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:17,922
because I can't fucking trust
you.

1351
01:11:17,954 --> 01:11:20,057
Hey, I'm talking to
you all right, capiche?

1352
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:23,093
[foreign language], enough,
now come on, let's go.

1353
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,029
You're gonna fuck this up for
us!

1354
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,296
All right, stop, stop!

1355
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:28,131
Stop, [foreign language]

1356
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:28,966
I'm not riding with him.

1357
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:30,868
I'll ride in my own car, fuck
it.

1358
01:11:33,971 --> 01:11:37,441
Hey, Roc, ain't Aisha supposed
to be having the baby soon?

1359
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:38,510
Yeah, any day.

1360
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:44,982
Ay, ain't that about your
fourth, fifth baby with Aisha?

1361
01:11:45,016 --> 01:11:46,284
You need to get your tubes tied.

1362
01:11:46,316 --> 01:11:48,086
Shut up, nigga.

1363
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:48,953
[Zoom] What's up, baby girl?

1364
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:50,988
Hi, where's Dutch?

1365
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:53,190
I got somebody who wants to talk
to him.

1366
01:11:53,223 --> 01:11:54,492
Who?

1367
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,394
William Brent.

1368
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:57,896
And who the fuck is that?

1369
01:11:57,928 --> 01:11:58,596
Bill Blass.

1370
01:11:59,997 --> 01:12:01,499
What he want?

1371
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:02,400
Trabajo?

1372
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:07,939
All right, fuck it, send him
in.

1373
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:08,639
Yo!

1374
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:13,444
Oh, there he is.

1375
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:15,346
What's up, Bill, go on have a
seat.

1376
01:12:16,713 --> 01:12:17,948
What's going on, man?

1377
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:23,520
Hey, guys, I really hate that
I'm here

1378
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:27,958
but my family and I are really
down on our luck right now.

1379
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:34,131
And I'm just looking for
any type of work right now

1380
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:34,999
if you have any.

1381
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:38,535
All right, what you think,
Roc?

1382
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:41,106
Give us a minute.

1383
01:12:42,272 --> 01:12:47,279
All right.

1384
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,548
Who he fuck with?

1385
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,917
Joe from Newark.

1386
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:54,619
He on the run from the feds.

1387
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,489
Man, fuck it.

1388
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:00,190
Just have him take Bliss' spot.

1389
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:02,126
Yeah.

1390
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,729
[Craze] All right, let's
move, let's make it happen.

1391
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:06,397
Let's make it happen, let's
move.

1392
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,263
- All right.
- All right.

1393
01:13:07,297 --> 01:13:10,400
On another note, nigga, is you
sterile?

1394
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:12,070
'Cause you ain't got no kids.

1395
01:13:12,102 --> 01:13:13,038
[Zoom] Fuck you.

1396
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:20,510
[Nina] Susan said you
wanted to see me, sir.

1397
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:21,511
Nina, come in.

1398
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:23,347
I wanted to introduce
you to our new client

1399
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:25,383
I was telling you about, Mr.
James.

1400
01:13:25,415 --> 01:13:26,284
Mr. James.

1401
01:13:27,418 --> 01:13:29,220
You can call me Bernard.

1402
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:30,054
[phone ringing]

1403
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,522
I'm sorry, I've gotta take
this.

1404
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:34,191
You guys keep talking, I'll be
right back.

1405
01:13:37,395 --> 01:13:39,397
I thought your name was Dutch.

1406
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,397
Nickname.

1407
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:43,201
[Nina] So how do you
get Dutch from Bernard?

1408
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:44,235
It's a long story.

1409
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:46,704
So the Cerrone Social Club is
one

1410
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:48,506
of the six restaurants that you
own?

1411
01:13:48,538 --> 01:13:50,742
No, but I manage it for a
friend.

1412
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:53,311
You're not exactly the person
you pretend to be, are you?

1413
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:54,544
Look, I said I could play
cards

1414
01:13:54,578 --> 01:13:55,513
till your friend came back.

1415
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:57,147
I didn't say I was good at it.

1416
01:13:58,248 --> 01:13:59,383
[Frankie] Nice, go ahead.

1417
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:01,718
One, two, head body, head
body, there you go, come on.

1418
01:14:01,752 --> 01:14:03,654
Come on, come on.

1419
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:04,588
Body, body.

1420
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:05,522
There you go, hit it, hit it...

1421
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:07,557
Don't listen to him, he don't
know shit.

1422
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:09,293
Oh, Tony, veni ca.

1423
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:10,293
[Fat Tony] Hey.

1424
01:14:10,327 --> 01:14:11,262
Kid looks good.

1425
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:13,096
[Fat Tony] He does, you'll
fuck that up.

1426
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:14,464
I trained him myself.

1427
01:14:14,498 --> 01:14:16,200
I could see that.

1428
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,302
Thank you for coming
down here to sit with me.

1429
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:21,105
No problem, for reasons
passed understanding,

1430
01:14:21,137 --> 01:14:23,207
I'm out picking up a few
things for the old lady

1431
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:25,376
tomorrow being our wedding
anniversary.

1432
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:28,112
Buona fortuna, did your wife
get the flowers I sent her?

1433
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:30,415
Yes, by the way, that was
an incredibly nice gesture.

1434
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:32,417
You made me look bad, you fuck.

1435
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:35,352
[foreign language]

1436
01:14:35,386 --> 01:14:37,555
I didn't think it was
appropriate

1437
01:14:37,587 --> 01:14:40,090
to talk to you about this over
the phone.

1438
01:14:40,123 --> 01:14:41,591
What are we talking about?

1439
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:44,494
I'm talking about our
street holdings here.

1440
01:14:44,528 --> 01:14:45,363
Dutch?

1441
01:14:45,395 --> 01:14:47,197
Yeah, Dutch.

1442
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:49,166
Come on, we all know these
people are inferior to us.

1443
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,600
Things ain't being ran right.

1444
01:14:50,633 --> 01:14:53,404
No, no, things are being
ran very fucking right

1445
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:54,805
from where I'm sitting.

1446
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:57,641
And the reason I know this
is my accountant told me so.

1447
01:14:58,376 --> 01:15:00,378
And just so there's no
more fucking confusion

1448
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:02,245
about where I'm sitting on this,

1449
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,647
the next time you wanna get
ahold of me,

1450
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:05,683
you call me on a fucking phone.

1451
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:07,084
[foreign language]

1452
01:15:07,118 --> 01:15:08,486
[foreign language]

1453
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:09,587
You mean you're gonna take the
side

1454
01:15:09,619 --> 01:15:12,623
of that bottom feeding
nigger over one of your own?

1455
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:16,561
[dramatic music]

1456
01:15:19,529 --> 01:15:22,166
[Tony choking]

1457
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:24,502
Nice work, Lou.

1458
01:15:26,736 --> 01:15:28,739
That's it, head body, head body.

1459
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:30,607
Come on, keep up that footwork.

1460
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:36,580
You come here a lot?

1461
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:37,848
A few times, a lot of doctors,

1462
01:15:37,882 --> 01:15:40,184
lawyers and financial analysts
come here.

1463
01:15:40,217 --> 01:15:43,154
I get it, rich people like
to hang with rich people.

1464
01:15:43,186 --> 01:15:43,854
Well, I ain't gonna lie.

1465
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:46,189
I enjoy the harvest of my labor.

1466
01:15:46,222 --> 01:15:48,225
But to be honest, all this is a
result

1467
01:15:48,258 --> 01:15:49,694
of wanting it for someone else.

1468
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:52,363
Okay, I'm confused.

1469
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,168
My father walked out of my
mom's life before I was born.

1470
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,636
She went hungry many a day
to feed and provide for me.

1471
01:15:59,669 --> 01:16:03,240
So I promised myself when I
got old enough that if able

1472
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:06,244
I would give her everything
that my father should have.

1473
01:16:06,276 --> 01:16:08,913
So it's not a holiday, birthday
or any day that goes by

1474
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:10,314
where I don't try to give her
the best

1475
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:11,815
that life has to offer.

1476
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:13,717
Well, your mother is very
fortunate

1477
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,919
because I don't think
there's a woman alive

1478
01:16:15,953 --> 01:16:18,522
that wouldn't wish for
that quality in a man.

1479
01:16:18,556 --> 01:16:21,459
Well, I'm not trying to
win an award or nothing.

1480
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:25,162
You sure are easy to talk to.

1481
01:16:26,564 --> 01:16:27,499
So are you.

1482
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:31,903
["Mandarin Hotel"]

1483
01:17:05,769 --> 01:17:08,338
You have the lawyers for
Martin and Kendall at noon.

1484
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:09,507
That meeting's gonna run long,

1485
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:10,774
so will you order us something
to eat?

1486
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:12,275
Sure, what do you feel like?

1487
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,543
Whatever you had yesterday is
fine.

1488
01:17:13,577 --> 01:17:14,779
Can we try something
different?

1489
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:16,881
I had lasagna, you had
spaghetti.

1490
01:17:16,913 --> 01:17:18,481
I had a bad experience with
it.

1491
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:19,348
Why?

1492
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:20,316
Well, they delivered the
meatballs

1493
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,419
but they forget the
spaghetti and the sauce.

1494
01:17:22,453 --> 01:17:24,222
They clearly have zero
compassion

1495
01:17:24,254 --> 01:17:26,390
for young starving assistants.

1496
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:27,290
They took care of it, right?

1497
01:17:27,324 --> 01:17:28,192
Yeah, but I was hungry.

1498
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:29,526
By the time they brought the
spaghetti,

1499
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,895
I had already eaten the
meatballs.

1500
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:32,262
That must've sucked.

1501
01:17:32,296 --> 01:17:33,263
Tell me about it.

1502
01:17:33,297 --> 01:17:35,533
Okay, well we won't
be ordering from them.

1503
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,769
Hey.

1504
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:39,637
Hi.

1505
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:43,208
I forgot to tell you, Mr.
James is here.

1506
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:45,643
What stopped you?

1507
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:46,744
The meatballs.

1508
01:17:46,776 --> 01:17:47,845
Thank you, Sam.

1509
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:54,718
I'm sorry.

1510
01:17:54,752 --> 01:17:56,521
Why, did you do something
wrong?

1511
01:17:57,254 --> 01:18:00,423
I didn't call you, but
by no means does that

1512
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,959
reflect the time that we spent
together.

1513
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:04,629
It was incredible.

1514
01:18:04,662 --> 01:18:09,633
Yeah, it was.

1515
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:12,804
Excuse me.

1516
01:18:14,471 --> 01:18:15,606
Nina, what are you trying to
tell me

1517
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:17,574
that you're not telling me?

1518
01:18:17,607 --> 01:18:19,276
I liked you from the moment I
met you,

1519
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,544
but I can't do this.

1520
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:24,515
I spoke with Tamika and
she let me know what you do

1521
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:26,783
beyond the restaurants and
stores.

1522
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:28,752
When I told you my brother died,

1523
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:31,422
he was murdered by a drug
dealer.

1524
01:18:31,454 --> 01:18:32,922
So you think I'm gonna end up
like him

1525
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:34,425
and you gonna lose me, too.

1526
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:38,561
You're far too smart to get
caught up

1527
01:18:38,595 --> 01:18:39,763
the way my brother did.

1528
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:47,004
It's about respect, respect
for his life, his memory.

1529
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:50,742
I can't see myself living
off what he died for.

1530
01:18:52,676 --> 01:18:53,745
I can respect that.

1531
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,716
And I probably shouldn't say
this,

1532
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:01,551
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1533
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:03,954
You will never ever get over me.

1534
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:07,492
I was meant for you and
you were meant for me.

1535
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:10,961
How do you know that?

1536
01:19:10,994 --> 01:19:12,563
Nobody knows that much.

1537
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:15,999
I know 'cause I know what love
is.

1538
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:23,775
[organ music]

1539
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:34,552
Mrs. Cerrone, this is Bernard
James, a business associate

1540
01:19:34,584 --> 01:19:36,553
and very good friend of your
husband's.

1541
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:39,957
[organ music]

1542
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:49,000
Rose, Tony was like a
brother to me, I'm so sorry.

1543
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,802
Whatever you need.

1544
01:19:52,503 --> 01:19:54,906
[organ music]

1545
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:08,386
Reach out to Detective O'Neal.

1546
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:11,154
I want this boy put to
bed as soon as possible.

1547
01:20:11,187 --> 01:20:14,124
[foreign language]

1548
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,397
Bill Blass, you was just gonna
leave

1549
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:25,436
without saying goodbye,
after we gave you a job?

1550
01:20:25,769 --> 01:20:26,870
Ow, fuck!

1551
01:20:28,872 --> 01:20:33,543
Look, guys, it's not what you
think it is.

1552
01:20:33,577 --> 01:20:34,412
[Craze] Oh yeah?

1553
01:20:34,445 --> 01:20:35,113
No.

1554
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,580
What is it?

1555
01:20:37,614 --> 01:20:39,649
You guys saw how shit was
going down.

1556
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:43,686
I was gonna give the money
back, I was only holding onto it

1557
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,458
in case there was a raid
or shit got complicated.

1558
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:49,693
It's true.

1559
01:20:49,726 --> 01:20:52,630
[Craze laughing]
[phone ringing]

1560
01:20:52,663 --> 01:20:53,531
Yeah.

1561
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:55,999
Come on, guys, you gotta
believe me.

1562
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:56,901
Man, shut up.

1563
01:20:56,934 --> 01:20:57,802
Hold on.

1564
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:01,906
Yo.

1565
01:21:05,742 --> 01:21:06,944
All right.

1566
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:09,212
Ay, y'all let Dutch
know whatever he needs,

1567
01:21:09,245 --> 01:21:12,182
whatever it is, I got him,
whatever.

1568
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:14,685
Yeah, I know, Dutch told us.

1569
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:16,052
He got a job for you.

1570
01:21:16,086 --> 01:21:17,488
Only you can do it, Bill.

1571
01:21:18,154 --> 01:21:20,457
Well, can I at least get
dressed first?

1572
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,694
Of course, Dutch has a
special outfit for you.

1573
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,529
Like I said, anything for
Dutch.

1574
01:21:29,098 --> 01:21:30,501
What the fuck is that?

1575
01:21:30,534 --> 01:21:31,602
It's an option vest.

1576
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:35,506
You got two options.

1577
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:39,108
Either you put this vest
on that Dutch made for you

1578
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:42,846
and you take some people
out along with yourself.

1579
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:45,682
Option two, we kill your whole
family.

1580
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,486
What the fuck you wanna do?

1581
01:21:48,519 --> 01:21:51,588
Your wife, your daughter,
your mother, your dad,

1582
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:52,856
your grandfather, your cousin

1583
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,727
and bubblefuck, we killing
everybody.

1584
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,529
Fuck, I think I just pissed
myself.

1585
01:21:58,561 --> 01:21:59,963
Fine, I'll fucking do it.

1586
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:02,900
I'll put the fucking vest on.

1587
01:22:02,932 --> 01:22:07,204
I thought you might
say that, wise choice.

1588
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:13,544
Yo, that nigga Roc is
really having another baby.

1589
01:22:13,577 --> 01:22:15,646
Man, didn't Aisha say it
wasn't gonna be no nother one?

1590
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:18,781
Ha, Roc's a little bitch.

1591
01:22:18,815 --> 01:22:21,586
[dramatic music]

1592
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,129
Secure all the exits,
we're going upstairs.

1593
01:22:33,163 --> 01:22:34,031
Move!

1594
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:42,205
[dramatic music]

1595
01:22:43,906 --> 01:22:46,744
Yeah, yeah bro, it's a boy.

1596
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:47,645
Big boy.

1597
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:53,684
Rahmin Abdul, also known
as Roc, you're under arrest.

1598
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:56,754
It's over.

1599
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:58,989
You have the right to remain
silent.

1600
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:00,056
[Roc] I just had a baby.

1601
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:00,923
- [Officer] Let's go.
- [Roc] I just had a baby.

1602
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,160
[Officer] If you give up that
right...

1603
01:23:06,663 --> 01:23:07,698
What the fuck?

1604
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,798
Fuck he smiling at?

1605
01:23:11,101 --> 01:23:13,905
[dramatic music]

1606
01:23:16,172 --> 01:23:18,041
What they call it when you don't
wanna have the baby no more

1607
01:23:18,074 --> 01:23:20,209
and you get your nuts clipped?

1608
01:23:20,243 --> 01:23:22,913
The snip, that's a vasectomy.

1609
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:23,780
Vasectomy?

1610
01:23:23,814 --> 01:23:28,017
Yeah...
[sirens wailing]

1611
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:30,855
[dramatic music]

1612
01:23:32,623 --> 01:23:33,290
Come on!

1613
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:37,627
[dramatic music]

1614
01:23:47,671 --> 01:23:50,074
[guns firing]

1615
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:55,713
[dramatic music]

1616
01:24:22,372 --> 01:24:25,008
Get a couple bottles to
table 12, no sparklies, though.

1617
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:25,943
Keep it low key.

1618
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,779
["Heat Up"]

1619
01:24:29,812 --> 01:24:34,150
Dutch, bruh, Zoom is dead.

1620
01:24:34,184 --> 01:24:37,287
and they got Angel on lockdown,
the feds.

1621
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,056
Roc and Angel ain't gonna
flip.

1622
01:24:41,857 --> 01:24:44,662
[dramatic music]

1623
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:52,770
Detective, you claim that
Mr. Bernard James is the cause

1624
01:24:52,802 --> 01:24:55,004
for your early retirement.

1625
01:24:55,038 --> 01:24:58,776
Yes, he ordered that the
27th Precinct be blown up.

1626
01:24:59,476 --> 01:25:02,846
He sent a psycho into the
station strapped with C4.

1627
01:25:02,878 --> 01:25:04,948
He blew himself up and my fellow
officers.

1628
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,151
Objections, your honor, calls
for facts not in evidence.

1629
01:25:08,185 --> 01:25:09,053
Overruled.

1630
01:25:09,086 --> 01:25:09,919
Exception.

1631
01:25:09,953 --> 01:25:10,787
[Judge] Noted.

1632
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,457
Now, Mr. O'Neal, how can you
be sure

1633
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:16,092
that Mr. Bernard James
was indeed responsible

1634
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:17,360
for that explosion?

1635
01:25:17,394 --> 01:25:19,762
The suicide bomber's
name was William Brent.

1636
01:25:19,796 --> 01:25:21,330
He also went by Bill Blass.

1637
01:25:21,364 --> 01:25:23,701
He was a small-time hustler.

1638
01:25:23,734 --> 01:25:25,169
He sent his wife a letter the
morning

1639
01:25:25,202 --> 01:25:26,837
before he entered the building.

1640
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:30,940
Is this the letter?

1641
01:25:30,973 --> 01:25:32,042
Objection.

1642
01:25:32,074 --> 01:25:33,677
Counsel, get up here now.

1643
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:38,082
[dramatic music]

1644
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,450
I'm very surprised.

1645
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:43,954
The defense has never received
a copy of this letter.

1646
01:25:43,986 --> 01:25:47,091
Your honor, we received this
this morning by the witness.

1647
01:25:47,123 --> 01:25:48,825
You knew he'd be introducing
this letter

1648
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:49,927
as your witness prep.

1649
01:25:49,959 --> 01:25:50,860
I'll allow it.

1650
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,930
He has a duty to turn over all
evidence.

1651
01:25:52,962 --> 01:25:54,263
[Judge] I said I'll allow it.

1652
01:25:54,297 --> 01:25:55,232
Your honor.

1653
01:25:55,265 --> 01:25:57,168
Counsel, I made my
ruling, step back now.

1654
01:25:58,502 --> 01:26:01,305
[dramatic music]

1655
01:26:16,787 --> 01:26:20,757
Dear Monique, by the time
you get this, I'll be dead,

1656
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:23,392
but I wanted you to know
that it's because of Dutch.

1657
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:26,296
He said if I don't do what
he says, he's gonna kill you,

1658
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:29,032
the kids and my whole family.

1659
01:26:29,065 --> 01:26:31,101
So this is my sacrifice.

1660
01:26:31,133 --> 01:26:32,336
I gladly make it, too.

1661
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:36,405
When you get this, deliver
it to the authorities,

1662
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:38,475
the DA or someone like that.

1663
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,910
Don't give it to no regular cop,
though.

1664
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:43,280
I love you, pray for my soul.

1665
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:44,315
Love always, Billy.

1666
01:26:46,048 --> 01:26:48,852
[dramatic music]

1667
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:27,490
[building exploding]

1668
01:27:34,897 --> 01:27:35,865
Hey, Michelle.

1669
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:36,566
You're blessed.

1670
01:27:44,507 --> 01:27:48,178
Your best was good but it
wasn't good enough, accept it.

1671
01:27:48,211 --> 01:27:50,580
The trial isn't over,
you haven't won yet.

1672
01:27:50,614 --> 01:27:52,115
I'll do you a favor,

1673
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,051
I'll take the death penalty off
the table.

1674
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:55,118
That's your offer?

1675
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,421
Look, I don't wanna
see your client executed.

1676
01:27:57,454 --> 01:28:00,224
I prefer to watch him rot in
prison for the rest of his life

1677
01:28:00,257 --> 01:28:02,526
as a gleaming example for
those who break the law

1678
01:28:02,559 --> 01:28:03,494
on my watch.

1679
01:28:03,526 --> 01:28:05,561
You mean as an example
for financial donors

1680
01:28:05,595 --> 01:28:06,997
in your bid for governor.

1681
01:28:08,565 --> 01:28:11,368
[dramatic music]

1682
01:28:12,068 --> 01:28:13,436
I'll even let you choose the
prison

1683
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:15,038
where he serves out his life
sentence.

1684
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:17,341
You haven't met the
elements, I can still win this.

1685
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:19,342
If not now, then on appeal.

1686
01:28:19,376 --> 01:28:21,144
Unless you become a magician,

1687
01:28:21,177 --> 01:28:22,880
we all know what's gonna happen.

1688
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:27,581
You have until before
closing arguments tomorrow,

1689
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:28,985
take that to your client.

1690
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:35,125
We'll take the next one.

1691
01:28:43,232 --> 01:28:45,369
["Again"]

1692
01:29:07,089 --> 01:29:09,126
The jury is split.

1693
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:12,696
I've been advocating strongly
on behalf of Mr. James.

1694
01:29:12,729 --> 01:29:15,633
So when I flip against him,
everyone else will follow.

1695
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:17,501
He's toast.

1696
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:22,306
["Again"]

1697
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:35,084
I asked my judge, Dutch
will never see daylight,

1698
01:29:35,118 --> 01:29:36,220
I promise you that.

1699
01:29:37,654 --> 01:29:40,324
Nobody fucks with me.

1700
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:47,397
[light music]

1701
01:29:51,735 --> 01:29:54,037
You know you're a
very sexy woman, right?

1702
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:56,140
If I didn't, I would be an
idiot.

1703
01:29:57,373 --> 01:29:59,510
You'll go out your
way not to be an idiot.

1704
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:03,446
Are you getting enough to eat?

1705
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:06,083
I was on a diet.

1706
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:07,184
[Michelle] Exercise?

1707
01:30:07,984 --> 01:30:08,952
I was waiting for you to stop
by

1708
01:30:08,985 --> 01:30:11,755
to see if you wanted to
get in a pickup game.

1709
01:30:11,788 --> 01:30:13,390
You like doing that, don't
you?

1710
01:30:13,422 --> 01:30:14,457
Doing what?

1711
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,025
Pretending things are
worse than what they are.

1712
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:17,761
Oh, I ain't gotta pretend.

1713
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:20,997
I'll spend a couple of years
in here and then be executed.

1714
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:24,066
The judge and the jury are
already bought and paid for.

1715
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,502
Can you prove that?

1716
01:30:25,534 --> 01:30:28,037
No, but you'll know
I'm telling the truth

1717
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:29,171
because the man that
bought and paid for it

1718
01:30:29,204 --> 01:30:31,173
will be in court tomorrow.

1719
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:34,177
He ain't gonna miss the
opportunity to see me burn.

1720
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:36,046
Then why are they offering
to take the death penalty

1721
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:38,349
off the table and get
you to choose the prison?

1722
01:30:39,815 --> 01:30:42,019
That's to torture me first.

1723
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:43,387
It's still a death sentence.

1724
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:45,521
It's a discreet phone call

1725
01:30:45,555 --> 01:30:48,057
from one prison official to
another.

1726
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:50,227
Suddenly, a Newark drug
dealer is found dead

1727
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,595
in his cell from suicide.

1728
01:30:51,628 --> 01:30:53,063
Nobody'll question it.

1729
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:55,798
I'll question it.

1730
01:30:55,832 --> 01:30:57,100
It doesn't matter.

1731
01:30:57,132 --> 01:30:58,401
It'll be like the Freddie Gray
case

1732
01:30:58,435 --> 01:31:00,604
and countless others before me.

1733
01:31:00,637 --> 01:31:02,072
Nobody'll be convicted.

1734
01:31:03,472 --> 01:31:05,641
If you felt that way,
why did you hire me?

1735
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:08,378
Here Comes the Sun.

1736
01:31:09,745 --> 01:31:11,015
Nina Simone song?

1737
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:13,050
Somebody told me once

1738
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:14,785
that song promised a better
tomorrow.

1739
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:19,757
I'm not done yet.

1740
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:24,494
[dramatic music]

1741
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:41,078
You're watching Wake Up New
Jersey.

1742
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,979
I'm David Greenwood.

1743
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:43,213
Today, we're keeping a very
close eye

1744
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:46,816
on what could only be described
as the most important trial

1745
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:49,086
in the history of Newark.

1746
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:50,620
District attorney Anthony Jacobs

1747
01:31:50,653 --> 01:31:52,222
and defense attorney Michelle
Nichols

1748
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:53,856
are about to begin their closing
remarks

1749
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:54,958
in the trial of Bernard James.

1750
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:57,793
This is all happening today
and I can tell you guys

1751
01:31:57,827 --> 01:32:00,297
from personal experience
that at most trials,

1752
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:03,566
it all hinges on these closing
arguments by the attorneys.

1753
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,869
However, the defense attorney
appears to be playing

1754
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:08,171
by the New Jersey Nets rule,

1755
01:32:08,204 --> 01:32:10,440
as in they've already lost the
game

1756
01:32:10,472 --> 01:32:12,408
but they're still on the court.

1757
01:32:12,441 --> 01:32:14,610
Stay with us as we follow
this developing story

1758
01:32:14,644 --> 01:32:16,646
as it all unfolds.

1759
01:32:16,678 --> 01:32:19,482
[dramatic music]

1760
01:32:24,354 --> 01:32:27,124
[dramatic music]

1761
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,436
All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

1762
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:43,740
[light music]

1763
01:32:57,587 --> 01:32:59,489
You may be seated.

1764
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:00,457
Bring in the jury.

1765
01:33:06,562 --> 01:33:09,365
[dramatic music]

1766
01:33:18,975 --> 01:33:19,910
Are you prepared to proceed

1767
01:33:19,943 --> 01:33:22,244
with your closing statements,
counselors?

1768
01:33:22,278 --> 01:33:23,446
Yes, your honor, I am.

1769
01:33:33,823 --> 01:33:36,793
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, you have just sat

1770
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:39,261
through three weeks of the
biggest

1771
01:33:39,294 --> 01:33:41,832
and baddest gangster movie ever
performed.

1772
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:46,302
It was better than the
Godfather, better than Casino.

1773
01:33:46,336 --> 01:33:50,973
It reminded me of Scarface
and just as fictitious.

1774
01:33:51,007 --> 01:33:55,845
It was written, directed and
produced by your very own

1775
01:33:55,878 --> 01:33:58,315
district attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

1776
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:00,751
He deserves an Oscar.

1777
01:34:01,618 --> 01:34:04,754
[Michelle clapping]

1778
01:34:04,787 --> 01:34:09,258
But this isn't Hollywood,
ladies and gentlemen.

1779
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,561
There's a man's life at stake.

1780
01:34:11,593 --> 01:34:14,263
And in these past few
weeks, not a single fact

1781
01:34:14,297 --> 01:34:18,267
has been presented by
Attorney Jacobs, not one.

1782
01:34:18,301 --> 01:34:20,971
He has merely presented
circumstantial evidence

1783
01:34:21,003 --> 01:34:24,341
held together by the
weak glue of assumption.

1784
01:34:24,373 --> 01:34:28,278
Assumption of crooked cops,
gangsters turned ministers,

1785
01:34:28,311 --> 01:34:31,815
five and dime hustlers and
not one law abiding citizen

1786
01:34:31,847 --> 01:34:34,350
in the bunch, not one.

1787
01:34:35,118 --> 01:34:38,754
He brings waywardness and the
faith of truth and glorifies

1788
01:34:38,788 --> 01:34:42,792
every word that comes out of
his mouth as to lure you away

1789
01:34:42,824 --> 01:34:45,962
from what's real, what's true.

1790
01:34:46,896 --> 01:34:48,964
And the witnesses he produced
certainly

1791
01:34:48,998 --> 01:34:51,702
aren't credible enough
to hang a man's life on.

1792
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:53,802
The district attorney

1793
01:34:53,836 --> 01:34:58,275
has not proven Mr. James
committed any crimes.

1794
01:34:58,307 --> 01:34:59,908
What crimes did he commit?

1795
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:01,910
I still don't know.

1796
01:35:01,944 --> 01:35:04,446
And it's supposed to be up
to you to find out based

1797
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,450
on the evidence supplied by the
state?

1798
01:35:08,818 --> 01:35:10,520
I don't think so.

1799
01:35:10,552 --> 01:35:12,622
I don't think the jury
should confuse itself

1800
01:35:12,654 --> 01:35:15,624
with the manuscripts
attorney Jacobs presented

1801
01:35:15,658 --> 01:35:17,794
with the real facts of this
case.

1802
01:35:19,028 --> 01:35:21,463
If you do that, then you will
only see

1803
01:35:21,497 --> 01:35:24,501
that Mr. James is
innocent of these crimes.

1804
01:35:28,471 --> 01:35:29,339
Thank you.

1805
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:35,779
Ladies and gentlemen, I
wanna thank you for your time

1806
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:39,548
and your patience throughout
these past few weeks.

1807
01:35:39,582 --> 01:35:42,552
As I said in the beginning, I
mean, we could be doing a lot

1808
01:35:42,584 --> 01:35:45,388
of other things but it was our
duty

1809
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:48,958
to ourselves and to each other.

1810
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:50,760
These past few weeks, we've been
submerged

1811
01:35:50,793 --> 01:35:53,630
in the murky waters of
Bernard James' life,

1812
01:35:53,663 --> 01:35:57,434
his disregard for life, law
and order and the property

1813
01:35:57,467 --> 01:36:00,737
of others from his youth,
stealing cars to the present.

1814
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,107
His existence has been
filled with bloodshed,

1815
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:08,645
murder, innocent victims
and shattered lives.

1816
01:36:08,677 --> 01:36:11,914
Now, we must do for Simone
Greenwood, her mother and father

1817
01:36:11,948 --> 01:36:14,551
what they are not here to do
today.

1818
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:17,586
And Detective O'Neal
from the 27th Precinct,

1819
01:36:17,619 --> 01:36:19,789
the survivors and their
families.

1820
01:36:20,789 --> 01:36:23,392
Your duty is to them now.

1821
01:36:24,961 --> 01:36:28,731
Your duty is to honor each and
every life

1822
01:36:28,765 --> 01:36:32,569
that Bernard James has
taken because if you don't,

1823
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:37,541
the lives that he takes in the
future

1824
01:36:38,574 --> 01:36:40,911
will be blood on your hands.

1825
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:45,615
Let's hope and pray that
the next victim isn't you

1826
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:50,619
or you, your brother, your
sister, your mom, your dad,

1827
01:36:50,653 --> 01:36:52,588
your husband, your wife

1828
01:36:54,489 --> 01:36:55,458
or your children.

1829
01:36:57,427 --> 01:36:59,763
If you we do not find justice

1830
01:36:59,796 --> 01:37:02,865
and find the defendant
Bernard James guilty today,

1831
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:05,968
then each and every one of you

1832
01:37:07,003 --> 01:37:08,705
will leave this courtroom today

1833
01:37:08,738 --> 01:37:11,475
as guilty as this man right
here.

1835
01:37:24,654 --> 01:37:26,022
