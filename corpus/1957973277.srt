ourselves, W.W.B.B.B.D?

361
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:43,127
What would Brother Big Bob do? [Bell Ring]

362
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,496
Oh, sorry. Let me help you out with that.

363
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,083
[Scalding sound] OOHH!! HEY!!!

364
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,052
Fiddlesticks. [Train horn]

365
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,845
[door bell] I'm back honey.

366
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,263
GEOFFREY:
Hey, Mama - I'm back here.

367
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,683
That postman did it again.

368
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,226
I think they just mix up the mail

369
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,945
so we can meet our neighbors.

370
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,440
Alright, one more

371
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,530
little squeeze, and there, let's see you.

372
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,323
Ooh-la-la.

373
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,326
Jackie O's got nothin' on you, girl.

374
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,453
So tell me why you
always walk around in those

375
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,373
stinky gym clothes? My volleyball threads?

376
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,542
Um-hmm. That's what I do.

377
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,752
Well, this is what I do.

378
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,713
And you are absolutely ripped

379
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,550
from the cover of a 1961 Life Magazine.

380
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,395
LIFE Magazine? Google it.

381
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,814
Geoffrey, you know...

382
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,350
You know who would love this dress?

383
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,478
Mama! Esther! Even in high school,

384
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,063
I remember your mama was

385
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,231
crazy about Jackie Kennedy.

386
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,733
When's her birthday? How much is my

387
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,900
employee discount?

388
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,737
Oh, we'll give you a
good deal on this one.

389
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,571
Too bad she can't actually

390
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,115
wear it anywhere. Oh, that's right.

391
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,700
Your daddy does keep a tight lid

392
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,076
on the fun factor, doesn't he?

393
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,536
That man could suck the fun

394
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,797
out of a clown car! Yes, he could!

395
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,169
Geoffrey, why didn't you ever leave?

396
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,053
You want me gone or somethin'?

397
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,758
No. But really? What? Homer? I did.

398
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,103
College in Birmingham,
then moved to Tampa,

399
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,430
then Mama got sick so I came back home.

400
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,848
Bim Bam Boom. Back in my room.

401
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,434
My story. The End.

402
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,853
Do you ever feel... Stuck?

403
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,605
Stuck? Naw sweetie.

404
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,941
Not in my nature.
Why don't you go on to Troy

405
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,401
and take that volleyball scholarship?

406
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,778
I mean like LEAVE LEAVE.

407
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:46,158
Like Richmond or
Chicago? Besides Navy Pier

408
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,619
and Nordstrom, what's Chicago got?

409
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,629
Oh you know, Uncle Steve and Aunt Verna

410
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,789
moved up there last year

411
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,925
and my sister Missy's in Richmond.

412
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,128
I miss her. She doesn't get home much.

413
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,255
And that surprises you because?

414
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,850
I dunno, I just...

415
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,303
I just think I need... out.

416
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,680
What does Brother Bob think about that?

417
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,890
To tell you the truth,

418
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,570
I wouldn't know.
Daddy's got other priorities.

419
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,072
♪
No, no, no. You're doing

420
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,442
fine, Carlton.
Well just, take him aside,

421
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,953
open up your Soul Winners New Testament,

422
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,996
and lead him down the

423
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,498
Roman road of salvation.

424
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,200
Ol' Carlton's got a lost plumber

425
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,793
working on his septic tank.

426
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,212
Tryin' to bring him to Jesus!

427
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,131
Yeah!

428
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,834
Well, I mean maybe, maybe tell him

429
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,968
that the Lord will pump

430
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,887
the sewage out of his life!

431
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,423
I mean of course,
after he cleans up a bit.

432
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,352
Umm, right well. You know what?

433
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,771
You're doin' fine.
Ok. God bless.

434
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,565
We'll be prayin' for ya. Ok bye.

435
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,766
Sorry for the interruption.

436
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,526
Lord's work is never done, you know.

437
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,439
[Steel drum] You play? That's a leftover

438
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,200
from a previous life.

439
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,245
Now, Josh, before we get started,

440
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,956
I'd like to ask you a question.

441
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,459
If you died tonight,

442
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,088
do you know where you'd go? New York.

443
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,708
I'm talkin' about your soul, son.

444
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,335
I mean we're all gonna face it one day.

445
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,137
But you don't want to face that day

446
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,307
without a personal
relationship with Jesus.

447
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,683
Yeah and you know, I don't

448
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,927
really have one,
so maybe I'm not the right

449
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,137
director for this movie.

450
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,972
No, no, no...
Now, I gotta tell ya.

451
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,765
I've been fastin' and prayin'.

452
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,394
I can see the Lord rainin' down His power.

453
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,738
I've asked the Lord to bind Satan,

454
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,700
and keep him locked up. I can see the Lord

455
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,736
and his angelic host riding

456
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,497
on the clouds of majesty.

457
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,411
So, is that a yes or a no?

458
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,080
A yes or no to what? Me being the director

459
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,840
of this little Bible movie.

460
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,588
You know, my daddy used to say

461
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,381
the Lord works in mysterious ways

462
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,300
His wonders to perform.

463
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,428
You might call it a coincidence.

464
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,805
But I have seen the hand of God

465
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,099
and that's enough for me.

466
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,269
So yeah, we're gonna make a movie, son.

467
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,896
Yeah it's just too weird, man.

468
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,774
It's too Christian. And no,

469
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,484
your research on Alabama
did not help at all.

470
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,286
Did not help at all.

471
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,445
There's no banjos, no football,

472
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,405
no beautiful women...

473
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,450
Well there was one maybe.

474
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,451
There's no script, no crew,

475
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,036
Nothin'. Haven't seen anything.

476
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,454
Nothin' except this deal

477
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,956
my Aunt Judy and this

478
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,624
preacher character cooked up.

479
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,718
So, save my seat at the bar.

480
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,636
I'll be back for Juneteenth.

481
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,129
NOAH: So he says to himself,

482
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,807
"Self, I know what I'll do.

483
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,217
I'll go home and ask my daddy

484
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,343
to take me back."

485
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,512
And that's just what he did.

486
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,896
But his daddy saw him coming

487
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,100
and ran out to meet him.

488
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,394
Then you know what he did?

489
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,728
He gave his son a big ol'

490
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,523
hug of fellowship. The son started giving

491
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,609
his little speech. But, the Father said,

492
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,112
"Hurry! Bring blue jeans

493
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,947
and a hoodie for him,

494
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,032
and the best designer sneakers

495
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,668
for his feet. Call Sammy's Pizza Palace,

496
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,120
reserve the back room

497
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,458
"because my
baby boy is back, Jack."

498
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,920
Can I get an Amen? CONGREGATION: Amen!

499
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,755
Praise the Lord! Now, you all go back and

with open arms, and a big ol' party.

Can I get an Amen? Amen. Now, we'd like to

Wow. Thanks. Yeah.

I feel like I'm running for office.

529
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,629
Just have some patience, I mean

530
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,630
you know the Board is always last.

531
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,423
Noah, come on over here.

532
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,383

Yes. She's comin' over for dinner.

535
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:58,678
Wonderful. I can just...

536
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,347
I can just swing by later then, right?

537
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,598
No, it's probably not

538
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,476

Careful those are antiques.

900
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,231
Are the script supervisor? I don't know.

901
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,941
Who's the script supey?

902
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,994
Ok I'll figure it out.

903
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,357
Josh, a word.

904
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,560
Well, if it isn't Bela Lugosi!

905
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,394
I'm just messin' with ya.

906
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,063
Listen, I can't make any sense

907
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,991
outta this last scene.
What is this, Greek?

908
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,151
Josh, for the love of

909
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,496
all that's Holy, who are all these people?

910
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,989
Well, it's a movie crew.

911
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,323
The best one I could round up.

912
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,042
Got a problem?

913
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,495
Is he Muslim? Muslim, maybe.

914
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,457
Turkish, definitely. He's not gonna bite,

915
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,466
go talk to him.

916
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,292
I don't think you understand

917
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,719
the theological implications here, son.

918
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,713
Garth, why don't you

919
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,174
and Brother Bob
have a little script conference.

920
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,558
I'll be right back.

921
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,733
Umm... Garth.

922
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,404
Let me ask you a question, Garth.

923
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,523
If you died tonight,

924
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,076
do you know where you'd go?

925
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,246
New York? What kind of...

926
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,666
[drum music]

927
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:41,934
Mom! Carl, hey bro. What's goin' on.

928
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,302
Haven't seen you lately, everything ok?

929
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,647
Yeah. Ok. We've missed you in youth group.

930
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,458
Oh. Sorry.

931
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,630
So, have a nice chat?

932
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,799
[Whistling]

933
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,046
Oh, Mr. Sheets! Good afternoon, come here.

934
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,299
Girls, excuse me. Would you have a seat?

935
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,592
I was just setting up

936
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,761
to do some interviews. I'd love

937
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,813
to get your opinion on some things.

938
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,685
Ok. Alright now look right at me

939
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,144
and tell me what your involvement

940
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,438
in the film is. Well, I guess I'm the

941
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:40,734
bookkeeper. And I am
going to track every expense.

942
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,202
What do you think of all this?

943
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,705
I think it's going to cost a lot of money.

944
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,448
And some of these people here

945
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,118
look like they're at the wrong movie.

946
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,160
Okay, everybody.

947
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,212
Let's get
this goin'. Last looks.

948
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,374
Actually, let's get you back over there.

949
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,800
We're gonna go left to right.

[cell phone rings]

951
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,148
Turn off your phones. Roll cam. Speed!

952
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,694
Here's where you
slate it. Jump in there.

953
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,493

And, action. Peter, Adam...

955
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,165
I've decided to retire.

956
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,843
I'm handing the company over to you boys.

957
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,846
I've worked my whole life

958
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,598
building up the business,

959
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:48,427
and now I'm giving it all to you.

960
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,022
Thank you, Father. We will make you proud.

961
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,732
Not so fast, Peter.

962
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:03,575
Father. I've got to be free.

963
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,994
I've got to do it MY way.

964
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,914
What do you mean? Let's just sell it.

965
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,367
WHAT?! I will take my share

966
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,376
and go off to distant lands.

967
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,954
I will make a name for
myself. NO! YES! NO!

968
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,040
WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER! NOOOOOO! YESSSSS!

969
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,052
Nooooooo! Sit down Mama! (crying) Noooooo!

Mother! No!

00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:38,610
My muscles. Noooooooooooo!

973
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,240
Breathe! Breathe!

974
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,240
CUT! Fantastic. Is she ok?

975
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,908
That was so great, wow!

976
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,702
Great commitment. I loved it.

977
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,161
We're gonna bring it back...

978
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,415
a touch. And a...

979
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,133
and let's go again. Yeah?

Alright, so uhh... roll it back!

So then Geoffrey,

982

and the lady playin' the mother,

983
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,092
get into it about this cross

984
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,427
she's supposed to wear in the scene.

985
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,186
Ya know he puts one on her

986
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,096
with this Jesus on it, and she's like,

987
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,305
"I'm not wearing this

988
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,982
because it's way too Catholic."

989
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,101
By the way,

990
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,144
if I had on some gym shorts right now

991
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,029
it'd be ON.

992
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,655
Oh yeah? Oh yeah.

993
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,357
You think you could take me?

994
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,484
Oh... that's pathetic.

995
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,661
About what I would expect.

996
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,240
Hey. I'm an artist. Not a jock, ok?

997
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,750
Besides, golf's my game.

998
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,617
I've been wondering

999
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,169
about your game, lately.

1000
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,754
Wonderin' about my game, huh?

1001
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,422
That's cute, ok.

1002
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,915
You know what I've been wonderin' about?

1003
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,625
This reggae fixation that Bob has?

1004
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,552
What's up with that?

1005
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,712
Grandaddy has this great

1006
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,464

Practically daddy's second mother.

Ya know he jammed with

1009
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,102
a bunch of rasta guys once.

1010
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,479
No way.

1011
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,306
Yeah. Right out of high school

1012
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,141
he moved up to Clearwater Beach.

1013
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,360
Yeah out of Big Bob's
reach. Tryin' to...

1014
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,312
You know, you know. Ya know he still has

1015
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,189
some chops though underneath that uptight

1016

1017
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,650
But, I'm not supposed to let

1018
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,202
that cat out of the bag. Meow.

1019
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,372
What else is in the bag?

1020
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,656
Bob and Noah's parents

1021
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,999
sign a secret marriage contract

1022
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,002
for the two of you? Oh. Gross.

1023
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,287
Hey I've been seein' the way

1024
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,205
he creeps around you.

1025
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,456
Psh. Hey you two would make

1026
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,332
a really cute couple,

1027
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,334
if you can handle it, ya know. Oh, yeah?

1028
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,419
Yeah. Yeah. Ya know, you'd make a fine

1029
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,629
little pack of fundamentalists

1030
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,673
together. Ya know, get a big white house.

1031
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,008
Keep the Baptists populated.

1032
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,009
God knows, they don't have enough

1033
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,728
of those in Alabama.

1034
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,064
You know what?

1035
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,067
I think that Noah threatens you.

1036
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,603
No. Not even close. That's cute.

1037
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,354
Maybe there's a movie

1038
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,855
in there somewhere, ya know?

1039
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,273
One big man on campus

1040
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,691
facing off against another

1041
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,985
in an epic battle for the...

1042
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,453
For the what?

1043
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,951
Oh! Ok! I am so sorry about that.

1044
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,836
That was just a little uhh...

1045
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,750
Coach says never let

1046
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,971
the opponent get in your head.

1047
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,806
So, uhh, this really is

1048
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,058
your first time out of the big city, huh?

1049
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,101
Yeah.

1050
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,480
Mama's apron strings pretty short?

1051
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,153
Wouldn't know.

1052
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,899
After she and my dad split up

1053
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,192
she took a job in London.

1054
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,453
Text and talk every now and then.

1055
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:40,626
It's ok. So, what about your daddy then?

1056
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,547
Last I heard, Canada.

1057
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,009
So... no family around?

1058
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,470
I got my buddy Garth.

1059
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,264
He's my brother, y'know?

1060
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,017
And my Aunt Judy.

1061
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,218
She's been tryin' to get me

1062
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,095
to visit for a long time.

1063
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,930
I'm glad it worked out because

1064
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,058
I like Alabama. Wait so she lives here?

1065
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,653
Yeah. Oh, you don't even know, do you?

1066
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,522
Your dad and my Aunt Judy,

1067
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,941

of this little Bible movie

1070
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,871
we're supposed to be shooting.

1071
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,206
Uhhh... I dunno if I

1072
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,407
was supposed to tell you that,

1073
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,793
so let's keep that a secret, yeah?

1074
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,587
Well, I can keep a secret.

1075
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,050
Ohhh.

1076
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,089
Still chuckle about this, myself.

1077
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,300
"Eternal Spring!"

1078
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,801
New York agency says it makes it

1079
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:44,481
more appealing to the snooty
Yankees - - no offense.

1080
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,141
But between you and me,

1081
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,778
cow dung is cow dung. Hey albeit,

1082
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,980
New York ad agency,

1083
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,149
that's pretty big time, J.J..

1084
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,150
Yeah, well I'm just a...

1085
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,151
little old small time farmer

1086
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,904
and business man tryin' to

1087
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,330
expand the market.

1088
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,157
With four thousand acres of

1089
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:06,044
prime south Alabama farm land.

1090
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,839
I was calling it "Pure Manure".

1091
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,125
Lyrical, don't you think? Pure Manure.

1092
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,086
They said it wasn't sexy enough.

1093
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,253
Said I need to go right straight

1094
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,849
to the results, not talk about product.

1095
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,686
So there you
have it, "Eternal Spring."

1096
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,980
Very zen-like. I love it.

1097
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:25,847
I dunno. Sounds a bit

1098
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,725
pretentious for a bag of cow dung.

1099
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,685
J.J. and I were talking

1100
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,896
about some marketing
possibilities in your film

1101
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,656
with his... Product.

1102
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,819
Right. What I know about making movies

1103
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,571
wouldn't even fill a shot glass.

1104
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,033
But Judith here assures me that this...

1105
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,161
Product placement. Yeah that.

1106
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,004
That it would be good for

1107
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,122
our little enterprise.

1108
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,340
So with your permission,

1109
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:57,345
I wrote this to get the ball rolling.

1110
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,390
Welcome to the movie business!

1111
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,144
♪

1112
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,940
Outta bacon cheeseburgers, bro.

1113
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,109
I dunno how you can eat that mess anyway.

1114
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,194
So look, a Jew, a brother,

1115
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,853
and a Baptist preacher walk into a bar...

1116
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,657
Josh, need you back here, please.

1117
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,374
Be right there.

1118
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,617
Hold the punchline.

1119
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,211
We gotta get this thing going.

1120
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,835
There's my beautiful sister

1121
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,387
in Christ.
Hug of fellowship!

1122
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,972
Noah...

1123
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,726
Where's Josh?

1124
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,645
He's around back, I think.

1125
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,605
Oh, you know what?

1126
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,149
How 'bout I go get him for you.

1127
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,694
You stay right here, ok? Thanks.

1128
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,446
Be right back. I got him.

1129
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,818
Is he working for this? Can I have a word?

1130
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,205
Sorry. Hair looks great. Thanks.

1131
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,207
Hey so Josh is really nervous

1132
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,283
about this next scene

1133
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,243
and doesn't want any extra people

1134
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,870
that don't need to be here to be here,

1135
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,048
so can you head over to Emily and

1136
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,299
break it to her gently?

1137
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:20,178
She'll take it better from you. Sure!

1138
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,342
Hi, Em!

1139
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,802
Uhh... I'm
supposed to tell you that

1140
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,431
Josh like umm, doesn't want you here?

1141
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,235
He thinks you
should like... leave.

1142
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,195
Really?

1143
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,573
Sorry.

1144
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,567
Roll cam...

1145
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,027
And... SPEED!

1146
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,196
The Prodigal. Scene 40. Take 1.

1147
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,033
Action!

1148
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,026
And this wiseguy,

1149
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,077
he ends up sayin' right to the waiter,

1150
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,863
"Hey yo! This is not an

1151
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,031
eight-ounce New York Strip."

1152
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,166
So he sends it right back,

1153
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,617
sends it right back to the kitchen.

1154
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,212
My dad, he takes this strip,

1155
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,505
he puts it on a different plate,

1156
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,542
flips it over, trims it a bit,

1157
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,918
throws some go-juice on there

1158
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,420
and sends it right back out.

1159
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,215
Now this guy, he takes one look at it.

1160
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,142
You wanna know what he says?

1161
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,228
Shh. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

1162
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,522
"Now THAT'S a New York strip!"

1163
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,192
[laughter]

1164
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,561
Hey, yo
bartender. We need drinks

1165
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,398
all around, alright. And you know what?

1166
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,692
You put that baby on my tab!

1167
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:13,742
ADAM! ADAM! ADAM! ADAM!

1168
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,092
Whoo! Yeah baby!

1169
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,260
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1170
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,970
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1171
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,048
Everybody, YES! Thank you!

1172
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,350
Can we get a playback on that?

1173
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,970
Well, the board didn't want us

1174
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,306
to rent this place.

1175
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,683
And the women's missionary circle's

1176
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,435
all up in arms
because they thought we were

1177
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,271
usin' church money to buy beer.

1178
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:47,659
I told them it was just apple juice.

1179
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,829
Then they didn't like the girls' costumes.

1180
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,783
But it says in Luke 15:30,

1181
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,243
"he squandered his property

1182
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,203
with prostitutes!"
He says it right here

1183
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,288
so BOOM! There ya go,

1184
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,122
what're you gonna do about that?

1185
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,549
Amen? Amen.

1186
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:07,887
Well, what did you think, Brother Bob?

1187
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,340
Hey, Emily. It's Josh, again.

1188
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,601
Just gimme a shout.

1189
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,303
So J, I was thinkin' man,

1190
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,847
if we take scenes 14 and 22,

1191
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:22,227
and pick it up at... let's say 12, man,

1192
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,270
we should be able to

1193
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,229
zoom right through to the end of 13

1194
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,148
and at least get back a half a day.

1195
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,410
What do you think about that? Yeah...

1196
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,581
Hot set. Fly that out.

1197
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,712
Bob Cross.

1198
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,547
Humble servant of the Lord.

1199
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,917
Right. I'm from the Montgomery paper

1200
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,586
we talked on the phone. Oh, yes, yes.

1201
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,297
Praise the Lord, I'm so glad you're here.

1202
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,766
We're about to shoot a scene.

1203
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,093
Amazing work with the casting.

1204
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,137
They look so real, honestly.

1205
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,981
Just like real homeless people.

1206
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,484
What do you real
homeless people look like?

1207
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,735
Point taken.

1208
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,061
The fact is these

1209
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,322
are our friends.
We see them every week,

1210
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,690
on Saturday we feed them lunch

1211
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,525
in the park, and then on Wednesday

1212
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,027
they're here for clothes closet.

1213
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,119
Some of them

1214
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:13,987
actually heard about the movie,

1215
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,196
and bless their hearts,

1216
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,290
they're just here to help us out.

1217
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,140
Looks great.

1218
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,753
Ok everybody, places. Hey, Guy.

1219
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,342
It's been a long time. Geoffrey...

1220
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,096
Quiet.

1221
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,515
Roll cam.

1222
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,933
And speed.

1223
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,768
The Prodigal scene 58 take 1.

1224
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,436
Settling.

1225
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,439
Action.

1226
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,571
Back up. No. You're
in my spot, sweetheart.

1227
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,739
This is NOT your spot.

1228
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,741
You heard the lady, pal. BACK OF THE LINE!

1229
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,576
END OF THE LINE! Back out of this.

1230
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,036
Get your claws off me! Hey you know what?

1231
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,129
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

1232
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,955
You touch my hat again, You think you're

1233
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,049
somethin' special? I'm gonna...

1234
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,066
CUT!

1235
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,713
Wow. Intense. It's ok. It's in the script.

1236
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,473
Josh told him to do that.

1237
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,602
Josh? Your director? Tell me about him.

1238
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,845
Josh?

1239
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,430
Well, God really blessed our socks off

1240
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,525
by sending him our way.

1241
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,402
We prayed that God would pour his

1242
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,562
Spirit into this production and

1243
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,398
well, prepare the hearts of the sinners

1244
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,575
who might see this movie.

1245
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,118
Our prayer warriors are

1246
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,370
on their knees day and night,

1247
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,322
interceding for people to

1248
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,448
come to the saving knowledge

1249
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,542
of our Lord Jesus Christ

1250
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,868
so that they might

1251
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,963
give their hearts to Him.

1252
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,127
Man, you think he really

1253
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,721
believes that stuff?

1254
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,304
How's the money holdin' out

1255
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,565
on the movie, Guy?

1256
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,017
Well, was fixin' to run out.

1257
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,562
I don't know how he did it,

1258
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,905
but that boy somehow managed to

1259
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,858
squeeze this
outta ol' J.J. Barnes.

1260
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:19,037
Look at that. The manure tycoon? Yep.

1261
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,700
Huh. Cow manure in a Christian movie.

1262
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,827
Wouldn't be the first time...

1263
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,172
It'd be more accurate
if it was pig manure.

1264
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,048
Can you imagine what

1265
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,343
Brother Big Bob would say about all this?

1266
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,055
[Angelic swell]

1267
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,270
Well, there you are, Pastor!

1268
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,723
Mrs. Wiley called.

1269
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,932
She want's you to visit her

1270
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:51,569
sister at the hospital.

1271
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,272
Guy said to tell you she's one of our

1272
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,858
biggest tithers.

1273
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,119
She had her gall bladder out!

1274
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,281
And they took out both of her lungs.

1275
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,992
They ripped her
vertabrae off her backbone.

1276
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,202
And now she just sits there

1277
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,212
like a Jello salad.

1278
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,291
[Bell ring] For Pete's sake!

1279
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,218
Get a cell phone!

1280
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,719
Geoffrey! Oh. It's you. You seen Emily?

1281
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,055
Child, you are wastin' my time and hers.

1282
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,557
Whoa, easy. What's the deal?

1283
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,267
The deal? The deal is

1284
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,694
you kickin' her off your set.

1285
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,523
What? No, I would never do that.

1286
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,033
I'm confused. Child get in line.

1287
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:39,734
She's a 20-year old PK

1288
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,069
with ants in her pants

1289
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,912
like she wants to dance.

1290
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,247
PK?

1291
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:45,999
Lordy, where do you come from?

1292
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,876
A preacher's kid. A confused one.

1293
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,911
She thinks she's in love with this

1294
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,621
cute boy that just swooped into town

1295
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,039
like Harold Hill promising

1296
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,415
gold trombones, but only

1297
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,759
breakin' people's hearts.

1298
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:01,339
Harold Hill? Really? Google it.

1299
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,966
Josh I love that girl.

1300
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,968
And you need to make this right.

1301
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,095
Or else you're gonna have me to deal with.

1302
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:11,608
And I know you don't want that.

1303
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,694
[DOOR BELL] Excuse me.

1304
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,195
Here we are at the end

1305
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,071
of the second act and the

1306
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,614
prodigal son has wasted

1307
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,117
all his inheritence, he been beaten up,

1308
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,618
he's homeless, he's thinkin' about home,

1309
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,744
naturally, I would be too.

1310
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,163
But he also remembers

1311
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,583
what he did to his dad. He betrayed him.

1312
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,876
He abandoned him.

1313
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,461
Then again, he's very desperate.

1314
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:44,632
So, he decides to go home anyway

1315
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,518
and beg his dad to take him back in.

1316
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,100
And... That's a metaphor.

1317
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,603
For when you hit rock bottom

1318
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,062
and your world's just crumbling

1319
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:03,818
all around you. And, you start thinking,

1320
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,079
maybe you can see things differently

1321
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,581
than you've ever seen them before.

1322
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:12,919
What am I tryin' to say here?

1323
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,338
You know what? I...

1324
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,297
I'm starting to think that it's

1325
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,373
just as much about the father

1326
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,427
as it is about the son.

1327
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:26,265
The love of a father
is just total embrace.

1328
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,301
There's no boundries.

1329
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,636
And if you don't have a

1330
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:36,025
physical one then maybe a heavenly type.

1331
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,571
[Table Crash] [Goat BLEET] CHILD!

1332
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,032
All I wanted was two more sand tarts.

1333
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,493
Now look at this mess.

1334
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,746
Come on, Gracie. It's time for your nap.

01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,049
Geoffrey said he needed me on set, so...

1337
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,468
I'm glad you're here.

1338
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,212
Listen, this thing...

1339
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,006
there's been some kind
of misunderstanding.

1340
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,549
I don't know who or what or why.

1341
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,550
You're finishing up soon,

1342
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,095
you're heading out. I'll be leaving too.

1343
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,982
It's... It's fine.

1344
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,436
Let's hang out, ya know?

1345
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,521
After we wrap tonight?

1346

Hey, look at y'all two. Y'all are so cute.

1347
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,243
But we gotta go, come on man.

1348
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,153
We're losing light. Connie's?

1349

Bacon cheeseburgers? Let's roll.

1350
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,294
Hold that.

And speed. The prodigal scene 64 take 1.

1352
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,595

Look me in my eye.
And tell me I'm the man.

You're the man. Don't you forget it.

01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,766
We're on our way outta here.

something to tell you.

to wrapping though.

1370

Look, I know. I'm sorry.

two days to make the drive.

1375
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,100

Hey, Josh. How ya doin'? Good. Good. Good.

1379
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,312
Have you looked at the footage?

1380
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,823
Any good keepers? Yeah lotsa keepers

1381
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,033
and it gets even better as we go along.

1382
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,077
Great. Momentum. Love it.

1383
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,779
I just want to tell you,

you've done a great job.

1385

I'm very impressed by you.

1386
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:59,460
Your Aunt Judith'd be very proud. Thanks.

1387
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,663
That means a lot. Listen, Brother Bob,

1388
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,488
at some point I'd like to

1389
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,425
talk to you, some thing... There you are!

1390
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,804
The board wants to meet with you.

1391
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,351
Can't believe you're bailing on me, man.

1392
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,178
Blume, this is our shot.

1393
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,020
Dude, if we don't take advantage

1394
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,013
of an opportunity like this

1395
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,191
it may not come back
around. You know that.

1396
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,730
Look, man. Gimme a call and let me

1397
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,657
know what you decide, alright?

1399
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,875
Man, you think he really

1400
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,011
believes that stuff?

1401
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,223
Brother Bob, always sellin'.

1402
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,768
Not sure anybody's buyin'.

1403
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,104
Amen. Praise the Lord.

1404
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,557
Then he said, "We already bound Satan."

1405
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,559
"Praise the Lord." Maybe we can bind

1406
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,727
the accountant, too. But wait a minute,

1407
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,237
maybe they're all in the same.

1408
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,532
I think they've got the
general idea, Noah.

1409
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:17,914
Noah...

1410
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,366
I'm disappointed.

1411
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,376
I know. It's disappointing.

1412
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,704
There were certain other

1413
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,381
people you could have recorded.

1414
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,457
Seems like you and certain

1415
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:32,845
other people have been engaging with some

1416
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,881
folks that, uhh...

1417
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,090
...that have a background

1418
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,677
and a lifestyle contrary to what we...

1419
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,103
Look, Pastor.

1420
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,855
We've been here from the beginning.

1421

Paying our tithes,

1422
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,101
keeping this church goin'. Now these...

1423
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,812
these outsiders come
in and all of a sudden

1424
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,530
they're the center of your universe.

1425
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,273
Where were they when

1426
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,357
the roof needed repairing

1427
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,451
and the money was short?

1428
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,777
We had to make sacrifices

1429
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,996
just to keep our doors open.

1430
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,831
How 'bout the Muslim?

1431
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,410
Which Muslim? There's more than one?!

1432
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,328
