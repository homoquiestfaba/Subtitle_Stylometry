00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:47,534
looked like?

196
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,330
Did you know him, Chris?

197
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:53,471
He looked like my brother.

198
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,784
Brian?

199
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:59,097
Daniel.

200
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,720
Who's Daniel?

201
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,480
He's our other brother.

202
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,034
Where's Daniel now?

203
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,864
Hospital.

204
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,382
What hospital is that, Chris?

205
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,763
Crownsville.

206
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:12,214
You mean, the state hospital?

207
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,768
Why is he there, Chris?

208
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,046
He doesn't like my parents.

209
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,392
And why doesn't Daniel like

210
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:21,706
your parents?

211
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,467
They don't like him.

212
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,297
[door opening]

213
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,750
Brian?

214
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:31,820
Hi.

215
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,476
Hi, you okay?

216
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:34,788
Yeah, I'm all right.

217
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,169
Are they finished?

218
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,895
It's over.

219
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,551
I'm here to help you.

220
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:40,898
Is Chris all right?

221
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,832
He's fine.

222
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:47,214
Brian, there may be a problem.

223
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,630
Chris said that he saw Daniel

224
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:53,911
in the yard last night.

225
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:56,085
Daniel?

226
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,985
Chris didn't tell me that.

227
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,641
That's impossible, Daniel's in

228
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,334
Crownsville.

229
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,821
So, how long's he been here?

230
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,650
Came in about a month ago.

231
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:10,824
Pulled a knife on a social

232
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,584
worker.

233
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,207
By the way, he hasn't been told

234
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,587
about his parents yet.

235
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:16,519
Do you want me to say anything?

236
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,486
Don't tell him.

237
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,108
You sure he was here all night?

238
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,040
Well, security said they

239
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,801
checked him off.

240
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,356
Wait here, I'll get him for you.

241
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,946
Hey, Henry.

242
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,880
Security?

243
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:35,711
[walkman playing]

244
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,414
What do you want?

245
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,243
I want you to come out

246
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:51,175
in the hall.

247
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,867
Some men wanna talk to you.

248
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,985
Let me know when you finish.

249
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,331
Daniel, no smoking in the halls,

250
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:12,921
okay?

251
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:13,922
We're with Annapolis Police,

252
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:14,715
we'd like to ask a few

253
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,958
questions.

254
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:18,202
Where were you last night?

255
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,997
Gee, where was I?

256
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,032
Let's see, I went down to the

257
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,309
mall about 8:00, I had something

258
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,655
to eat, I saw a movie.

259
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,726
Did you leave the premises?

260
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,107
Is that what this place is,

261
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,419
the premises?

262
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:29,627
Does this look like a place you

263
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,215
can just walk out of?

264
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,665
Yeah, it does.

265
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,770
Is somebody trying to screw

266
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,427
me here?

267
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,704
If it says I checked Daniel

268
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:38,774
Hannigan off at 11:30,

269
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:39,568
I checked him off.

270
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:40,569
So, you saw him.

271
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:41,397
I checked him off.

272
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,295
That's not what I'm asking.

273
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:43,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,193
Come on, time out.

275
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,298
Bobby, you're making too big a

276
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:46,920
deal about this.

277
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,715
There's what, 150 patients here?

278
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:49,854
I mean, you can't expect him

279
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,235
to make sure every kid is tucked

280
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:52,822
in by 11:00, am I right?

281
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,272
Am I?

282
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,687
I mean, what are you gonna do?

283
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:56,654
Walk up to every bed with a

284
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,689
flashlight, look under the

285
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,690
covers?

286
00:14:58,725 --> 00:14:59,829
No, you poke your head in the

287
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,279
room and you eyeball it, right?

288
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,453
You guess.

289
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:03,523
Hey man, I didn't say that.

290
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:04,455
Don't get excited, nobody's

291
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:05,697
gonna get reported.

292
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,561
We just want the truth.

293
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:08,424
Now, did you see this kid at

294
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,117
11:30 or not?

295
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:15,742
No.

296
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,814
There you go, he guessed.

297
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,695
Norman!

298
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,524
Listen, nobody can confirm they

299
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,974
saw him past 10:00 last night

300
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:41,906
at Crownsville.

301
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,769
You know how lack security is

302
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:43,770
there.

303
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:44,702
This kid has a record.

304
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,530
His parents had to put him in

305
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:46,462
reform school last year,

306
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:47,222
that's a motive.

307
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:48,119
His own brother identified

308
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:48,982
him in the backyard.

309
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:50,156
His 7-year-old brother.

310
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,950
You want to make an arrest

311
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,330
because somebody's a bad kid?

312
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:54,160
Open this up, think further.

313
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,161
I mean, it's possible the

314
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:55,989
murders had nothing to do with

315
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,128
the family.

316
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,130
Hey, look, nobody wants to make

317
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,235
an arrest more than I do.

318
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,546
But, if we book a 17-year-old

319
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,754
kid for killing his parents, and

320
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:03,686
it turns out he's innocent--

321
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:04,653
We know, we know.

322
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:05,930
No, no, no, you don't know.

323
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,932
You do it by the numbers,

324
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,245
and you get me the evidence,

325
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,248
and you do it now.

326
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,977
Daniel?

327
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,428
Daniel, something has happened

328
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:22,395
to your family that you should

329
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:24,845
know about.

330
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,400
Come on, sit down.

331
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,370
I, um, I don't know how to

332
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,752
say this, other than to just

333
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,443
say it.

334
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,031
This morning, your parents were

335
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,172
found murdered in their home.

336
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,214
They think I did it.

337
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:50,319
[knocking]

338
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:53,495
They want to look around.

339
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,194
Will you turn your soles up,

340
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,817
please?

341
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,964
This your only pair of shoes?

342
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:20,039
Would you take them off, please?

343
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,988
Thanks.

344
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,824
I'll, uh, get you another pair

346
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,447
of shoes.

347
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:53,658
They were very family

348
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:54,970
oriented.

349
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:57,628
Hard working people.

350
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,112
Maureen was a high school

351
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:01,735
teacher, her husband Joe was

352
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,530
an engineer, a layman in our

353
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,842
church who taught Sunday School

354
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,603
to the kids here.

355
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:09,709
They were very giving people.

356
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:10,503
This has been a special

357
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:11,262
report...

358
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,091
They just interviewed Father

359
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,368
Greg on TV.

360
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,507
Is Brian okay?

361
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,715
He's fine.

362
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,717
He's staying with Barbara.

363
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:18,856
Well, what did he say when

364
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,995
you talked to him?

365
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:21,307
Ken Pierson, please.

366
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,756
Rick, can you talk about it

367
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,345
in here?

368
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,312
Just asking.

369
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,347
I know you were, I just--

370
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:29,418
Uh, hi, this is Tom Kelley.

371
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:30,799
Would you ask Ken to call me as

372
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,800
soon as he can, please?

373
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:32,835
Thank you.

374
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,043
I was on the phone.

375
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,700
[door slams]

376
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,908
[sighing]

377
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:40,671
He's upset about this, too.

378
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:41,534
Are you sure you want to get

379
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,156
involved with this?

380
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,710
I don't have a choice.

381
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,990
I called a criminal attorney,

382
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,407
Ken Pierson.

383
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,309
Daniel's a suspect, isn't he,

384
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,966

00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:27,238
I don't understand that.

1149
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:30,345
But, uh, I have to look forward,

1150
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:32,968
I don't look back.

1151
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:36,696
That's how I've dealt with it.

1152
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,701
All the gatherings, the church

1153
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,047
groups that we were in with your

1154
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,636
mom and dad,

1155
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,155
we never knew what was happening

1156
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,158
to Daniel.

1157
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:53,954
No one knew.

1158
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:57,337
[overlapping chatter]

1159
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:04,827
Hey!

1160
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:05,621
Watch it, watch it!

1161
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:06,484
Good one, good one, good one.

1162
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:07,554
Here we go.

1163
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:09,315
Set it up, set it up, set it up.

1164
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,938
Get it up!

1165
00:54:11,972 --> 00:54:12,801
Gotta get more on the ball,

1166
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:15,424
more on the ball.

1167
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:16,805
Here, okay, here we go,

1168
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,772
8-7, serve it up, Tom.

1169
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,326
Big point, big point.

1170
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,499
You ladies watching?

1171
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:22,742
Go team!

1172
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:23,674
Hey, you ready?

1173
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:24,571
Got your head in the game,

1174
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:25,434
are you ready?

1175
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:26,815
Yeah, I'm ready.

1176
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,955
Here we go, 8-7.

1177
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,577
Call it!

1178
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:31,371
Set it up, set it up,

1179
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:32,303
set it up.

1180
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:34,201
That's it.

1181
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:36,894
Good, good.

1182
00:54:36,928 --> 00:54:39,655
You got it?

1183
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,314
Good, good, good.

1184
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,488
Atta boy.

1185
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:45,868
Nice!

1186
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:46,869
Good one, good one, good one.

1187
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:47,698
Set it up, set it up.

1188
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:49,976
Watch it.

1189
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,080
Daniel, you okay?

1190
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:52,081
Is he all right?

1191
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:53,013
Daniel?

1192
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,083
Yeah, he's fine, he's fine.

1193
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:55,015
I told you, son, you gotta watch

1194
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,880
yourself.

1195
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:04,162
Where you going?

1196
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:05,094
Daniel, it was an accident.

1197
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:06,337
Daniel, wait up.

1198
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:07,511
No, no, if he doesn't want to

1199
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:08,684
play, don't make him.

1200
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,513
Come on, Brian.

1201
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:12,343
Brian, let him go!

1202
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:13,310
Come on, let's get somebody else

1203
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:14,449
in here, let's go!

1204
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:15,657
Come on, guys, let's play.

1205
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:16,865
Hey, do you wanna play?

1206
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:18,901
Yeah.

1207
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,628
That's all he does, man,

1208
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:25,114
is just get on me.

1209
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:26,357
I know you don't wanna be here,

1210
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:27,324
man, let's just go.

1211
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,118
We can come back later.

1212
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:30,810
I can't, what do I say?

1213
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,294
Just tell him you wanna come

1214
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,226
with me, you found something

1215
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,574
better to do.

1216
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,232
Come on.

1217
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:41,614
I can't.

1218
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:52,487
[women laughing]

1219
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:53,902
Where did you come up with

1220
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:54,661
that?

1221
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:55,421
Hi, handsome.

1222
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:56,387
Hi, can I sit here?

1223
00:55:56,422 --> 00:55:57,250
Of course you can.

1224
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:58,113
Don't want to eat at the kid's

1225
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,010
table, huh?

1226
00:55:59,045 --> 00:56:00,218
Put your shirt on, honey,

1227
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:01,150
it's cold.

1228
00:56:01,185 --> 00:56:02,013
Besides, all the girls are

1229
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:02,773
watching.

1230
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:04,533
Mom.

1231
00:56:04,568 --> 00:56:06,915
Daniel left, of course.

1232
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:09,331
Yeah, he's gone.

1233
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,332
Oh, God, sometimes I think

1234
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,609
it's hopeless.

1235
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:13,093
I don't understand how somebody

1236
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:14,405
can be so angry and bitter

1237
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,406
about everything.

1238
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:16,442
It's hormonal.

1239
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,236
All 15-year-olds are angry about

1240
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:19,583
something, present company

1241
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:20,377
excluded.

1242
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,481
No, no, I've been a teacher

1243
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:23,034
too long.

1244
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:24,001
First day of class, I can

1245
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:24,933
pick 'em out.

1246
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,175
I know who the good kids are,

1247
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,832
I know who the bad kids are.

1248
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,006
And you know what?

1249
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,490
I'm always right.

1250
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,148
Well, it's an awkward age.

1251
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:34,183
You don't know how many times

1252
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:35,046
I've been at the principal's

1253
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:36,427
office this year.

1254
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:37,670
He's violent, he fights, he

1255
00:56:37,704 --> 00:56:39,810
cheats, you can't trust him.

1256
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:40,983
Maureen.

1257
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:41,915
Hey Brian, honey, why don't

1258
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,054
you go sit with the kids?

1259
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:43,883
Oh, no, no.

1260
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:46,126
No, he's heard all this before.

1261
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:47,127
[sighing]

1262
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:50,199
Daniel even threatened us once.

1263
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:52,132
He told me he could kill us.

1264
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,271
Brian, did you hear him say

1265
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:55,239
that?

1266
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:57,793
Well, that's an awful thing

1267
00:56:57,828 --> 00:56:58,794
to say, I'm sure he didn't

1268
00:56:58,829 --> 00:56:59,623
mean it.

1269
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:01,314
Oh, no, no, he meant it.

1270
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:02,764
He got so mad at Joe, one night

1271
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,213
he came up to me after dinner,

1272
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:05,905
and he said, "I could kill him,

1273
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:07,044
you know?"

1274
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:08,183
Just like that.

1275
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,218
Why would he say something

1276
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:10,357
like that?

1277
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:12,394
Because he's an angry person.

1278
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,360
Maureen, maybe you're coming

1279
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:15,017
down too hard on him.

1280
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:16,122
Oh, please don't tell me how

1281
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:17,779
to raise my kids, Barbara.

1282
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:18,883
Scott has one parent, it's

1283
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:19,712
different.

1284
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:21,507
Why is it different?

1285
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:22,715
Why does the blame always

1286
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:24,337
come back on us?

1287
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:26,615
Maureen, I'm not blaming you.

1288
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,099
You just can't expect everything

1289
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:29,825
to be perfect.

1290
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,102
I just think kids need some

1291
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,828
room, you know?

1292
00:57:32,863 --> 00:57:34,347
Some space.

1293
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:36,901
Oh yeah, space, freedom.

1294
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:38,040
Let's just throw out all the

1295
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,525
rules, let them be themselves.

1296
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:40,457
That's the answer to everything

1297
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:41,665
these days.

1298
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:42,735
Oh, Barbara.

1299
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:44,530
Oh, I love you, I really do.

1300
00:57:44,564 --> 00:57:46,359
But, you can be so naive

1301
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,465
sometimes.

1302
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:51,053
You have no idea.

1303
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:54,125
No idea.

1304
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,437
You can't just walk off like

1305
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,853
that.

1306
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

1307
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:06,137
I'm not gonna let this ruin my

1308
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:08,830
day, I'm not.

1309
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:09,762
Your father will deal with this

1310
00:58:09,796 --> 00:58:11,557
later.

1311
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:14,560
And he did.

1312
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:16,838
His way.

1313
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:17,804
We can go, man.

1314
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,530
We could take a bus to Florida,

1315
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:23,223
or get an apartment, or...

1316
00:58:23,258 --> 00:58:26,330
We don't need them.

1317
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:32,888
I hate them.

1318
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:46,730
What's wrong with me?

1319
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,114
[sighing]

1320
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,844
You want anything while I'm out?

1321
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:00,778
No, thanks.

1322
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:03,263
[dog barking]

1323
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:09,373
Like always, Daniel was asking

1324
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:12,238
to get caught.

1325
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:25,596
Where were you, Daniel?

1326
00:59:25,631 --> 00:59:27,909
Out-- just let me in, Mom.

1327
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,776
Come on, let me in!

1328
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,261
Please?

1329
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,889
Don't open the door.

1330
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:45,927
Go back to bed.

1331
01:00:04,566 --> 01:00:05,532
[crying] We failed.

1332
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,294

who might be homesick, to get a

1521
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:53,871
homecooked meal.

1522
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:54,976
Uniforms, the pomp, the

1523
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,634
ceremony, I love all that.

1524
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,360
You know, I think we're missing

1525
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:01,707
that today in our country,

1526
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,640
that sense of tradition.

1527
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,781
Without it, we're-- we're lost.

1528
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:07,920
Joe wanted to go to the

1529
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:08,748
academy.

1530
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:09,508
Oh!

1531
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,372
Finish the story, Maureen.

1532
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,511
Well, the opportunities

1533
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:13,374
weren't there for--

1534
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:14,685
I was never really

1535
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,549
encouraged.

1536
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:17,412
What about you, Brian?

1537
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:18,241
What are your plans after high

1538
01:07:18,275 --> 01:07:19,035
school?

1539
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:20,036
Well, his grades are so bad,

1540
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:20,864
he'll be lucky to get out of

1541
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:22,072
high school.

1542
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:22,900
See, Brian, this is what I've

1543
01:07:22,935 --> 01:07:23,660
been talking about.

1544
01:07:23,694 --> 01:07:26,352
This is the payoff right here.

1545
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:27,353
I never knew how to get that

1546
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:30,253
point across to you and Daniel.

1547
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:31,806
Chris?

1548
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,291
You still have a chance.

1549
01:07:34,326 --> 01:07:35,120
Daniel?

1550
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:37,363
Um...

1551
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:42,161
Daniel is my brother.

1552
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:45,026
Oh, where's he?

1553
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,787
He's in reform school.

1554
01:07:52,654 --> 01:07:55,795
Dessert?

1555
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,176
Daniel and I found a way to

1556
01:07:57,211 --> 01:07:58,557
talk to each other.

1557
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,903
I had to be careful not to let

1558
01:07:59,937 --> 01:08:01,525
Mom or Dad know.

1559
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,458
What's reform school like?

1560
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:06,979
Hm, it's great, man.

1561
01:08:07,013 --> 01:08:08,429
I mean, they got rules and

1562
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:09,499
everything, but...

1563
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:10,396
Lights out, guys.

1564
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:11,639
I can do whatever I want,

1565
01:08:11,673 --> 01:08:12,950
whenever I want.

1566
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:14,124
Nobody's telling me what to do

1567
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:16,644
anymore.

1568
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:17,610
So, what do-- what do they say

1569
01:08:17,645 --> 01:08:19,198
about me?

1570
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:21,511
Who?

1571
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:22,822
Mom and Dad.

1572
01:08:22,857 --> 01:08:25,929
Do they talk about me?

1573
01:08:25,963 --> 01:08:28,311
Yeah, sometimes.

1574
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:32,453
You know what, man?

1575
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:33,730
I don't even care if they do,

1576
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:35,076
or if they don't.

1577
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,457
Doesn't matter.

1578
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,114
Wrap it up, Hannigan.

1579
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,011
I'm happier now than I ever

1580
01:08:39,045 --> 01:08:41,358
was.

1581
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:42,773
You know, I get out for the

1582
01:08:42,808 --> 01:08:43,636
weekend.

1583
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:44,844
A lot of guys are going home,

1584
01:08:44,879 --> 01:08:46,398
and I don't even know if I want

1585
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:48,331
to go home.

1586
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:49,470
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't

1587
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:50,988
even care.

1588
01:08:51,023 --> 01:08:52,058
Why don't you call Mom and

1589
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:52,921
Dad?

1590
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:53,922
Why should I have to call

1591
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:55,717
them, why don't they call me?

1592
01:08:55,752 --> 01:08:57,167
It's my home, do I have to be

1593
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:59,721
invited?

1594
01:08:59,756 --> 01:09:02,724
I wanna see you.

1595
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:05,002
Come on, Hannigan, let's go.

1596
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:06,211
Well, then, you gotta talk to

1597
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:08,799
Mom and Dad.

1598
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:12,078
'Cause I can't.

1599
01:09:22,468 --> 01:09:23,952
Mom and Dad agreed to a visit

1600
01:09:23,987 --> 01:09:25,333
from Daniel.

1601
01:09:25,368 --> 01:09:27,784
They wanted a picnic.

1602
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:30,442
Hey.

1603
01:09:30,476 --> 01:09:31,201
Hey.

1604
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:32,029
How you doing?

1605
01:09:32,064 --> 01:09:33,134
I really thought they might ask

1606
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,204
him to come home again.

1607
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,032
This is Chris.

1608
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:36,965
Hey, how you doing?

1609
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,863
Good.

1610
01:09:37,897 --> 01:09:40,072
My new brother.

1611
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:40,831
Hey, Scott.

1612
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:43,006
Hey, man.

1613
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,972
I'm thinking about going to

1614
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:46,216
college and getting my degree.

1615
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:48,977
Maybe computers.

1616
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:51,290
I haven't really decided yet.

1617
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:53,879
That's great, Daniel.

1618
01:09:53,913 --> 01:09:55,156
Once I learn how to use one,

1619
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,433
maybe I can teach Brian.

1620
01:09:56,468 --> 01:09:57,917
We can start our own company

1621
01:09:57,952 --> 01:09:58,987
or something.

1622
01:09:59,022 --> 01:10:01,369
Or something.

1623
01:10:03,682 --> 01:10:04,683
Where you gonna get the money

1624
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:07,617
for these computers?

1625
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:10,136
Well, if you want something

1626
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:12,691
bad enough, you'll get it.

1627
01:10:12,725 --> 01:10:14,175
I'm gonna clear the table.

1628
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,314
You have dessert, Mom?

1629
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:17,730
Of course.

1630
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:18,835
Let me help with the dishes.

1631
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:19,767
Oh no, that's all right.

1632
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:20,595
Stay there.

1633
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,390
I want to help.

1634
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:25,255
It's fine, Daniel.

1635
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,084
We can handle it.

1636
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:27,844
Why?

1637
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:28,914
Let him help.

1638
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:31,813
Daniel, stay.

1639
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:32,711
What is this?

1640
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:33,643
I just want to go in the house

1641
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:35,886
to help--

1642
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:38,303
What, you don't want me in the

1643
01:10:38,337 --> 01:10:40,891
house?

1644
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,275
Is that it?

1645
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,863
I do live here, right?

1646
01:10:46,897 --> 01:10:49,659
This is my house, isn't it?

1647
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:51,488
Isn't it?

1648
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:52,489
That's why we're sitting in the

1649
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:54,733
rain.

1650
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:57,667
How could you do this?

1651
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:05,985
It's not fair, man,

1652
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,263
they can't do this to you,

1653
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:10,404
it's not fair!

1654
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:13,441
I wanna kill 'em.

1655
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:19,275
[crying]

1656
01:11:21,173 --> 01:11:23,555
Chris, honey?

1657
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:27,938
Sweetheart.

1658
01:11:27,973 --> 01:11:32,011
Don't worry, honey, I'm here.

1659
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:34,773
Don't worry, sweetie.

1660
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,330
[phone ringing]

1661
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:41,331
Hello?

1662
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:42,953
Hi, Tom, it's Barbara.

1663
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:44,403
Um, listen, is Brian

1664
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:45,335
in the room?

1665
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,406
No, he's still asleep.

1666
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:48,752
I think we need to bring

1667
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:52,308
Chris back to the police.

1668
01:11:57,623 --> 01:11:59,004
Hi, Mrs. Forester, I was just

1669
01:11:59,038 --> 01:12:00,488
calling to check in on Chris.

1670
01:12:00,523 --> 01:12:01,800
Uh, are you taking him to mass

1671
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:05,148
this morning?

1672
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:08,324
He went where?

1673
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:11,499
What are you thinking about,

1674
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:13,639
Chris?

1675
01:12:13,674 --> 01:12:16,332
Well, just about that night

1676
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,678
and my brother.

1677
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:18,679
Now, which brother are we

1678
01:12:18,713 --> 01:12:21,406
talking about?

1679
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,546
Brian.

1680
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,478
What do you wanna tell us

1681
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:25,755
about Brian?

1682
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:28,378
Well, after I saw my dad,

1683
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:30,829
when I went to Brian's room,

1684
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:32,658
he was throwing up.

1685
01:12:32,693 --> 01:12:35,247
I forgot to tell you that.

1686
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:36,455
And what did Brian say to you

1687
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,388
when you say him throwing up?

1688
01:12:38,423 --> 01:12:41,874
He told me to go back to bed.

1689
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:43,462
You told us that you saw

1690
01:12:43,497 --> 01:12:45,361
Daniel in the backyard that

1691
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,327
night.

1692
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,675
Chris, think real hard.

1693
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,676
Do you think it might have been

1694
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:54,093
Brian?

1695
01:12:54,128 --> 01:12:56,475
Maybe.

1696
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,545
But you told us, though, that

1697
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,719
Brian was in his bedroom,

1698
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:00,168
remember?

1699
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:01,377
But, Brian couldn't be in two

1700
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,930
places at the same time now,

1701
01:13:02,964 --> 01:13:05,381
could he?

1702
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:07,106
After you saw Brian in the

1703
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:10,834
backyard, do you think that,

1704
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:11,939
well, he might have had enough

1705
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:13,319
time to come back inside the

1706
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,702
