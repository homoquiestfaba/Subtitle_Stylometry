1
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,497
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,112
Who are you?

3
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,260
Who the fuck are you?

4
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,398
Hello?

5
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,310
Hey, big boy. Woz?

6
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,439
Woz?

7
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,676
- He's in the john.
- What?

8
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,517
Brockman?
Brockman, is that-

9
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,079
Why aren't you answerin' the cell?
Everything cool out there?

10
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,058
Yeah, it's, uh-

11
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,220
It's broken.
Uh, we're fine.

12
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,163
What?
I can't hear you.

13
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,496
- I said we're fine.
- Good.

14
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,503
<i>Snakeskin wants to know</i>
<i>if he left his piece out there.</i>

15
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,131
- A Glock?
- Where?

16
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,607
I don't know.
In the desk.

17
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,610
Just a second.

18
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,996
- Yeah, it's here.
- Would you speak up? I can't hear you.

19
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,005
I said it's here.

20
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,940
Yeah, I knew it.
I told the fucking guy it was out there.

21
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,034
I don't know what
his problem is.

22
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,102
How's Coles?

23
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,572
He's fine.

24
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,141
So, how long
before you get back?

25
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,153
Aren't you a little antsy?

26
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:46,282
Who knows? Maybe- I don't know.
Maybe a couple hours.

27
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,486
We'll call you when it goes down.
And, Brockman...

28
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,258
don't go finishing things up there
till we're all done on our end.

29
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,299
- Yep.
- All right. I'm out of here.

30
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,927
The cops are all over us.

31
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,810
<i>What's she doing?</i>

32
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,279
<i>Molina, we've got a problem.</i>

33
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,248
- Ms. Coles.
- I know.

34
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,348
- You're only supposed to come
in here if something went wrong.
- I couldn't. I just-

35
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,359
- <i>Molina.</i>
- She's fine, Captain.

36
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,554
You've got to get her in there.
Understand?

37
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,232
Full signal.

38
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,827
- <i>Curtis, you got a clean signal?</i>
- It's all good on this end.

39
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,465
Okay, Ms. Coles.
It's time.

40
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,568
Number 52.

41
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,546
All you gotta do is put it in and walk away.
That's all.

42
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,641
They kidnapped my husband
from his own building.

43
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,016
I just can't imagine what
else they're capable of...

44
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,889
what else
they might do when-

45
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,020
Ms. Coles, if they come within five feet of you,
we'll be all over 'em.

46
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,591
It's not taking this money to them that scares me.
It's what happens once I let go.

47
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,536
What happens to Bill then?

48
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,832
We won't let them get away.

49
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,936
Just bring my husband back,
Detective.

50
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,506
He's all I have.

51
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,123
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

52
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,431
- What?
- Talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me right now. Hey.

53
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,768
- Tell me what happened.
- I don't know what happened.

54
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,773
- Tell me what happened right now!
- I don't remember.

55
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,071
- Tell me what you know!
- Did you do this to me?

56
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,807
- Tell me what happened right now, goddamn it!
- Don't hit me anymore!

57
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,619
What's the last thing
you remember?

58
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,218
I don't know. Me waking up.
You smacking me around.

59
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,286
Please untie me.

60
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,328
W-Where are we?
What is this place?

61
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,304
- The desert.
- Desert?

62
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,606
That much I do know.

63
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,584
- Are they dead?
- No.

64
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:07,683
Well, it's gonna get real ugly when
these guys wake up. You better untie me.

65
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,490
<i>I wouldn't do that if I were you.</i>

66
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,796
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

67
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,464
Don't listen to him. Hey, butt out!
Mind your own business!

68
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,100
<i>Me and my friend, we got this</i>
<i>straightened out. We don't need your help.</i>

69
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>Really.</i>
<i>Don't untie him, man.</i>

70
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:33,779
<i>And why not?</i>
<i>What the hell do you know?</i>

71
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,788
He's tied up and we're not.
Right?

72
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,950
<i>That's brilliant. This guy</i>
<i>doesn't know anything either.</i>

73
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,689
<i>Just think about it for a second, would you?</i>
<i>Somebody did this.</i>

74
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,325
You know? And it makes sense
that they did it for a reason, right?

75
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,563
Yeah.
And what reason is that?

76
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:56,370
It's obvious, isn't it? Whatever side we're on,
it sure as hell ain't his.

77
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,569
What side?
What are you talking about?

78
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,807
We're not on sides.
This isn't teams.

79
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,476
<i>We're all in this together!</i>
<i>Period!</i>

80
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,850
Okay. You got me.

81
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,412
So, how the hell
did we get here?

82
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,916
I don't know.

83
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,823
- Yeah.
- McGahey, Anderson,
stand by. She's coming out.

84
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,222
<i>Everyone, hold position.</i>
<i>Curtis, tell me when that thing moves.</i>

85
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,431
Oh, shit. What the hell
happened to him?

86
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,037
He's been shot. He's lost
a hell of a lot of blood too. Take these.

87
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,139
Go up top and see
if you can unlock him.

88
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,242
No. These are too big.
These are car keys.

89
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,311
- Shit.
- You're gonna let him go and not me?

90
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,481
Hey, the man's been shot,
so shut up.

91
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,958
So maybe I'm a doctor.
I'm hurtin' too.

92
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,825
- Is there a bathroom here?
- It's right down that way.

93
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:45,575
- What's your name?
- I don't- I don't know.

94
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,279
You don't remember anything?

95
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,187
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

96
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,259
I'm gonna die.

97
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>What the hell is goin' on here?</i>

98
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,949
<i>Is he okay?</i>

99
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,225
I can't help him unless I find a key.
I'm gonna check this guy.

100
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,736
- Get away! Get away!
- Hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

101
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,901
Okay! Okay!

102
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,708
What did you have to go
and do that for?

103
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:57,381
- You attacked me. I was just tryin' to help.
- Help, huh?

104
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,256
- Who asked you?
- Not you, asshole. Him.

105
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,852
Thought you might have
the keys to the cuffs.

106
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,733
<i>Listen. Listen.</i>
<i>Whoa. Hold- Hold on.</i>

107
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,069
It's important you tell us
what you know.

108
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,439
- I don't have to tell you shit.
- You remember anything?

109
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,968
<i>Do you remember- Do you know</i>
<i>who the fuck you are? Say something!</i>

110
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,277
- Of course I do.
- What do you remember then?

111
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,285
This guy did this to us!
That's what I remember! He did this!

112
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,218
Hey, hey. I didn't
do anything to anybody.

113
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,518
You broke my fucking nose
is what you did.

114
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,581
Oh, you remember that?
You actually remember that?

115
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,060
- Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Now get off my case.
- Okay, what's your name then?

116
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,395
My name? Fuck your mother.
That's my name.

117
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,402
Go wash up.
You don't remember jack shit.

118
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,802
You'll remember my boot up
your ass in about 10 seconds.

119
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:51,434
What the hell is this place, huh?
Where the hell are we?

120
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,446
Maybe you fucking asses
will remember to pick me up!

121
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,541
Guys! Hey!
Hey!

122
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:28,675
Whoa. This canister's busted open.
I think it fell from up there.

123
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,307
You think that's what caused
us all to be like this?

124
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,408
Maybe.

125
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,915
Hey, stop gettin' high
on that shit and untie me!

126
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,258
We all inhaled way more than that
little sniff you just got. Let me ask you this.

127
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,456
<i>Why would you put up bars</i>
<i>on all these windows...</i>

128
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,330
have a high-tech door lock
in this shit hole of a place?

129
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,064
Somebody's obviously gone to
a lot of expense to secure this.

130
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,837
Something either very dangerous
or very valuable in here.

131
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,478
There, with the trash can.
Is he one of yours?

132
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,383
- I'm not sure.
We contract out most maintenance.
- Find out.

133
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,385
What the-
Come on, honey. Come on.

134
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,691
It's gone, Captain. The signal's gone.

135
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,958
<i>What do you mean gone?</i>
<i>He hasn't done anything.</i>

136
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,059
Anderson, what's going on out there?
Break silence. Talk to me.

137
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,331
Nothin' here, Captain.

138
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,741
- McGahey, can you tell?
- Nothin', Captain.

139
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,178
All right. It's a go.
Stop him.

140
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,650
- Anything?
- Nothin'.

141
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,094
- Keys.
- <i>Captain, what's goin' on?</i>

142
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:56,100
He's one of ours.
His name's Frank Gilroy. He's not all there.

143
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,728
<i>Anderson, ease up. He works here.</i>

144
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,501
- Affirmative.
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Shit!

145
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,907
Captain, it's a false bottom.
Must open up to the basement.

146
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,709
- Basement?
- We're on it. Go, go, go!

147
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,909
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

148
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,283
Why were you standing
in front of this locker?

149
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:25,129
Big man told me, Frank,
I could get $20.

150
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,135
Captain,
we've located the bag.

151
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,603
Check that corridor.
Check that one.

152
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,474
Captain, the bag's empty.

153
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,479
Check that fucking corridor!
Secure that stairwell!

154
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,613
You try all the windows?

155
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,622
They're all barred.

156
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,624
- All of them?
- Yep.

157
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,683
That's the only door.

158
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,336
Sorry.

159
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,395
Okay.

160
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,007
- Sorry.
- <i>Okay.</i>

161
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,663
Fuck!

162
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,540
Son of a bitch. Ow.

163
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,279
Big disappointment, huh?

164
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,028
Piss off.

165
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,587
Does the name Coles
mean anything to you?

166
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,795
- Nope.
- How about Woz?

167
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,501
Look, nothin' means anything
to me right now, all right?

168
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,171
I remember
bein' in that room.

169
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,950
Then I remember just walkin' in here.
Other than that...

170
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,717
it's like I landed
in a fuckin' Alzheimer's ward.

171
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,727
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

172
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,763
It's all of us.

173
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,821
That's too bad.

174
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,809
Wash your hands.
Oh.

175
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,055
Won't open. I already checked it.

176
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,395
All right. So, let's go over this again.
You woke up-

177
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:51,300
<i>I saw you guys. There was blood on the shovel.</i>
<i>There was blood everywhere.</i>

178
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,339
<i>A broken cellphone. I just freaked out</i>
<i>and headed for the door.</i>

179
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,273
- You didn't move anything.
You didn't see nothing else?
- No.

180
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,071
Anything suspicious or odd?

181
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,580
I saw two chairs back to back
in the storeroom with rope around it.

182
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,638
<i>Well, that's interesting.</i>

183
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:09,676
Well, obviously, whatever went down here
didn't go down as planned, right?

184
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,986
- Trapped like fuckin' rats.
- <i>So that's it? That's everything?</i>

185
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,322
Yep. Pretty much.

186
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,124
Hey. Ask him
about the phone call.

187
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,187
What?

188
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,962
Ask him...
about the phone call.

189
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,832
<i>What? What phone call?</i>

190
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,338
- There's a phone in here?
- Um, listen-

191
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,376
<i>When you guys were</i>
<i>still passed out...</i>

192
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,004
- he went to answer the phone.
- Where's the phone?

193
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,379
- Listen, I was gonna tell you-
- Just-Just tell me who was on the phone.

194
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,384
I don't know.
Some guy.

195
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,387
- That's funny that you forgot
to mention that little tidbit.
- Some guy. Who? What?

196
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,446
I- I don't know.
He just started talking.

197
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,186
- <i>So he recognized your voice then?</i>
- <i>No. I don't think so.</i>

198
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,559
I mean, it was noisy on his end.
It was construction or something.

199
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,655
Whose side are you on
anyway, man?

200
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,632
Wait a minute.
You think I'm with them?

201
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,134
He talked to you.
He recognized your voice, right?

202
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,330
- Let's tie this motherfucker up.
- Yeah.

203
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,498
Wait a minute.
I picked up the phone.

204
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,203
<i>The caller asked if I was so-and-so.</i>
<i>I said, "No, so-and-so's in the john."</i>

205
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,375
<i>Then he asked if I was someone else. I didn't</i>
<i>know what to say, so I just changed the subject.</i>

206
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,816
- Bullshit!
- What was I supposed to say?

207
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,377
"Hey, buddy, I can't remember jack shit.
Could you please tell me what's goin' on?

208
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,324
<i>We've all beaten the hell out of each other</i>
<i>here and fried our brains in the process."</i>

209
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,520
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Think about it.

210
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,587
He talked to you.
He recognized your voice, man.

211
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,862
He didn't know who I was.
He asked if I was two different people.

212
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,393
He didn't know.
I'm not on the caller's side.

213
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,497
Well, somebody in here's
gotta be.

214
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,941
I'm not on anybody's side.

215
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,945
- <i>Captain, it's back.</i>
- What?

216
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,414
The tracking signal- it's back.
It's headed due east from our location.

217
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,418
What's the signal strength
on that thing?

218
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,286
- It'll hold for about two miles.
- All right. Start putting a tail on it.

219
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,255
Captain,
I saw one of the guys.

220
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,421
- Who?
- One of the pickup guys walked right past me.

221
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,762
- Can you I.D. him?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

222
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,324
<i>Curtis, hold on.</i>
<i>Anderson's coming with you.</i>

223
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,231
They're headed
toward the interstate.

224
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,868
- I got a good look at one of 'em.
- Did you?

225
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,105
Promise me next time
you'll do more than just look.

226
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,396
Come on.
Let's make the call.

227
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,401
No, no. We all agreed. He gets back here.
We all make the call together.

228
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,629
Hey, let's go!

229
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,698
<i>Hey!</i>

230
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,545
Look.
I found the fucking keys.

231
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,585
Yeah, you got keys
and no car.

232
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,646
You got a holster and no gun and you got
a cellphone in a million pieces downstairs.

233
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,089
- It's making perfect sense, isn't it?
- What can I say?

234
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,286
Just relax, all right?

235
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,129
- <i>They're coming to kill us.</i>
- You don't know that.

236
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,326
What do you think they're diggin' out there,
huh? They're puttin' a pool in?

237
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,529
- What do you think you're doin'?
- Orderin' a pizza.

238
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,299
- Give me the phone!
- No!

239
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,897
What's the matter, pal?
Huh?

240
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,966
You feelin'
a little guilty?

241
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,013
Huh?

242
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,140
You wanna make a phone call?
Go ahead. Dial 911.

243
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,650
- Go ahead. Yeah, you're innocent.
- Yeah.

244
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,984
- 'Cause you know how you
broke your nose, right? Sure.
- I know what I know, okay?

245
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,856
What the hell are you doing?

246
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,193
Are you insane?
That was our ticket out of here!

247
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,132
Yeah, it's our ticket,
all right.

248
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,670
Oh, shit.
A cop. It's a cop.

249
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,675
No. Security guard.

250
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,041
What have you fuckers
got me into?

251
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,013
You barely looked at him.
How do you know he's security?

252
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,245
It's right here.
"L.P.W." Liberty Plaza West.

253
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,809
- Wait a second. Why does that sound so familiar?
- Oh, shit.

254
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,821
- What?
- Shit.

255
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,421
<i>"Police are investigating the disappearance</i>
<i>of William Coles Jr...</i>

256
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:13,658
<i>"of Coles Consolidated Equities, and the</i>
<i>company's financial adviser, Richard McCain.</i>

257
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,927
<i>"While both men's cars were found</i>

Police suspect the men
have been abducted."

261
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,036
Not seen since Sunday morning,
and this is the Tuesday morning paper.

262
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,777
- Right.
- So we've been here at least two days.

263
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,254
Coles and McCain.

264
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,223
- That could be any one of us, right?
- What else? Keep readin' it.

265
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,591
<i>"Witnesses report hearing gunshots</i>
<i>in the area around midnight Sunday."</i>

266
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,394
- Anything else?
- He's got a wife. That's about it.

267
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,060
Oh. How are we gonna
figure this out?

268
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,934
I got you pegged as Richard.
You seem like a Dick to me.

269
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,135
That must make you the kidnapper,
'cause a tycoon could afford a pair of nuts.

270
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,076
- Yeah?
- What?

271
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,638
- Two names, right? Two guys.
- Two.

272
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,877
Well, obviously, something
went haywire down here.

273
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,920
Okay, there was a struggle.
McCain and Coles got loose from the back.

274
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,286
Okay?
Makes sense, right?

275
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,417
So either they were recaptured,
which makes the three of us kidnappers-

276
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,894
- Or one of us is Coles and one is McCain.
- Exactly.

277
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:24,094
- And the other guy?
- <i>Doesn't matter. We gotta work</i>
<i>together till we get out.</i>

278
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,330
- He's right.
- And then we go our separate ways.

279
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,339
- <i>They're probably comin' back now.</i>
<i>You thought of that?</i>
- Stop jumpin' to conclusions.

280
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,568
They get their money.
They come back. We're fine.

281
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,407
You're assuming they're gonna get money!
You're assuming somebody's gonna pay!

282
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,743
Maybe nobody's gonna pay!
Fuck me, we're dead!

283
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,046
- What is wrong with you? Huh?
- You're wrong.

284
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,143
They got blood
on their hands.

285
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,782
Whoever Coles is, whoever McCain is,
they're dead men unless we get out of here.

286
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,813
God!

287
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:14,818
The bars are the way to go.
They're all rusted out.

288
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,657
You're just gonna keep breakin' them.
You're never gonna get through that.

289
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,525
All of a sudden you remember
you're an architect, huh?

290
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,497
- Just-
- Hey, hey!

291
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,033
Go ahead.

292
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,626
<i>Girls, stop fighting.</i>
<i>Could we get some water here?</i>

293
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,729
Shut up!

294
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,634
Come on.
A man's been shot!

295
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,647
<i>If you want, you can untie me.</i>
<i>I'll do it myself.</i>

296
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,174
Deaf or stupid?

297
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,243
Eat me, hemlock.

298
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,054
All right.
Let's give it a go.

299
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,393
We're gonna use the shovel
and just-

300
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,400
We're gonna pry it.
Get some leverage on it.

301
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,616
No matter who anybody is here
or how tough you think you are...

302
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,847
you'll always be the pussy that's tied up
to an office chair.

303
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,754
All right?

304
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,010
What are you lookin' at?

305
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,987
Now, just because we're tied up
doesn't mean we're friends.

306
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,004
What?

307
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,469
What?

308
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,954
- Why didn't you say so?
- Yeah.

309
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,100
Whoo!

310
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,935
- Ha ha!
- <i>What do you see?</i>

311
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,943
<i>There's nothin'.</i>

312
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,343
Help!

313
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,650
Hey, let's take it
easy with that!

314
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,718
- Okay! Okay!
- <i>Take it easy!</i>

315
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,459
<i>Hey, I thought it was gonna help.</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna do nothin'!</i>

316
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,862
Guess that settles it.

317
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,702
<i>I wasn't gonna do nothin'.</i>

318
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,799
I wasn't gonna do anything
with that. I just thought-

319
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,810
- Sure.
- Hey, what are you doing?

320
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,210
That's more like it, chief.
Now you're talkin'.

321
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,475
<i>Christ, you're lettin' him go?</i>

322
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,642
What-
What are you doin'?

323
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,347
Fuckin' asshole.

324
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,549
One less thing
to worry about.

325
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,322
Shh!

326
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,362
What the hell is that?

327
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,329
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

328
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,897
<i>Let him answer it.</i>
<i>Let him answer it.</i>

329
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,944
- <i>Let him do it.</i>
- Are you crazy?

330
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,447
If that's them, they bought his voice once.
They'll do it again. Let him answer.

331
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,213
- Yeah?
- <i>Uh, it's me.</i>

332
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,453
It's done. See you before sundown.

333
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,254
They're coming.

334
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,664
<i>Sundown.</i>

335
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,948
Oh, shit.

336
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,315
Half an hour.
We barely made a dent.

337
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,786
<i>Oh, that's the spirit there,</i>
<i>cheese. Get me another blade.</i>

338
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,382
He's right. We're not gettin'
anywhere with this.

339
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:52,088
Well, I don't know. We got, uh-
We got two hours, right?

340
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,257
We're gonna have to decide
how far we're prepared to take this.

341
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,460
What do you mean?

342
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,596
I mean, when they show up,
are we all prepared to do whatever it takes?

343
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,480
Give me another blade.

344
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,540
That was the last one.

345
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,150
<i>What do you want me to tell her?</i>

346
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,589
I don't know.

347
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,890
Just take her down to the station
and keep her calm.

348
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,663
Shit, look at this.

349
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,831
This is the same chemical name
on that busted canister out there.

350
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,070
- Oh, yeah?
- Listen to this.

351
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,807
"Warning. Effects of inhalation
or exposure include...

352
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,406
"shortness of breath, nausea,
unconsciousness...

353
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,476
"temporary memory loss,
seizure and/or death.

354
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,649
"Avoid breathing.
Contact a physician. Infectious agent.

355
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,658
Dire if exposed
in large doses."

356
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,320
I mean, shit, how long have we
been breathin' this stuff in?

357
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,886
<i>Don't fucking move, McCain!</i>
<i>I got a gun to your head!</i>

358
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,028
McCain.

359
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,035
You know, I been thinkin'
about this whole thing.

360
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,073
You wakin' up
before everybody else.

361
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,234
<i>The phone call.</i>

362
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,710
It's all pretty convenient.

363
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,240
You got somethin' to say,
go ahead and say it.

364
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,650
Maybe you are just waitin'
for them to show up, huh?

365
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,156
What about you? Aren't you the one that
ripped the phone jack out of the wall?

366
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,490
Yeah, but I didn't lie about it
and try to cover it up, did I?

367
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,923
Okay. Now, would you
come on over and help me?

368
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,612
Shh! Listen. Listen.
My memory's coming back.

369
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,809
I remember parts from before.
I know who we are.

370
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,875
Oh, yeah.
Why should I believe you?

371
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,389
Because, Bill, you're the other hostage.
You're William Coles.

372
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,450
Oh, really? Miracle cure you're havin'
all of a sudden, huh?

373
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,759
They kidnapped us from work.
Okay? We were finalizing a deal.

374
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,357
We were in a parking structure.
Do you remember any of that?

375
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,062
- No.
- They took us on a Sunday. It was late afternoon.

376
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:57,039
We were running some numbers.
That son of a bitch saw us go in. He saw us go in.

377
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,042
<i>Hey!</i>

378
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,445
I know you have no reason to believe me,
but he's setting us up.

379
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,145
- Geez.
- So we gotta get that gun
before that son of a bitch...

380
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,415
remembers who he is,
otherwise we're screwed.

381
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,822
I don't remember shit, okay?
I don't remember.

382
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:19,022
Okay. For Christ's sake, you
don't remember your own kids?

383
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,587
Our kids play Little League together
for Christ's sake, Bill.

384
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,100
<i>You don't remember</i>
<i>your own children?</i>

385
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,201
Bill.

386
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,639
What? What's wrong?

387
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,615
We need to talk.

388
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,110
What's goin' on?

389
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,194
Kill him!

390
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,899
<i>Get that son of a bitch!</i>

391
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,032
<i>Get him, get him, get him, get him.!</i>
<i>Get him.!</i>

392
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,307
<i>Get the gun!</i>
<i>Get the gun!</i>

393
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,144
<i>Get the gun!</i>

394
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,610
Fuck.

395
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,554
What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

396
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,147
He said I was Coles.
He said I was Coles, man.

397
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,625
What?
And you believed him?

398
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,425
He said his memory came back.
He knows who we are.

399
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,334
<i>He's a lying sack of shit!</i>

400
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,131
He remembered my kids.
My kids, man.

401
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,900
He's lying!

402
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,998
I couldn't risk it.
I couldn't risk it!

403
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,440
Is that true?
What do you remember?

404
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,109
What do you remember,
asshole?

405
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,618
He's gonna kill us, Bill.

406
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,585
<i>Fuck- Fuck you.</i>

407
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,287
- Fuck me? No. Fuck you!
- Don't!

408
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,993
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Tell me who to shoot!

409
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,001
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you doin', man?</i>

410
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,264
I lied.

411
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,171
- What do you remember?
- I made the whole thing up.

412
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,505
- That's enough!
- I'm just tryin' to get out of here, man.

413
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,601
<i>Just leave him alone.</i>
<i>Just leave him alone, man.</i>

414
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,340
I don't know what I'm doin' here.
I don't know what I'm doin' here.

415
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,383
You're only sayin' that
so I don't kill you.

416
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,418
You're gonna
kill me anyway.

417
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,419
What do you remember?

418
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,323
You're the one.
You're the one.

419
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,291
I'm not a criminal.

420
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,626
Stop acting like one then.

421
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,633
We're in the middle of nowhere.

422
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,974
- What? Speak!
- I think they just pulled off.

423
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,842
Don't think. Read the damn thing.
You got a bead or not?

424
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,711
Yes. Right here. Go.

425
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,522
<i>This guy did this to us!</i>

426
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,503
<i>Whose side</i>
<i>are you on anyway, man?</i>

427
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,054
<i>How are we gonna get up there?</i>

428
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,701
<i>Go to the ledge!</i>
<i>Go to the ledge quick! We're losing you!</i>

429
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,863
- I got it! I got it!
- You on the ledge?

430
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,649
- Easy!
- Oh, shit!

431
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,686
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

432
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,721
Sorry.

433
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,920
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!

434
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,694
- Fuck.
- More security glass?

435
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,462
Hey, wait a second.

436
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,735
- I may be able to shoot a hole in it.
- No way, pal.

437
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,741
The gun stays with me.

438
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,334
Don't be a prick. I'm tryin'
to get us out of here.

439
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,642
I could shoot it
at close range, right here.

440
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,649
You come down.
I'll climb up there and shoot a hole in it myself.

441
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,981
You're too big,
you fat fuck!

442
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,022
The rope may not hold you.
Suit yourself.

443
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,192
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

444
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,823
Now here's where
your good look pays off.

445
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,336
That's him.
That's him inside the store.

446
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,929
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

447
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,100
You see which car is his?

448
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,981
<i>I can't tell.</i>

449
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,847
Oh, no. No, no.
Come- Come on.

450
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,250
Shit.

451
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,154
<i>Fuck! He's gone.</i>
<i>Which one?</i>

452
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,953
- I don't know.
- Come on! Come on! Which one?

453
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,017
I don't know! They're all
leaving at the same time!

454
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,121
<i>Well, choose one.</i>
<i>The Denali or the pickup?</i>

455
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,189
Right there.
The pickup.

456
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,667
Go, go, go!

457
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,835
Come on!

458
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,987
- How do we know you're not
just gonna leave us here?
- I guess you don't.

459
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,158
Cut the shit!
Cut the shit!

460
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,198
That's really funny.

461
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,598
- Oops.
- Asshole.

462
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,018
Oh, I hope you're dead,
you clumsy fuck!

463
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,759
<i>Hey. Hey. Hey, man,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

464
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,803
Lucky to be alive.

465
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,805
Of all the
stupid things.

466
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,774
Hey. Hey.
Hey, can you hear us?

467
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,776
- Are you all right?
- Erin?

468
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,813
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>
<i>you were too heavy, huh?</i>

469
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,315
Fuck off.

470
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,147
- My shoulder.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit. Whoa, whoa. Just wait.

471
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,746
Ah, man,
your back is bad.

472
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,553
You do understand
that was our only weapon.

473
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,117
Back off!
It was an accident, all right?

474
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,392
- What's the matter with you?
- You trust this guy? Huh?

475
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,730
Oh. I see
what's going on here.

476
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,670
I-What, you two are gonna
start workin' together now?

477
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,673
What the hell difference
does it make?

478
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,869
Is that gonna get us
out of here any faster, huh?

479
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,640
- I don't think so.
- What are you doing?

480
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,774
Don't!
Don't untie him!

481
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,182
- You stay outta this.
- We had an agreement!

482
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,880
Yeah. I'm hedging
my bets.

483
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,923
Thanks.

484
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,254
You idiot.

485
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,260
It's you and me now.

486
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,694
<i>What's the matter with you? Fuck.</i>

487
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,631
<i>You better stay in the garbage,</i>
<i>'cause I ain't through with you.</i>

488
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,603
All right. This is gonna sting a bit.

489
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,701
- Son of a bitch!
- So who's Erin?

490
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,008
Your wife?

491
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,641
Or my daughter.
I can't remember which.

492
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,911
At least you got somebody
outside of this place.

493
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,354
You'll remember her soon enough. Soon as
we get out of here, it'll all come back to you.

494
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:09,388
How can you be so sure we're gonna like
what we have when we get out of this place?

495
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,560
I mean, what could have brought us all here
that's worth remembering anyway?

496
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,036
Nothin'. That's exactly it.
Nothin' we can remember here...

497
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,471
is gonna have anything to do with
who we really are.

498
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,704
The choices we make from here on
out of this shit hole-

499
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,712
that's what's gonna
define us.

500
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,146
- You really believe that?
- Yeah, man. I do.

501
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,856
Shit.

502
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:38,156
I didn't want to say anything around those
two other jokers, but... I know who we are.

503
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:41,220
- You remember something?
- Yeah.

504
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,266
About you and me?

505
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,359
Yeah. This smell.
This smell for the longest time...

506
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,904
out there
and then in here.

507
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,270
See?

508
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,038
- I remember. I have orange trees.
- You have orange trees.

509
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:58,081
- Yeah, on my ranch. It's been
in my family for generations.
- Shit.

510
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,740
- I'm Coles.
- You're Coles then.

511
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,375
I'm William Coles.
I really am.

512
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,248
- He was right.
- I think he was guessing.

513
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,788
I don't have kids.
At least I don't think I do.

514
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,017
Wait a minute.
Why are you telling me this?

515
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,083
- Don't you see? You're McCain.
- Me, McCain? No!

516
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,425
- Yes.
- You actually remember this?

517
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,761
I-

518
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,358
Our original terms that we proposed
to you are more than fair.

519
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,233
You want this bid,
you get back to me within an hour.

520
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,802
No. No, but you
have to be McCain.

521
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,367
- You have to be McCain.
- What makes you so sure?

522
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,107
For whatever reason, you're the only one
I feel like I can trust...

523
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,446
and if I can remember that,
they're not far behind, so we gotta get out now.

524
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,078
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not, okay? You're McCain.

525
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,282
- It's the only thing that makes sense.
- Fuck. I'm not McCain.

526
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,384
- What?
- I remember too.

527
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,395
What?

528
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,397
How could you do that?

529
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,300
Humiliate me like a dog!

530
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,770
Like a stinking fucking dog!

531
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,172
- You tried to humiliate me!
You see this? You see?
- Get the hell off!

532
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,973
- They were turning blue!
- Get off me!

533
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,173
- What's the matter with you?
- How could you fucking do that?

534
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,183
You would have done
the same thing.

535
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,879
<i>You were the one</i>
<i>with the gun!</i>

536
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,291
Hey.

537
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,418
There's someone outside.

538
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,460
<i>Where is he?</i>

539
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,498
Right over there.
See him? Behind the gate.

540
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,194
Is it them?

541
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,499
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>
<i>It's gotta be too soon.</i>

542
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,699
- Hey!
- <i>Hey!</i>

543
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:34,801
<i>Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Over here!</i>

544
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,507
Hey! Hey!

545
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,516
- <i>Over here!</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

546
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,575
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

547
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,180
Back off.
Let me try.

548
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,386
Can you see anything?

549
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,225
Um, uh, move it around. Move it around.

550
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,234
- <i>Whoa, whoa. What's that?</i>
- Holy shit. It's a kid.

551
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,167
<i>Kid! Hey!</i>

552
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,137
- <i>Hey!</i>
- He doesn't understand.

553
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,140
<i>He doesn't know what you're saying.</i>
<i>He doesn't speak English.</i>

554
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:13,844
What the hell?

555
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,379
<i>Ramon. Vamos.</i>

556
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,324
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

557
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,260
<i>Go get your parents!</i>

558
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,696
Wait, wait, wait, look!
He's going back! He's going back!

559
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,256
- <i>You sure?</i>
- <i>Yeah. He's good. He's going to them.</i>

560
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,833
<i>Yeah, he's getting in. Look at him.!</i>

561
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,841
<i>They're coming! Whoo-hoo!</i>

562
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,877
You did it!

563
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:45,904
<i>Whoo! Over here!</i>
<i>Look over here!</i>

564
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,510
<i>No. No!</i>

565
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:54,523
No! Help!
Hey! No. Shit!

566
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,650
- <i>No!</i>
- Fuck it.

567
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,723
Shit.

568
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,686
Hey, can I get some help up here?

569
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,125
Here.

570
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,275
Thanks.

571
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,210
You know
I'm not gonna be able to get those off.

572
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,540
Thanks anyway.

573
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,418
You think
I'm afraid of dying?

574
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,454
I'm not afraid of dying.

575
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,934
I didn't tell you
to give up.

576
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,936
What's the E.T.A.
on our backup?

577
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,978
At least
20 minutes away.

578
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:35,246
I'm over this.
Let's crash.

579
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,454
Police! Nobody move.

580
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,353
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- What's this?

581
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:43,187
- <i>I got nothing over here. You?</i>
- <i>Clear!</i>

582
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,854
- Got people back here?
- No?

583
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,692
- You see him?
- <i>No.</i>

584
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,867
<i>Where is he?</i>
<i>I said where is he?</i>

585
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,006
<i>Who owns the pickup?</i>

586
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:01,237
You think if you keep talking
they'll eventually understand?

587
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,558
- The yellow pickup!
- The yellow one is mine.

588
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,628
What about it?

589
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,236
How stupid do those guys
think we are?

590
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,472
Might have been
born at night but not last night.

591
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,272
Hey, step on the gas.

592
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,477
Let's pick up Leon and Ray
and finish this up.

593
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,648
First the locker,
now this.

594
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,929
- Hey.
- Fuckin' tracker.

595
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,827
<i>We gotta get that gun.</i>

596
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,960
- We already tried.
- Not together, we haven't.

597
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,504
<i>Well, let's get the rope.</i>
<i>I'll do it.</i>

598
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,803
You guys had your chance to fuck this up.
Let me. Maybe I can get it.

599
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,809
They're gonna be here
any minute, all right?

600
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,438
So does it matter what we do?
We can draw straws, whatever.

601
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,779
I'm sick of waiting for these bastards.
I swear, I want 'em to come back.

602
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,446
And what are you gonna do?
Whine until they surrender?

603
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:21,217
- Why don't you two shut up?
- <i>Fuck you.</i>

604
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,193
- You're the moron that left the gun up there.
- Hey.

605
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,220
I remember.

606
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,904
I remember.

607
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,963
<i>I was seven</i>
<i>and you were nine.</i>

608
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:43,411
<i>We- We wanted to go out</i>
<i>on the lake one day with some friends.</i>

609
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,414
You remember?

610
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,349
You know me?

611
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,717
My dad told us
not to go...

612
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,984
because of the storm.

613
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,992
<i>We said fuck him.</i>

614
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,654
<i>What did he know?</i>

615
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:04,063
<i>We went out in the old man's</i>
<i>MacGregor 26...</i>

616
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,297
<i>and we got in some</i>
<i>argument about...</i>

617
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,362
who was the only pitcher
to win M.V.P.

618
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,409
Sandy Kaufax.

619
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,106
<i>And we argued so much</i>
<i>about it...</i>

620
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:23,517
that we didn't realize
we couldn't see land anymore.

621
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:27,522
<i>I was really fuckin'</i>
<i>scared.</i>

622
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,888
<i>And I could see that</i>
<i>you were- were too...</i>

623
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:36,398
even- even though you kept
talking like it would be okay.

624
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:43,362
<i>And then this big wave came</i>
<i>and-and turned us over.</i>

625
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,536
I- I remember goin' down...

626
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,669
and being disoriented.

627
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:56,714
<i>Thinking if I couldn't find which way was up,</i>
<i>I was gonna die for sure.</i>

628
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,913
And then this hand-

629
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,725
This hand reached down...

630
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,989
and grabbed me...

631
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,088
<i>and pulled me up.</i>

632
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,827
<i>You must have seen</i>
<i>how terrified I was.</i>

633
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,465
You looked me
in the eye...

634
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,668
and you told me
not to give up.

635
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,077
<i>No one was gonna die.</i>

636
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,672
<i>We all-all had to</i>
<i>stick together...</i>

637
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,810
<i>and keep each other</i>
<i>holding onto the boat.</i>

638
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,224
That's what we did...

639
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,329
for four hours.

640
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,331
We held on...

641
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,458
<i>just like you said.</i>

642
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:59,544
Hey, that's really touching and all.

643
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,948
Completely useless though.

644
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,987
Enough with the boats, kid.
Who are you?

645
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,045
Just listen
to what he's saying.

646
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,216
He's right.
We gotta work together.

647
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,385
<i>No, listen to what</i>
<i>I'm saying.</i>

648
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:15,329
If he knows who he is,
then maybe he can tell us who we are.

649
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,299
It doesn't matter
who we are!

650
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,996
'Cause they're gonna
be back here any minute.

651
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,006
- All right, we got one shot at this!
- Hey, tell us who you are.

652
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:28,373
Who are you, kid?
Tell us. Tell us, kid. Kid!

653
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,184
Sorry.

654
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,801
I don't know who the hell
you are.

655
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,140
I don't care.

656
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,181
Maybe you are a kidnapper.
I don't know.

657
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,116
But you know what
I think?

658
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,914
Maybe somewhere along the line
you just forgot who you were...

659
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,251
before you become one.

660
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:17,692
But regardless,
we can't do this without you.

661
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,188
The plates aren't visible
in any of these shots.

662
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,527
- Wait a minute.
- <i>What?</i>

663
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,574
Right here. In the reflection of
the gas station window.

664
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,202
- That's their front plates.
- You upload that to Molina. Get a cleaner shot.

665
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,610
Let me know. Let me know when it's coming.

666
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,648
It's coming. It's coming.

667
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,651
Wait. Let's just tip it.
We tip it-Just pull down. Yeah.

668
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,710
- There it is.
- Oh! Whoo!

669
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,956
- Where'd she go?
- She said she needed some air.

670
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,029
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

671
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,632
Yeah. I can't drink
any more either.

672
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,643
May I?

673
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,687
Bill's father
was completely self-made.

674
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:33,031
But before he had anything,
he built this place up at Eagle Ridge.

675
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,833
<i>Beautiful place.</i>
<i>Right there in the foothills.</i>

676
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,467
Burnt down
a few years ago.

677
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,836
Bill decided to...

678
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,712
rebuild it by hand
just like his father.

679
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:57,653
He's one of the wealthiest men in the state,
barely has time to breathe, but...

680
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,457
he had to do it, you know?

681
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,623
Show himself he could.

682
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,398
Must be nice
for the two of you to have.

683
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,940
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>a place to get away to.</i>

684
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,306
You should see
the sunsets there.

685
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,454
Only next time,
we let it go from up there.

686
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,619
- Be sure you keep this door
open when the shit goes down.
- I'm on it.

687
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,629
- You know how to use that thing, right?
- Yeah.

688
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,631
Great vantage point
from up there.

689
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:41,159
You get out to that truck quick and get it
started so we can get the hell outta here.

690
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,590
What's that?

691
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,751
It's Erin.

692
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,155
She's my daughter.

693
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,294
Beautiful.

694
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,470
So there you go.

695
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,112
Now you got something
to fight for.

696
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,804
Shit! Here they are!

697
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,361
Merry Christmas.

698
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,489
Dig a hole big enough
for three people.

699
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,031
Soon as they come in,
let it go.

700
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:02,168
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

701
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:06,181
Captain, we got a partial on the plate
that Anderson sent.

702
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,342
Put it on the wire.

703
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:12,148
They can't be more than 40 miles
from that gas station.

704
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,946
Hey, Ray. Call Ritter and make sure
he's putting the plane down on time.

705
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,451
- Ray?
- I know. I know. Back to the scanner.

706
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,553
Hey!

707
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,928
Get the lights.

708
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,974
- Woz!
- <i>Brockman.</i>

709
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,605
- Go!
- <i>Hey!</i>

710
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,876
- Now!
- <i>Come on. I got some burgers for you guys.</i>

711
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,113
<i>Shit. Where the fuck</i>
<i>are you, assholes?</i>

712
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,349
Quit jerking each other off
and let's go!

713
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,157
Watch out!

714
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,160
Leon! Leon, it's me!

715
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,899
What the fuck?

716
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,642
You okay?

717
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,922
Nobody move!
Everybody down!

718
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,789
Coles, you move,
you're dead.

719
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:06,029
- Hit me.
- Get him down! Woz, get him down!

720
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,334
Goddamn mess.
What the fuck happened here?

721
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:23,616
You look like shit, Woz.

722
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,519
We got no prints on the 20
we got from the custodian...

723
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,960
<i>and nothing yet on the A.P.B.</i>
<i>we have on the vehicle.</i>

724
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,989
<i>I been working with this plate from Molina.</i>
<i>I run it through the D.M.V., but it comes up dry.</i>

725
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:41,628
<i>I ran a state-wide search</i>
<i>on all open investigations, and I got a hit.</i>

726
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:45,401
<i>It seems the narcotics task force down</i>
<i>in San Diego's got an open investigation.</i>

727
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:48,671
<i>These kidnappers- they're meth dealers.</i>
<i>They've got a rap sheet a mile long...</i>

728
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,679
<i>and they're suspected links</i>
<i>to murders on both sides of the border.</i>

729
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,305
This Stefan Burian
is the ringleader.

730
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:57,751
- Get everything San Diego has on these guys.
- I've already got a call in.

731
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,191
So that's it?
That's all you've got to say?

732
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,195
- It happened so fast.
- <i>You know, you been workin' for me...</i>

733
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:10,061
for a couple months now,
handling deals, collections...

734
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,794
all kinda tough shit.

735
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,098
Babysitting two suits
in there...

736
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,231
- is what's too much for you to handle.
- No, I- I-

737
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,571
I fucked up.

738
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,009
You better pull your shit
together, man.

739
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,104
This is far from over.

740
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,418
What did you do that for?

741
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,266
What-

742
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,697
Hey! Hey! Hey!

743
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:56,467
Where you gonna run to, Coles?
Come here!

744
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,937
Oh, shit.

745
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:16,315
Better take him
and the rest of ours out back.

746
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,933
<i>Takes talent</i>
<i>to fuck it up so badly.</i>

747
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,494
Go and clean the shit up.
Then we're heading out of here.

748
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:40,979
We kill them before
we're free and clear...

749
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,746
the mess gets
even bigger, right?

750
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,449
You don't have to
kill them.

751
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,620
I'm not.

752
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,687
Good.

753
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,129
You are.

754
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:18,175
- <i>Here, Dad.</i>
- It's from both of us.

755
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,849
- That's Erin.
- <i>Has she ever had</i>
<i>a reaction to insulin before?</i>

756
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,893
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- <i>Is her mother there?</i>
<i>Anybody that can say-</i>

757
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,691
- I'm divorced. I have no idea.
- She's not breathing. We gotta get her inside.

758
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,756
God, baby.

759
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,728
<i>That fuckin'</i>
<i>lighter, Woz.</i>

760
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,534
They've been gone
for five years.

761
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,598
You either
get over it...

762
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,940
or pick up smokin'
again.

763
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,886
Go and finish them off.

764
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,357
Take the fuckin'
rent-a-cop with you too.

765
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,623
Your cut will be here
when you're done.

766
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,687
- Hi.
- Have a seat.

767
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,534
There's been
a development.

768
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,798
Do any of those men
look familiar to you? Their names?

769
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:50,675
<i>You ever recall</i>
<i>seeing any of them...</i>

770
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,476
- <i>with Mr. Coles?</i>
- No. Who are they?

771
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,878
These are the men
who have your husband.

772
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:07,323
Excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant James
of Narcotics Task Force San Diego's on line one.

773
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,297
Now who the hell is this?

774
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,644
Did you get the keys
to that truck?

775
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,649
We can't go for the truck.

776
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,618
- I don't have the keys.
- Doesn't matter. We still got a shot.

777
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,918
If we get up over the ridge,
should be able to find the interstate.

778
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:38,050
You may be right.
How many rounds you got left in the gun?

779
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,095
Just keep moving
this way.

780
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,627
You guys can powwow all night.
I'm gonna get outta here.

781
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,169
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Whoa!

782
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:52,401
Aw, shit. What's the matter with you?
Put it down.

783
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:57,673
- Oh, fuck me.
- They want me to finish this.
Then I get outta here.

784
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,408
- What?
- You see what's happening here?

785
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,646
You fucking-You fuck.
So you are one of these pieces of shit, huh?

786
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,587
- I tried to tell you!
- For once in your life, shut up, all right?

787
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,784
- If I don't kill you, they're gonna kill me.
- Listen, you're not doing this.

788
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,454
- It's not that simple.
- What do you mean, it's not that
simple? Of course it's that-

789
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,055
Was it that simple when you ripped
that phone jack out?

790
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:20,795
Guy was bleeding to death in the other room.
You're saying you were only doing it for him?

791
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,962
What's the matter with you, man?
We didn't do this!

792
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:24,972
You're only worried
about yourself...

793
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,008
and the murder rap
over this dead guard...

794
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,876
so don't start talkin' about simple, 'cause this
whole thing couldn't be further from it.

795
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,914
We should be runnin' now!
Get out of this shit hole!

796
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,415
- You don't get it, do you? This is it.
- No, no, no.

797
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,884
- This is who I am.
- Bullshit. Put it down.

798
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:41,445
- You turn around right now.
- No, man. You want to kill me, do it to my face.

799
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,424
- Do it.
- No, you do it. Show me who you are, huh?

800
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,324
<i>Do it!</i>

801
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,387
Is this how you want Erin
to remember you?

802
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,660
<i>I'll give you anything</i>
<i>you want. Anything you want.</i>

803
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,328
Just fucking don't do it.
Don't fucking do it!

804
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:59,102
- My wife and my daughter are gone.
Both fucking gone.
- Don't fucking do this.

805
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,165
- I just want this to end.
- No!

806
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,940
<i>This is Detective James Curtis.</i>

807
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:10,815
<i>Detective Curtis,</i>
<i>I've got Captain Parker on the line for you.</i>

808
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,582
Curtis, a local worker and his son
reported suspicious activity...

809
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:18,683
at a chemical warehouse off Blythe Road,
15 miles west of that gas station.

810
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,695
Are you sure
they check out, Captain?

811
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,594
Listen. There's an undercover
officer on the scene.

812
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:26,100
<i>We don't know if his cover's</i>
<i>been blown, if he's alive or if he's dead.</i>

813
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:30,366
<i>Affirmative. We'll be there in five minutes.</i>
<i>Tactical's 20 minutes out.</i>

814
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,203
- 10-4.
- You ready for this?

815
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,436
Yeah.

816
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,541
- <i>Hey.</i>
- What?

817
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,709
We got a problem.

818
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,123
Stay with the car.
Keep it running.

819
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,954
Hey, you.

820
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,329
Am I lookin'
at a cop?

821
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,603
Cop?

822
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,144
- <i>You worked so hard to make detective.</i>
- <i>Here, Dad. See?</i>

823
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,819
Hey. So you like
this place?

824
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:28,090
<i>Yeah. Keeps the money clean.</i>
<i>Hey, you ready?</i>

825
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,666
<i>I'd tell you not to do</i>
<i>something to make me look bad...</i>

826
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,328
but then I know you'd just
do something to piss me off.

827
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,896
- Well, if I didn't need
the money so bad, I just might.
- Hey, money's good.

828
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:43,035
It's good to have you back, you know?

829
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,579
It's like old times.

830
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:48,377
<i>Where'd your friends go?</i>

831
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:53,451
You double-crossing
son of a bitch!

832
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:02,019
Turn him around! Move!

833
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,918
Look.
There it is.

834
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,299
- Come on!
- You wait for backup.

835
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,033
Where you going?

836
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,003
Ain't over yet.

837
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,597
Oh, what the f-

838
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,357
You saved my life.

839
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,767
You okay?

840
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,472
Yeah.

841
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:41,283
- How's the arm?
- It's all right.

842
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,792
This guy's been undercover
for the last eight months.

843
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,727
<i>His fucking command staff in San Diego</i>
<i>hasn't talked to him in three weeks.</i>

844
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,787
I don't know
if I could do that.

845
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,799
It's gotta be instinct.

846
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,392
What, police work?

847
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,733
No. Surviving.

848
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,770
You guys should
consider yourselves very lucky.

849
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,778
A few more minutes
of exposure to those chemicals...

850
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:08,373
and you would have gone
into full arrest, never woken up.

851
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,079
My memory-
will it ever come back?

852
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:16,750
The human body can endure
significant trauma, Detective.

853
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:20,158
For better or for worse,
it'll all come back sooner or later.

854
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,219
<i>Okay.</i>

855
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:28,194
Captain.

856
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,751
<i>You don't have to do this if you don't want to.</i>

857
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:50,281
I just don't know of any other way that we can
be together. What's stopping us, Detective?

858
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:54,624
<i>Celebration in advance.</i>
<i>'Cause I have a plan.</i>

859
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:59,156
A plan that could see us all retired
within the next two weeks.

860
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:04,266
- Hey, you tell him yet?
- Tell me what?

861
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:08,298
<i>This is a mark worth millions.</i>
<i>No security on corporate insurance.</i>

862
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,868
That'll cover getting him back fast,
no matter what the price.

863
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,950
<i>With the prenup we have,</i>
<i>there's just no other way.</i>

864
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,714
I want them all dead
and the trail leading to McCain.

865
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,188
- If something goes wrong-
- It won't.

866
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,549
But if it does?

867
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,696
Then we'll just do
what we have to do.

868
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,430
- <i>Hey. You okay?</i>
- Yeah.

869
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,875
I'm fine.

870
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,528
Captain.

871
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:07,199
I think you're
lookin' for this.

872
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,878
<i>There's someone I want you to meet.</i>

873
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,224
Can I trouble you
for a cigarette?

874
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,529
I don't smoke.

875
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,814
Wouldn't be lying
to me, now, would you?

876
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,755
And if I were?
