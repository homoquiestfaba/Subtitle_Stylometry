1
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,759
Here you go.

2
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,588
Shh.

3
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,079
Are you frightened?

4
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,949
No.

5
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Yes.

6
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,198
Uh, so am I.

7
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,798
Can you move at all?

8
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,120
Uh... Uh, I'll try,
if there's some place to go.

9
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,234
The Farnsworth school is just
on the other side of the woods.

10
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,353
The Miss Martha Farnsworth
Seminary for Young Ladies.

11
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,915
Any men about there?

12
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,909
Just four other students,
a teacher, and Miss Farnsworth.

13
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,109
The slaves left.

14
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,789
I can't say you'll be
welcome as a Yankee,

15
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,594
but it will be
better than here.

16
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,359
True enough.

17
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,080
I'll accept your invitation.
Can you give me a hand up?

18
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,240
Just give me a minute, will you?
To catch my breath.

19
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,549
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,270
Come here.

21
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,790
You're a lot heavier
than my brother.

22
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,959
Where's he now?

23
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,997
He got killed
in Tennessee.

24
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,918
Oh, well, that wasn't
none of us.

25
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,951
I was never in Tennessee.

26
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
What's your name?

27
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,473
Amelia Dabney.

28
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,993
Mine's McBurney.

29
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,749
Corporal John McBurney.

30
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,270
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Corporal.

31
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,032
We're off to,
where was it now?

32
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,634
To Miss Farnsworth's
Seminary for Young Ladies.

33
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,712
With only five students?

34
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,111
The other girls
have gone home,

35
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,794
but Miss Martha
kept it open.

36
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,993
It was mainly because we don't
have anywhere else to go.

37
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,713
My home is Georgia,

38
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,631
but my mother thought
it would be better

39
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,553
if I stayed up here
in Virginia for a while,

40
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,996
what with your General Sherman down
there so close to Atlanta and all.

41
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,713
Did you run away?

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,675
I was with the
Sixty-Sixth out of New York.

43
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,709
We got hit,

44
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,753
I fell and...

45
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,512
Everything began to blaze.

46
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,399
Do you want to go back?
I can show you the way?

47
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,393
Not now.

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,869
Maybe later when my
leg stops bleeding.

49
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,157
...and now
the verb "to be."

50
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,759
Miss Emily.

51
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,754
Très bien.

52
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,159
Miss Martha!

53
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,872
Marie, come with me.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,115
Help!

55
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,391
Miss Martha!

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss Martha!

57
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,151
Amy!
Help!

58
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,388
What happened?

59
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Are you all right?

60
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,233
How did he get here?

61
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,878
He was all alone
in the woods.

62
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,518
I couldn't leave him
there to die.

63
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,671
You know you're not
supposed to go that far!

64
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,359
- Is he dead?
- Uh...

65
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
No.

66
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,635
Not yet.

67
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,518
Quick, we need
to move him to the porch.

68
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,996
Lift him up.
Edwina, grab a shoulder.

69
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,718
- Yes, Miss Martha.
- Girls!

70
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,314
Let's get him to the porch.
Quick! Quick!

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,838
We all need to help.
Get his legs, girls.

72
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,919
One, two, lift.

73
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,296
He could be dangerous,
Miss Martha.

74
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,480
Just pick him up.

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,597
Sixty-Sixth New York, ma'am.

76
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,557
Grateful to be
your prisoner.

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,869
He's a real
blue belly.

78
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,680
You know they rape every
Southern woman they come across.

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,392
Would you stop
that nonsense, Jane!

80
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,039
It's true.

81
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,078
You couldn't tell from his
face he was a Yankee, would you?

82
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Amy,
I need you to run inside,

83
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,712
get the blue rag,
and tie it on the gate.

84
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,112
The blue rag's so the patrol knows
we've captured a live Yankee.

85
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,278
Why did you not call out?

86
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,896
You must have seen
them crossing the fields.

87
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm sorry, Miss Martha.

88
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,216
I forgot it was
my turn to look out.

89
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,798
You cannot forget this.

90
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,896
Next time it'll be Union
scroungers in our garden.

91
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,751
That's how we lost
most of our chickens.

92
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,269
All right.

93
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,354
Now, Marie, get up there.

94
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,616
Call out if you see
any of our soldiers.

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,675
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,432
We ought to
wash his wound.

97
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Yes.

98
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,599
And we're gonna
need to sew it up.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,035
Uh...

100
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,273
Amy, did I not tell you,

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,480
get the blue rag, tie it on
the gate for the patrol.

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,915
After all the blood he's lost,
he'd die now if he went.

103
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
Wouldn't it be
the Christian thing to do?

104
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,276
Yes. Yes, you're right.

105
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,074
It would be.

106
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,798
He's never
going to make it.

107
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
So, we're going to wait
until he's in better shape,

108
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,271
before he's taken away.
Get him inside.

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,515
Come on.

110
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,955
I'm going to need you to put
hot water on to boil, Emily.

111
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
And we're gonna need cloth.

112
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,112
Anything we can spare.

113
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,675
Alicia, Jane,

114
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,960
you find that cloth and you
bring it to the music room.

115
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,951
- You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

116
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,149
All right.

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,595
Miss Edwina.

118
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,353
Shut the door, girls.

119
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,235
I need scissors.

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,878
Yes, Miss Martha.

121
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Here.

122
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Ugh.

123
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Go get me
some more cloth.

124
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
I need cloth, now.
Yes, Miss Martha.

125
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,037
There's enough metal in here
to shoe a horse.

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,758
I think I got most of it.

127
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,558
I'm gonna need
a needle now.

128
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,836
Get me the thread
and needle.

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,976
- Back up.
- I can't... Stop it.

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,319
Do you hear
what they're saying?

131
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,759
No, I didn't.

132
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,473
Edwina, get me some water.

133
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm gonna clean him.

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,439
Yes, Miss Martha.

135
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
I thought so.

136
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Is he going to die?

137
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,478
Not today,
I don't think.

138
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,993
What'll happen?

139
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,030
We'll turn him over
to the patrol, of course.

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,439
In the meantime, I don't want
you lurking around here.

141
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,949
Or poking around in this room.
Do you hear me?

142
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,958
His name,
in case you've wondered,

143
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,632
is Corporal John McBurney.

144
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,976
Well, he's not going
to be here long enough

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,639
for his name to make
any difference to us.

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,558
Now, there's been
too much distraction,

147
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,955
so no more studying today.

148
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,519
We have a lot
of mending to do.

149
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,198
Mmm. Good.

150
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,157
To the sewing room.
Come on, girls.

151
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,951
I won't be here
much longer, Amy.

152
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,794
Careful, keep your
stitches in a straight row.

153
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,038
Jane, it's the same
for you as all of us,

154
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,395
you don't leave because there's
nowhere for you to go.

155
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,993
There is so.

156
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,388
My father
is with General Lee

157
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,913
and if I so desired,

158
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,315
soldiers would come escort
me to him right now.

159
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,837
If anybody knew
where that was.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,353
Nice and even.

161
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,199
My mother wrote me from Charleston
that the blockade is fearful.

162
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,600
She says I probably eat better
here than I would at home.

163
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,829
You do.

164
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,911
You should have never
brought that Yankee here.

165
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,235
I agree.

166
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
He's probably a spy

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,016
and will let the blue bellies
in at night to raid our garden.

168
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,280
I doubt that,
Miss Jane.

169
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,516
Miss Edwina, aren't you
afraid of that blue belly?

170
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
No.

171
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,429
And it is very bad manners
to call him that.

172
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,353
He has a name,

173
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,593
Corporal John McBurney.

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,359
John.

175
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,836
Let's see.
Am I doing it right?

176
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,235
Yes, but you can get
your stitches closer together.

177
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,355
All right.

178
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,793
It's our boys,
Miss Martha.

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,995
They're passing our way.

180
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,509
Can't we go
and greet them?

181
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,200
No. I don't want them
to see you girls.

182
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,416
I think they have
some prisoners...

183
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,919
Go upstairs. Now.

184
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,576
- What's gonna happen?
- Can't see.

185
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,389
What's the news?

186
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,710
Taking these Yanks
to prison to die.

187
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,234
Good evening, Captain.

188
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,548
Evening, ma'am.

189
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,915
You think Miss Martha's going
to tell them about him?

190
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,073
You all alone
here, ma'am?

191
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,195
Just a few of us.

192
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Well...

193
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,069
Is she telling him?

194
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,118
I can't tell.

195
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,592
Well, you take care,
ma'am.

196
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,509
A lot of these Yanks, they got
separated from their outfits.

197
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,656
And they're just roaming
through these woods,

198
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
and they're desperate.

199
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,256
I was wondering if you might
have a few cartridges

200
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
you could spare?

201
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,416
What good would
that do you, ma'am?

202
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,032
My father left me
his revolver.

203
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,918
I'd feel much safer
if I knew I could use it.

204
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,793
Well, I'll see
what I can spare.

205
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
There you are.
Thank you.

206
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
You're welcome.

207
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,159
He's giving her
something.

208
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,833
You take care.

209
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,950
- All right, let's move out.
- They're leaving.

210
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,793
She didn't tell them.

211
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,320
What are you
doing in there?

212
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,833
See you later.

213
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,513
I was just talking
with him privately.

214
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,829
Let him rest.

215
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,753
He's not one of your
wounded birds or beetles.

216
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,912
We pray for all
of those we have lost.

217
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,359
And we pray

218
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,238
that we will be kept from
harm throughout the night.

219
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Amen.

220
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,719
Amen.

221
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,588
Would anyone like to ask
for special blessings?

222
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,790
I pray that the Lord
see fit to restore

223
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,030
the health
of the wounded soldier.

224
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,119
We pray for his return to
health and his early departure.

225
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,160
Do you think he'll live?

226
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,256
I don't know.

227
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,760
I hope we don't
hear him in the night.

228
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,753
He'll come and get ya.
You know he will.

229
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,216
Marie, stop it...

230
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,071
To your
rooms quietly, girls.

231
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,919
Good morning.

232
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
It is morning?

233
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,668
It's about 6:00.

234
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,434
I thought as much from
the larks I heard singing.

235
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Do you like birds?

236
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,153
Oh, I love them.

237
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,998
Anything wild, I love.

238
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,959
Wild and free.

239
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,798
I think they're robins.

240
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,598
I can show you some
nests I collected.

241
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,271
That would be
my great pleasure.

242
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,195
I better go.

243
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,157
Miss Martha's coming
to fix your bandages.

244
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,436
All right, then.
Thank you, darlin'.

245
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,439
But I like peas.

246
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
You're getting
quite good at that.

247
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Mmm-hmm.

248
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,559
Can I have a pea?

249
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Yes.

250
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,799
Oh, I dropped it.

251
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,913
Can I have another one?

252
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,835
Good morning.

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,069
Good morning.

254
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,038
How's the Yank doin'?

255
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,551
He's fine, much better.

256
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,120
Miss Edwina, how long is he going
to stay in the music room?

257
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,593
Until he's much better.

258
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,592
But how am I supposed
to practice my violin

259
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
with a dangerous enemy
in the same room?

260
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,675
Miss Jane. Please.

261
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,519
Good morning, girls.

262
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,511
Good morning,
Miss Martha.

263
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,751
Tell me, Amy,
did you find any mushrooms

264
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,671
while you were out
collecting soldiers?

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,434
I did, but I'm not sure
they're safe to eat.

266
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,976
Mmm. Well, we'll take
a look at them later, shall we?

267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Hmm.

269
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,873
Seems like the soldier
being here is having an effect.

270
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,319
Get about your business, you
have work and studies to do.

271
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,056
Shall we not have
music here today?

272
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,310
No.
Go to the library.

273
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,719
Good morning, Corporal.

274
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,319
Good morning, ma'am.

275
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,432
I think I'm disrupting
your place here.

276
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,950
Yes. Indeed you are.

277
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,079
You don't mince words, ma'am.

278
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,068
You speak right up.
I like that.

279
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,079
Do you indeed?

280
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,790
You think it makes a great difference
to me whether you like it or not?

281
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,758
Oh, I'm sure my opinion means
nothing at all to you, ma'am.

282
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,256
I'm not looking
for your praise.

283
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,191
Are you not? What are
you looking for then?

284
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,429
Nothing.

285
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,996
You've already given me plenty,
and I'm most appreciative.

286
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,679
Aren't you afraid that I'll
turn you over to our soldiers?

287
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,439
No, I don't think so.

288
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,151
I don't say
you won't do it, but...

289
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,271
You know, I think there are far worse
things that could happen to me.

290
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,997
I don't relish
the prospect of prison,

291
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,399
but it's better
than being dead.

292
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,320
That's exactly what I would be
if you hadn't helped me.

293
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,871
Not necessarily.

294
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,349
Is your leg paining you?

295
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,949
Some.

296
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,436
Well, I hear numbness
would be more grave.

297
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Indeed.

298
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
There's some brandy
if you wish.

299
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,709
Oh, now that would be
a pleasure.

300
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,638
It's not being offered for your
pleasure, only for your comfort.

301
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,077
I must remind you, Corporal McBurney,
you are not a guest here.

303
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,992
You are a most
unwelcome visitor.

304
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,355
And we do not propose
to entertain you.

305
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,312
Well, I wouldn't
expect it, ma'am...

306
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,309
Although you'll find
I'm easily amused.

307
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
What is it, miss?

308
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,395
I just wondered if there's
anything I can do to help?

309
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,511
No. There's nothing
you can do.

310
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,240
You have enough studies and other
work to keep you well occupied.

311
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,999
I only
thought to help.

312
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,355
That won't be necessary.

313
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,712
And, Miss Alicia, you can tell the
others that this room is off-limits.

314
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,913
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
You can trust me
in your place, ma'am.

316
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,952
Well, I don't know you.

317
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,111
Well, I think
if you knew me...

318
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,835
You would.

319
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,631
You won't be here
long enough for that.

320
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,469
Ma'am?

321
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,868
Yes, Corporal?

322
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,792
I don't suppose
there's any chance

323
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,155
of a bit of soap
and a razor, is there?

324
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,073
Let me see what I can find.

325
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Thank you, ma'am.

326
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,760
Careful
with your E's.

327
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,751
Very good, Miss Jane.

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,831
Are we almost done?

329
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,316
Almost, this is
the last row.

330
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,994
Alicia.

331
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,616
I wanted to bring
this to you last night

332
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,471
for fear that you might
die before morning,

333
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,711
but then I thought,
since you were unconscious,

334
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,478
you wouldn't be
able to read it anyway.

335
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,468
That's very logical.

336
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,993
Are you Catholic?

337
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
I was baptized.

338
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,195
Well then, here's
a prayer book for you.

339
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,029
Thank you.

340
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,896
I thought you might
need to confess

341
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,160
if you're
on the verge of death.

342
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,192
Oh, I think I'll be able to hang
around for just a little bit longer.

343
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,519
Where's me manners?
I'm John Patrick McBurney.

344
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Pleased to meet you, sir.

345
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,759
Pleased to meet you, madam.

346
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,159
Just a moment, miss.

347
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,136
Where do you think you're
going in my pearl earrings?

348
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,958
Oh, Miss Edwina,
don't be hateful.

349
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,598
Everyone
is dressing up today.

350
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,079
Not in my jewelry,
they're not.

351
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,878
I'll give them back.

352
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,871
And how beautiful
you look this morning,

353
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,679
you're all dressed up
yourself.

354
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I am not.

355
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,876
Why, I haven't seen that lovely
pin since last Christmas.

356
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,634
Get to your work.

357
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Wait...

358
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Don't run away.

359
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,958
Did you want to see me
about something?

360
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,468
Thank you.

361
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,720
They look as if you've been
trying to dig a pit with them.

362
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,389
I was.

363
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,952
In the middle of battle, with
all that iron flying overhead.

364
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,431
My first thought
was to bury myself.

365
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,120
But when
you couldn't, you ran?

366
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,429
I did.

367
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,672
I surely to God did.

368
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,120
It wasn't very brave
of you to run.

369
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,438
Well, maybe not,
but it was smart.

370
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I think.

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,835
Because you're alive?

372
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,309
And now I've met you.

373
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,192
You don't even know me.

374
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,158
Ah, I know your name...

375
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,953
Miss Edwina Morrow.

376
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,116
And what else have you
been told about me?

377
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,793
Nothing besides your name.

378
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,674
It's a lovely name.

379
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,156
I hope the girls
weren't telling stories.

380
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,957
What do you care
what they say about you?

381
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,834
I don't.

382
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,349
I just didn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

383
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,631
Then you do care
what I think about you.

384
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,038
You're a stranger here,

385
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
that's all,

386
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,231
and I don't want
you to be misled.

387
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,995
Well, then maybe you can
set me off on the right foot

388
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,720
and tell me a little bit
about yourself.

389
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,312
Where are you from,
Miss Edwina Morrow?

390
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,870
My father's home
is Richmond.

391
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,230
Uh, I left Savannah
when I was quite young.

392
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,912
We lived in several places
for my father's enterprises.

393
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,831
And are you waiting
for a sweetheart to return

394
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,839
when this war is over?

395
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,235
I have no one
in the military.

396
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,235
And how did you
end up in this place?

397
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,069
Why are you
so interested in me?

398
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,192
I just reckon that you and I,
we're both a little out of place here.

399
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,438
I bet you're
the independent sort,

400
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,319
and the other girls, they don't
even know how to get close to you.

401
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,871
And then of course
there's your looks.

402
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,712
That doesn't matter to me.

403
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,396
Well, you can bet
it matters to other people.

404
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,438
Sorry to tell you, and I hope you
don't mind me telling you, but...

405
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,635
Well, in all my travels,

406
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
I've never come across such
a delicate beauty as yours.

407
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,788
Tell me something,
will you?

408
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,879
Miss Morrow,

409
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
it's okay.

410
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,312
If you could have anything,

411
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
what's your biggest wish?

412
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,001
If you could have anything in
the world, what would it be?

413
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Anything?

414
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,232
Yeah. Anything.

415
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,908
To be taken
far away from here.

416
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,160
Good day,
Corporal McBurney.

417
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
John.

418
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,274
When
the blackbird in the spring

419
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,349
'Neath the willow tree

420
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,792
Sat and rocked
I heard him sing

421
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,269
Singing Aura Lea

422
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,994
Aura Lea, Aura Lea
Maid with golden hair

423
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,350
Sunshine came along with thee
And swallows in the air

424
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,796
"Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden,

425
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,632
"and I will give you rest.

426
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,314
"Take my yoke upon you,
and learn of me,

427
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,835
"for I am meek
and lowly in heart,

428
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,793
"and ye shall find
rest unto your souls.

429
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,718
"For my yoke is easy..."

430
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,990
May I use
the bath closet?

431
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,430
Can't you wait?

432
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,314
All right.

433
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,151
"For my yoke is easy

434
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,874
"and my burden is light."

435
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,551
Good night, Corporal.

436
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,916
I ask God's blessing
on our armies,

437
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,071
and the safe return
of our boys.

438
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Yes.

439
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,272
One, two, three, four,

440
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,032
five, six, seven, eight...

441
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,713
One, two, three, four,

442
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,672
five, six, seven, eight...

443
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,318
You ready?
Okay.

444
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
All right.

445
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,110
Don't do that!

446
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,112
Here you go, Henry.

447
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,749
All right.

448
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,788
Come here.

449
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,030
Corporal McBurney
gave me one of his buttons.

450
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,272
Miss Amy.

451
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Bless us,

452
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,039
and bless thee thy gifts,

453
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,960
which we receive
from thy bountiful goodness

454
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,475
through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

455
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Amen.

456
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Amen.

457
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,120
It has occurred to me
that we might reflect

458
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,639
on the unexpected presence

459
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,800
of Corporal McBurney in our house...

460
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,311
...until his leg heals,
of course.

461
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,876
And we might discuss how
we may practice compassion

462
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,120
and what else we might learn
from his presence here.

463
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,200
What does each of you
think of this?

464
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,150
Miss Alicia,
can you tell us

465
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,360
what do you think we may learn
from his presence here?

466
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,350
Well, maybe the sight
of him will remind us

467
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,398
there's something else in
the world besides lessons.

468
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,496
Well, it seems to me
that is all there should be

469
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,953
for any young lady your age.

470
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,196
If we learn our lessons
properly when young,

471
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,551
we can expect
a calm and happy life

472
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,115
when faced with the
distractions of the world.

473
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,275
N'est-ce pas?

474
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,274
With the presence
of this hateful enemy,

475
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,152
it'll be a constant
reminder to us

476
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,878
that the war
is still going on,

477
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,034
and the sacrifices
and prayers we must make.

478
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,356
- Mmm.
- May I say,

479
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,670
that any breath of fresh air
from the outside world,

480
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,189
I think is welcome
to us all.

481
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,600
I heard
he's a mercenary,

482
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,518
so maybe he's not
even really an enemy.

483
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
What's a mercenary?

484
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,036
It means he's just paid
by the army to fight,

485
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
he's not really
fighting their cause.

486
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,950
Well, we don't know
about that.

487
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,878
He seems to be
a student of nature,

488
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,315
so I expect to learn
about foreign wildlife.

489
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,677
He seems to be
a sensitive person.

490
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,955
Does he?

491
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,234
I found him understanding.

492
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,149
Do you, indeed?

493
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,790
Oh, you must share more of
your findings with us, Edwina.

494
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,713
As dedicated Christians,

495
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,077
we will join the Corporal
after dinner for a prayer.

496
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,275
Before we retire.

497
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,953
Yes, Miss Martha.

498
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,110
Shall we?

499
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Corporal.

500
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,875
Would you care to join us
for an evening prayer?

501
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,236
But first, maybe
we'll have a little music

503
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,878
if that's not
too disturbing for you.

504
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh, no disturbance at all. No.
I'd love to hear a bit of music.

505
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Miss Jane?

506
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,599
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,519
Miss Jane,
you play beautifully.

508
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Doesn't she?

509
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Indeed.

510
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,439
The years creep
slowly by, Lorena

511
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,357
The snow is on
the grass again

512
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,834
The sun's low
down the sky, Lorena

513
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,472
The frost gleams
where the flowers have been

514
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,151
But the heart throbs on
as warmly now

515
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,073
As when the summer days
were nigh

516
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,714
The sun can never dip so low

517
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,711
Or down
affection's cloudless sky

518
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,675
Could it be Yankees?

519
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,394
Possibly not.
It could be some of our own.

520
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,194
Edwina, wait here
with the girls.

521
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,312
If it is enemy soldiers,
I'll rap on the door three times.

522
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,856
We'll go to the woods
and meet you there.

523
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
What about the Corporal?

524
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
Well, he's in no condition to leave.
He will remain here.

525
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,228
Shh. All of you.

526
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,874
Can I help you, gentlemen?

527
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,696
- I think it's one of our men.
- I hope so.

528
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,336
Miss Edwina,
what are we going to do?

529
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,679
Don't worry,
girls.

530
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,034
Right this way.

531
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,635
Why are they here?

532
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,911
Do you think they're here
for the Corporal?

533
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,869
They may be.

534
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,176
Why don't
we turn him in?

535
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,872
Are they coming?
I'm so scared.

536
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
It's all right.

537
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,976
There's two of them.
Two of our own.

538
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,216
I've given them something to eat.
They're in the kitchen.

539
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Why did they come?

540
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,833
To offer their assistance.

541
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,309
The army is about to leave
the vicinity.

542
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,035
As of yet, I haven't
told them about the Corporal.

543
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,671
But I might ask them
to take him with them.

544
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,435
But he couldn't ride
without hurting his leg.

545
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,976
Well, I could tell them
that he's wounded.

546
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,991
Suggest that they come back.

547
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,353
But that could be weeks.
Could even be months.

548
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,755
They'll probably insist
on taking him right now,

549
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,878
and who knows
what'll happen to him.

550
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,960
They could shoot him and
leave him along the road to die.

551
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,715
I could allow the Corporal to
stay until he is recovered,

552
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,031
and then we could send him
on his way, alone.

553
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,355
Oh, yes.

554
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,760
There is Christian
charity to be considered.

555
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,957
You keep talking about him as if
he wasn't right here in this room.

556
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,656
And there are the doubts if
we can really consider him an enemy.

557
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,908
Please, Miss Martha.

558
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,313
I will allow Corporal McBurney to
stay here until his leg has healed.

559
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,656
But if any of you
is opposed to it,

560
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,069
I will tell the soldiers right now,
and they will decide

561
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,388
what his fate will be.

562
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Any of you?

563
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,319
Miss Jane?

564
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,829
Well then,

565
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,753
he will stay.

566
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,912
The decision is made.

567
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,032
Off to bed.
All of you.

568
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,117
Come on, girls.
Off you go.

569
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,256
Can we go and greet
the soldiers?

570
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,429
No. No, no.

571
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,216
I do not want to put
temptation in their way.

572
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,958
Come on, girls.
Miss Edwina.

573
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,072
This has been
quite a night.

574
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,229
I have to say,

575
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,238
when they saw me,

576
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,676
they said, there is
nothing more frightening

577
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,239
than a startled woman
with a gun.

578
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
When I return,

579
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,675
would you care to join me
for a brandy, Corporal?

580
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,719
I'd like that
very much, ma'am.

581
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,556
How long do you think
he'll stay here?

582
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,550
Miss Martha seems to be
warming up to him,

583
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,119
and I believe
he likes it here.

584
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,759
What would you know?

585
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,278
I've talked
with him privately.

586
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,096
You think just
because you found him,

587
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,816
you have some sort of special
relationship with him?

588
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,273
You're just jealous.
Shh.

589
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,998
It must be tiring
for you.

590
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,959
I can't say
it hasn't been a struggle.

591
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
Well, I admire
your strength.

592
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,000
I know it must be hard for you to be
strong all the time for these girls.

593
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,416
They're lucky to have
a woman such as yourself

594
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,576
to keep going
for all of them.

595
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,115
I'm just trying to give them what
they need to survive in these times.

596
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,800
It's a very different world out
there that they're going into,

597
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,638
I don't think
they realize it.

598
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,956
They can't know what
it's like out there.

599
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,878
Sometimes I get so tired.

600
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,191
I pray that
the end is near.

601
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,671
I can't make any sense of it,
how much everyone has suffered.

602
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,558
There's no sense
to be made of it.

603
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Hmm.

604
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,880
Did you have someone
before the war?

605
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,875
I did.

606
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,469
Well, I'm sorry.

607
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,678
Everyone has lost so much.

608
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,512
I was a coward to leave,

609
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,760
but you don't realize what battle
really is until you've seen it.

610
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,912
It must be devastating.

611
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,350
I was fresh off
the boat from Dublin.

612
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,038
I had nothing.

613
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,509
I took $300 to take
another man's place.

614
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,919
I see.

615
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,828
We've all done things
out of character.

616
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,800
We will see to it that
you make your way home.

617
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,071
Thank you
for your company, Corporal.

618
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,916
If you'll excuse me,
I must insist that you rest.

619
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,280
Well, good night, ma'am. Have a good...
Have a good evening.

620
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,392
Good evening, Corporal.

621
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
You got it!

622
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,428
Miss Martha!

623
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,999
Miss Martha, come look!

624
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
What is it?

625
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Be careful.

626
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,360
Don't put too much weight
on the bad leg.

627
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,709
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,120
I still wouldn't rush
nature to take its course,

629
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,720
but if you want
to risk doing this...

630
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,796
Oh! Corporal, please.

631
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,593
Steady yourself.

632
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,936
Can you help me outside,
Miss Amy?

633
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,439
Yes, of course.

634
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,835
Good day, Corporal.

635
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Ladies.

636
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,736
It's your turn
in the kitchen garden.

637
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
That's right.

638
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,836
I'm helping the Corporal,
as you can see.

639
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,633
I'm sure
we could relieve you.

640
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
No, that's enough.

641
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,071
I'll decide
whose work is needed.

642
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
On your way, girls.

643
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,950
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,950
This reminds me of the first
time we met, you and me.

645
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,272
Your roses need pruning.

646
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,677
And those hedges
are in terrible shape.

647
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,496
Your whole flower garden
needs tending.

648
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,351
I'll get to it tomorrow.

649
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,120
You'll do
nothing of the kind.

650
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,278
Have you had much gardening
experience, Corporal McBurney?

651
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,793
I've done
a bit of it, yeah.

652
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,474
Well, if you really have
such a gift for gardening,

653
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,668
you may assist us
later in your convalescence.

654
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,712
It would be my pleasure,
ma'am.

655
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,189
Come. You have
work to do, Miss Amy.

656
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,277
Here's some water
if you like.

657
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,437
I like very much.
Thank you, my girl.

658
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,791
Miss Martha told me
to return to my lessons,

659
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,155
but I told her all the
things you need me to do.

660
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,816
Yeah, sure. I'm counting
on you to keep

661
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,320
me clumsy feet away
from birds' nests.

662
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,116
That, and keep me company.

663
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,637
Listen, don't tell
any of the others,

664
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,474
but I consider you to be my best
friend in this whole place.

665
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,757
You do?
Yeah, of course I do.

666
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,640
I'm sure if it wasn't for you,
I'd still be sitting under that tree.

667
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,789
Thank you, my lady.
Hmm.

668
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,312
You better not be saying any unkind
things about us to the Corporal.

669
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,476
Now, why would I
ever do that?

670
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Corporal.

671
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,870
I was wondering
how your leg is?

672
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,956
It, uh, twinges
a bit now and then.

673
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,913
I would expect that.

674
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,509
You will recall
I was the one

675
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,556
who was opposed to you
walking on it so soon.

676
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,197
However, I appreciate
your desire to be active.

678
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,836
May I check?
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Well...

680
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,991
The stitches, uh,
they're holding nicely.

681
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,469
Mmm.

682
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,437
The wound
is healing very well.

683
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,430
When do you think
I'll be fully recovered?

684
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,911
Some would say
you're recovered now.

685
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,353
I'm sure the army surgeons
would say

686
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,277
you are ready
to return to duty.

687
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,789
So, you'd like me
to leave?

688
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
I didn't say that.

689
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
No, of course not.

690
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,909
You're far too polite a lady
to be so blunt about it.

691
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,310
I am as blunt as I need
to be, Corporal McBurney.

692
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Since you brought it up,

693
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,336
I would say that the leg
will be healed well enough

694
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,112
to leave by the end
of the week.

695
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,799
That's in just a few days.

696
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,428
Yes, it is.

697
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,949
Where would I go?

698
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,273
I'm afraid that is entirely your
business where you go, Corporal.

699
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,117
However, I think you may
find columns of your troops

700
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,832
on the main road
to Richmond.

701
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,150
Your garden should have
continual care.

702
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,956
I mean, you need
a full-time gardener.

703
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,394
Perhaps,

704
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,959
but I expect, in these times,
one just has to do without.

705
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,800
It's a shame, isn't it, that I
couldn't have remained helpless.

706
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
When?

707
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,830
I don't know exactly,
but she asked him to leave.

708
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,275
Well, we will just have to
make it so pleasant for him

709
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,555
that he won't even
consider leaving us.

710
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,920
We might suggest
to Miss Martha

711
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,110
that the Corporal join us
at the table for dinner.

712
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,712
Yes, he must get lonely
eating alone in his room.

713
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,359
We can show him some real
Southern hospitality.

714
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,352
Miss Edwina Morrow.

715
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,111
I've missed being near you.

716
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,119
You have?

717
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
Yeah.

718
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,191
You have no idea
how lovely you are.

719
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,632
Miss Farnsworth suggested it's
time for me to be on my way.

720
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,952
I don't want you
to leave.

721
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,269
I don't want to leave.

722
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,152
I love you, Edwina.

723
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,713
Please don't ever say that
unless you mean it.

724
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,559
I do mean it.

725
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,600
Geez, I knew exactly how I felt
about you the first time we talked.

726
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,376
I was too afraid
to say anything

727
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,280
for fear that you'd never
let me near you again.

728
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm only telling you now because
I'm running out of time.

729
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,792
It might be my last chance.

730
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,630
I realize I'm not good
enough for you, Edwina.

731
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,078
That's not true.
It is.

732
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,515
You just don't believe in
yourself enough to see it so.

733
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,958
I'm tired of this war.

734
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,991
I want to see the West.

735
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,629
If you can get to Richmond,
my father can help you.

736
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,792
Come with me.

737
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,679
Corporal?

738
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,636
Miss Martha invites you
to dine with us.

739
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,309
Oh, have you heard?

740
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,789
Miss Martha invited the
Corporal to dinner tonight.

741
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Have you got it?

742
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,154
Almost.

743
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,156
Miss Alicia,
too much cream.

744
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,551
Now, you stop your giggling.

745
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,719
Manners.

746
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,754
That dress is very
becoming, Miss Edwina.

747
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Thank you.

748
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,616
There might be other
attractive shoulders here

749
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,440
if we were all permitted
to wear such dresses.

750
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,799
I wouldn't say it's entirely
suitable for a young ladies' school,

751
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,915
but we know Miss Edwina
is accustomed to town society

752
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,433
with different views.

753
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,792
I would suggest that
we change the subject

754
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,390
and that Miss Edwina
draws her shawl.

755
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,753
Yes.

756
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,640
That will avoid any
more speculation on the subject.

757
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,071
This is the best meal
I've had in a long time.

758
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
Thank you, ma'am.

759
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,953
Merci beaucoup.

760
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,950
Miss Alicia made
the pie herself.

761
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,153
I hope you like apple pie.

762
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,039
I love apple pie.
It's my favorite.

763
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,910
Is that my recipe,
Alicia?

764
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,149
It is.

765
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,480
I picked the apples.

766
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
They're delicious.

767
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,438
Apple pie
is my favorite too.

768
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,520
Really?

769
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,720
We've been fortunate to have
enough water for our garden.

770
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,392
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,112
Shall we have some music?

772
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,672
That's a beautiful song, Jane.

773
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,680
Isn't it?

774
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,394
I always thought
it was rather romantic.

775
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,028
Quite.

776
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,915
Mademoiselle, can I
interest you in a dance?

777
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Spin.

778
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
Oh, wait, wait.

779
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,829
Miss Morrow.

780
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,712
I haven't had
the chance to tell you

781
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,632
how ravishing
you look tonight.

782
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,474
Thank you.

783
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,951
May I come and see you
this evening?

784
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,550
Would you care
for a digestif, Corporal?

785
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,868
Yes, ma'am.

786
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,680
What a beautiful evening,
ma'am.

787
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,720
Isn't it.

788
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,712
- The music's lovely.
- Yes, it is.

789
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Pardonnez-moi.

790
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,230
My father had
quite a cellar in his day.

791
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,919
This house was
full of parties.

792
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,037
People traveled
from all over to come here.

793
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,594
Well, it must have been
splendid, ma'am.

794
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,671
Yes. Yes, it was.

795
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,150
There were carriages
lined up...

796
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,795
There were beautiful,
beautiful gowns.

797
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,148
Men in full dress.

798
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,435
Elegant dinners and balls.

799
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,079
Well, a toast to you,
Miss Martha,

800
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,195
you must be the bravest woman
I've ever known.

801
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,669
No.

802
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,194
No. All bravery is,

803
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,591
is doing what is
needed at the time.

804
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,439
Tell me, Corporal...
Yes, ma'am.

805
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,280
...do you think this war
will be over soon?

806
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,669
Very soon,

807
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,435
sooner than you Southerners
are ready to admit.

808
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I know.

809
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,432
And you could do
with some help around here.

810
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,793
A man's help.

811
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,475
Hmm.

812
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
Very nice, Miss Jane.

813
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,720
The corporal sure
does look comfortable tonight.

814
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,509
Girls...

815
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,196
Let's gather
for our evening prayers.

816
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,474
Dear Lord,

817
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,671
we ask for your protection
over our school,

818
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,976
and we ask
for your protection

819
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,877
over the brave members
of our army.

820
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,073
And may we look after our
friend, Corporal McBurney,

821
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,832
as he makes his way?

822
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yes.

823
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,678
Yes, Miss Amy.

824
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,710
Corporal McBurney's stay here has
taught us all a very important lesson,

825
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,310
that the enemy as an individual
is not what we believed.

826
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,674
Let us bow our heads
in silent meditation.

827
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,439
Good night, Miss Edwina.

828
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,599
Good night, Corporal.

829
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,714
Good night, ma'am.

830
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,359
Please! Stop it!

831
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,198
Quiet, girls!

832
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,708
You need your rest.

833
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
Indeed.

834
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,480
Good night, ma'am.

835
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,240
Thank you for your, uh...
Your hospitality.

836
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,713
Good night, Corporal.

837
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,160
Go to sleep.

838
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,158
John...

839
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,070
Edwina.

840
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,675
Edwina...

841
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,992
Darling... Wait.

842
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,633
Edwina, look, just, please...

843
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,239
No.
Lovely Edwina...

844
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,628
Please.
No! No!

845
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,671
No!

846
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,949
No!

847
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,176
- Get me some rope!
- Is he dead?

848
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,191
Get me some rope! We need
to stop the bleeding.

849
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,440
Hurry up!

850
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,120
What happened?

851
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,599
I was so shaken
by my experience,

852
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,800
I could hardly
leave my room.

853
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,756
It was terrible
the way he rushed in.

854
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,475
And then Edwina came up
and began fighting him.

855
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,230
We need to move him
to the table.

856
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,552
You heard me. Hurry up.

857
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,517
I didn't do anything.
Pick him up!

858
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,397
Help me! Help me move him!

859
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,990
Be quiet. Be quiet.

860
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,399
What are you gonna do?
Shh!

861
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,079
Quiet. Go to your rooms.

862
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,754
Go! I need you to go
to your rooms, now.

863
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,399
Go!

864
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,077
We need to remove it.

865
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
What?

866
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,440
That leg is badly broken.

867
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,112
I can't repair it,
I'm not a surgeon.

868
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,469
No!

869
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,478
He's losing so much blood.

870
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,830
Please... The leg
will mortify by the morning.

871
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,880
What do you want me to do?
Do you want him to die?

872
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,757
No! No!

873
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,792
Edwina, look at me!

874
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,355
I need rags.
I need chloroform.

875
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,273
Go to the smokehouse.
Get the saw, now!

876
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,791
Hurry. Hurry!

877
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,956
Quickly! He's losing blood!

878
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,429
Edwina,

879
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,110
bring me the anatomy book.

880
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,680
"My soul does wait,

881
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,791
"And in His word do I hope.

882
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,837
"My soul waiteth for the Lord

883
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,793
"more than that they watch
for the morning."

884
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,754
Jesus Christ!

885
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,590
What have you
done to me?

886
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,234
Oh, Jesus!

887
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,231
I've been waiting
for days to talk to you.

888
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,079
You don't know
how sorry I am.

889
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,350
You're sorry?
You could have stopped her!

890
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,736
No, I couldn't...
Why didn't you stop her?

891
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,760
I couldn't.

892
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
There she is!

893
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,080
The butcher!

894
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,713
We saved your life.

895
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,960
We had no choice.

896
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,856
You didn't have a choice
or you wanted to punish me

897
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,960
for not going to your room!

898
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,576
It was an accident.
She saved your life.

899
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,079
You're worse
than she is!

900
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,355
Did you plan
this together?

901
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,920
Now you have me
at your beck and call.

902
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,712
John, please...
Get away from me!

903
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,800
Get me something
for the pain!

904
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,473
We'll bring you a bottle.

905
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,070
You didn't tell me
it was a house of madwomen.

906
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,950
Miss Martha,
what are we going to do?

907
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,194
Marie said she saw
Union troops approaching.

908
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,736
If we let him go,
he'll join up with them.

909
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,955
He'll tell them about
our garden and our cow.

910
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,274
He'll lead them back here.

911
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,589
Exactly.

912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,831
You vengeful bitches!

913
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,991
How are you doin'?

914
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,198
I tried to ease Miss Martha's
suspicions about us.

915
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,195
I was so worried
about you.

916
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,635
You'll be strong
again soon.

917
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,720
Shut up.

918
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,193
Can I get you anything?

919
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,080
Get me the key.

920
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,191
She would know
if it went missing.

921
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,840
You know I'd get
in trouble for that.

922
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,599
Just get it for me.

923
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,238
There might be another one in
her drawer with her valuables.

924
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,155
Ow!

925
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,758
Get me the key.

926
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,800
All right.

927
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,436
I will.

928
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,279
Who's there?

929
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,989
It's Jane.

930
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,469
Jane.

931
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,520
Open the door
for a minute, will you?

932
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,120
Please.

933
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,751
Jane. Jane,
where are you going?

934
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,755
I'm just going out
to the garden, Corporal.

935
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,998
Play a song
for me, will you?

936
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,633
Will you do that
for me, Jane?

937
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,360
Will you play one of those
pretty songs?

938
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,192
Pretty like you...
Please.

939
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,711
I'm not really
a bad fella, Jane.

940
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,157
Do you think you'll be
able to put in a...

941
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,840
A good word for me with
Miss Martha and the others?

942
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,336
You know, maybe things
will be able to go back

943
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,520
to the way
they were before...

944
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,960
Will you ask her
to let me stay?

945
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,797
She seems to be doing that.

946
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,880
No, I mean...

947
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,199
For her to tell me
I'm welcome.

948
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,835
For her to talk to me
and let you all talk to me.

949
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,831
Would you see
if she'll do that?

950
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,080
Yes, sir.

951
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,559
Thank you, Jane.

952
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,671
I wish he would just leave.

953
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,880
We have to wait for the Union
troops to pass, which will be soon.

954
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,678
I expect our men
to push them back.

955
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,479
Miss Martha, I'm scared.

956
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,749
I know, dear.

957
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,115
He said he was going to kill
me if I made any noise.

958
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Oh, be quiet.

959
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,514
Please.
We must all be strong.

960
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,056
He wasn't harming her.

961
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,308
She isn't harmed,
is she?

962
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,118
He intended to harm her.

963
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,816
We're not sure
what his intentions were...

964
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,193
Don't fence with me, miss.

965
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,238
I don't think he meant
to harm anyone.

966
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,152
Perhaps not,
but we can't be sure.

967
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,320
- Stay back.
- Well, well, well...

968
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,149
What are you lovely Southern
ladies learning today?

969
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,355
The art of castration?

970
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,440
Why don't you just go?

971
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,496
We'll help you get your
possessions and you can leave.

972
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,839
Oh, I can leave now,
can I?

973
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,315
Just without me leg.

974
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,879
Are you finished
dressing me up?

975
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,520
I'll leave
when I goddamn want to.

976
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,791
Everything's gonna change
around here from now on!

977
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,320
Let me tell you
how it's gonna go.

978
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,640
Do you even know why Edwina
threw me down those stairs?

979
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,428
And why your Miss Martha
there, she took my leg?

980
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,550
Because I wouldn't go
to her room! Or Edwina's!

981
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,096
No. No, no, no, they didn't
like that that much!

982
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,350
That's enough! I'll tell
you when it's enough!

983
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,117
Please don't shout,
Corporal McBurney.

984
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,679
You'll frighten Henry here.

985
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,629
No. Amy.

986
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,319
Amy...
Stay away from me!

987
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,748
Come here. Come here.

988
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,155
It's all right.

989
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,355
It's all right.

990
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,835
It's all right.

991
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,136
It's all right.

992
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,354
It's all right.

993
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,154
Miss Martha,
what are we going to do?

994
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,559
Yes, it'll be all right.

995
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,989
It'll be all right.

996
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,839
I need you to get
the blue rag.

997
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,309
I need you to go
to the front gate. Hmm?

998
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,311
You pretend like
you're gathering walnuts,

999
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,760
and you tie that
rag on the gate,

1000
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,160
and then you come
right back here.

1001
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,834
Can you do that?

1002
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,149
Yes, Miss Martha.

1003
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,078
Yes. Good. Hurry.

1004
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,828
What are you doing there, Miss Amy?

1005
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,912
Go inside and stay there.

1006
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,920
Help!

1007
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,955
Leave me alone!

1008
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,336
What did
Miss Martha say?

1009
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Get away from me!
Why are you sending signals?

1010
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,280
- Miss Martha!
- Amy!

1011
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,433
What are you thinking, sending a
little girl to do your bidding?

1012
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,672
Corporal McBurney, please.

1013
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,319
It's all right.

1014
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,671
You come inside with us.

1015
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,788
We have one more bottle
of Bourbon in the cellar.

1016
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,994
Go on, then.

1017
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,279
Get over there
and sit down.

1018
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
Sit down.

1019
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,038
Sit down, the lot of you!

1020
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,228
Amy, I thought
we were friends.

1021
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,671
I never meant
any harm to any of you.

1022
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,270
Look at me, look at
what you've done to me.

1023
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,273
I'd rather be dead
than be a man without a leg,

1024
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
hobbling around.

1025
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,471
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

1026
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,239
I see how you all look at me,
your disgust and your pity.

1027
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,231
I'm not even
a man anymore!

1028
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,832
I took your kindness
and I trusted you,

1029
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,797
and you toyed with me,
you butchered me.

1030
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,640
All right. Well, I've had
enough of your devilment.

1031
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,160
I've got six shots
left in this gun,

1032
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,496
and the next one of you
that tries something,

1033
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,351
I swear to God,
you're gonna get it from me!

1034
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,680
Do you hear me?

1035
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,712
The next shot
is for one of you.

1036
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,960
Edwina.

1037
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,120
Edwina, no.

1038
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,397
What are you doing? No.

1039
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,920
What do you want?

1040
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,791
How could you let her
be alone with him?

1041
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,953
Alicia, please,
just let me think.

1042
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,280
I knew it was a mistake when
you brought him here, Amy.

1043
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,352
You can't blame her, she did it
out of the goodness of her heart.

1044
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,120
I'm trying to think.

1045
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,440
We have to rid
ourselves of him.

1046
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,790
We're not safe here
while he's in the house.

1047
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,511
Can't we leave him
back in the woods?

1048
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,911
No, it'd be too much
of a risk.

1049
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,879
We could hang him?

1050
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,192
We cannot resort
to brutality.

1051
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,880
We can't go on like
this with him here.

1052
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,513
I know, that's why
I need to think.

1053
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,352
I'm trying to think
of a plan.

1054
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,856
I could tell him he's no longer
welcome around certain people...

1055
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,936
You'll do nothing
of the sort.

1056
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,816
You're a fool if you think he's
gonna take your suggestions...

1057
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,136
I was trying to help.
Girls, please. Please.

1058
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,229
Will you go and get help?

1059
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,834
I can't. I can't leave
you here with him alone.

1060
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,351
He loved the mushrooms.

1061
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,832
The Corporal loved
the mushrooms we served him.

1062
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,909
What if Amy
picked the kind...

1063
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,394
Some especially for him?

1064
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,351
Do you think
you could do that, Amy?

1065
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,875
Do you think you could
find the mushrooms?

1066
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,277
Oh, you'd have
to be very quiet.

1067
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,836
You'd have to go very quickly
out of the house.

1068
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,275
Yes?

1069
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,635
Yes, Miss Martha.

1070
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,392
He mustn't see you.

1071
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,830
Hmm, that's what
we're gonna do.

1072
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,433
We're gonna make
a nice supper.

1073
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,471
We'll invite him
for a big send-off.

1074
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,875
Prepare a smoked ham and
we'll make biscuits and...

1075
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,755
And then we'll sauté the
mushrooms in butter and wine.

1076
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,159
Allow me.

1077
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,879
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1078
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,576
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

1079
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,919
Ladies.

1080
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,752
Corporal McBurney,

1081
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,920
we'd like you to know that
we harbor no ill feelings,

1082
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,951
and we prepared this meal

1083
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,469
in commemoration
of your journey ahead.

1084
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:27,238
Well, thank you for
excusing my, uh, outburst.

1085
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,874
Think nothing of it.

1086
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,873
I'd like to thank you for all this as well.
It looks, uh...

1087
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,800
It looks like just about the
finest meal I've ever seen.

1088
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,475
Oh.

1089
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,359
Bon appétit.

1090
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,711
- Yes.
- Wait, wait...

1091
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,951
We must say grace.

1092
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,272
Lord, bless this food

1093
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,711
and grant that we may be
thankful for Thy mercy's be.

1094
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,796
- Amen.
- Amen.

1095
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,280
Would you pour me a
glass of wine, please, Marie?

1096
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,189
Thank you.

1097
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,112
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1098
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,111
Miss Amy picked
the mushrooms today.

1099
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,496
Would you like some,
Corporal?

1100
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,040
I would indeed, yeah.
I'm fond of them.

1101
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,793
Thank you, Miss Marie.

1102
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,354
Miss Morrow?

1103
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,800
Miss Edwina...

1104
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,359
You don't like mushrooms.

1105
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,589
That's true,
I don't really.

1106
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,678
All right, then.

1107
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,072
Thank you.

1108
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,749
Mmm.

1109
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,668
Jesus.

1110
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,600
Miss Amy, you picked
these mushrooms yourself?

1111
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,709
Delicious.

1112
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,840
I'm not gonna
stay here for much longer.

1113
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,636
But, um, while I'm here,

1114
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,718
I want to do my best
to make up for,

1115
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,630
you know, all the unfortunate
things that happened.

1116
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,874
Miss Alicia,

1117
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,314
tell us, how is your
embroidery coming along?

1118
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,193
It's coming along
just fine.

1119
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,280
I do have to say,
the roses are looking splendid.

1120
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,829
And the Blush Noisette,
it's always been one of my favorites.

1121
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,359
John?

1122
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,440
I can't breathe...

1123
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,120
John?

1124
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,433
What's the matter?

1125
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,520
What...

1126
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,640
What...

1127
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,668
What's the matter?

1128
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,758
Miss Amy.

1129
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,072
Keep your stitches in a straight
line, like I showed you.

1130
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,669
Edwina.

1131
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,269
Edwina.

1132
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,073
Yes, Miss Martha.

1133
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,594
Not so tight, Miss Amy.

1134
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,200
Lay him here.
