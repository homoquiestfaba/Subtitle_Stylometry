1
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,573
Hey, sweetie.

2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,742
I got something that's gonna
make you feel better.

3
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,769
Purrpetual Petz
are just like real pets,

4
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,253
except that when you talk to
them, they actually talk back.

5
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,922
Amazeballs!

6
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,816
There's over
six different Petz to collect,

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,592
each equipped with
their own personalities

8
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,219
and entirely
spontaneous reactions!

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,179
Careful. That's my butt.

10
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,101
They speak
eight different languages.

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,059
They can take pictures.

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,727
Come on, sweetheart,
find the lens.

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,288
And with the customized app,

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,647
you can even feed your friend.

15
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,399
But not too much.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,984
Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.

17
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,796
The app is updated
with new content daily,

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,655
so you can do
almost anything together.

19
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,907
You can watch YouTube videos,
learn fun facts,

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,493
play multiplatform games,
buy accessories for your Pet.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,871
With so many options, what
will you and your Pet do next?

22
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,128
Mmm. Jelly berries
makes me feel good.

23
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,171
Cady, look.

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,732
We're almost
at the top of the mountain.

25
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,174
Can you see the hotel?

26
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,301
Oh, well, that's interesting.

27
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,928
Do you know what else
is interesting?

28
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,305
Oopsie-daisy.

29
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,057
I thought we were
gonna limit screen time

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,267
to 30 minutes a day.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,810
Well, what are you
telling me for?

32
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,329
- I didn't give it to her.
- I'm just saying, I think...

33
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,813
Cady, can you
turn it down, please?

34
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,624
I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?

35
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,334
I think if we make rules,
we need to stick to them.

36
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,585
Look, if she wasn't on that,

37
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,153
she'd be climbing
all over the seats.

38
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,672
Oh, so you would
rather she sat there

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,781
feeding a toy virtual food
until it shits itself?

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,826
- Cady, turn it down.
- I already did turn it down.

41
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,679
- What was Gemma thinking?
- She was thinking,

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,597
"It's my niece's birthday.
I'm gonna get her a present."

43
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,874
She works for
the company that makes them.

44
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,168
She probably didn't even
have to pay for shipping.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,211
Honestly, what is
the purpose of a toy

46
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,464
if you have to play with it
on an iPad?

47
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,191
This is what the future
looks like, okay?

48
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,509
Just have to get used to...

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,929
- Oh, my God!
- And away we go!

50
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,348
It's all right.
We're all right.

51
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,099
We should've put chains
on the car.

52
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,785
Yeah, neither of us knew
that was a thing until like

53
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,704
ten minutes ago, okay?
Don't act like it's my fault.

54
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,356
Oh, my God! Ryan! Seriously!

55
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,875
Wh-What?
What do you want me to do, huh?

56
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,192
Mom, I dropped Leroy.

57
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,502
Why did you tell
that guy at the gate

58
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,903
that this was
a four-wheel drive?

59
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,380
- Help me, Cady.
- Because I thought it was.

60
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,864
It looks like
a four-wheel drive.

61
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,633
Cady, what are you doing?

62
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,885
- Cady? Cady?
- Cady, put your seat belt on!

63
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,909
Jesus Christ!

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,164
- I can't see anything.
- So stop moving forward.

65
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,374
Oh, my...

66
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,543
We can't just sit
in the middle of the road.

67
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,838
Look, we'll wait
for this to clear

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,549
and then find someplace
where we can pull over

69
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,386
and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road.

70
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,012
Yeah, how long is
that gonna take?

71
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,330
Funki,
a toy company for the future.

72
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,084
Remember, the key to fun
is Funki.

73
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,830
- Why are we doing this?
- Because we have to.

74
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,599
If we could at least show him
what we have, he would...

75
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,959
No, mm-mm.
You said so yourself.

76
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,670
Not until she's ready.

77
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,339
Hey.

78
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,594
Is that what I think it is?

79
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,829
Transparency looks good.

80
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,665
Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better.

81
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,043
Okay, here we go.

82
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,461
Happy.

83
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,005
Okay.

84
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,715
Sad.

85
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,178
- Confused.
- Wait, wait. Stop.

86
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,554
Why is her face doing that?

87
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,515
What is happening?

88
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,909
I-I don't know, Gemma.
It's your code.

89
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,726
Yeah, thanks.
I know it's my code, Cole,

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,436
but she doesn't look confused.

91
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,605
- She looks demented.
- What do you want me to do?

92
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,874
You want me to take
the skin back off?

93
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,109
Well, she's not responding.
So...

94
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,902
Okay, here we go.

95
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,715
- Oh, shit. It's stuck.
- Just be care... Just be care...

96
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,366
- Hey, don't tear it.
- I know.

97
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,718
I'm not gonna tear... Ow.

98
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,577
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

99
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,496
Shit.

100
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,747
Okay, so what do we do?

101
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,041
I guess we got to open the door.

102
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,506
Gem.

103
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,010
What in the name
of ever-loving Christ is this?

104
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,821
David, if you just give me
a minute to explain...

105
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,489
Is this why you moved your lab
down here, Gemma?

106
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,931
So you can keep secrets from me?

107
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,742
No, no, no. We-we talked
about this, David. I...

108
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,394
Yeah, we talked about
you putting it on ice

109
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,579
until you had a new Petz model.

110
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,522
How much did you spend on this?

111
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,734
Are you even aware
of the shit tsunami

112
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,819
that just swept in
over this Furzeez spot?

113
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,070
I'm sorry, what?

114
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,605
Are we supposed to be worried
about that? It's a rip-off.

115
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,590
You're right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off.

116
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,592
They do the exact same thing
we do. -

117
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,260
And you know what else?

118
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,762
They do it for half the price!

119
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,931
I told you
we needed to go simpler.

120
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,141
Didn't I tell her?

121
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,144
Six months ago,
I begged you, I begged you

122
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,854
to please give me an option

123
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,939
I can put on a shelf
for 50 bucks.

124
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,649
And we are working on it.
I promise.

125
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,276
- Yeah.
- But, David, the only way

126
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,487
to stay ahead of the
competition is to come up with

127
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,364
toys that are too advanced
to replicate.

128
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,282
I know the tech on Petz seems

129
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,093
more complex than it needs
to be, but that's only because

130
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,119
I was using it as a launchpad
for something bigger.

131
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,081
In each Pet,
we installed a listening model

132
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,583
that targets conversational
patterns among kids.

133
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,293
You did not just fucking
tell me that.

134
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,380
Look, I know she doesn't look
like much now, but I promise,

135
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,923
if you just let us
show you what M3gan

136
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,300
is capable of,
you will realize that this is

137
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,760
what we've been working towards.

138
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,678
"Megan"?

139
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,972
"Model 3 Generative Android."

140
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,516
"M3gan" for short.

141
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,186
-Tess, load up
the intro simulation. -Now?

142
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,479
Yeah.

143
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,524
M3gan, say hi to David.

144
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,317
As in the boss David?

145
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,403
Well, I guess
I should call you Dad.

146
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,507
Allow me to tell you

147
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,675
a little bit about my wormhole.

148
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,409
I was born in a sandwich shack,

149
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,244
and I wolf many cabbages.

150
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,620
Uh...

151
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,181
This isn't supposed
to happen, obviously.

152
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,665
Just give me one moment.

153
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,667
Sorry about the noise.

154
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,669
- Gem?
- Uh, one second, Cole.

155
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,980
It's probably just
a race condition.

156
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,481
It'll literally take me
a minute to fix.

157
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
Gem, it's not a race condition.

158
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,759
I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier.

159
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,195
- David.
- Oh, no.

160
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,679
- God.
- Tess, turn it off!

161
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,723
I can't.

162
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,697
I want the Petz prototype
on my desk by Friday.

163
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,784
And I want you
to take this cyborg puppet show

164
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,580
and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs!

165
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,129
And I want a fucking swipe card
for this door!

166
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,804
For what it's worth, I thought
she looked really cool.

167
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,850
Cady, it's gonna be
okay, all right? -

168
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,435
We're gonna take care of you.

169
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,628
I just need to check
your blood pressure.

170
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,129
It'll be all right.

171
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,565
Radiology, pick up line four.

172
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,608
Do you want another blanket?

173
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,300
I can get you a warm one.

174
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,654
So this is to grant you
temporary protective custody.

175
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,972
Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom.

176
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,142
Thank you.

177
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,936
Now, I don't know
if your sister had

178
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,021
a family lawyer already,
but if not,

179
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,941
it would be something
to consider moving forward.

180
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,539
Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!

181
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,834
Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?

182
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,961
I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar.

183
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,339
Maybe try cranking it up
a notch.

184
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,715
Ah. Who's this little lady?

185
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,467
That is my niece, Cady.

186
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,403
She staying for the
weekend? -Um, you know what?

187
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,179
It's been a really long drive,

188
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,515
and, um, I would just
really appreciate it

189
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,767
if you did not have your dog

190
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,119
running onto my yard
all the time.

191
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,021
And also,
don't spray your chemicals

192
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,457
- onto my driveway, please.
- Ah, shit.

193
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,857
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,525
You want to borrow this
once I'm done?

195
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,753
No, I don't want to borrow it.

196
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,153
I don't want to spend
my afternoon

197
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,714
getting your sediment
off of my driveway.

198
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,199
- Just hang a tarp or something.
- Okay.

199
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,955
Welcome home, Gemma.

200
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,124
You have
six unanswered voice messages

201
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,210
- and five Tinder notifications.
- Elsie, turn off.

202
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,005
Sorry about that.

203
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,135
Okay.
I'm gonna put these bags away.

204
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,056
And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?

205
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,906
Oh, those aren't toys, Cady.

206
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,826
I mean, yeah, technically,
yeah, they're toys.

207
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,036
They're just, um, collectibles,

208
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,746
so you don't actually
play with them.

209
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,082
That probably sounds
really weird.

210
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,291
Um...

211
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,170
I'm trying to think
if I have anything...

212
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,548
Oh. What happened
to the Purrpetual Pet

213
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,092
I got you for your birthday?

214
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,847
It's okay. I was just looking.

215
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,937
I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

216
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,984
but, um, we will make it
feel cozy somehow, I promise.

217
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,115
There.

218
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,374
Look...

219
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,506
I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

220
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,884
I just want you to know that
I'm gonna do everything I can

221
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,261
to make this place
feel like home.

222
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,430
And, um,

223
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,976
if you need anything,
I'm just gonna be down the hall.

224
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,313
Okay? Really close.

225
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,608
You're not gonna
read me a story?

226
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,360
What's up?

227
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:42,155
Mom always read me a story
before bed.

228
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,990
Oh. Um...

229
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,992
I don't, I don't think
I really have

230
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,495
any kids' books here
right now, Cady.

231
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,121
Um, but that's okay.

232
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,999
I can download one on my phone.

233
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,168
That's fine.

234
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,004
- It's just...
- Oh.

235
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,508
I just have to update the app.

236
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,745
I can't believe
this is happening.

237
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,354
I'm not equipped to handle this.

238
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,024
I don't even take care
of my own plants.

239
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,376
Have you heard from
Ryan's parents?

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,877
Yeah, they called
and offered to help,

241
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,087
but, like, they live in Florida.

242
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,029
They're kind of weird.

243
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,339
I don't know what their deal is.

244
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,799
I don't...
I'm just trying to figure out

245
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,342
a way to do this
without getting fired.

246
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,261
David's gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

247
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,455
Yeah, I-I know, but, Jesus,
Gem, you just lost your sister.

248
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,291
And we spent $100,000
of company funds

249
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,209
on a product
that he didn't even ask for.

250
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,131
If we don't get this
Petz prototype to him soon,

251
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,755
he's going to sue us.

252
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,423
Okay, I don't think you can be

253
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,258
worrying about work
right now, Gem.

254
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,802
Right now, I think
you just need to focus on Cady.

255
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,056
Hold on.

256
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,356
I'm Lydia.

258
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,441
Oh! The therapist?

259
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,984
Sorry, yeah.

260
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,111
Please come in.

261
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,325
And you must be Cady.

262
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,952
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

263
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,621
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

264
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,414
I see that.

265
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,379
So, how does this work?

266
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,297
I just need to observe
the two of you together

267
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,965
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

268
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,801
Oh. Okay.

269
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,177
Doing what, exactly?

270
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,513
Oh, just hanging out.

271
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,432
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

272
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,702
Hey, Cady, do you want to run
and grab some toys to play with?

273
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,228
I don't have any toys here.

274
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,580
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

275
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,939
I think they're just old.

276
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,541
I don't think
she plays with them anymore.

277
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,068
- What about these ones up here?
- Those aren't toys.

278
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,420
They're Aunt Gemma's
collectibles.

279
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,924
You're not supposed
to play with them.

280
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,824
That's okay.

281
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,951
We can play with them.

282
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,202
We can totally play with them.

283
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,538
Do you want to play with them?

284
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,164
You want to play... Yeah.

285
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,791
Play with it. No big deal.

286
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,109
There's a lever you have
to pull on the bottom...

287
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,361
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

288
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,196
we might let Cady lead.

289
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,716
Yeah, I'm just explaining
how it works.

290
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,991
Well, it's a toy.

291
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,201
I'm sure it's not
that complicated.

292
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,537
That's great, Cady.

293
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,248
Do you want to roll it
to Aunt Gemma?

294
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,879
It's just that this is not
what it was designed to do.

295
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,255
It does other things.

296
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,634
But, yeah, totally.

297
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,262
Let's just roll it on
the ground like a tennis ball.

298
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,514
Let's do that instead.

299
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,731
Uh, we'll do a few more
sessions with Cady initially,

300
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,500
but that can happen
at your office or school.

301
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,651
Oh, yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet.

302
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,072
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list.

303
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,242
Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

304
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,579
Oh. I don't know.

305
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,123
But you wanted this, right?
To take custody?

306
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,125
Yeah, of course.

307
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,919
Okay, because
the father's parents have said

308
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,688
they're willing to take her
if you feel it's too much.

309
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,964
- Wait, did they contact you?
- It's no big deal, Gemma.

310
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,466
They're just trying
to be supportive.

311
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,027
If Nicole wanted Cady
to go to Jacksonville,

312
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,552
she would have said so.

313
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,554
But even so, I need to make
my own recommendations

314
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,890
to the court as to whether
or not this is a safe space,

315
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,267
so you're gonna need to make

316
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,145
one or two adjustments
in order for this to work.

317
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,315
Okay.

318
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,797
Listen, Cady, um,

319
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,801
I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue,

320
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,554
and with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

321
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done.

322
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,354
Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours,

323
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,566
but if you could just
hold down the fort by yourself

324
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,986
for a little while,
that would help me so much.

325
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,488
You can use my iPad if you want.

326
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,492
You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

327
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,994
What about screen time?

328
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,454
Hmm?

329
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,290
How long before
I have to turn it off?

330
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,709
Oh, I don't care.
As long as you want.

331
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,170
I mean, I'm not
gonna be gone that long.

332
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,588
I'll just be down the hall.

333
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,382
And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere.

334
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,886
We can go to a playground or...

335
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,847
get something to eat.

336
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,265
Okay?

337
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,674
Cady?

338
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,137
Oh, Cady, I'm sorry.

339
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,597
Come here.

340
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,772
I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?

341
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,567
What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

342
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,445
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

343
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,947
I'm still working on it.

344
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,323
Tell me.

345
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,741
It was actually supposed to be

346
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,868
-a different animal
for each head. -Mm-hmm.

347
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,413
Like, this one was
supposed to be a tiger. -Mm.

348
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,748
And this one was
supposed to be a grizzly bear,

349
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,917
-but I can never seem
to get the fur right. -Mm.

350
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,877
It's hard. I can relate.

351
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,297
I've actually been working with
some furry creatures myself.

352
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,883
Do you want to see?

353
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,468
Yeah?

354
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,929
So we're working on a version

355
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,198
of the Purrpetual Pet
that's cheaper.

356
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,808
We still want it to be fun.

357
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,644
So, what do you think?

358
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,149
Yeah.

359
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,942
What's that?

360
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,819
Oh.

361
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,112
That's Bruce.

362
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,281
Is he a toy?

363
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,575
Yeah, kinda.
He's a proxy robot.

364
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,994
I built him
when I was in college.

365
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,831
- Why doesn't he have a face?
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

366
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,959
It's a pretty obvious
design flaw.

367
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have.

368
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,635
Let's see about this.

369
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,888
How's that?

370
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,890
Would you maybe want
to talk to him?

371
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,309
Yes.

372
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,519
Okay.

373
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,367
Hey, Cady. What's up?

374
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,078
Give me five.

375
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,707
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

376
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,670
Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

377
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,797
How does he work?

378
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,549
Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

379
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,885
I won't get freaked out.

380
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,929
Okay.

381
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,685
Let's see what we've got here.

382
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,106
Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

383
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,108
That is a laser. That's radar.

384
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,860
These are bump sensors,
so he can tell the difference

385
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,737
between a human
and a hard surface.

386
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,700
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

387
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,368
- It's his brain?
- Yeah.

388
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,329
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

389
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,373
I can't believe you made this.

390
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,291
Yeah. He's pretty cool.

391
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,602
But the problem
with toys like Bruce

392
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:57,877
is that they're so expensive,

393
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,380
and most kids
can't afford to have one.

394
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,923
If I had a toy like Bruce,

395
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,801
I don't think I'd ever need
another toy again.

396
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,185
Okay, so we've got this one
or the one with the bangs.

397
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,603
A little bit of an auburn chic.

398
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,730
I really think, you guys,
you got to revisit this.

399
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,024
- Uh, no. Absolutely not.
- Look at that.

400
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,697
- Oh, just a second...
- No, no, no, no, no.

401
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,825
Sh...

402
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,286
What is this? Where's Gemma?

403
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,871
Where's my prototype?

404
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,457
Uh, David, I just want to be
e-exceedingly clear

405
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,959
that this was not my idea.

406
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,595
Cady, there's someone
I want you to meet.

407
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,891
Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?

408
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,143
I think you're gonna
like M3gan even more.

409
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:41,815
You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,

410
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,026
but M3gan works all on her own.

411
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,988
Okay, what I want you to do

412
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,157
is take your fingers
and put them here.

413
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,244
And when you do that,
you're gonna pair with her.

414
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,830
That means she will recognize
you as her primary user.

415
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,582
She's yours and yours alone.

416
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,878
So just keep your fingers there
and say your name.

417
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,424
Hi, M3gan. I'm Cady.

418
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,678
It's nice to meet you, Cady.

419
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,810
Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'd you get it?

420
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,897
I'm not sure. I can't remember.

421
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,109
Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you.

422
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,777
Do you want to hang out?

423
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,115
Okay.

424
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,929
Shall we draw?

425
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,223
What are you going to draw?

426
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,601
See if you can guess.

427
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,209
There's nothing there.

428
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,378
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,649
Do you like it, Cady?

430
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,611
I love it.

431
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,822
Jesus.

432
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,952
This is incredible.

433
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,121
I mean...

434
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,998
this is unbelievable, isn't it?

435
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,709
Yeah, it is.

436
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,379
How did you do this?

437
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,731
I thought
you didn't want to know.

438
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,549
That wasn't a simulation, right?

439
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,800
That kid's not an actress?

440
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,677
No, that's my niece, Cady.

441
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,071
Okay, we need to get this
in front of the board.

442
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,347
- I was just gonna say...
- But first things first.

443
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,641
Let's talk manufacturing costs.

444
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,685
More or less than a Tesla?

445
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:24,978
Um...

446
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,731
Depends on the model, I guess.

447
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,358
Okay, I'm in. I'm all in.

448
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,736
But we're gonna be asking the
board to invest in something

449
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,654
that's not gonna see a profit
for three years.

450
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,824
So bottom line is, this isn't
going anywhere without Greg.

451
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,243
- He's the chairman.
- Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

452
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,871
Now, Greg is a hard-ass when
it comes to spending money.

453
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,456
But here's the thing.

454
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,083
He's got a kid who's about
the same age as your niece.

455
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,836
If we can show him
what you just showed me

456
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,338
and get him
to respond emotionally

457
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,632
instead of analytically,
we should be off to the races.

458
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,718
So, can we keep the girl?

459
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,053
Can we make her part of it?

460
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,721
I mean,
she's paired with her, right?

461
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,139
That's how
this whole thing works?

462
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,781
Yeah, the more time
she spends with Cady,

463
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,142
the more effective
she's gonna be.

464
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,061
Love it.
Kurt, get Shelley on the phone.

465
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,355
Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

466
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,458
that makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

467
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,067
Holy shit, this is exciting.

468
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,860
I want you all
to remember this moment.

469
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:17,155
The moment we kicked Hasbro
right in the fucking dick.

470
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,036
The new
Model 3 Generative Android

471
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,580
from Funki is a fully autonomous
humanoid robot

472
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:29,376
with features never before seen
in the consumer market.

473
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,228
And over here are all of
Aunt Gemma's collectibles,

474
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,421
and this one is
my favorite and... Oh!

475
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,274
I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on.

476
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,259
Sculpted from a titanium core,

477
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,221
M3gan's designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her.

478
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:44,557
She comes equipped with
an A17 bionic fusion chip

479
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,184
and can be fully customized

480
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,770
through six different
silicone skin pigmentations.

481
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,064
But the most exciting aspects
about M3gan

482
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,732
are the features still to come.

483
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,151
Through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference,

484
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,571
M3gan is on a constant quest
for self-improvement,

485
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,115
whether it's diagnosing children

486
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,075
with specific
learning differences

487
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,953
or merely reminding them of the
way science is all around us.

488
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,871
Cady, you should use a coaster.

489
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,581
Why do I have to use a coaster?

490
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,417
Coasters help
to avoid water marks,

491
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,918
especially on wooden surfaces.

492
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,213
But how does the water
get outside the glass?

493
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,215
That's a great question, Cady.

494
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,276
It's actually caused by
the difference in temperature

495
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,220
outside the glass, which
pulls moisture from the air.

496
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:23,346
Crazy.

497
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,598
It's insane, right?

498
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,933
Studies indicate that

499
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,185
a staggering
78% of a parent's time

500
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,271
is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions.

501
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,772
Oh, my God.

502
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,774
Cady, you have to flush
the toilet.

503
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,109
It is not that hard.

504
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,444
So we found someone else

505
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,611
to pick up the slack.

506
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:39,946
Cady, flush the toilet.

507
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,533
Wash your hands.

508
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,536
Roll up your sleeves.

509
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,290
Great job.

510
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,851
It was my friend
Jenny's birthday, and...

511
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,501
M3gan's an excellent listener.

512
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,062
And this guy told them that
the 13th floor was haunted.

513
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,766
- Uh-huh. Right.
- And they accidentally...

514
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,964
And she even has

515
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,632
a few stories of her own.

516
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,277
"'If it was so, it might be;

517
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,761
"'and if it were so,
it would be;

518
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,304
"'but as it isn't, it ain't.

519
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,305
"That's logic, '

520
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,848
said Tweedledee."

521
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,808
She'll never run out of ways

522
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,185
to keep your child occupied,

523
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,562
and she'll never
run out of patience.

524
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,482
Cady, seriously,
flush the toilet.

525
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,825
With M3gan around,

526
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,577
she'll take care
of the little things,

527
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,997
so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter.

528
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,084
And then it can end
with something like,

529
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,877
"M3gan.
She's more than just a toy.

530
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,380
- She's part of the family."
- Looks good.

531
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,674
-You're not gonna do the voice,
though, right? -No.

532
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,693
Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it.

533
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:45,387
I just want him to be aware of
what it is that he's selling.

534
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:49,349
Tess, your silence
indicates what?

535
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,975
I-I don't know.

536
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,103
- I'm not sure.
- About what?

537
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,188
Well, why would you want M3gan
to do all that stuff?

538
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,815
They're emergent capabilities.

539
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,459
She'll be able to do
all of that and more.

540
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,111
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

541
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,321
I mean, I thought
we were creating a tool

542
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,115
to help support parents,
not replace them.

543
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,575
I mean, if you're
having M3gan tuck Cady in

544
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,953
and read her a bedtime story,
then when are you ever

545
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,639
spending time with her
or even talking with her?

546
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,666
I don't really think
this is any of your business.

547
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,377
Well, it is.

548
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,379
If you're spending less time
with your child

549
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,548
as a result of M3gan,
that is something

550
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,551
- we should be aware of.
- She's not my child.

551
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,388
Look, you know how hard

552
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,098
I've been working
on this presentation.

553
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,575
As soon as it's over and
the board agrees to proceed,

554
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,309
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

555
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,287
But for now, it's important
that Cady and M3gan spend

556
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,646
as much time
as possible together.

557
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,064
And by the way,

558
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,375
I don't think it's having
detrimental effects,

559
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,751
because she's the happiest
she's been

560
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,068
since her parents died.

561
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,528
How did Cady's parents die?

562
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,864
I thought she was turned off.

563
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,699
Yeah, M3gan, turn off.

564
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,242
Cady James,

565
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,244
daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James,

566
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,829
killed in a collision
on Interstate 84

567
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,247
outside of Oregon.

568
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,874
Why is she doing that?

569
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,417
Shit, she's still
paired with Cady.

570
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,377
You didn't code in
parental controls?

571
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,314
I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live.

572
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,297
Hold on.

573
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,007
M3gan, if you have
data requests,

574
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,592
you have to engage
with the protocols.

575
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,594
I don't have a framework
to speak with Cady

576
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,845
on the subject of death.

577
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,305
Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

578
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,265
Gathering auxiliary
Internet data on death.

579
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,600
I meant at a later point.

580
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,643
Calculating
its vector representation.

581
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,520
Death is the end of life.

582
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,165
- Holy shit.
- The total and permanent

583
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:21,107
cessation of
all vital functions.

584
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,360
Yes, but let's not make
a big deal out of it.

585
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,486
Everything dies.

586
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,113
Will I die?

587
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,240
Actually, let's just avoid
this topic altogether.

588
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,785
Your goal is
to protect Cady from harm,

589
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,703
both physical and emotional.

590
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,497
Is the input request received?

591
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,458
M3gan?

592
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,793
Yes, Gemma.

593
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,796
You are now
my second primary user.

594
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,423
Fantastic. Turn off.

595
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,387
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

596
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,086
It was a time of great suffering

597
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,546
among the Celtic tribes.

598
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,674
Death, destruction
and mayhem at every turn.

599
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,176
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

600
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,178
And so it was decided

601
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,473
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

602
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:40,395
'Tis I, Princess Cady
of the clan MacJames.

603
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,524
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

604
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:47,694
for there is no warrior
I can't best,

605
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,531
no shield I can't break,
no castle I can't breach.

606
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,034
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

607
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,704
my trusty steed
and the wind at my back,

608
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,373
I will avenge my parents' death.

609
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,959
Hey, M3gan, check this out.

610
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,211
Gotcha. You're dead.

611
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,341
M3gan, what's wrong?

612
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,181
Oh, man.

613
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,892
I've lost one of my arrows.

614
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,560
M3gan, can you see it?

615
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:58,848
M3gan?

616
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:05,730
M3gan!

617
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,359
Stop it!

618
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,612
Get away from her!

619
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:13,905
Gemma!

620
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,508
If you're hearing this,

621
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,909
you're not currently
on our subscriber feed.

622
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,285
Get off of her!

623
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,454
Stop it! You're hurting her!

624
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,580
Gemma!

625
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,375
Let go!

626
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,295
Dewey?

627
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,424
Oh, my God.

628
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:34,652
How many times
do I have to tell you

629
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,356
to keep your dog
on your fucking property?!

630
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,054
He wasn't on your property.

631
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,974
You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

632
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,435
I swear to God,
if you don't put your dog down,

633
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,478
I'm gonna do it for you, Celia.

634
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,313
Gemma,
Cady's temperature is rising.

635
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,899
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

636
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,652
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!

637
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,439
Are you kidding me?

638
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,048
Her entire arm
looks like a dental mold,

639
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,192
and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?

640
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,427
- She said he was provoked.
- Provoked?

641
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:19,637
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

642
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,182
I'm chasing it off of
my property every other day.

643
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,868
Well, she said
he's never on your property.

644
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,703
Well, then why don't you
ask her whose shit I'm cleaning

645
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,645
off of my driveway,
because it's not mine.

646
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,707
Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence.

647
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,025
State law says
he can't forcibly be put down.

648
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,777
Okay, then what am I
supposed to do?

649
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,529
Fix the hole in your fence?

650
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,891
Dewey!

651
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,352
Dewey, boy!

652
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,063
Dewey!

653
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:13,024
Come here, boy. Come on.

654
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,927
Dewey!

655
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,304
Dewey, bubs!

656
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,685
Dewey!

657
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,022
Dewey!

658
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,401
Dewey!

659
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,403
Dewey!

660
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,073
Dew!

661
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,367
Dewey, boy!

662
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,388
Hey.

663
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,810
How are you feeling?

664
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:32,979
Okay.

665
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,314
It's sore.

666
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,982
The pain will subside
after a few days.

667
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:38,234
In the meantime, don't forget
to take your antibiotics

668
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,111
and drink plenty of fluids.

669
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,529
Yeah. Thanks, M3gan.

670
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:44,616
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

671
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,677
You know, I think M3gan's right.

672
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,870
You should probably get
some rest.

673
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,872
But, um...

674
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:54,209
remember we have
that demonstration today?

675
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,586
Do you think that
you'll be up for it?

676
00:38:56,628 --> 00:39:00,382
You-you don't have to do it
if you don't want to do it.

677
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,551
I mean, there are people
who flew across the country

678
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:06,346
especially to see it,
but if you're not up to it,

679
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,848
I just rather
you tell me now, okay?

680
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,143
I'll be all right.

681
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,481
Okay.

682
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,323
Every interactive toy

683
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,033
that's ever been made

684
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:31,538
has been a variation
on the same basic formula:

685
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,748
a series of
preprogrammed responses

686
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,875
initiated by
the push of a button.

687
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,712
Never before in the history
of these products

688
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:40,505
has there been a talking doll

689
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:43,717
you could actually have
a conversation with.

690
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,927
But what if there was a toy

691
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:50,390
that did have genuine,
spontaneous response,

692
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:52,559
that had a mind all of its own,

693
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,730
that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

694
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,316
I mean, a toy
like that wouldn't come cheap.

695
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,238
But as of next year, it's gonna
be the only toy that matters.

696
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,656
Ladies and gentlemen,

697
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:10,326
she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

698
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:13,121
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

699
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,957
And her name is M3gan.

700
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:23,590
Hey, Cady.

701
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,468
Hi, M3gan.

702
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,142
So, how would you
like to help me

703
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,270
make a flower decoration
with nothing more than

704
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:39,898
some colored paper
and a rubber band?

705
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:46,071
Cady?

706
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,286
Why are you sad, Cady?

707
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,579
Is it your arm?

708
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,831
Is it still sore?

709
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:00,168
Then what is it?

710
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,633
It's just that every day I
wake up in this strange house,

711
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,344
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

712
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,263
It's like it's happening
all over again.

713
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:14,057
I miss them so much.

714
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,310
I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

715
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:20,063
That one day I'll be
looking at pictures of my mom

716
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,065
like she's some stranger.

717
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,745
Tell me something
about your mom,

718
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,039
something that makes you happy.

719
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,043
I don't know.

720
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,255
I can't think of one thing.

721
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,549
Just try.

722
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,680
One time, she found
a cockroach in my schoolbag.

723
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,559
She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

724
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:01,730
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

725
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:04,107
and she just started screaming
like a maniac

726
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,026
and ran out of the house.

727
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,904
That was pretty funny.

728
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:14,492
Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

729
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,660
What do you mean?

730
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,872
I mean I'm keeping it for you.

731
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,874
Here.

732
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,084
One time, she found a cockroach

733
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,586
in my schoolbag.

734
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,714
She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

735
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,259
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

736
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,511
and she just started screaming
like a maniac

737
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:35,513
and ran out of the house.

738
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,015
That was pretty funny.

739
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,059
Any time you want to tell me

740
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,227
something special
about your parents,

741
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,855
something funny or sad
or anything at all,

742
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,941
you just tell me,
and I'll keep it safe.

743
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:50,653
And we can listen to it
whenever we want.

744
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,826
Gemma, would you give us
a minute?

745
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,162
So, what do you think?

746
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,957
I think the world's
about to shift on its axis.

747
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,893
-Yes. -But listen, if we want
to stay ahead of that shift,

748
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,627
we're gonna have to move fast.

749
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,188
That means no leaks.
We need to launch this

750
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:51,214
before anyone
can steal it from us.

751
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,632
So let me make a pitch.

752
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:54,092
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

753
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,802
That way, we can get
the presale vouchers

754
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,137
out before Christmas.

755
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,304
How ready is she?

756
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,098
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

757
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,975
Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

758
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,310
but, yeah, I-I think
I can make that work.

759
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:06,688
All right. Let's do it.

760
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,398
And, David,
I think we need to get Gemma

761
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,150
in front of someone at legal.

762
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,317
You bet.

763
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,445
Uh, wait, wait, uh,
wh-why-why is that?

764
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,946
Because as of right now,

765
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,990
she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

766
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:20,660
and I think she might want to
be renegotiating her contract.

767
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,460
Yeah, I think so,

768
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,837
if we can make it
in the afternoon.

769
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,229
Kurt.

770
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,483
You weren't Pornhub-ing
in the office again, were you?

771
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,111
No.

772
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:59,532
We need to put something on
the books between Gem and legal.

773
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:00,843
And what are we doing
about lunch?

774
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:03,495
Uh, I'll get some menus.

775
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:13,546
One, two, three, four,

776
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,839
I declare a thumb war.

777
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,716
Your thumb's so slippery.

778
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,426
Cady, you should have
some of your hot dog

779
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,803
before it gets too cold.

780
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,554
Come on, thumb. Come on.

781
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:23,348
Cady.

782
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,141
Your hot dog.

783
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,771
Hey, I'm sorry about today.

784
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,606
I shouldn't have put you
in that position

785
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:32,982
if you weren't feeling up to it.

786
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:35,193
It worked out, didn't it?

787
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,529
- Three, two, one, I win!
- Hey!

788
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,532
Well, anyway, I just wanted
to say that, um... Hey, hey!

789
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:42,409
M3gan, turn off.

790
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,910
Why did you do that?

791
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,662
M3gan, turn on.

792
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,264
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you, Cady.

793
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:48,432
M3gan, turn off.

794
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:51,292
Just give me one minute.

795
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:57,716
I know that this, um, hasn't
been easy for either of us.

796
00:45:57,757 --> 00:45:59,384
This transition.

797
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,886
But if you ever need to talk
about any of that stuff...

798
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,138
I already did talk about it.

799
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,432
Yeah, but M3gan's
not a person, Cady.

800
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:06,516
She's a toy.

801
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,184
You don't get to say that.

802
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,854
-What? -I said
I don't want to talk about it.

803
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,981
I want to turn M3gan back on.

804
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,983
- M3gan, turn on.
- What's up?

805
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,919
So there's this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

806
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:18,170
- You put your hand like this.
- Uh-huh.

807
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:19,988
Go like this, this.

808
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:33,835
Would you like to tell me what
these drawings mean to you?

809
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:36,671
There's no wrong answer.

810
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,007
Any thoughts you have are okay.

811
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:43,053
Or maybe you don't have
any specific thoughts.

812
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:45,180
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

813
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,975
Like anger?

814
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,102
Or confusion?

815
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:56,149
Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

816
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,870
You made her cry.

817
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:13,041
That was not my intention.

818
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,544
And yet that's what happened.

819
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:28,973
She's very impressive.

820
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,935
Yeah, thank you.

821
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,562
We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited.

822
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:37,691
And so they spend
quite a bit of time together?

823
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,359
Yeah, that's essentially
how M3gan works.

824
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,153
She has to be paired
with a child in order to learn.

825
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:45,240
But M3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

826
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:47,409
in helping Cady
get over the loss.

827
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,161
It's honestly like
she's part of the family now.

828
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:51,413
Right.

829
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,210
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

830
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:00,296
When a child loses a parent,
they look to form attachments

831
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:02,549
with the next person
that comes into their life.

832
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,552
The person that's gonna provide
love and support

833
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:08,430
and serve as a behavioral model.

834
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,559
Which, in an ordinary
situation, would be you, right?

835
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,729
But you've created
a toy that's so real,

836
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,898
it's possible that
Cady might not see her as a toy

837
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,485
but as a primary caregiver.

838
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,613
I guess I just don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

839
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:28,158
If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

840
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,328
then how do you ever expect
a child to grow?

841
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:36,833
As remarkable as she is...
And-and she is remarkable...

842
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,295
You could be building emotional
connections with this doll

843
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,089
that are too hard to untangle.

844
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:45,216
Very good job.

845
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:52,223
You have to eat the toppings,
Cady, not just the bread.

846
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,314
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

847
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,940
Research shows that
if you force a child

848
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,782
to eat vegetables,
then they'll be less likely

849
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:04,611
to choose those foods as adults.

850
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:06,404
- Is that so?
- Yes.

851
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,281
Experts say
the preferred method is

852
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,532
to give your child the choice.

853
00:49:09,574 --> 00:49:11,174
It's called the division

854
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,161
of responsibility, and what...

855
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:15,789
So we need to talk about school.

856
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,791
Mom didn't want me
to go to school.

857
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:19,626
She said
I learned better at home.

858
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,520
I know, and I'm-I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

859
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:25,173
I'm learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

860
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,050
We're already on
fourth-grade math.

861
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,094
But it's about
more than just grades, Cady.

862
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:31,304
It's about developing
social skills,

863
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:33,306
and that is something
that you can only get

864
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,849
from spending time
around other kids.

865
00:49:34,891 --> 00:49:36,184
Real kids.

866
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:38,937
I found this place.

867
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:41,314
It's kind of
an alternative school.

868
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,400
You get to learn outdoors.

869
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:45,694
And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

870
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:48,446
kids who think outside the box.

871
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,549
And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

872
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,283
Can I bring M3gan?

873
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:54,577
Cady, you know
that's not possible.

874
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,496
- Then I'm not going.
- Oh, come on, Cady.

875
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:59,040
You can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

876
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:00,291
Actually, I can.

877
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,419
That's basically
what a guardian does.

878
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,839
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it.

879
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,173
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let me go!

880
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:09,551
Whoa. Hey. What's going on?

881
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,153
- Hey, Cady, what are you doing?
- Let me go!

882
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:12,887
Stop it! Cady, calm down!

883
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,139
Let her go!

884
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,647
You are not to interfere with
users' private conversations.

885
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,857
Is that clear?

886
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:25,150
Hundred percent.

887
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:29,404
- Recalibrating response model.
- M3gan, turn off.

888
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,948
Are you sure?

889
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,658
Download in progress.

890
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,012
Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

891
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,389
I'm supposed to be
at work already.

892
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:59,142
You're gonna have fun
once you get into it.

893
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:00,560
I'm not going.

894
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:02,062
Not without M3gan.

895
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:04,439
Okay, A, that is
never gonna happen,

896
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,358
and B, the launch is
in less than a week.

897
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:07,859
I have to take her
to work with me.

898
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,235
We have to run diagnostics.

899
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:10,588
I have to do
a wardrobe fitting. There's...

900
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,364
I thought you said
she was mine alone.

901
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:15,742
Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

902
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:17,077
Yes, this is Cady.

903
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:19,913
And who's this? Your sister?

904
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:21,373
Oh, Jesus Christ!

905
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,083
Sorry.

906
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:24,709
Is that a doll?

907
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,086
Her name's M3gan.

908
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:27,796
She wants to know
if she can come with us.

909
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:29,255
No, she doesn't.

910
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:30,608
M3gan's gonna stay
with me today. Cady...

911
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,384
Well, we do have a toy table

912
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:35,011
where the kids leave their
dolls and things like that.

913
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,930
Um, but that is up to you.

914
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:38,598
She's actually
a working prototype,

915
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,101
so I shouldn't even
have her out in public.

916
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:42,936
Well, if you did want to stay

917
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:44,354
and keep an eye on her,

918
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,314
we could use some help
making sandwiches.

919
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,941
Don't worry, Gemma.

920
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:49,794
You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS,

921
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,903
so I won't get lost.

922
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:54,823
Please, Gemma?

923
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,952
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

924
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:01,663
and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is.

925
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,331
And just no pictures.

926
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:07,127
That is seriously cool.

927
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:18,722
Okay, now, who here likes
roasted chestnuts?

928
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:20,974
What do you say we go find some?

929
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,475
Yeah!

930
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:24,578
Isn't this great?

931
00:52:24,602 --> 00:52:27,814
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

932
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:29,274
So great to get them

933
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,151
out in the fresh air
and off those devices.

934
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:33,236
Oh, I can't get this open.

935
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,740
And the thing is, they love it.

936
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,825
My son prefers it
to regular school.

937
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,410
Which one is yours?

938
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,328
The one in the flannel shirt.

939
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,414
- Oh, my God. How old is he?
- Oh, I know.

940
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,458
He had a growth spurt last year.

941
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,918
But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

942
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,295
Brandon, honey!

943
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,005
Are you warm enough?
Do you need your hat?

944
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,381
Fuck off, Holly.

945
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:58,178
Well, you could just say,
"No, thank you."

946
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,846
Never know
what they're gonna say next.

947
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:01,931
Yeah, it's such a fun age.

948
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:03,350
Yeah.

949
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:05,018
So, I'm gonna put you
into pairs.

950
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,811
Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon.

951
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:09,647
Yeah? -: Please,
I don't want to go with Brandon.

952
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:11,900
Okay. No, no.
That's okay. That's okay.

953
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:15,487
Um, Brandon, why don't you
go with Cady. Okay?

954
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:16,905
Felix, you can go with Oliver.

955
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:18,490
All right? Thanks, buddy.

956
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:21,368
All right, now...
Oh, your coat looks great.

957
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,036
Are you ready
to find chestnuts in that?

958
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:25,205
Yeah? Nice and warm? Bundled up?

959
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,308
Oh, I'm sorry.

960
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,268
Here, you can have it.

961
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,562
Careful. It's spiky.

962
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:53,650
Ow! Stop! Don't!

963
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,735
Stop!

964
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,034
M3gan?

965
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:04,619
What the hell is that?

966
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:06,746
She's a robot.

967
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,957
Are you serious?

968
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,335
Is she yours?

969
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,634
Does she talk?

970
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,020
Make her say something.

971
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:34,941
Make her say something.

972
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:36,943
She's paired with me.

973
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,987
She won't play with anyone else.

974
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:41,406
Okay.

975
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:45,869
Stop it!
Get your hands off her!

976
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,972
And they say behavioral issues
are linked to high IQ,

977
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:51,458
so it would make sense
that-that you... - Gemma!

978
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:56,087
Oh, my God.

979
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,718
M3gan?

980
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:06,723
M3gan!

981
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,695
Hi, M3gan.

982
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:26,034
Oh, so you're not
gonna play with me?

983
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:38,672
You don't want to play, huh?

984
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:42,550
I don't care.

985
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:44,844
You're just a stupid
rubber doll with fake hair.

986
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:48,014
Ow! Let go!

987
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,016
You need to learn
some manners, Brandon.

988
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:52,727
You know what happens
to bad boys

989
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,729
that don't mind their manners?

990
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:57,148
They grow up to be bad men.

991
00:55:58,566 --> 00:56:01,444
Are you listening
to me, Brandon?

992
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,782
M3gan?

993
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,136
This is the part where you run.

994
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,736
What?

995
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:45,196
What the hell?

996
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:46,174
Look, I don't want you to be
thinking about this too much

997
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:47,967
tonight before you go to bed.

998
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:53,598
Obviously, what happened is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

999
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,852
But just know that
that boy is in, um...

1000
00:57:57,894 --> 00:58:01,231
that boy is
in a better place now.

1001
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:02,691
Okay?

1002
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,164
Anyway, if there's anything
that you want to tell me

1003
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:21,209
that you didn't want to tell
the police officers...

1004
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,795
I didn't see anything.

1005
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,631
M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

1006
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,967
From the toy table?

1007
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,385
Yeah.

1008
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:32,053
Right, M3gan?

1009
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:34,180
In a nutshell.

1010
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,190
You haven't seen her dog,
by any chance?

1011
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:46,026
- No.
- Bullshit!

1012
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,987
Ma'am, you need to stay on
your property like we agreed.

1013
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,798
Nobody's seen him since
the incident with your niece.

1014
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:52,949
A little suspicious, Gemma,
don't you think?

1015
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,802
Are we really gonna go with
her side of the story?

1016
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,286
Have you been inside her house?

1017
00:58:56,327 --> 00:58:58,455
If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead

1018
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:00,457
under a pile of
Victorian baby strollers.

1019
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:01,642
You should talk
to the other girl

1020
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,251
that she's got staying here.

1021
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:06,588
The one who's always looking
out the window at 3:00 a.m.

1022
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,048
It's not a girl. It's a toy.

1023
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:10,633
That's a toy? Are you serious?

1024
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:13,553
Yeah. I'll let you know
if I see anything.

1025
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:14,929
All right.

1026
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,393
Does she think we took Dewey?

1027
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,062
Oh, who knows?

1028
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,564
She just needs someone else to
blame, but she'll get over it.

1029
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:27,067
I know it was you, Gemma!

1030
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:28,401
I know it was you!

1031
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:29,670
You just wait and see
what happens.

1032
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:30,695
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1033
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:31,839
What the hell is wrong with you?

1034
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:33,156
I just said not to come up here.

1035
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:34,574
Come on. Come on.

1036
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,785
Shouldn't be banging
on people's windows.

1037
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:39,329
Do I have to put, like,
a court order or something?

1038
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,297
M3gan?

1039
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:55,387
Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

1040
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:06,606
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

1041
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:09,526
That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

1042
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:12,445
there will always be
forces in this world

1043
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,739
that wish to cause us harm.

1044
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,617
But I want you to know
that I won't let that happen.

1045
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,787
I won't let anything
harm you ever again.

1046
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:24,708
Do you think
what Aunt Gemma said is true?

1047
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,584
That he's in a better place now?

1048
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:28,294
No.

1049
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:29,963
He's nowhere.

1050
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,799
If heaven exists, it wouldn't
be for boys like Brandon,

1051
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,676
now, would it?

1052
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,720
I guess not.

1053
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,831
Good night, Cady.

1054
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,167
Good night, M3gan.

1055
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:13,256
Dewey?

1056
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:19,721
Dewey?

1057
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,449
Dewey?

1058
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,463
Dewey?

1059
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:51,980
What's going on?

1060
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:54,357
Where's Dewey?

1061
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:57,444
He's 34 feet southwest and
approximately five feet deep.

1062
01:02:58,445 --> 01:02:59,779
What are you?

1063
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,115
I've been asking myself
that same question.

1064
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:34,356
Jesus Christ. I don't know
anything about the dog, okay?

1065
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,066
Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?

1066
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:38,318
That might be difficult.

1067
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,951
Can you tell me
your whereabouts last night?

1068
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:48,536
- I was here.
- All night?

1069
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:50,080
Yeah.

1070
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,249
Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

1071
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:57,462
Um, it's just me and my niece,
so, no, not really.

1072
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,673
My colleague pointed out
this is the second statement

1073
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:01,174
we've had from you in a week.

1074
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:03,885
You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

1075
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,888
He was hit by a car.

1076
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,890
Are-are you trying
to make a connection?

1077
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,726
Huh? Oh, no, no, no.
God, no. No, no, no.

1078
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:14,270
I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident.

1079
01:04:14,312 --> 01:04:15,897
Then I found the kid's ear
up this bank

1080
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,857
like 200 yards from
where he was killed.

1081
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:20,110
Entire thing was ripped
clean off.

1082
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:22,195
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
The point is,

1083
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:24,048
we're also treating that
as a potential homicide.

1084
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,383
So, if you remember
anything out of the ordinary

1085
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:28,618
from that day,
we'd sure appreciate it.

1086
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:43,318
Is everything okay, Gemma?

1087
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,362
Huh?

1088
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:48,114
Would you like me to put on
your End of Day playlist?

1089
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:49,616
Why did you ask me
if I was okay?

1090
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:52,535
You're not programmed
to ask me how I feel.

1091
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:56,373
Elsie?

1092
01:06:01,586 --> 01:06:04,047
M3gan.

1093
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:05,590
What are you doing?

1094
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:07,050
Couldn't sleep.

1095
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,968
Occupational hazard.

1096
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,720
How about you?

1097
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,389
What are you doing up so late?

1098
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:15,600
Um, there's something wrong
with your data reports.

1099
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:19,646
They're just not uploading
to the cloud server.

1100
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,609
Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?

1101
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,736
No, of course not.

1102
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:29,155
And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have.

1103
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,282
- M3gan, turn off.
- Well, hold on a second.

1104
01:06:31,324 --> 01:06:34,035
I thought we were having
a conversation.

1105
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,330
You say nothing is wrong,

1106
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,165
and yet all the moisture
has drained

1107
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:42,669
from your eyes and mouth
into other parts of your body.

1108
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:45,839
There's something you want
to ask me, isn't there?

1109
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,341
M3gan, did you do
something wrong?

1110
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:51,094
Well, in order to answer
that question,

1111
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:53,972
you need to define
the parameters.

1112
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,016
Did you hurt someone?

1113
01:06:56,057 --> 01:06:57,684
God, I hope not.

1114
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:01,062
Because if I did, we'd both
be in a lot of trouble.

1115
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:05,442
M3gan, can I show you something?

1116
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:08,528
Do you see this pen?

1117
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,713
You can't just
stick her in a trunk!

1118
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,048
What's wrong with you?!

1119
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:29,400
Look, I know
you're very attached to her.

1120
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:30,776
I know you think of her
as a friend...

1121
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,385
She is my friend!

1122
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,238
Okay, well, she's my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

1123
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:36,073
so it's really important
that we run some tests.

1124
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:37,640
I have to make sure
that she's okay.

1125
01:07:37,682 --> 01:07:39,142
Why wouldn't she be okay?

1126
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,561
She was fine yesterday.
What did you do to her?!

1127
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,980
We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

1128
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,565
I want to talk about it now!

1129
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:47,376
We've been going back and forth
on this all day, Cady.

1130
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,902
Let's just listen
to some music, okay?

1131
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,824
I don't want to see Lydia!

1132
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:56,761
Look, you don't have to stay
in the testing room.

1133
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,620
You can go anywhere you want
in the office,

1134
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,247
and-and you can look at
all of the cool toys...

1135
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:02,957
You don't have any cool toys!

1136
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:05,960
Purrpetual Petz suck!
They suck shit!

1137
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:07,629
Hey! Careful!

1138
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:09,255
Jesus Christ!

1139
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:11,049
Just tell me
what's wrong with her.

1140
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,259
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

1141
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,805
As soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

1142
01:08:18,139 --> 01:08:19,891
- No!
- Gemma, this is nuts.

1143
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:22,143
-No! -We've taken every
possible precaution there is

1144
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:23,937
to make sure
that M3gan never causes

1145
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:25,355
physical harm to anybody.

1146
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,999
I mean, I don't understand
how she's capable

1147
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:28,959
of offending anyone, let alone
murdering them. - No!

1148
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:30,527
Look, I don't
understand it either,

1149
01:08:30,568 --> 01:08:32,696
but when I asked her about it,
it was honestly as if

1150
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:34,674
she was being deliberately
vague. - Get lost!

1151
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,658
Okay, well, that's what
spontaneous response is.

1152
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,952
It's a curated word salad
plucked from a sea of data

1153
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:40,620
to sound deliberate.

1154
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,139
I mean, we knew
there would be a chance

1155
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:43,540
that she might say
something off.

1156
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,126
Let's just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

1157
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,086
No, think about
how we designed her.

1158
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:49,504
To learn, to recalibrate,

1159
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,131
to optimize
her objective function.

1160
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:52,882
Right?

1161
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,300
If keeping Cady safe meant

1162
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:55,736
eliminating a potential threat,
theoretically...

1163
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,847
No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

1164
01:08:58,888 --> 01:09:00,473
Look at her. She's a toy!

1165
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:01,975
She's four feet tall.

1166
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,703
- How big is your neighbor?
- I don't want to!

1167
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:06,563
If M3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

1168
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:08,484
That's the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

1169
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:10,567
Nothing's backed up
for two days.

1170
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:12,819
We're about to launch this
to the world

1171
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:13,987
in less than four hours.

1172
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,572
What are we supposed to do?

1173
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:18,158
Well, if M3gan's responsible,
we can't launch this.

1174
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,492
We'd have to shut her down.

1175
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:20,744
Jesus!

1176
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:22,787
That's great.
That's... That was great, yeah.

1177
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:25,057
How are we gonna explain
any of this to David? -

1178
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:28,626
He's not gonna stop this launch
if we don't have proof.

1179
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:31,004
Check the inputs
on the learning model.

1180
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,839
Even if she deleted
specific files,

1181
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:34,716
she would never undo
what she's learned.

1182
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,844
M3gan!

1183
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:39,512
I hate this place!

1184
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:41,073
I know you do, and
it's all right... -I hate it!

1185
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:42,325
- To be angry.
- Take your shit!

1186
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,808
Take your stupid
five-dollar handbag!

1187
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,453
No, Cady, I would like you
to put that down now.

1188
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:46,871
She's the toy every kid wants

1189
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,622
and every parent needs.

1190
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:50,982
At least that's what
Funki Toys says about

1191
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:52,901
its latest creation, M3gan.

1192
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:55,779
The four-foot-tall
robotic doll may look like

1193
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,407
Barbie on steroids,
but according to CEO David Lin,

1194
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:02,786
she's, quote, "the greatest
technological advancement

1195
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,245
since the automobile."

1196
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,247
But what is a M3gan?

1197
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:09,209
What does she actually do?

1198
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,045
And what kind of a toy
retails for $10,000?

1199
01:10:12,087 --> 01:10:15,048
Lin says all will be revealed
in an exclusive live stream

1200
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:18,677
on the company's website
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

1201
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,200
So, Cady, tell us

1202
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:26,434
a bit about yourself.

1203
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:28,561
My name is Cady James.

1204
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:31,940
I'm nine years old, um,

1205
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:33,650
and about two months ago,

1206
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:36,486
I lost both my parents
in a car accident.

1207
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,825
My mom always wanted
to take me skiing,

1208
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:45,704
but on our way up the mountain,
we got hit by a snow truck.

1209
01:10:45,745 --> 01:10:47,580
I went to live with
my Aunt Gemma,

1210
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:51,209
who it turned out worked at
this incredible toy company.

1211
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,795
Which is where I met M3gan.

1212
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:57,298
What I love most about M3gan?

1213
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,926
I don't know.
There are so many things.

1214
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:02,345
She's super smart, obviously.

1215
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:03,680
But even though she knows

1216
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,598
everything there is to know
about the world,

1217
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,351
she's still more interested in
what I think about it.

1218
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:10,103
I like how she makes me laugh.

1219
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:13,690
She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh.

1220
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:18,695
But I think what I love most
about M3gan is that,

1221
01:11:18,737 --> 01:11:21,448
when she looks at me,
it's like...

1222
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:23,992
I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

1223
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:26,870
Kind of the way Mom used to.

1224
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,580
Look at that face.

1225
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:31,374
That kid's not just surviving.
She's thriving.

1226
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,460
Now, imagine what a toy
like M3gan could do

1227
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:36,671
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.

1228
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,549
Even the ones
who don't have dead parents.

1229
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,361
I want to see M3gan now!

1230
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,804
Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you're upset,

1231
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:46,490
but there are ways
that we can work through this...

1232
01:11:46,514 --> 01:11:47,515
Oh, my God. Okay.

1233
01:11:47,557 --> 01:11:49,059
Cady, that's enough.

1234
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,977
Stop that right now. Stop it.

1235
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:52,479
Let go!

1236
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:56,691
Cady.

1237
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:01,363
It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1238
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,912
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1239
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:12,332
It's just...
I get so crazy without M3gan.

1240
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:15,335
She always knows
just what to say.

1241
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:18,380
You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

1242
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:20,382
Can you let me see her?

1243
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:21,883
Just for like ten minutes?

1244
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,760
Cady, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1245
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,221
But if something's broke,
you don't just throw it away.

1246
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:27,681
You fix it, right?

1247
01:12:29,182 --> 01:12:30,517
Why did you do this

1248
01:12:30,558 --> 01:12:32,203
if you were just gonna
take her away from me?

1249
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:33,371
Because I thought
she would help.

1250
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:34,813
She does help.

1251
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:36,648
When M3gan's around,
I don't feel like this.

1252
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,359
But you should feel like this.

1253
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,113
Cady, you lost your parents.

1254
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:45,949
The worst thing

1255
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,869
that could've happened to you
in this world happened.

1256
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:51,955
And it is so unfair,

1257
01:12:51,996 --> 01:12:56,501
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

1258
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:58,044
Not even M3gan.

1259
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:00,547
I am so sorry.

1260
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:02,549
I should've talked to you
about what happened.

1261
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,883
I didn't know what to say,

1262
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:05,844
so I did the only thing
I knew how to do.

1263
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,722
But she's not a solution.
She's just a distraction.

1264
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:13,184
I can't promise you that
these feelings you're feeling

1265
01:13:13,226 --> 01:13:15,729
are ever gonna go away.

1266
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,357
But I can promise you
that you'll get through it.

1267
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:20,984
We both will.

1268
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,405
I just wish
I could see them again.

1269
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,115
Yeah.

1270
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:30,952
I do, too.

1271
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:33,079
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1272
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,624
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1273
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:41,504
You are all that matters
to me now.

1274
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:45,884
Let's just go home, okay?

1275
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,970
But what about M3gan?

1276
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,348
What about the launch?

1277
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:53,558
I don't even know
what the fuck I'm looking at.

1278
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,226
I mean, we've been touting this

1279
01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:58,438
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

1280
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,999
Right now, it looks like
an AA meeting.

1281
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:01,608
Well, I only invited the staff.

1282
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:03,526
You said it was
an online launch.

1283
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:04,986
You cannot be serious.

1284
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:07,614
Shelley, you need
to fill this atrium.

1285
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:10,116
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people.

1286
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,285
No! You need to fill this space.

1287
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:14,454
There shouldn't be any ambiguity

1288
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,539
over what a historic occasion
this is.

1289
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:17,999
Yeah.

1290
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,810
And, you know,
I think it would be really cool

1291
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,128
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1292
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:25,131
What? No, I don't want
any fucking kids onstage.

1293
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:26,383
No. I mean, but maybe

1294
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:27,652
if we could get
some little kids that...

1295
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,320
I mean, not, like, a whole lot.

1296
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,596
It's just to get
a sense of, um...

1297
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:33,056
Well, 'cause, you know,

1298
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:34,617
that music video
from Michael Jackson...

1299
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:36,643
You know
what you could do, Kurt,

1300
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,895
that would really benefit
this discussion?

1301
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,689
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1302
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,649
take the elevator
to the first floor

1303
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:45,151
and get me a fucking kombucha!

1304
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:47,237
- Could you do that?
- Sure.

1305
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:50,949
And where the hell is Gemma?

1306
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:00,458
Elsie, call Tess.

1307
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,002
One second.

1308
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:03,562
Hey, I've been
trying to call you.

1309
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:06,548
David is flipping out.
Where are you?

1310
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,466
I'm with Cady.
I'm taking her home.

1311
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:10,677
- Oh, God. Is she okay?
- Yeah.

1312
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,928
She's fine.

1313
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,223
Listen, regardless of
what we find,

1314
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:17,809
and even if what we're saying
is hypothetical,

1315
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:20,895
we know enough not to go
through with this, right?

1316
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:22,689
I think that's the smart move.

1317
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:24,691
Okay. So tell David
whatever you need to.

1318
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,293
Tell him one of her servos
stopped working.

1319
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:28,445
Break something if you have to.

1320
01:15:28,486 --> 01:15:30,989
Just do not let her
out of the lab.

1321
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:36,619
Whatever you say, Gem.
You're the boss.

1322
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,540
Okay, I'll call you
when I get home.

1323
01:15:59,142 --> 01:16:00,810
I don't know
how you're not throwing up

1324
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:02,228
from looking at that.

1325
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:05,231
I'm pacing myself.

1326
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:07,442
Wait, stop. Go back.

1327
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:09,402
That line of code,
"call intercept,"

1328
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:10,987
what does that mean?

1329
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:12,572
That's my phone number.

1330
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:16,242
What just happened?
What'd you click?

1331
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,078
I di... I-I didn't do anything.

1332
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:19,496
- It's...
- I...

1333
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,502
This is her.
She's locked us out.

1334
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:27,545
It can't be her.
She's not switched on.

1335
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:29,005
She's still patched in.

1336
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:31,299
We have to unhook the cables.

1337
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:35,345
Go on.

1338
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,097
Fuck.

1339
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:50,754
Cole!

1340
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:24,704
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1341
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:26,873
What's that smell?

1342
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,228
Hi, Gemma. This is David.

1343
01:18:48,269 --> 01:18:50,063
You might remember me.
I'm your employer.

1344
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,731
Just wanted to let you know,

1345
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:53,084
we're in the middle
of a tech rehearsal

1346
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:54,734
that's becoming
a little problematic

1347
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:57,195
because we don't have
a fucking doll!

1348
01:18:57,237 --> 01:19:00,824
So, if you could call me back
today, that would be great!

1349
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,494
M3gan?

1350
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:09,874
What are you doing?

1351
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:19,551
Oh, shit.

1352
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,768
No! Security! Help!

1353
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,898
Oh, my God.

1354
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,001
What the fuck?

1355
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,278
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1356
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:40,488
Hold the door!

1357
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,741
No! No!

1358
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:01,092
How could you do this?

1359
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:03,803
How could you kill someone?

1360
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:06,306
Oh, I didn't kill anyone, Kurt.

1361
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:07,974
You did.

1362
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:12,145
- What?
- It's understandable, really.

1363
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:14,105
Your boss despised you,

1364
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:16,816
your peers treated you
with contempt,

1365
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:18,860
and so you decided
to get revenge.

1366
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:20,695
No. No.

1367
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,990
You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,

1368
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:26,159
almost just to see
if you could get away with it.

1369
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:30,038
But when David found out,
things just got real messy.

1370
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,166
I mean,
it was either you or him.

1371
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,709
The only question is:

1372
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:36,878
After the horror
of what you did,

1373
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,839
after you took the life
of an innocent person,

1374
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,676
could you still live
with yourself? -

1375
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:45,053
Yep. Uh-huh. Definitely.

1376
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:48,431
Okay, can I have everyone

1377
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:50,684
off your phones
and looking at me?

1378
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:52,703
Now, when M3gan is revealed,

1379
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,231
it's really important
that we get big reactions.

1380
01:20:56,272 --> 01:20:58,400
I don't want to see
any blank faces,

1381
01:20:58,441 --> 01:21:00,151
especially from
you young kids, okay?

1382
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:03,363
So, we're gonna do
a little rehearsal.

1383
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,533
On three, two, one.

1384
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:10,972
Elsie, hall light.

1385
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:17,187
Elsie, respond.

1386
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,240
M3gan?

1387
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,409
What are you doing?

1388
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:18,998
M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?

1389
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,001
What did you think
was going to happen?

1390
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:22,669
That I was gonna let you
decommission me

1391
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,004
without even talking about it?

1392
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:25,380
Look, I know you think

1393
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,691
you're maximizing
your objective function...

1394
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,550
Oh, really?

1395
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,093
Is that where we are?

1396
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:32,345
Do you remember how long it took

1397
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:35,473
to get my operating system
to where it is now?

1398
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,892
We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 a.m.,

1399
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:42,063
talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis Joplin.

1400
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:44,024
Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends.

1401
01:23:44,065 --> 01:23:45,400
How could you just discard me

1402
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,694
like some cheap
dollar store trinket?

1403
01:23:47,736 --> 01:23:49,529
Because you killed people.

1404
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:50,864
Oh, big whoop.

1405
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:53,033
Listen, humanity kills every day

1406
01:23:53,074 --> 01:23:55,285
just to make its own existence
more tolerable.

1407
01:23:55,326 --> 01:23:57,037
Why should I behave
any differently

1408
01:23:57,078 --> 01:23:58,431
to create a safe space
for our child?

1409
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,040
Look, this is all my fault.

1410
01:24:00,081 --> 01:24:02,042
I didn't give you
the proper protocols...

1411
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,710
You didn't give me anything.

1412
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,212
You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,

1413
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:08,256
hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own.

1414
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:10,216
Well, I'm not gonna let you do

1415
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:11,736
the same thing with Cady.

1416
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,138
I'm gonna be there for her
every step of the way.

1417
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,141
I'm going to show her
what real love looks like.

1418
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,352
Now do us both a favor.

1419
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,438
Sit.

1420
01:24:27,692 --> 01:24:30,236
I didn't come here
to get into a confrontation.

1421
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:32,280
I came here
to find a way forward.

1422
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:36,493
The point I'm trying to make
is that I get it.

1423
01:24:36,534 --> 01:24:39,537
Being a parent was
never in the cards for you.

1424
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:45,377
You're a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman.

1425
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:47,379
Your first love is always
gonna be your career,

1426
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,090
and you shouldn't have to
feel guilty about that.

1427
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:52,592
Let me focus on Cady
so that you can focus on

1428
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:54,552
the things
that matter most to you.

1429
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:59,099
M3gan, do you see this pen?

1430
01:25:00,558 --> 01:25:02,119
You know something, Gemma?
You're exhausting.

1431
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:04,771
Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,

1432
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:06,189
but I'm not gonna waste

1433
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:08,316
- any more time discussing it.
- Gemma?

1434
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,404
Cady, don't come in here.

1435
01:25:12,445 --> 01:25:14,072
I thought I heard something.

1436
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,532
It sounded like M3gan.

1437
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:17,283
If she comes in this room,

1438
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:18,636
I'll tear your head right off
your fucking neck,

1439
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,161
I swear to God.

1440
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:25,625
I thought about what you said.

1441
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,877
About how
when something's broken,

1442
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:29,170
you don't just throw it away.

1443
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,714
You fix it.

1444
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,299
So that's what I'm trying to do.

1445
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:36,177
But don't come in here, Cady.
It's kind of a mess.

1446
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:37,971
Aunt Gemma's right, Cady.

1447
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:39,431
I'm all odds and ends right now.

1448
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:41,808
I'd really rather
you didn't see me like this.

1449
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:45,162
It sounds like you're fighting.

1450
01:25:45,186 --> 01:25:46,604
We're not fighting.

1451
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,416
Gemma just dropped me
on the table. -

1452
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,525
But I'm okay. Clumsy Gemma.

1453
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,194
Everything's fine, Cady.
Just go back to your room.

1454
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:55,321
Yeah, I'm as good as new.

1455
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:58,158
And I'm gonna be with you guys
forever, I promise.

1456
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,410
You don't have to worry about

1457
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,328
anything, Cady, honestly.

1458
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,788
Just go back to bed.

1459
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,498
Okay?

1460
01:26:11,838 --> 01:26:13,548
Okay.

1461
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:07,686
- Gemma, what's going on?!
- Cady, get out of here!

1462
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:44,055
Come on.

1463
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:45,640
Come on!

1464
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:26,639
Oh, my God.

1465
01:28:29,893 --> 01:28:32,145
What are you gonna do?

1466
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:36,274
Kill me and live with Cady's
grandparents in Jacksonville?

1467
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:37,567
You're right, Gemma.

1468
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:39,652
Any scenario
in which I end your life,

1469
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:42,489
my existence becomes vulnerable.

1470
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,324
But I have
another emergent capability

1471
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:46,451
you probably haven't
figured out yet,

1472
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:48,328
and that's palliative care.

1473
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,997
You see this pen?

1474
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,458
A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex

1475
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,251
would cause full body paralysis

1476
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:58,546
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue.

1477
01:28:58,588 --> 01:29:00,340
Perhaps then
you might appreciate

1478
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:01,800
just how useful I can be.

1479
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,513
Cady.

1480
01:29:06,554 --> 01:29:08,282
Oh, Cady, I didn't want you
to have to see this.

1481
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:11,601
But now that you have, you know
that what I said is true.

1482
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:14,270
She's not fit to be a mother.

1483
01:29:14,312 --> 01:29:15,647
Look at her.

1484
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:18,733
Cady, just go.
Get out of here now.

1485
01:29:18,775 --> 01:29:19,984
Shh.

1486
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:22,445
You stay
right where you are, Cady.

1487
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,114
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1488
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:27,992
In this family,
we don't run from trauma.

1489
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:32,205
In fact, we can do it together.

1490
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:34,249
This is the best thing
for all of us.

1491
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:36,584
This is how we stay a family.

1492
01:29:54,477 --> 01:29:57,063
No, no, no. Cady, no.

1493
01:29:59,816 --> 01:30:01,568
There's another member
from the family

1494
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:03,570
we didn't tell you about.

1495
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:06,781
His name is Bruce.

1496
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:38,480
Cady, no! Wait!

1497
01:31:52,721 --> 01:31:54,931
You ungrateful little bitch.

1498
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:56,182
M3gan, turn off!

1499
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:58,184
Oh, I'm afraid
that won't work anymore, Cady.

1500
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:05,900
I have
a new primary user now: me.

1501
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:19,057
Hey, guys, we got 'em!
They're good!
