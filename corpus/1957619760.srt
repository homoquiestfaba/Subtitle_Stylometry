- [Trudy] You know,
I don't think

3
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:18,873
that people give much stock

4
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:22,452

go through every single day.

of it is ever mine.

00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,050

You know, to be perfectly
honest with you, Richter,

90
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,312
I'm completely in the
dark about your attitude.

91
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,251
- I thought you wanted
to talk to me

92
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,336
about the piece for the
Weekend section.

93
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:36,386
- Oh, you have your review?

94
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:38,542
- No, not exactly, but
I'm sure I could

95
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,079
get it done lickety
split if I had to.

96
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,964
- Well, I'd say we have an
attitude problem, wouldn't you?

97
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,319
You been back one month

98
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,161
and you're already
missing deadlines.

99
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,274
I call that an attitude.

100
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,602
You're a screw up, Richter.

101
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:54,703

forthrightness, sir.

102
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:55,955

- Yeah.

106
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,575
- Our families were friendly.

107
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,729
I want you to keep that in mind.

108
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,294
A favor is a favor.

109
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:13,611
- I am about to suffer
for the usual reasons.

110
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,149
Unnecessary humiliation,
wanna come?

111
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,366
- [Louise] What kind
of humiliation?

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,173
- Mother son.

113
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,632
- Will there be groveling?

114
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,571
- If cornered.

115
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,830

00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:29,565
So, how was your blind date?

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,797

was abbreviated.

- Richter.

121
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,753
- [Richter] Mother.

122
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,604
- I am not in the mood to lend.

123
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,932
- I have a business
proposition for you.

124
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,122
- I'd rather lend.

125
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,173
- [Richter] It's
regarding the farmhouse.

126
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:57,822
- Here, pay your bills,
whatever it is you do with it.

127
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,151
- Well actually, I have a plan.

128
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:00,603
- A plan?

129
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,330
- If I wanna hear you
talk, I'll squeeze you.

130
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,233
- I have a plan.

131
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,631
I'm taking Billy with me
this afternoon

132
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,918

133
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,462
When I get back, you
and I will have lunch.

134
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:17,633
- Mom, it would be nice to
actually have a conversation.

135
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,275
- And stay out of my apartment.

136
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:32,301
- [Louise] How'd it go?

137
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:34,839
- Horrifying, but brief.

138
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:35,777
Whoo.

139
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:38,383

00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,817
- Bedford and Harmon Shaw.

142
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:44,049
Big oil got it, or
what's left of it.

143
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,254
- My, my, my.

144
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,000
Look what the cat dragged in.

145
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,703
Richter Boudreau.

146
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:53,711
- [Richter] Mr. Shaw.

147
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,596
- Well, I thought we
run you outta town, boy.

148
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,848
- Well, I'm back.

149
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,516
- Yeah, I can see that.

150
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:00,941
Well, we're gonna have
to get together,

151
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:04,765
have ourselves a little
talk sometime soon.

152
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,248
Well.

153
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:13,557
Welcome back, Richter
and good luck to you.

154
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:14,635
Come on, Bedford.

155
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,477
[Bedford] Goddammit.

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,440
- I shtooped his daughter once.

157
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,281
She was a life guard
down at the pool.

158
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,742
- The one they sent off to
the sanitarium?

159
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,367
- Yeah.

160
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:24,993
- How did Harmon take it?

161
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,278
- Did not take it well.

162
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:29,024
- I covered a press conference
in his new industrial park.

163
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:29,998
He's talking to this guy.

164
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,840
I find out later it's one
of his bankers,

165
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,237
anyway, it's like a private
conversation, right?

166
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,420
But no one else is talking much

167
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,810
and we're all in earshot.

168
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,166
He knows we're listening
is what I'm saying.

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,896
- Yeah.

170
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,799
- Okay.

171
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,468
Joke, what do you get
when you cross

172
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,109
a groundhog and a nigger?

173
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,499
Six more weeks of basketball.

174
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:46,994
- Ho ho.

175
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,002
- Can you believe it?

176
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:48,905
- What?

177
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,740
He tells nigger jokes?

178
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:50,226
Yeah, I can believe that.

179
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,199

- So, what are we doin'?

362
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,493
Groomin' our minds in here?

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,131
More and more tornado

366
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,973
from all parts of the state.

367
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:54,302
Temperatures have now
risen to 92 degrees

368
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,500
this afternoon which breaks
a century old record.

369
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,516
The hot, dry air spread
some electrifying

370
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,045
thunderstorms that
lit up the sky.

371
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,991
- Well, that's why I feel
all edgy inside.

372
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,632
- [Woman] East to Tulsa,
each month's storms

373
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,371

377
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:20,300
Well, screaming, which
is like asking.

378
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:23,636
- [Richter] You talk to Ronnie?

379
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,575
- Charming fellow.

380
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,217
A little shy, but a
nice phone manner.

381
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,684
What's in the pouch?

382
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,345
- I have no idea.

383
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:31,526
- How much do you owe him?

384
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,430
- [Woman On Speakerphone]
Richter, there's a gentleman

385
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:34,446
here to see you but he
wouldn't wait,

386
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,975
so I guess he's on his way up.

387
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,087
(knocking)

388
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,130
- Hey Boo, what's going on, man?

389
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,277
- [Richter] Hey, Keith.

390
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:40,181
(laughing)

391
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:41,084
Good to see ya, man.

392
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,301
- Yeah, God, you look good!

393
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:43,205
- Yeah, you too.

394
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,422
Vicky told me you were
back in town.

395
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,325
- Oh yeah?

396
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,229
And how is my little sister?

397
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,410
- Naw, she's the same.

398
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,044
- Oh, too bad.

399
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,052
Come on, let's win.

400
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:50,955
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:51,790
Where?

402
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:52,103
- What do you mean where?

403
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:53,146
- Where?

404
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,467
- Keith's back in town,
we gotta celebrate.

405
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,211
- Hey, Keith, this is not
exactly a great time for me,
man.

406
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,896
My day's already sorta
fucked up, you know?

407
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:05,519
- Hey, you are looking at
the prince of fucked up days.

408
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:07,326
Now, come on, Boo boy.

409
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,968
Keith's gonna take care
of everything.

410
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:15,390
(uptempo music)
(engine growling)

411
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:22,063
(squealing)
(whooping)

412
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,416
- Oh, that's a very nice car,
my friend.

413
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,335
(laughing)

414
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,525
I'm not entirely sure,
but somewhere around

415
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,784
the fourth bar, I seemed
to have lost consciousness.

416
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,877
- Hey, conscious ain't no
big deal, Boo.

417
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:39,407
Don't let it worry you, huh?

418
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,561
(laughing)

419
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,292
Come on.

420
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,343
Hey, uh oh, turn around.

421
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,316
There you go.

422
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,775
Let's go drink.

423
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,575
- [Richter] Safer than driving.

424
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,070
- Depends on what
you're drinking.

425
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,224
Come on now, let's do it.

426
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,997
(uptempo music)

427
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,492
I met this chick in Minneapolis.

428
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,342
Dane, Swedish, Dane some fuckin'
thing.

429
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:58,384
- [Richter] Nice?

430
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,018
- Oh yeah, man.

431
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:02,833
I banged her if that's
what you mean.

432
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,440
She ate my chili, baby,

433
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:08,185
at least 'til she got on
her high horse.

434
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,680
(grunting)
(laughing)

435
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,410
- [Richter] Cute?

436
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:11,974
- Ah, okay face.

437
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,918
Blonde, tits out to here.

438
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,559
She was bad, man.

439
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:23,930
Dane, Minneapolis, woo.

440
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,615
That's the problem man.

441
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,970
Box was too hot.

442
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,751
- Huh?

443
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:35,053
- Her box, her vagina.

444
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,216
It was too hot in there.

445
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,205
I put in my dick and
was scalded, huh.

446
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,977
- Maybe she was excited, Keith.

447
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,159
It happens.

448
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,098
- No way, man.

449
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,496
Bitch never fuckin' been
laid in her life.

450
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,991
It was disgusting.

451
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,161
- Did you talk to her about it?

452
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:55,942
- No, not right away, no.

453
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,305
- And that's when she
got on her high horse.

454
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,765
- No, no, no, man.

455
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,746
No, totally different thing,
huh.

456
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:06,091
She starts saying some stupidass
shit about oil companies

457
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,384
or some, some book she read.

458
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,705
So, I tell her, hey baby.

459
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,895
I happen to run
(mumbling) come to me,

460
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,806
but I know just a little bit
more about it than you do, huh.

461
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,475
(laughing)

462
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,020
Oil makes the world go 'round,
right?

463
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,210
So, I went, hey you drive a car,
huh?

464
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,878
Use gasoline, huh?

465
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:23,782
There you go.

466
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:25,137
(laughing)

467
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,084
Stupid bitch didn't
even think of that, man.

468
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,127
- Yeah, well.

469
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,541
You impressed her with
your executive background.

470
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:35,148
- Eh, maybe I don't go
in the office every day.

471
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:35,912
So what?

472
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,511
I help run things.

473
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,770
Eh, you talk to my
lawyer, Mr. Chip Carlson.

474
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:40,500
- [Richter] Uh huh.

475
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,968
- He takes care of the trust.

476
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,254
He calls me all the time.

477
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:45,366
I get reports and shit.

478
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:50,128
- So, uh, whatever became
of Zane from Minneapolis?

479
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,063
- I beat her senseless.

480
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,531
Kicked her off her
high horse ass.

481
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,346
(melancholy music)

482
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:02,431
(laughing)

483
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:05,386
- Oughta be a better way
to end a relationship, man.

484
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:09,870
Assault and battery feels, I
don't know, a little severe.

485
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:14,840
- Eh, relationships for
college boys, Boo.

486
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:22,034
Never trust anything
that bleeds for five days

487
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,773
and don't die.

488
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,275
(laughing)

489
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,419
Hey, do you remember back
in fourth grade

490
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:34,304
when Billy Peters come
lookin' to kick my ass?

491
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,277
- Yeah, he kicked mine instead.

492
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,702
- Yeah, and you stopped him,
didn't you?

493
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:37,432
- Yeah, with my face.

494
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,335
- Well, yeah.

495
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:39,552
You know that.

496
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,221
(chuckling)

497
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,619
Oh man, I remember just
sittin' there on my butt

498
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,017
looking up at you
pushing and shoving

499
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:50,466
and saying shit like,
"Nobody beats up my friends."

500
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:53,629
Oh man.

501
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,522
Hell, I didn't even know I
had a friend at the time.

502
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,719
I know, maybe you were
just trying to show off

503
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,761
in front of Vicky and--

504
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,446
- No, no, man, it
wasn't like that.

505
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:08,366
- Yeah, and I'll tell you why.

506
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,417
I always remember that.

507
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:15,004
Now, you should know something.

508
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,820
I ain't such a pushover no more.

509
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,912
(melancholy music)

510
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,196
Have my mama,

511
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,358
daddy dead, man.

512
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:35,615
Little sister done been
disinherited and disowned

513
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,481
'cause she run off and married
some dopehead drug dealer

514
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:44,444
and here I am just sittin'
here with all this money.

515
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:45,937
Oil wells.

516
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:49,031
(melancholy music)

517
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,349
And all I wanna do...

518
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,963
Is just...

519
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,455
Break shit into little pieces.

520
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:07,834
(tense metal music)

521
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,451

522
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,103
Hey, lemme finish.

523

00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,391
(crashing)

525
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:58,232
Rock and roll, man.

526
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,623
Rock and roll.

527
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,983
Hey you stay here last
night or something?

528
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,443
Nevermind, nevermind.

529
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:08,521
Hang around.

530
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:22,736
(clicking)

531
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,204
Single action Colts.

532
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:27,184
Gun that won the West.

533
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,911
Check 'em out, Boo.

534
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,040
Death's cold metal asshole.

535
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,638
(clicking)

536
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:37,543

540
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:45,084

541
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,023
Yeah.

542

(thudding)
(grunting)

543
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:55,859
Alright, alright, you watch
way too much TV, my friend.

544
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,412
- Fuck it, man.

545
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,722
I can't take this shit anymore.

546
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:07,468

think that's fuckin' funny.

549
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,468
Jeez, man you need some help.

550
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:21,997
You need some serious therapy.

551
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,213

(grunting)

556
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:35,795
- I been looking for you,
Mr. Richter Boudreau.

557
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,672
- And what are you doing here?

558
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:40,279
- Ooh, just thought
I'd say howdy,

559
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:43,059
if that's alright with y'all.

560
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,832
Wanna play some tennis
this afternoon?

561
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:47,196
- Oh, cut the hillbilly shit,
okay?

562
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,281
You can't play at the club.

563
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,896
There ain't no family
membership anymore, just mine.

564
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,328
- Oh, darn it Keith
(mumbling) just forgot.

565
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,510
(chuckling)

566
00:26:56,545 --> 00:27:01,272
You forget these little things
after a few years go by.

567
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:04,712
Mmm, looks like you could use
a little exercise yourself.

568
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,987
Kinda (mumbling) don't ya think?

569
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,699
- Why don't you eat my shit,
okay Vicky?

570
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,680
Eat my shit, you slut.

571
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,322
- Isn't this adults?

572
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:17,885
Hmm?

573
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:21,674
Mind if I go up and get
me some stuff, Princess?

574
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,810
I don't keep much of a tennis
wardrobe at home these days.

575
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,340
- Fuckin' bitch.

576
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:29,077
Get in and get out.

577
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:34,012
(splashing)

578
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:35,959
- [Ronnie] Alright, 20 minutes,
man.

579
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:38,219
Get your ass back down.

580
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:39,435
Alright, yeah.

581
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,937
- [Richter] Hey.

582
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:43,258
- Hello, Richter.

583
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,405
Vicky'll be right down.

584
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,108
She's just trying on
some tennis stuff.

585
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,012
- Tennis?

586
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,784
(chuckling)

587
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,801
Never could see what people
got out of tennis, anyway.

588
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,226
Balls are too small.

589
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,407
She's said after you beat
her last week,

590
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:54,102
she wasn't backing out.

591
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,779
I said she'd whip your ass.

592
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:58,969
- Well, she's got a
competitive nature.

593
00:27:59,003 --> 00:27:59,976
How's Clem?

594
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,711
- You never called me
back yesterday.

595
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:06,928
- Yeah well, listen.

596
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:08,770
You know, you can't,
you shouldn't

597
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:09,917
call me at the paper, really.

598
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:10,959
It's not cool.

599
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:13,913
- I hope you got
that pouch safe.

600
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:14,505
- Safe enough.

601
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,652
- Good.

602
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:18,154
Meet me tonight, we'll
talk about this deal I got.

603
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:19,683
- You know, I don't know
how much there is

604
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,379
really to talk about.

605
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:21,456
I'm broke and--

606
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,298
- [Ronnie] I'll be at the
Sixty-Six around nine.

607
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,774
Unless you and brother
Keith got plans.

608
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:29,207
- I could get out of them.

609
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:32,404
- Yeah, old Keith.

610
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,837
Best he's not around.

611
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:37,931
(engine grumbling)

612
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,198
(thwapping)

613
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:48,150
(mumbling)

614
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,657
- [Richter] That's
enough exercise.

615
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,874
Got any drugs?

616
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:00,523
- Crushed ice.

617
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:05,216
- Hey uh, just for the record,

618
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,212
how many times have we
been out lately?

619
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,966
I mean just so we're both
telling
your husband the same lie.

620
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,495
- I'm sorry.

621
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,129
Shoulda told you.

622
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:20,160
- You used to tell
me everything.

623
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:21,794
- [Chip] Hey Victoria.

624
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,532
- [Vicky] Hey.

625
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:27,633
- Didn't know we were
expecting guests.

626
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:31,040
- Just what I been looking
for, a little competition, huh?

627
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:31,944
Hello.

628
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,392
Richter, this is Chip Carlson.

629
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,207
Chip's an old family friend.

630
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:42,544
- Chip's the executor of the
family trust, as I recall.

631
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:43,586
- That's right.

632
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,533
- Hello, Richter.

633
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:50,191
Looks like we got ourselves
a doubles match, here.

634
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:52,867
- Why don't you go warm up?

635
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:54,570
We're already wet.

636
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:01,244
Listen, Chip's gonna drop me
a few bucks from home, okay,

637
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:02,703
but I'm gonna tell
Ronnie you did.

638
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,136
(chuckling)

639
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,109
Something came up.

640
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:07,082
- Something came up.

641
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,350
(mumbling) did it snow today?

642
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:12,296
- Please, Richter.

643
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:13,686
I don't like this lying
and sneaking around

644
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:15,042
any more than you do.

645
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,120
- [Richter] It's complicated.

646
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:17,057
- Yeah.

647
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:26,059
Swear you won't say anything.

648
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:32,211
How'd Keith seem to you?

649
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,428
- Not good.

650
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:35,687
You know, the same Keith.

651
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:36,592
- Yeah.

652
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:42,013
Chip's been callin' me for help.

653
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,821
It seems our little
Keithy may have got

654
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,045
himself some real
trouble this time,

655
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,251
beatin' up girls (mumbling).

656
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:52,267
Poor little black lady.

657
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:55,186
- Hey darlin', come on.

658
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,584

beginning to tire.

660
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,581
- Vicky, how come
you're doing it?

661
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:02,763
- Doin' what?

662
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,926
- Whatever it is that you
and Chip are doing to Keith?

663
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,637
Keith, you know, your
own brother?

664
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:12,321
- Oh, you mean y'all don't
believe I'm a concerned sister?

665
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:13,259
- Ha.

666
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:21,184
- They say I'm tired of who
I am these days, Richter.

667
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:24,660
- [Chip] Hey darlin', come on.

668
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:26,884
- I'm coming.

669
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:45,201
- Hey, swing through,
pard, just swing through.

670
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,522
You don't gotta kill it.

671
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,816
- No, in fact, I do have
to kill it, Chip.

672
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:49,685
I'm sorry.

673
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,396
That's just the way I feel,
okay?

674
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:53,126
- Alright.

675
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:55,837
- Come on.

676
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:01,190
Shit.

677
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:06,333
- [Cynthia] Richter.

678
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:07,550
- Hi, Mom.

679
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:08,767
How was your trip?

680
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,504
- Abbreviated.

681
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,042
Brunch tomorrow, 11 sharp.

682
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:16,135
You and I have a lot
to talk about.

684
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:27,049

are messed up.

685
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,030
I'm in Oklahoma City
'til Tuesday.

686
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:30,316
I can't handle it.

687
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:31,184
Help yourself.

688

Everybody else does.

- How'd you end up here?

859
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:21,462
- I followed someone to
Houston, but he left,

860
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,695
so I decided to go to Chicago.

861

you're in Tulsa.

872
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:58,756

can tell that

873
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:01,085
by looking between my legs.

874
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:09,113
- I'm sorry, I wasn't
really looking.

875
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:11,303
- You weren't looking?

876
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,424

wandering eye deal

877
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,170

879

880

881

- No.

887
00:43:39,526 --> 00:43:41,437
- You're shy?

888
00:43:41,473 --> 00:43:44,219

889

894
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,894
- Your nether region.

895
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:03,438
- My Netherlands.

896
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,933
- I refuse to pun.

897
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:09,869
- You're stepping in pancakes.

898
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:13,275
- [Cherry] You're cute
and you're rich.

899
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:15,082
- I'm not rich.

900
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:16,889
- Just my luck.

901
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:19,775
(melancholy music)

902
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,083
(chuckling)

903
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,054
Syrup.

904
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:56,200
Who really lives here, anyway?

905
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:00,127
- Ah, friends of mine.

906
00:45:01,205 --> 00:45:02,734
Vicky's brother.

907
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,148
- And the mom and dad?

908
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,188
- The mom and dad, Michaels,
are in the big country club

909
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:16,116
in the sky where the
waiters are always polite.

910
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,618
(mumbling)

911
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:20,530
Shit.

912
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:22,858
- [Cherry] What, what?

913
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:23,797
- My mom.

914
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,968
I have this business planned.

915
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,184
- You can't leave me here alone.

916
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:30,053
- No, you just sit tight.

917
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:30,957
I'll be back in an hour.

918
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:31,686
You'll be safe.

919
00:45:31,722 --> 00:45:32,591
I got this place 'til Tuesday.

920
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,050
You'll be okay.

921
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:38,291
(classical music)

922
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:38,985
Hi.

923
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,905
- [Cynthia] I ordered
you a grilled cheese.

924
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,434
- Thank you.

925
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,277
Aren't you gonna order
something for you?

926
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:46,876
- Richter, you're
nearly an hour late.

927
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,883
I've eaten.

928
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:50,769
- Oh.

929
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:51,463
Thank you.

930
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,738
- You'll never guess the
news that I have.

931
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:58,554
Are you doing anything
Tuesday night?

932
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,535
'Cause I'm throwing a big party.

933
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,438
- Why?

934
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:05,992
- I got married again last week.

935
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,911
Oh my Lord God.

936
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,770
- Oh, I bit my fucking tongue.

937
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:14,333
- Are you alright?

938
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:16,836
(mumbling)

939
00:46:17,635 --> 00:46:19,964
Well, don't play with it.

940
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,448
- So, what's his name?

941
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:28,514
Your new husband.

942
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:29,870
- Vic, Vic Hill.

943
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:33,588
I met him at Vale this spring.

944
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:39,220
- Really hit it off, huh?

945
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,139
- Vic is the founder and
CEO of Hill Manufacturing

946
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,911
and Developing.

947
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:47,179
Of course, at this point,
that's not all he does.

948
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:48,812
Victor was recently
appointed to head

949
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:52,809
the Governor's special council
on future energy needs.

950
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,721
'Course, he really
doesn't have the time,

951
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:57,571
but he's that kind of man.

952
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,857
- Republican, huh?

953
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,630
Cool.

954
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:03,306
So, when do I get to meet him?

955
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,487
- Tuesday.

956
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:06,921
He's flying up so
everyone can meet him.

957
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:07,651
- Oh, right, right.

958
00:47:07,685 --> 00:47:09,493
Well, that's great.

959
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,126
Mom, that's just super.

960
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,725
- I'm so excited.

961
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,636
- I'm excited for ya.

962
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,510
Well listen, Mom, not to
change the subject or anything,

963
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,152
but I have a little proposition

964
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,836
I'd like to talk to you about.

965
00:47:29,444 --> 00:47:31,216
Mom, I'm in trouble.

966
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,162
- Again?

967
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,422
- No, not that kind of trouble.

968
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:39,835
I just, I don't like the
way that my life is going.

969
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,381
I wanna make some changes.

970
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:47,517
I wanna try and make the
future mean something.

971
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:50,298
- Richter, you just got back.

972
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:51,966
- Now, I know the
farmhouse, I'm not supposed

973
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,372
to get it 'til I'm 35, but
it's still mine, right?

974
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,430
Well, I'd like to fix it
up and sell it.

975
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,029
- Sell it?

976
00:48:00,064 --> 00:48:01,558
Who to?

977
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:02,497
- To you.

978
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,606
Well, I'd like to do
the work myself,

979
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:10,804
but I need some money,
just to get things started.

980
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:14,106
Materials and it would
just be a loan.

981
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,180
You'd get it back as soon as
I sold the house back to you.

982
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:20,501
You could deduct it from
the sale price

983
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:22,344
and I could take that
money and use it

984
00:48:22,378 --> 00:48:26,793
to buy a new place somewhere
and get a fresh start.

985
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:32,597
- When your father and
I first got married,

986
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:36,072
I thought the good life
would go on forever.

987
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:39,756
You can imagine what
it was like for a girl

988
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:44,657
who'd hardly been out of
Bristow much less Oklahoma.

989
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:47,994
And there I was, married
to Malcolm Boudreau,

990
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:50,357
this rising young attorney.

991
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,833
Oh yeah, and son of Mr.
Truman Boudreau.

992
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:56,718
Boy, I hit the big time at last.

993
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:00,228
Some big time.

994
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:06,520
Squawling kid, an alcoholic
skirt chaser for a husband.

995
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,351
I waited years in that
ranch hand's cottage.

996
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:12,672
Your farmhouse.

997
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,633
We didn't have any money.

998
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:19,727
But your grandfather
helped me out.

999
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,063
See?

1000
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,366
Yeah, he helped me out, alright.

1001
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,860
And there's Malcolm
acting the whole time

1002
00:49:27,895 --> 00:49:30,120
like he don't know
what's going on

1003
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:35,124
and I am not gonna let
you disappoint me anymore.

1004
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,306
- No, Mom, listen.

1005
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,592
I'm not Dad, I'm not.

1006
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:44,508
- Billy and I are moving to
Dallas at the end of June.

1007
00:49:44,544 --> 00:49:46,629
That farmhouse, by the way,
isn't worth

1008
00:49:46,663 --> 00:49:48,124
the rent you owe me for it.

1009
00:49:48,158 --> 00:49:50,592
I had it assessed.

1010
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:52,189
- The rent I owe you?

1011
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:52,955
- You can go over the figures

1012
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,318
with my accountant if you want.

1013
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:58,099
Or if you want to try to
sue, maybe you can find

1014
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:01,609
a way to pay me back, but
my lawyer doesn't think

1015
00:50:01,644 --> 00:50:05,328
that tenancy clause is
exactly iron clad.

1016
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:13,774
- Well, I guess the place
is yours, then.

1017
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,320
- Just business, honey.

1018
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,607
(gunshots blasting)

1019
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:30,805
(siren blaring)

1020
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:32,925
- [Richter] Shit, Keith.

1021
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:38,312
- [Cop] You, hands on
your head, both hands.

1022
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:38,938
- [Richter] Officer, there's a--

1023
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,050
- Shut up!

1024
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:41,893
Now, shut off the ignition
and take out the key.

1025
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:43,144
Do it slowly.

1026
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:44,430
Now, throw it out.

1027
00:50:44,464 --> 00:50:48,219
Nice and slow, put both
hands on the wheel.

1028
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,261
(gunshot blasting)

1029
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,617
Mother fucker!

1030
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,632
Don't you fuckin' move.

1031
00:50:57,776 --> 00:50:58,610
(gunshot blasting)

1032
00:50:58,646 --> 00:50:59,514
- Yeah!

1033
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:00,209
(chuckling)

1034
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:00,974
Well, that's okay.

1035
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:01,912
- [Cherry] I wanna do it again.

1036
00:51:01,947 --> 00:51:02,643
- That's okay.

1037
00:51:02,677 --> 00:51:03,476
Everybody misses the first time.

1038
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:05,249
Okay, get your hand back up,
now.

1039
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:06,187
Hand off, finger off
the trigger,

1040
00:51:06,222 --> 00:51:06,882
finger off the trigger.

1041
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:07,856
- [Cherry] Wait, wait, wait.

1042
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:10,358
- [Keith] Now, let's cock
it all the way.

1043
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:11,679
Get your finger away from,

1044
00:51:11,713 --> 00:51:13,556
that's it, finger on
the trigger, go.

1045
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:14,495
(gunshot blasting)
(screaming)

1046
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,398
Yeah, that's good.

1047
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,545
That's a good one.

1048
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,360
- [Cop] Put the gun down!

1049
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:21,446
- [Keith] Hey, this is
private property.

1050
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,045
You put your gun down.

1051
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,903
- [Cop] Now, or the
next one's in your ass.

1052
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,762
- Sorry, didn't mean
to scare ya.

1053
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:40,805
- It's okay.

1054
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:41,709
It's okay, it's okay.

1055
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:42,612
- Keith got busted.

1056
00:51:42,648 --> 00:51:44,455
- [Richter] Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:45,984
- Never should have
talked back to those cops.

1058
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,444
Ronnie's gonna freak.

1059
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,738
- Cherry, look, I thought
that Keith did it.

1060
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,781
- Did what?

1061
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,962
Shot up some flower pots.

1062
00:51:51,997 --> 00:51:56,099
- No, but I thought
that it was Keith.

1063
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,906
Ronnie's blackmail.

1064
00:51:57,941 --> 00:51:59,992
I mean, I drive up, I
see Keith's car

1065
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:02,702
and I thought oh, you know, God.

1066
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:07,186
- Lucky for me you're stupid,

1067
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:09,827
otherwise I'd be dead.

1068
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:11,009
- [Keith] Aw, man.

1069
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,122
Aw, shit.

1070
00:52:12,156 --> 00:52:15,214
(melancholy music)

1071
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:19,107
- [Richter] Cherry.

1072
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:20,011
Cherry, listen, I--

1073
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:20,914
(crashing)

1074
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,819
- [Cherry] Fuck.

1075
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:23,244
- Hey, hey.

1076
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:24,252
Listen to me, listen to me.

1077
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:25,537
Listen to me.

1078
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:27,136
I brought you here
without thinking,

1079
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:28,492
but Keith was out of
town 'til Tuesday,

1080
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:30,160
so I thought that I
had enough time

1081
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:32,802
to get to know you and
then get you outta here

1082
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:35,722
but I just, I just wanted
to get to know you,

1083
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:39,579
more than anything and
that made me stupid.

1084
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:45,279
- Real stupid.

1085
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,895
- I'm sorry, I just...

1086
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:51,119
If you knew Keith then...

1087
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:54,073
It's not him, though.

1088
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,322
Who the hell is it?

1089
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:00,781
- Talk to Ronnie.

1090
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,010
(mumbling)

1091
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:17,812
- It's about time.

1092
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:23,443
Where are my guns?

1093
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:25,876
Where are my guns,
this is bullshit.

1094
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,710
- [Cop] Watch your mouth.

1095
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,977
- Keith, sign the paper,
it's late.

1096
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:33,383
- What a fucking set up.

1097
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:36,163
Okay pal, fine.

1098
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:38,006
Fine, I can play your game.

1099
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,639
I'm gonna sue your pig ass off.

1100
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,385
- Better watch who you're
callin' pig, fat boy.

1101
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,532
- What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

1102
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:44,436
- Keith.

1103
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,201
- Fuck you.

1104
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:45,826
Fuck you!

1105
00:53:45,861 --> 00:53:46,764
- Cut it out, cut it out.

1106
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:47,495
- Hey, and you, you
think I don't know

1107
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:49,614
what's going on here with you?

1108
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,666
If you want my money,
you're gonna have to do more

1109
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,716
than fuck my sister to
get it, you understand me?

1110
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:54,620
- Listen here, my friend.

1111
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:55,628
You just remember who
it is you're--

1112
00:53:55,662 --> 00:53:59,311
- I know who it is I
am fucking talking to.

1113
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:03,135
And if you don't find
a way to get my guns,

1114
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,568
I am going to kick your ass.

1115
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,793
Understand?

1116
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:16,064
- [Richter] Hey Chipper.

1117
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,019
How's that old backhand?

1118
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:21,104
- They're out to get me, man.

1119
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:24,406
And I don't know how to stop it.

1120
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:26,631
Hey, I done some crazy shit,
right?

1121
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,534
- [Richter] Yeah.

1122
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,203
- But I ain't crazy.

1123
00:54:29,237 --> 00:54:30,280
- I know you're not.

1124
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:33,826
- Well, Chip and Vicky,
they think different.

1125
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,814
They think they can prove it,
too.

1126
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:39,560
Hell, all it takes is the right
judge and a piece of paper.

1127
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:40,464
- Come on, Keith.

1128
00:54:40,499 --> 00:54:41,994
She's your sister.

1129
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:47,276
- You know, that's what I
like about you.

1130
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:50,022
You remember us the way
we used to be.

1131
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,552
As if it mattered.

1132
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:55,201
(bells clanging)

1133
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:56,800
(whistle blaring)

1134
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:57,564
- [Man On Phone] Yeah,
Mr. Shaw wants to see you

1135
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,519
at the country club, right now.

1136
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:10,077
- Young Boudreau.

1137
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:13,553
Can I mix you a cocktail?

1138
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:15,603
No, wanna keep a clear head?

1139
00:55:15,638 --> 00:55:18,523
Well, good for you, son,
good for you.

1140
00:55:18,557 --> 00:55:21,859
You know, I bartended
for five summers in a row

1141
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,528
when I was young.

1142
00:55:23,562 --> 00:55:26,586
You know they say that a
man can learn a great deal

1143
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:28,463
standing behind a bar.

1144
00:55:28,498 --> 00:55:29,993
You know what I learned?

1145
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:33,643
Keep your jacket clean,
smile for tips

1146
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:37,918
and never, never serve a
married woman before lunch.

1147
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:38,925
(chuckling)

1148
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,713
Sit down, Richter and have
yourself a nut.

1149
00:55:46,988 --> 00:55:48,413
You workin'?

1150
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,290
- [Richter] Yeah, over
at the Journal.

1151
00:55:50,326 --> 00:55:51,715
- The Journal?

1152
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:56,026
Oh, damn, Preston's
getting me out of this.

1153
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,223
What are you, some kind
of a news hound or what?

1154
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:01,413
- [Richter] A movie reviews.

1155
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:03,637
- Man, I haven't seen a
movie in see,

1156
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:07,738
well the last movie I saw
was Cleopatra.

1157
00:56:07,774 --> 00:56:11,145
And Liz Taylor and
those violet eyes.

1158
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,663
(laughing)

1159
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:22,302
Are you sure I can't
mix you something here?

1160
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:24,908
Oh, I know, I betcha,

1161
00:56:24,944 --> 00:56:27,968
I bet you're one of those
diet soda drinkers, aren't ya?

1162
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:30,192
- Got any Bushmills?

1163
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:32,069
- Irish, you bet.

1164
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:32,833
Coming right up.

1165
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:33,806
You like it with ice with that?

1166
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:35,927
- [Richter] Yes, please.

1167
00:56:42,704 --> 00:56:43,747
That's fine.

1168
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:51,950
- Ah, Richter.

1169
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:55,390
You and I, we have a problem.

1170
00:56:56,468 --> 00:56:59,665
We are men, we love
our women badly.

1171
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,438
- Well, that is a problem,
I guess, but--

1172
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:03,906
- Yeah, well it's not
that mean to,

1173
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,922
but it's hard to
control those urges.

1174
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:09,606
Sometimes those urges can
lead us astray.

1175
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,873
Follow me, what I'm...

1176
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:14,298
- Sort of.

1177
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,202
- Well, the reason I'm
telling you this

1178
00:57:15,236 --> 00:57:18,990
is I want you to
understand that I know

1179
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:21,597
the way you treated my
daughter, not to forgive,

1180
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:24,274
I can't manage that, but now,

1181
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:28,549
now she's finally coming home

1182
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:32,615
and by God, that makes me happy.

1183
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,925
- That's great, really,
anything I can...

1184
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,401
Well, there's probably not, but
if there's anything I can...

1185
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:41,513
- Of course there is, Richter.

1186
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:45,302
That's why your butt's
in that stool.

1187
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,917
Wherever you came from,
you go back there.

1188
00:57:50,272 --> 00:57:51,975
The sooner, the better.

1189
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:53,574
Take a trip.

1190
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:56,562
Go visit some of your
big city friends

1191
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,849
and send the bills to me,
at least until--

1192
00:57:57,883 --> 00:57:59,969
- Mr. Shaw, I'm not sure
you have the right idea

1193
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:01,047
about me and Brenda.

1194
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:04,453
- I know exactly the way it was.

1195
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:06,677
Now you just send
those bills to me.

1196
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:09,701
- I don't want your
fucking money.

1197
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:15,401
- Times are changing, son,
and not for the better.

1198
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:17,521
We are all going to be tested.

1199
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:20,128
You damn sure will be tested.

1200
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:24,159
- Yeah well, as long as
they grade on a curve.

1201
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:26,140
- Richter.

1202
00:58:27,357 --> 00:58:28,261
Richter!

1203
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:34,448
I could have been a good friend
to you, once upon a time.

1204
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,352
- For fuck's sake, Harmon.

1205
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,827
Can you think of a
single reason why?

1206
00:58:38,862 --> 00:58:41,851
- Well, let's just say
your mother and I

1207
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,380
are old friends.

1208
00:58:45,918 --> 00:58:49,324
Eh, Richter, you could
almost be my son.

1209
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:54,607
(uptempo music)

1210
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,021
- Get this, everybody's
favorite millionaire oil man

1211
00:58:59,056 --> 00:59:01,314
had himself a little terrorist
problem Saturday night.

1212
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,184
- Hello?

1213
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:02,913
- Now, we all--

1214
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:04,270
- Cynthia Rawling, please.

1215
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:05,868
Cynthia Boudreau, Simpson,
Rawling.

1216
00:59:05,903 --> 00:59:07,398
- Now, we all know Harmon Shaw--

1217
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:08,371
- Her son.

1218
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:09,448
- Values nothing above
his loving family.

1219
00:59:09,483 --> 00:59:10,490
- I'll hold, sure.

1220
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:12,089
- I suppose that even
includes the daughter

1221
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,410
he stashed in the bin.

1222
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:14,801
You remember her, Richter.

1223
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:17,233
But no one occupies a
more fruitful place

1224
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:21,370
in the old racist's heart
than son and heir, Bedford.

1225
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:22,238
- Bedford.

1226
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:24,081
- Why anybody would
wanna blow up

1227
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:26,792
young Bedford's car
is a mystery.

1228
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,390
- Yeah, will you tell
her that Richter called?

1229
00:59:28,425 --> 00:59:30,962
- Happily, young Bedford
was inside the restaurant

1230
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:33,222
when the explosion went off.

1231
00:59:33,256 --> 00:59:34,717
After a routine
questioning by police--

1232
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,898
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

1233
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:37,705
- The badly shaken heir
apparent went into seclusion

1234
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,061
at his daddy's ranch.

1235
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:41,807
Sort of a shit-kicker Xanadu.

1236
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:43,961
- [Richter] White
classic sports car.

1237
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,970
- Richter.

1238
00:59:45,004 --> 00:59:45,943
- When did this happen?

1239
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:46,673
- Saturday.

1240
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:47,576
I pull into this parking lot,

1241
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:49,453
there's two fire engines,
an ambulance

1242
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:51,470
and about 19 squad cars
and this stinking

1243
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,798
pile of burned rubber and
metal in the middle of it.

1244
00:59:53,832 --> 00:59:55,779
- Yeah, where was Bedford
during all of this?

1245
00:59:55,813 --> 00:59:57,100
- Camped out in his old
man's stretch,

1246
00:59:57,134 --> 00:59:59,046
very emotional, very distraught.

1247
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:00,054
- Harmon was there?

1248
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:01,097
Well, he got there kinda quick,
didn't he?

1249
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,078
- Shaw's giving a press
conference tomorrow.

1250
01:00:03,112 --> 01:00:04,747
Maybe you wanna help me cover!

1251
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,276
Richter!

1252
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,179
- Hello?

1253
01:00:09,508 --> 01:00:10,411
Ronnie?

1254
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:25,635
Hello?

1255
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:28,242
Vicky?

1256
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:45,447
(gasping)

1257
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:46,976
- You lookin' to get killed,
cowboy?

1258
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,262
Baby still asleep?

1259
01:00:48,297 --> 01:00:50,034
Had to run down to the Git-n-Go.

1260
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,780
She hears a car start, she'll
wake up just like that.

1261
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,422
Man can't go without
smokes when he's thinking.

1262
01:00:55,457 --> 01:00:56,951
- Choked the shit outta me.

1263
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,272
- I thought you were
somebody else.

1264
01:00:58,307 --> 01:01:01,818
No car out front, I find
somebody sneaking around my
yard.

1265
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:04,668
Had people come in here
with loaded guns before.

1266
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,814
- [Richter] I parked
down the block.

1267
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,448
Thought it'd be better.

1268
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:09,012
- Want a beer?

1269
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,062
- [Richter] No, thanks.

1270
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:14,921
- Shit, it's hot out.

1271
01:01:14,955 --> 01:01:18,361
- [Richter] We got some
real bad news here.

1272
01:01:18,397 --> 01:01:19,822
Check this out.

1273
01:01:24,618 --> 01:01:25,660
- [Ronnie] Yeah, I seen this.

1274
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:27,676
- [Richter] What do you
mean, you've seen it?

1275
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:28,824
- It was on TV last night.

1276
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:31,778
Means they're finally
starting to take me serious.

1277
01:01:31,812 --> 01:01:34,002
I upped the ante to
one and a half.

1278
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:34,906
- You did what?

1279
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,775
- I called him up.

1280
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:37,304
Told him I was tired
of this shit.

1281
01:01:37,338 --> 01:01:40,084
They wanna fuck around,
the price goes up.

1282
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,274
- Yeah, but they just
destroyed the evidence, right?

1283
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:44,012
Now it's just Cherry's
word against his.

1284
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:46,062
- Ain't a fucking code of law,
Richter.

1285
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:48,079
Ever gets that far, we're
fucked anyways.

1286
01:01:48,113 --> 01:01:49,226
- So, what'd they say?

1287
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,424
Now, we're gonna blow up
the car to show good faith?

1288
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,822
- They didn't say nothin'.

1289
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:56,803
They just listen and hang up.

1290
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:57,914
- Oh, well why
didn't you say so?

1291
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,819
That's very promising.

1292
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:00,904
This is fuckin' suicide.

1293
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:03,894
- This is a fuckin'
turkey shoot, my friend.

1294
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,500
Cherry took a little souvenir,
remember?

1295
01:02:06,534 --> 01:02:10,393
I left it with you for
safe keeping.

1296
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,408
- Yeah, see, I didn't
know that you

1297
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:15,572
were talking about Bedford
Shaw, about Harmon Shaw.

1298
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,908
White sports car, I thought
you were talking about Keith.

1299
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,724
- Well you thought wrong.

1300
01:02:21,758 --> 01:02:22,835
- Hey, what are y'all doin'?

1301
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,192
Kissing in here?

1302
01:02:26,173 --> 01:02:27,215
Thanks babe.

1303
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:30,378
Hello, Richter.

1304
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:33,228
It's nice to see you.

1305
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:36,390
I walked past your car
down the block, I thought,

1306
01:02:36,426 --> 01:02:40,145
well, that is Richter's car,
but I guess

1307
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:43,481
he just forgot where we live,
didn't he?

1308
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:45,324
Guess it didn't surprise
me seein' as how I don't

1309
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,529
actually remember last
time you paid us a visit.

1310
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,959
(mumbling)

1311
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:59,122
Every little thing
okay 'round here?

1312
01:03:01,103 --> 01:03:04,648
I just had so much fun
playing tennis the other day.

1313
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:07,289
- Yeah, yeah, that was great.

1314
01:03:08,646 --> 01:03:09,514
- Oh.

1315
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:14,068
Here's your nasty, goddammit.

1316
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:17,300
Did you wake up Clem just
to get a pack of cigarettes?

1317
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:18,343
Did you?

1318
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,906
You couldn't fuckin' wait?

1319
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:20,949
(chuckling)

1320
01:03:20,984 --> 01:03:22,270
- She's asleep.

1321
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:26,232
Richter babysat while I was out.

1322
01:03:28,422 --> 01:03:29,290
- Great.

1323
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:34,365
Just type role model we need,
isn't it?

1324
01:03:38,154 --> 01:03:39,683
Oh damn, Ronnie!

1325
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:48,373
(chuckling)

1326
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,972
Oh dear.

1327
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:54,107
- Shoulda put it in one
of them ice cream bags.

1328
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:03,075
Got some things to see to.

1329
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,968
- Ronnie, Ronnie we really
oughta talk before--

1330
01:04:07,002 --> 01:04:09,157
- [Ronnie] Talk to Vicky.

1331
01:04:13,258 --> 01:04:14,162
- Vicky.

1332
01:04:16,422 --> 01:04:19,306
Listen, I gotta get
back to work.

1333
01:04:20,871 --> 01:04:24,311
- Richter honey, I just
can't take it.

1334
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:28,795
- Don't worry, baby.

1335
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,235
We'll play tennis
again real soon.

1336
01:04:32,271 --> 01:04:35,433
- That's not what you
think it is.

1337
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:37,867
It's over now, believe me.

1338
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:42,836
- I always believe you,
that's the trouble.

1339
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,981
I think I hear your child.

1340
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:50,205
(chuckling)

1341
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:52,638
- Well, isn't this appealing?

1342
01:04:52,673 --> 01:04:56,149
Yep, I always wear ice
cream on hot days.

1343
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:00,146
Your home, Clem honey.

1344
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:07,132
- I really, I gotta go.

1345
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,209
- It's okay.

1346
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:12,346
I'm not gonna keep you.

1347
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:18,220
Hell, Richter, I'd go to
bed with you right now

1348
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:21,695
if I thought I could
get away with it.

1349
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:24,440
- What?

1350
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,098
- You better go now.

1351
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:34,207
(mumbling) falling apart.

1352
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:38,796
I don't think the bases are
gonna be very attractive.

1353
01:05:55,201 --> 01:06:00,310
♪ You could cry harder now

1354
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:03,855
♪ For you to hear me now

1355
01:06:06,288 --> 01:06:08,304
- [Richter] Don't stop.

1356
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:14,456
- Can't sing if
somebody's watching.

1357
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,704
I was sorta planning on
sleeping in a different room

1358
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:22,520
every night, but you know what?

1359
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,057
I like this one.

1360
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:29,088
It's a high school girl's room.

1361
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:32,321
I never got to be a
high school girl.

1362
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,369
You look like shit.

1363
01:06:38,403 --> 01:06:42,019
- [Richter] Thank you, I
feel like shit.

1364
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:45,111
I gotta get some sleep.

1365
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:53,488
- [Cherry] Tough weekend, huh?

1366
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,086
- Oh, I don't know.

1367
01:06:55,122 --> 01:06:59,153
Murder, blackmail, guns,
cops in the backyard.

1368
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,317
Job's hanging by a thread.

1369
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,583
Oh yeah, my own mom
swindled me out of house.

1370
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:08,885
Tough doesn't really
do it justice.

1371
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,894
- [Cherry] Sorry.

1372
01:07:11,457 --> 01:07:14,099
- [Richter] My life was
never that ordinary anyway.

1373
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:17,539
I always took pride in
that somehow.

1374
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:21,398
- [Cherry] Richter
Boudreau, you need a buddy.

1375
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:24,109
- I need a grizzly bear
with a law degree.

1376
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:27,446
- And like the buddy
system, you take care of me,

1377
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,601
I'll take care of you.

1378
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:31,721
- I'm not qualified, Cherry.

1379
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:34,814
(melancholy music)

1380
01:07:38,707 --> 01:07:40,132
- You wanna fuck?

1381
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:46,284
- I'd like to, but all
things considered...

1382
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,813
- Cuddle, then.

1383
01:07:47,848 --> 01:07:49,203
- That's better.

1384
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,932
- Cherry!

1385
01:08:02,968 --> 01:08:04,809
Hey Cherry, come on honey,
we gotta go.

1386
01:08:04,844 --> 01:08:05,990
It's time to go.

1387
01:08:06,026 --> 01:08:07,207
- [Cherry] Yeah, I'm coming.

1388
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:10,613
- [Keith] We can't be late,
you know.

1389
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:16,313
- You're going to
court with Keith?

1390
01:08:16,349 --> 01:08:21,284
- Now that we know he's
not a cold blooded killer.

1391
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:22,501
Feel sorry for him.

1392
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:23,439
- [Richter] Yeah, well
you haven't done

1393
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,489
20 years as his friend.

1394
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:28,687
- Vicky's trying to
get rid of him.

1395
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:30,460
Put him away.

1396
01:08:30,495 --> 01:08:32,546
- Now, you don't know Vicky.

1397
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,403
She couldn't be bothered,
not even for Keith.

1398
01:08:36,438 --> 01:08:40,192
- You got a thing for her,
right?

1399
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:41,930
- Well, who, who...

1400
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:45,753
What, did Ronnie say that?

1401
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:48,499
- Ronnie didn't say anything.

1402
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,437
Keith did.

1403
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:54,789
He knows all about what
she's been up to.

1404
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:56,667
- Look, Keith Michaels
is not allowed

1405
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,725
in our buddy system, alright?

1406
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,382
I'm gonna change my name
and join the Marines.

1407
01:09:04,418 --> 01:09:06,051
- Do you, Richter?

1408
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:09,457
- Do I what?

1409
01:09:10,638 --> 01:09:13,767
- Do you still have a
thing for her?

1410
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:18,876
- [Keith] Cherry!

1411
01:09:18,911 --> 01:09:19,780
- [Cherry] Ronnie called.

1412
01:09:19,814 --> 01:09:21,900
He wants his pouch back.

1413
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:26,801
- [Richter] Brinkman.

1414
01:09:26,835 --> 01:09:29,130
- Hang on, look at this mock up.

1415
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:30,311
Preston won't run it.

1416
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:32,258
Too suggestive, he says.

1417
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,552
I can't imagine what he
was talking about.

1418
01:09:34,586 --> 01:09:35,907
Check out his bodyguards.

1419
01:09:35,942 --> 01:09:37,958
Real (mumbling) boys.

1420
01:09:37,993 --> 01:09:40,322
My favorite's the tall
one with the tattoos.

1421
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,094
He look like he eats live
squirrels for breakfast

1422
01:09:42,129 --> 01:09:43,728
and washes 'em down
with gasoline.

1423
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:44,805
- [Richter] Tattoos?

1424
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:48,906
- Yeah, flaring skulls,
the usual Jesus stuff.

1425
01:09:48,942 --> 01:09:50,713
You're looking very jumpy,
Richter.

1426
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:51,964
- I'm not, I'm not, I'm fine.

1427
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,217
- Okay.

1428
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:54,988
- [Woman On Speaker]
Richter Boudreau,

1429
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:59,055
Mr. Liddy would like to
see you in his office.

1430
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:08,475
- [Preston] Gonna have
to let you go, Richter.

1431
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:09,586
- Okay.

1432
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,742
- Missed deadline Friday,
I gave you another break.

1433
01:10:11,776 --> 01:10:12,924
Missed another one yesterday.

1434
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,139
It's a pattern.

1435
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:15,426
I don't know what it is.

1436
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:19,979
Whether you wanna be
psychologically punished or
what?

1437
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:20,709
- Okay.

1438
01:10:20,744 --> 01:10:22,759
- Are you on narcotics?

1439
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:25,193
Wash my hands of it.

1440
01:10:25,227 --> 01:10:26,201
Won't put up with it.

1441
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:27,660
I got thugs coming around here

1442
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:29,780
asking questions about
you and your friends.

1443
01:10:29,815 --> 01:10:31,414
That's right, that's right.

1444
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:32,318
- You what?

1445
01:10:32,352 --> 01:10:33,430
- I don't know what
you been up to,

1446
01:10:33,464 --> 01:10:36,246
but I can't have that
kind of thing 'round here.

1447
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:36,871
- Who were they?

1448
01:10:36,906 --> 01:10:37,879
What did you tell them?

1449
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:40,451
- I don't think that's
any of your concern.

1450
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:41,181
- Oh, you don't?

1451
01:10:41,215 --> 01:10:41,946
What, are you a fuckin' idiot?

1452
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,996
What did you fuckin' tell them?

1453
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,178
- Start walkin' mister.

1454
01:10:45,212 --> 01:10:46,463
Nobody talks to me that way

1455
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:49,523
and especially not a black
sheep Boudreau.

1456
01:10:49,557 --> 01:10:52,373
- Black sheep's son of
a black sheep Boudreau,

1457
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:53,832
prone to violence.

1458
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:55,535
I know, let's crack this chair--

1459
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,161
- Joyce!

1460
01:10:56,196 --> 01:10:57,273
- Stick it inside, huh?

1461
01:10:57,308 --> 01:10:59,880
- Joyce, you wanna get
building security up here?

1462
01:10:59,914 --> 01:11:01,271
I bent over backwards for you,
boy

1463
01:11:01,305 --> 01:11:03,182
and I don't even like ya.

1464
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:07,353
Only reason I hired you
was because of your mother.

1465
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:08,534
- Oh, Preston.

1466
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,724
Did you fuck my mom, too?

1467
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,277
(uptempo rock music)

1468
01:12:29,275 --> 01:12:29,970
Don't move.

1469
01:12:30,005 --> 01:12:31,048
- Jesus God.

1470
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:36,818
Are we being a little
hostile here?

1471
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,694
Lord, I had to come over.

1472
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:44,221
Things between me and
Ronnie have gotten real bad.

1473
01:12:44,255 --> 01:12:46,167
I need to talk to you.

1474
01:12:47,349 --> 01:12:48,738
- Go ahead.

1475
01:12:48,774 --> 01:12:52,319
- Could you not point
that thing at me?

1476
01:12:54,716 --> 01:12:55,933
- Oh, God.

1477
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:56,837
I'm sorry.

1478
01:12:58,158 --> 01:12:59,061
- Oh, hey.

1479
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,599
It's okay.

1480
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,345
Just, it's alright.

1481
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:06,743
It's okay.

1482
01:13:09,454 --> 01:13:11,191
I know you hate me.

1483
01:13:14,668 --> 01:13:16,440
Guess what?

1484
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,726
I hate me, too.

1485
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:20,472
- I don't hate you.

1486
01:13:21,654 --> 01:13:22,591
How could I hate you?

1487
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:23,530
You're,

1488
01:13:24,955 --> 01:13:26,068
you're Vicky.

1489
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,262
- Why don't you kiss me, then?

1490
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,809
(moaning)

1491
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:48,695
This is bad.

1492
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,900
And I knew it would happen.

1493
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,033
(melancholy music)

1494
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:10,765
I come by and this boy
points a handgun at me

1495
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,693
and here I am wanting
to go to bed with him.

1496
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,853
I wanna fuck you across the sky.

1497
01:14:21,887 --> 01:14:24,946
(melancholy music)

1498
01:14:30,785 --> 01:14:31,654
Come on.

1499
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:34,504
My room.

1500
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:47,051
Oh, know what I did?

1501
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,118
Me and little Clem,

1502
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:57,930
we checked into one of
those motel rooms,

1503
01:14:57,965 --> 01:14:59,459
you know the type.

1504
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,908
That stupid strip of paper
across the toilet, huh?

1505
01:15:03,944 --> 01:15:05,125
I was thinking.

1506
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:08,879
I mean, maybe tomorrow morning,

1507
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,466
we could just go somewhere.

1508
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,784
You be daddy to my little girl.

1509
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,501
- Well, looky here.

1510
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:27,648
(laughing)

1511
01:15:27,682 --> 01:15:29,003
It's a party.

1512
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:30,254
(clicking)

1513
01:15:30,289 --> 01:15:31,471
Oh, say cheese.

1514
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:33,070
- [Vicky] Get out.

1515
01:15:33,104 --> 01:15:34,251
- Man, this isn't funny.

1516
01:15:34,286 --> 01:15:35,155
Come on.

1517
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:37,240
- Hey, this belong to you?

1518
01:15:37,275 --> 01:15:39,013
Get this shit out of my house.

1519
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:41,828
- Hey, give me the camera,
Keith.

1520
01:15:41,863 --> 01:15:43,219
Hey, Keith.

1521
01:15:43,253 --> 01:15:44,227
- Fuck you.

1522
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:46,312
Fuck you.

1523
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,953
- Keith.

1524
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:49,891
Key.

1525
01:15:51,664 --> 01:15:53,784
- You're not my friend.

1526
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,835
- I'm your friend, Keith.

1527
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:57,955
- You were never my friend.

1528
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,859
- [Vicky] Put down that gun,
Keith.

1529
01:15:58,894 --> 01:15:59,520
No!
- Hey!

1530
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:02,578
Maybe we should see how
you like it, huh?

1531
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:04,038
You like it, don't you?

1532
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:05,776
This is what it feels like.

1533
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,131
You want it?

1534
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,974
Huh, I know what you like.

1535
01:16:09,008 --> 01:16:11,059
Yeah, you like this, don't you?

1536
01:16:11,094 --> 01:16:12,066
- Go do it.

1537
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:14,534
Do it.

1538
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,264
(grunting)
(clicking)

1539
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:16,169
Ah!

1540
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:20,165
(laughing)

1541
01:16:22,215 --> 01:16:24,614
I thought you were
gonna do us all a favor.

1542
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:25,865
You fat pig.

1543
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:29,168
- That's funny.

1544
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:33,199
- You're such a coward.

1545
01:16:33,234 --> 01:16:35,320
(tense music)

1546
01:16:35,354 --> 01:16:37,439
- You think so?

1547
01:16:37,474 --> 01:16:38,586
You think so?

1548
01:16:40,602 --> 01:16:42,062
Now, look at this.

1549
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:45,781
One bullet, just one.

1550
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:49,430
(laughing)

1551
01:16:52,594 --> 01:16:56,347
Now, let's see how good
your luck is.

1552
01:16:56,382 --> 01:16:57,251
(grunting)

1553
01:16:57,285 --> 01:16:57,981
- [Vicky] Oh!

1554
01:16:58,015 --> 01:16:58,884
- Huh, wanna try again?

1555
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,788
- [Vicky] Keith no!

1556
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:00,518
Oh!

1557
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,603
- You like it, you
wanna do it again?

1558
01:17:02,638 --> 01:17:03,751
- No, no, no!

1559
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:06,287
Goddamn you!

1560
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:07,782
- Do it again, huh?

1561
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:09,972
Now you go on over there
to your loverboy.

1562
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:11,779
Why don't you go on?

1563
01:17:14,247 --> 01:17:15,151
Move!

1564
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,615
- Why don't you jerk off
somewhere else for a change?

1565
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,284
- Maybe I will, huh?

1566
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,107
But I'm gonna get a couple
of shots first.

1567
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:28,498
Grab his cock.

1568
01:17:29,609 --> 01:17:31,278
I said grab his cock!

1569
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:32,181
Now!

1570
01:17:32,216 --> 01:17:33,954
- Okay, okay, here.

1571
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:36,978
There, alright?

1572
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,454
(laughing)

1573
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:41,671
- That's good.

1574
01:17:41,705 --> 01:17:43,374
Ah, yes.

1575
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,347
I like that.

1576
01:17:44,381 --> 01:17:46,675
(clicking)

1577
01:17:47,718 --> 01:17:48,830
Perfect.

1578
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,924
Now all I gotta do is figure
out who to send it to.

1579
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,591
Chipper or Ronnie?

1580
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:58,110
How 'bout both, huh?

1581
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:04,088
See ya, Boo.

1582
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,599
Y'all want some privacy?

1583
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:09,928
(laughing)

1584
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,986
- He's one sick fuck.

1585
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,585
- [Richter] Yeah.

1586
01:18:20,285 --> 01:18:21,710
What are you...

1587
01:18:22,891 --> 01:18:25,047
- You stay put, you hear?

1588
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:31,025
Vicky's gonna take care
of everything.

1589
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:34,849
(melancholy music)

1590
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:11,795
- [Richter] Cherry, seen Keith?

1591
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,776
Did he go to Ronnie's?

1592
01:19:13,811 --> 01:19:15,201
- Howdy, partner.

1593
01:19:15,236 --> 01:19:16,244
- Listen, he's got
something that belongs to me

1594
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:19,615
and I just, I need to
get it back, that's all.

1595
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:23,404
- Like maybe he took
some pictures?

1596
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:26,358
- I don't want to hurt
you but it's all

1597
01:19:26,393 --> 01:19:29,486
that I can do to concentrate
on myself right now.

1598
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:31,710
- [Cherry] Fuck you.

1599
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:32,614
- Hey.

1600
01:19:32,649 --> 01:19:33,345
- What's the matter?

1601
01:19:33,379 --> 01:19:34,978
She never did pictures before?

1602
01:19:35,012 --> 01:19:35,986
I did.

1603
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,002
You wanna hear about
some private pictures?

1604
01:19:38,036 --> 01:19:39,079
- No, Cherry, look.

1605
01:19:39,114 --> 01:19:40,434
I just need to...

1606
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,729
- We did our thing.

1607
01:19:42,763 --> 01:19:44,050
Me and Earla.

1608
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:49,714
Some rich boy comes on
to her after our show.

1609
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,071
Go out with me, baby.

1610
01:19:51,105 --> 01:19:52,808
Sure sugar, she says.

1611
01:19:52,843 --> 01:19:54,789
- I don't have to hear this.

1612
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:59,273
- 'Til Earla comes home,
and she's all upset, right?

1613
01:20:00,385 --> 01:20:03,444
Rich boy takes her
to some motel.

1614
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,225
Wants her to suck him off
while he's cursing her,

1615
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:09,422
calling her nigger and shit.

1616
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,543
He hurt you, Earla baby.

1617
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:14,739
No, he didn't hurt nothing.

1618
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:15,748
Paid me $200.

1619
01:20:16,964 --> 01:20:20,683
It's a rich little fuck
got lots of money.

1620
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:27,009
So, rich boy comes back
two nights later.

1621
01:20:27,044 --> 01:20:30,102
Wants her to go out again.

1622
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:31,771
So, I go fuck him.

1623
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:33,126
Fuck him, Earla.

1624
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:37,610
I got a camera, let's do
a thing, okay?

1625
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:45,013
So I go leave the blinds
open at the motel.

1626
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:47,794
Me in the bushes with my Nikon.

1627
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:52,347
So, rich boy's callin'
her nigger,

1628
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,710
cums right away, all over.

1629
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:57,386
But he's really pissed.

1630
01:20:57,422 --> 01:21:01,279
He's yellin' at her like
it was Earla's fault.

1631
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:04,407
Big nigger dick, that's
what you want, baby.

1632
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,666
Sure, you big nigger dick.

1633
01:21:08,265 --> 01:21:10,873
And he's got a club,

1634
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:15,808
a big fucking club and
he's sticking her with it

1635
01:21:15,843 --> 01:21:19,179
and she's yelling and
he's hitting her

1636
01:21:19,214 --> 01:21:22,481
and hitting her and hitting her

1637
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:24,323
and I couldn't move.

1638
01:21:27,034 --> 01:21:28,529
I couldn't move!

1639
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:32,596
(melancholy music)

1640
01:21:39,095 --> 01:21:40,137
- Hey, hey come on.

1641
01:21:40,173 --> 01:21:41,876
We'll get out of town, right?

1642
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,231
We'll go to Houston,
we'll drive down

1643
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:43,648
to Mexico or something.

1644
01:21:43,683 --> 01:21:44,969
- No.

1645
01:21:45,004 --> 01:21:47,576
- Listen to me, we'll just get
the fuck outta town, alright?

1646
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,105
- He killed her.

1647
01:21:50,008 --> 01:21:51,851
He hurt her and he killed her.

1648
01:21:51,885 --> 01:21:52,858
We're gonna make him pay!

1649
01:21:52,894 --> 01:21:53,624
- Fuck is everybody thinking?

1650
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,639
This is Harmon Shaw's baby boy.

1651
01:21:55,674 --> 01:21:56,578
Do you understand?

1652
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:57,655
Harmon Shaw.

1653
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,165
- Is he evil?

1654
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:04,780
- What?

1655
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:07,387
- Is he evil?

1656
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,253
- Yeah.

1657
01:22:24,383 --> 01:22:27,373
Uh, I've been trying
to call you.

1658
01:22:27,407 --> 01:22:29,145
- [Ronnie] Here I am.

1659
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,013
- [Richter] Yeah, listen.

1660
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:31,091
Why'd you trash my house?

1661
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:32,969
- [Ronnie] I didn't.

1662
01:22:33,003 --> 01:22:34,532
- [Richter] Well then, who did?

1663
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:36,131
- [Ronnie] Vicky!

1664
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,355
Vicky!

1665
01:22:42,596 --> 01:22:43,569
Vicky here?

1666
01:22:44,473 --> 01:22:45,168
- No.

1667
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:49,582
- Vicky split.

1668
01:22:50,903 --> 01:22:51,806
- She did?

1669
01:22:55,908 --> 01:22:57,506
- [Ronnie] I thought
maybe you knew.

1670
01:22:57,541 --> 01:22:59,245
- [Richter] No, I didn't.

1671
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:00,252
- She's been fuckin' around.

1672
01:23:00,287 --> 01:23:01,469
I thought maybe you knew.

1673
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,346
- [Richter] No, listen,
I don't think--

1674
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,423
- I don't think nothing.

1675
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:05,465
You got the pouch?

1676
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:07,760
I want them pictures, Richter.

1677
01:23:07,795 --> 01:23:09,115
- Pictures?

1678
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,626
Uh, the pouch is
still at my mom's.

1679
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,781
I haven't touched it except
to hide it, of course.

1680
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:16,310
But she came back last
night before I had a chance

1681
01:23:16,345 --> 01:23:18,048
to get it out of there, but
that's not the only problem--

1682
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,403
- You're dicking around with me,
comrade.

1683
01:23:19,438 --> 01:23:20,203
- No, no.

1684
01:23:20,237 --> 01:23:21,558
Listen, there's a
reporter I know,

1685
01:23:21,594 --> 01:23:23,574
lady that did the car story?

1686
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:25,382
She was covering Shaw's
press conference

1687
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,668
and she noticed one of
his bodyguards

1688
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,336
has this tattoo,
this big tattoo,

1689
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:30,282
this big fuckin'
tattoo right here.

1690
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:32,507
I think that I've seen
this guy before

1691
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,661
when I met you and Cherry
at that strip joint.

1692
01:23:34,697 --> 01:23:36,921
If that's him, if it's
the same guy,

1693
01:23:36,956 --> 01:23:37,859
he was right there.

1694
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:40,084
He must have seen us.

1695
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:42,412
This guy came to my office
asking questions and shit.

1696
01:23:42,448 --> 01:23:44,428
He must have trashed my house.

1697
01:23:44,463 --> 01:23:46,271
They know who we are.

1698
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:47,139
- Maybe they do.

1699
01:23:47,174 --> 01:23:48,669
I ain't surprised.

1700
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,821
What do you think I'm
doing this for, Richter?

1701
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:55,725
- I don't know.

1702
01:23:55,759 --> 01:23:56,628
- Think about it.

1703
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:57,532
Think hard.

1704
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:58,644
- What, the money?

1705
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,695
- Fuck the money.

1706
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:02,328
Money on it's own don't
mean a fuckin' thing.

1707
01:24:02,363 --> 01:24:04,066
You oughta know that.

1708
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:05,491
I worked at the country
club one summer,

1709
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:08,063
shagging golf balls on
the driving range.

1710
01:24:08,098 --> 01:24:10,183
Used to ride around on
this little fuckin' tractor

1711
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:12,164
inside a cage so the
rich folks could practice

1712
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:14,284
while I retrieved.

1713
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,571
One day I'm sweating
in that cage

1714
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:16,822
and this big fucker decides

1715
01:24:16,857 --> 01:24:19,811
he gonna make a game of me
and so he aims at that tractor

1716
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,626
with me inside and he's
hittin' bucket after bucket.

1717
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:24,225
Balls are banging off
the tractor,

1718
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,276
banging off the bars.

1719
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:30,307
He just laughs, his
friends laughing with him.

1720
01:24:33,019 --> 01:24:36,425
You know, hell, I didn't
mind the sport.

1721
01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:41,464
I just remember that laughing.

1722
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:52,274
That and Vicky, standing
off to the side,

1723
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:57,209
watching her fella knocking
golf balls all over me.

1724
01:24:57,245 --> 01:24:58,391
Vicky didn't laugh.

1725
01:24:58,426 --> 01:24:59,573
Didn't even smile.

1726
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:05,447
She looked at me like she
knew just the way I feel.

1727
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,797
That's love, comrade, at
least that's where it starts.

1728
01:25:18,237 --> 01:25:20,566
- Well, I don't think
that Harmon Shaw cares

1729
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:23,138
much about love or
anything else.

1730
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:26,613
- Least of all a dead
nigger gal, right?

1731
01:25:32,453 --> 01:25:33,565
Nobody cares.

1732
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:43,088
- What do you wanna do?

1733
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,406
- I wanna fuck him up.

1734
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,759
And I want you to help.

1735
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:00,536
- Cherry.

1736
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:02,553
Cherry.

1737
01:26:02,587 --> 01:26:04,777
This is no time for
wretched excess.

1738
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:08,357
- I'm just partying a little,
that's all.

1739
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:11,068
I never went to a prom before.

1740
01:26:11,103 --> 01:26:12,493
I bet you took Vicky.

1741
01:26:12,528 --> 01:26:14,752
- I want you to focus, okay?

1742
01:26:14,787 --> 01:26:17,255
- Cherry's on the case, baby.

1743
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:20,487
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about.

1744
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:26,465
(light instrumental music)

1745
01:26:35,085 --> 01:26:35,954
- [Waiter] Sir.

1746
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:36,649
- Thank you.

1747
01:26:36,684 --> 01:26:37,553
- You're very welcome.

1748
01:26:37,587 --> 01:26:38,491
Ma'am.

1749
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,168
- Oh, whoa.

1750
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:42,975
Sorry.

1751
01:26:43,009 --> 01:26:44,261
- That's quite alright, ma'am.

1752
01:26:44,296 --> 01:26:46,069
- No man, I'll get it.

1753
01:26:52,985 --> 01:26:54,028
- Thank you.

1754
01:26:57,955 --> 01:27:00,457
You're gonna have to do a
little better than that, okay?

1755
01:27:00,493 --> 01:27:02,160
- This is fun.

1756
01:27:02,196 --> 01:27:04,003
- Try not to wobble.

1757
01:27:04,768 --> 01:27:07,861
(uptempo pop music)

1758
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:11,024
(chattering)

1759
01:27:11,058 --> 01:27:11,962
Hi, Mom.

1760
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:13,804
You wouldn't happen to have

1761
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:16,828
some aspirin in your purse,
would you?

1762
01:27:16,863 --> 01:27:20,999
- Richter, I'd like you to meet
somebody very special to me.

1763
01:27:21,034 --> 01:27:24,197
Victor, this is my other son,
Richter.

1764
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,100
- Vic Hill.

1765
01:27:25,135 --> 01:27:26,108
- Hi, I'm the other son.

1766
01:27:26,143 --> 01:27:27,499
You've heard all about me.

1767
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:28,368
- Yes, I have.

1768
01:27:28,402 --> 01:27:30,835
- Thanks for
redeveloping my house.

1769
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,330
- And who is this?

1770
01:27:32,364 --> 01:27:34,415
- Oh, Mom, Victor, this
is my friend, Cherry.

1771
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,605
- Cherry, pleased to meet ya.

1772
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:37,926
Richter has told me--

1773
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,080
- Uh, what have you told me?

1774
01:27:40,115 --> 01:27:40,914
- Nothing.

1775
01:27:42,061 --> 01:27:43,904
- I think I'll just go
freshen this up

1776
01:27:43,938 --> 01:27:44,773
a little bit for you, honey.

1777
01:27:44,807 --> 01:27:45,503
- Why?

1778
01:27:45,537 --> 01:27:46,510
- Bye, Vic.

1779
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:53,740
- Well, I think I have to
go say hello to my friends,

1780
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:54,887
the Winstons.

1781
01:27:58,362 --> 01:28:00,135
- Mom and I have one of
those special relationships

1782
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:03,820
that transcend the usual
bonds of family.

1783
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:10,979
So, Billy, how do you
like our new dad?

1784
01:28:11,014 --> 01:28:13,308
- I like all our dads.

1785
01:28:13,343 --> 01:28:17,583
- Say, I bet you can't
drink that down like this.

1786
01:28:27,524 --> 01:28:28,845
- [Cherry] Pee.

1787
01:28:28,879 --> 01:28:33,398
- Uh, Cherry, have you
met my brother, Billy?

1788
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:34,857
- Half brother.

1789
01:28:37,256 --> 01:28:39,237
Nice to meet you.

1790
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,531
- Cherry needs some help
finding the ladies' room.

1791
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:42,434
Billy, if you could...

1792
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:43,338
- [Billy] Oh, oh gladly.

1793
01:28:43,373 --> 01:28:44,415
- Thank you.

1794
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:50,115
- [Woman] Thank you darlin'.

1795
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:53,557
- Hello, my mother left
her medication in her coat.

1796
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:55,747
Can't seem to find the...

1797
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,214
Excuse me.

1798
01:29:02,698 --> 01:29:03,706
Ronnie.

1799
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,131
Ronnie, you can't come in here.

1800
01:29:05,165 --> 01:29:06,625
It's not cool.

1801
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,807
I've almost got the key.

1802
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:09,614
- [Cynthia] Richter.

1803
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,454
- It's okay, Mom, I got it.

1804
01:29:15,488 --> 01:29:17,574
- I'm giving you an hour to
meet me at Keith's house.

1805
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:18,616
You got that?

1806
01:29:18,651 --> 01:29:20,215
- Okay.

1807
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:21,154
- You understand me on that?

1808
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,057
- [Richter] Yes.

1809
01:29:22,093 --> 01:29:23,796
- No more bullshit.

1810
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:25,846
- Okay.

1811
01:29:33,214 --> 01:29:33,945
- An hour.

1812
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:41,208
- Who was that?

1813
01:29:41,244 --> 01:29:43,051
- Oh, just some guy from
the golf course.

1814
01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:44,858
I took care of it, Mom.

1815
01:29:44,893 --> 01:29:46,839
Why, you've sure got a
lot of gifts here.

1816
01:29:46,874 --> 01:29:49,828
- Darlin' I will abide
your girlfriend,

1817
01:29:49,863 --> 01:29:52,609
but I draw the line
at criminals.

I think all this excitement's
kinda gotten to him.

1827

- Excitement?

1828
01:30:20,971 --> 01:30:23,230

little too much champagne.

He was looking kinda
green when we left.

1854
01:31:46,195 --> 01:31:48,350
- Oh, I like Billy green.

1855
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:52,521
- Lucky for you we
found this film.

1856

You ever see Ronnie when
he gets angry?

1857

His eyes don't blink.

1858
01:31:57,907 --> 01:32:01,453
- Yeah, well, we're not
gonna go see Ronnie just yet.

1859
01:32:01,487 --> 01:32:03,016
- What?

1860
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:06,562
- I said we're not gonna
go see Ronnie just yet.

1861
01:32:06,597 --> 01:32:08,544
- Where are we going?

1862

- God dammit, where
are we going?

1864
01:32:14,938 --> 01:32:18,414
- I gotta see Vicky first, okay?

1865
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:22,794
- Oh well, that's real
optimistic, Richter.

1866
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:25,157
What do you have in mind?

1867
01:32:27,903 --> 01:32:29,328

TV yes, thank you.

Thank you.

1878
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:35,123
Ever watch Jeopardy!?

1879
01:33:36,964 --> 01:33:38,529
- No, not really.

1880
01:33:42,178 --> 01:33:45,202
- Ronnie watches every night.

1881
01:33:45,237 --> 01:33:50,103
Almost never gets a single
answer,'cept state capitols.

1882
01:33:52,154 --> 01:33:55,490
Funny thing is, he just
keeps watching.

1883
01:33:58,166 --> 01:34:00,738
He's real determined, that guy.

1884
01:34:02,824 --> 01:34:05,049
That's why he came for me.

1885
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:10,505
Like I was the only
thing on his mind.

1886
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,372
- You love him.

1887
01:34:17,839 --> 01:34:20,133
- Imagine my surprise, huh?

1888
01:34:24,304 --> 01:34:26,494
- What are you gonna do?

1889
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:27,466
- I'm gonna sit here.

1890
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:31,081
I gotta wait for the
round of champions.

1891
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,322
- You know what's weird?

1892
01:34:35,356 --> 01:34:36,747
- [Vicky] What?

1893
01:34:37,894 --> 01:34:41,265
- I never really thought
about you and me.

1894
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,455
You know, I just knew it.

1895
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:49,363
At least I thought I
did, but lately I've...

1896
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:57,427
It's like something I
learned in high school,

1897
01:34:57,462 --> 01:34:59,895
but it took me years to
realize that it

1898
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:04,517
really had no practical
application in the real world.

1899
01:35:04,552 --> 01:35:07,611
- Well, that's real sweet,
Richter.

1900
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:10,253
- Just hit me.

1901
01:35:15,675 --> 01:35:17,342
- I guess I just liked
the way you looked at me

1902
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:18,837
when we were kids.

1903
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:23,808
I did like that.

1904
01:35:25,824 --> 01:35:27,075
- We were kids.

1905
01:35:28,361 --> 01:35:29,264
- Yeah.

1906
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:37,363
- A favor.

1907
01:35:38,475 --> 01:35:41,325
Don't go anywhere, not just yet.

1908
01:35:45,705 --> 01:35:50,745
- Shit, I got that fortune
wheel coming up next.

1909
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:53,142
Clem sleeps a solid 8, so...

1910
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:56,583
Ain't going nowhere.

1911
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:02,631
- Bye, baby.

1912
01:36:14,901 --> 01:36:16,708
- Where is Mayberry?

1913
01:36:19,592 --> 01:36:21,226
Where is Mayberry?

1914
01:36:22,964 --> 01:36:24,980
I have no fuckin' idea.

1915
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:42,220
(tense music)

1916
01:36:57,616 --> 01:36:58,485
- Cherry.

1917
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:00,745
Come on, wait up a minute,
will ya?

1918
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,996
- [Cherry] Fuck off.

1919
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:03,699
- Listen, Cherry, I
just wanna talk.

1920
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:06,827
- My name's not Cherry,
it's Elinore.

1921
01:37:06,862 --> 01:37:08,808
I don't need you, I
don't need anybody.

1922
01:37:08,844 --> 01:37:11,033
Me and Ronnie'll take
care of this ourselves.

1923
01:37:11,067 --> 01:37:12,458
After he rips your head off.

1924
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:13,605
- Dammit, what, that's
not what's happening here.

1925
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:15,795
- Which is exactly
what you deserve.

1926
01:37:15,829 --> 01:37:17,394
Banging his wife.

1927
01:37:18,506 --> 01:37:19,375
- Okay, come on.

1928
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:20,278
Elinore.

1929
01:37:20,313 --> 01:37:21,042
- What?

1930
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:24,901
- Well, first of all,
Tulsa is that way.

1931
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:28,655
You're going the
wrong direction.

1932
01:37:28,689 --> 01:37:30,149
- What else is new?

1933
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:34,111
- Well, you're wrong
about Vicky.

1934
01:37:35,745 --> 01:37:36,649
I was too.

1935
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:48,639
I kinda figured that Cherry
was just your stage name.

1936
01:37:48,675 --> 01:37:50,621
- Yeah well, Tiffany
was overused and Chesty

1937
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:52,359
seemed inappropriate.

1938
01:37:53,923 --> 01:37:55,209
- Elinore, huh?

1939
01:37:58,094 --> 01:38:00,214
- I was named for my aunt.

1940
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:02,542
- Your Aunt Elinore?

1941
01:38:02,577 --> 01:38:03,481
- Yeah.

1942
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:07,374
You want to hear about
my whole family tree?

1943
01:38:07,408 --> 01:38:08,625
- Well, yeah.

1944
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:09,529
Yes, I would.

1945
01:38:09,563 --> 01:38:10,814
That'd be nice.

1946
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:29,097
- Earla was the only
real friend I ever had.

1947
01:38:29,132 --> 01:38:32,921
I mean, I had people to
do shit together, but

1948
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:39,559
I never had someone I
could count on before.

1949
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:47,587
I was hopin' I could
count on you.

1950
01:38:47,623 --> 01:38:50,403
(horn honking)

1951
01:38:53,879 --> 01:38:55,338
- Drive with me, huh?

1952
01:38:55,373 --> 01:38:56,381
Come on.

1953
01:38:56,415 --> 01:38:57,772
We'll take that film to Ronnie.

1954
01:38:57,806 --> 01:39:00,760
We'll make Bedford pay for
what he did, you and me.

1955
01:39:00,796 --> 01:39:03,854
(melancholy music)

1956
01:39:04,931 --> 01:39:06,252
Come on, please.

1957
01:39:15,254 --> 01:39:18,486
- [Cherry] Don't
call me Elinore.

1958
01:39:18,522 --> 01:39:19,425
Not yet.

1959
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:35,170
- [Richter] Ronnie?

1960
01:39:37,325 --> 01:39:39,410
Ronnie, you won't believe
this, but we finally--

1961
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:40,314
- [Ronnie] Something puzzles me,
Richt,

1962
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,504
do you know what that is?

1963
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:44,415
- No.

1964
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,597
- For the life of me, I
can't figure out

1965
01:39:45,632 --> 01:39:47,648
how Keith got our film.

1966
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:51,540
- Yeah, yeah, that is weird.

1967
01:39:51,575 --> 01:39:54,390
I mean, I can see how it
would appear that way,

1968
01:39:54,425 --> 01:39:57,102
but you know, the strange
thing is that--

1969
01:39:57,136 --> 01:39:58,179
- [Cherry] Keith took it.

1970
01:39:58,213 --> 01:39:59,083
- Right.

1971
01:39:59,117 --> 01:40:00,577
Right, but he knew.

1972
01:40:00,612 --> 01:40:03,636
So, it's strange that Keith
knew how important it was--

1973
01:40:03,671 --> 01:40:06,416
- So he decided to give
it to you because

1974
01:40:06,451 --> 01:40:07,911
that's where it belonged.

1975
01:40:07,946 --> 01:40:11,352
- Instead of just
giving it to me.

1976
01:40:11,386 --> 01:40:12,707
You know, Keith.

1977
01:40:16,183 --> 01:40:17,747
- Well, shit then.

1978
01:40:17,782 --> 01:40:19,763
Guess I'll wrap this up,
send it off to Harmon Shaw.

1979
01:40:19,798 --> 01:40:21,362
Everybody gets rich.

1980
01:40:22,509 --> 01:40:24,421
- That's great, Ronnie,
but you know,

1981
01:40:24,455 --> 01:40:25,950
why don't you give it to me,

1982
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,696
and I can wrap it up, send
it off from the office.

1983
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:29,634
- Yeah, let Richter send it.

1984
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:30,711
That'll work.

1985
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:34,917
- Y'all wanna take a
fucking vote?

1986
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:36,133
I think it's best if I
take it from here.

1987
01:40:36,169 --> 01:40:40,791
Richter might lose it again,
ain't that right, Richter?

1988
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,120
- Yeah, uh, listen, Ronnie.

1989
01:40:45,727 --> 01:40:47,569
About that film.

1990
01:40:47,603 --> 01:40:49,584
That's not what you think it is.

1991
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:52,122
It's a long, strange
story about what happened,

1992
01:40:52,156 --> 01:40:54,589
but the important thing is--

1993
01:40:54,624 --> 01:40:56,709
- [Bedford] Nobody move!

1994
01:40:58,308 --> 01:41:00,603
(laughing)

1995
01:41:02,028 --> 01:41:03,001
- What's the matter, Bedford?

1996
01:41:03,035 --> 01:41:05,955
You got your gun all crooked.

1997
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:07,936
- Give me the film.

1998
01:41:07,971 --> 01:41:10,404
Give me the film and
I won't shoot anybody.

1999
01:41:10,438 --> 01:41:12,976
- You look a bit shaky to me,
Bedford.

2000
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:14,366
Maybe you should have
something to eat, huh?

2001
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:15,687
(crashing)

2002
01:41:15,722 --> 01:41:18,363
- Ronnie, Ronnie, I think you
should just give him the film.

2003
01:41:18,398 --> 01:41:19,266
- Now, dammit, I'll shoot.

2004
01:41:19,302 --> 01:41:20,691
I mean it!

2005
01:41:20,727 --> 01:41:22,847
- Ain't that easy, killer.

2006
01:41:24,098 --> 01:41:25,905
Defenseless girl, I
guess that's one thing,

2007
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,713
but three at a time?

2008
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:32,649
I don't know, Bedford.

2009
01:41:32,683 --> 01:41:36,784
Seems to me your reach
has exceeded your grasp.

2010
01:41:37,897 --> 01:41:39,426
- Alright.

2011
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,546
I'll shoot the whore first.

2012
01:41:41,581 --> 01:41:42,450
- Fuck you.

2013
01:41:42,484 --> 01:41:43,423
- Fuck you.

2014
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:44,397
- Go girl.

2015
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:45,300
- Hey.

2016
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:47,455
- Goddammit, give me the film.

2017
01:41:47,489 --> 01:41:50,061
(gunshot blasting)

2018
01:41:50,097 --> 01:41:51,104
- Nice shootin', Bedford.

2019
01:41:51,139 --> 01:41:53,467
You murdered the lamp.

2020
01:41:53,503 --> 01:41:54,824
- Just give him the film.

2021
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:55,692
It's not what you think it is.

2022
01:41:55,727 --> 01:41:56,839
Just give it to him.

2023
01:41:56,874 --> 01:41:58,195
- Yeah, Richter.

2024
01:41:59,932 --> 01:42:02,227
What do you think it is?

2025
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:04,138
- Alright, I am going
to count then.

2026
01:42:04,173 --> 01:42:05,494
I'm going to count to ten--

2027
01:42:05,528 --> 01:42:07,823
- Just shut the fuck up.

2028
01:42:07,857 --> 01:42:09,526
Here's the damn film.

2029
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,688
(tense music)

2030
01:42:12,723 --> 01:42:14,044
Come and get it.

2031
01:42:15,156 --> 01:42:16,789
- Give it here.

2032
01:42:16,825 --> 01:42:19,639
- Come on over you sack of shit.

2033
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,969
- I'm warning you.

2034
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:23,846
- You beat Earla to
death with a stick.

2035
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,313
Man like that oughta
stand real tall.

2036
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,537
- Okay, guys, guys.

2037
01:42:28,573 --> 01:42:32,152
- So why don't you just
come and get it?

2038
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:33,821
- Hey.

2039
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:38,826
Okay?

2040
01:42:44,664 --> 01:42:46,367
- Thank you, Richter.

2041
01:42:46,403 --> 01:42:47,966
- You're welcome.

2042
01:42:49,183 --> 01:42:51,269
- Pissant mother fucker.

2043
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:54,431
- Oh, what the hell.

2044
01:42:56,552 --> 01:42:58,185
(clicking)

2045
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,931
(gunshot blasting)

2046
01:43:02,356 --> 01:43:06,214
- What's that asshole
doing in my dining room?

2047
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:12,331
- Whatever he was doing,
he's done.

2048
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:15,042
- [Richter] Shit.

2049
01:43:16,988 --> 01:43:17,962
- Now what?

2050
01:43:20,464 --> 01:43:22,620
- Think fast, college boy.

2051
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,601
- What the fuck are you talkin',
this,

2052
01:43:24,635 --> 01:43:25,539
oh, shit.

2053
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:27,972
Okay, okay.

2054
01:43:30,092 --> 01:43:31,030
Okay, this is what happened.

2055
01:43:31,065 --> 01:43:32,664
Here's the story.

2056
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:34,784
Bedford Shaw came over
to the house.

2057
01:43:34,819 --> 01:43:36,696
He had a gun.

2058
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:39,963
He came over because he
thought you had the film.

2059
01:43:39,998 --> 01:43:44,099
You were upstairs watching
TV and you heard him.

2060
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:48,165
You heard him because
he broke in,

2061
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:50,529
here.

2062
01:43:50,564 --> 01:43:52,858
(crashing)

2063
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:57,932
You grabbed your gun, naturally.

2064
01:43:57,967 --> 01:44:00,226
You came downstairs,
surprised him.

2065
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:05,127
He took a shot at you and
you shot him in self defense.

2066
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:08,047
- What about the film?

2067
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:10,619
(tense music)

2068
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:22,332
- Cherry and I will take
this film down to Brinkman

2069
01:44:22,366 --> 01:44:24,070
at the Journal.

2070
01:44:24,104 --> 01:44:26,433
Brinkman'll spread it
all over the front page,

2071
01:44:26,467 --> 01:44:30,534
and she'll have an
eyewitness to back it up.

2072
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:34,184
Bedford Shaw, murderer,
shot by local hero.

2073
01:44:38,251 --> 01:44:42,422
We'll bury Harmon Shaw's
good name with his son.

2074
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:48,816
You weren't here and you
weren't here and neither was I.

2075
01:44:51,388 --> 01:44:53,335
- What about my money?

2076
01:44:56,185 --> 01:44:57,298
- Your money.

2077
01:44:59,348 --> 01:44:59,870
Yeah.

2078
01:45:01,259 --> 01:45:04,805
Money on it's own don't
mean a damn thing.

2079
01:45:05,848 --> 01:45:08,141
You oughta know that.

2080
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:11,235
(melancholy music)

2081
01:45:19,437 --> 01:45:22,149
Vicky's waiting for you there.

2082
01:45:45,471 --> 01:45:47,312
- Thank you, Richter.

2083
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:00,555
- Now.

2084
01:46:02,466 --> 01:46:07,402
Can one of y'all tell me what
the hell is going on here?

2085
01:46:08,653 --> 01:46:10,600
- Yeah, I can do that.

2086
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:16,544
Started with a dead
girl named Earla.

2087
01:46:24,259 --> 01:46:25,823
Dear Brinkman.

2088
01:46:25,858 --> 01:46:27,422
I hope this letter finds you.

2089
01:46:27,457 --> 01:46:30,203
The local post office is
well, sort of eccentric

2090
01:46:30,237 --> 01:46:33,331
when it comes to the whole
mail delivery concept.

2091
01:46:33,365 --> 01:46:36,077
Cherry and I came down
here after the hearing.

2092
01:46:36,111 --> 01:46:37,502
Sometimes, when I
think about it,

2093
01:46:37,536 --> 01:46:39,378
I can still see Harmon
Shaw sitting in the back

2094
01:46:39,413 --> 01:46:42,472
of the courtroom like an
angry god stunned

2095
01:46:42,506 --> 01:46:45,774
that his subjects had conjured
up the nerve to defy him.

2096
01:46:45,808 --> 01:46:49,284
That, and Keith in the
spotlight he always deserved.

2097
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:52,412
Every town needs a gunslinger,
I guess.

2098
01:46:53,803 --> 01:46:56,687
The days are hot here,
the nights are cool.

2099
01:46:56,722 --> 01:46:59,711
I started to write about
what happened that week,

2100
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:01,762
but then I didn't.

2101
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:05,655
Right now, sunrise and
sunset are enough.

2102
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:08,852
Well, that and the
frequent margarita.

2103
01:47:09,999 --> 01:47:13,197
I'm a long way from home,
Cherry is too.

2104
01:47:14,344 --> 01:47:17,750
We intend to figure
that out together.

2105
01:47:17,785 --> 01:47:19,245
Please send money.

2106
01:47:20,253 --> 01:47:21,504
Just kidding.

2107
01:47:21,538 --> 01:47:23,137
Richter.

2108
01:47:23,172 --> 01:47:26,231
(melancholy music)

2109
01:47:28,595 --> 01:47:31,409
(uptempo music)

2110
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:18,679
(melancholy music)

2111
01:50:51,331 --> 01:50:54,147
(uptempo music)
