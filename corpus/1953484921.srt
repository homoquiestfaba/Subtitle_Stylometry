00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,004
♪

2
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,010
Hey, handsome.

3
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,379
Tosha, I know all your
friends think

4
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,681
you're sleeping
with Denzel Washington,

5
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,418
but I can't help that the
brother looks like me.

6
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,854
Randy, didn't I just hear
you talking to someone ?

7
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,222
No.

8
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,291
But I suppose this little
get-together we're having

9
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,292
has something to
do with this

10
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,395
silly online course
that you're taking.

11
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,030
What's it called ?

12
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,566
Shula-kula, or Shasta
Cola or something ?

13
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,568
Kama Sutra.

14
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,869
Old school.

15
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,305
Shasta Cola isn't even
on the market anymore.

16
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,474
The Tantra is about
relationships

17
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,643
between men and women

18
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,412
and their spiritual
and physical connection

19
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,383
to romance
and sexuality.

20
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:49,288
Look, baby, it's the
spiritual art of love,

21
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,726
of connecting spiritual
and physical form.

22
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,995
Get it ?

23
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:02,167
It's experiencing love
through the beauty of the earth.

24
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,937
It's about acceptance
and not judgment.

25
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,573
It's about compassion.

26
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,243
You know what else
it's about, baby ?

27
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:16,415
It's about truth within.

28
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,151
Unconditional love.

29
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,486
Either you have been
hitting the bottle earlier

30
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,324
or you want some
new religion.

31
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:31,163
Well, the Kama Sutra
evolved from the

32
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,266
Tantra and it's not just about
religion, baby.

33
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,169
It's about
spiritual path.

34
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,939
Well, spirits have
definitely been in your path.

35
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,141
What's the Kama Sutra,
anyway ?

36
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:50,549
Well, ancient Indians
believed that sex and survival

37
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:55,420
are the two fundamental forces
that drive human existence.

38
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,492
Having sex to
survive or...

39
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,829
surviving bad sex ?

40
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,965
No, baby, it's not about
good or bad sex,

41
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,569
it's about promoting
healthy relationships

42
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,637
between the sexes.

43
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,575
You think we have time to
promote our healthy,

44
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,677
intimate relationship ?

45
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,146
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
slow down, hot boy.

46
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,583
Listen, baby, tonight is really,
really important to me

47
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,519
and we're gonna
play a little game

48
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,490
and the results of tonight will
help me with my research paper.

49
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,325
So...

50
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,161
Cedar ?

51
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,197
Ooh, I forgot
about the food.

52
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,468
Man, this cedar smells
like my grandma's old wardrobe.

53
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,907
Hey, girl, it's me, hi.

54
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,409
I only have a couple minutes
before this board meeting,

55
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,676
but seriously...

56
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,078
<i>who would have thought a man's</i>
<i>22 shoe size</i>

57
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,413
<i>meant he</i>
<i>had a 2-inch pencil</i>

58
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,448
and could barely make
it past the two-minute mark ?

59
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,283
<i>Girl, I told you about</i>
<i>Devil Douche</i>

60
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,352
You can't trust
those basketball players.

61
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,787
<i>I mean, I would have</i>
<i>done better, you know,</i>

62
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,588
putting out my Mr. Muscle

63
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,457
and renting
a Boris Kodjoe flick.

64
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,794
Ooh, Boris Kodjoe.

65
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,629
Mm-mm-mm.

66
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,264
<i>Okay, I'm scared to ask.</i>

67
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,965
What is Mr. Muscle ?

68
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,200
My new vibrator.

69
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,436
Oh, you are too
out there, girl.

70
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,304
<i>Oh, oh, oh, I'm</i>
<i>out there ?</i>

71
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,773
This coming from
Ms. Kardashian and Ray J.

72
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,375
Okay, please <i>.</i>

73
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,211
<i>Oh, you don't remember, you're</i>
<i>the one who premiered</i>

74
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,713
the Randy and Tosha
sex tape last weekend.

75
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,948
Wait a minute,
wait, wait--

76
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,949
<i>Oh, you know, you were</i>
<i>hitting that bottle</i>

77
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,117
pretty hard.

78
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,052
We all came over for our
usual girls' night out

79
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,120
over at your place.

80
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,621
That I remember.

81
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,290
<i>And then you made us sit</i>
<i>down on your big floppy couch</i>

82
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,958
and we watched the DVD.

83
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,259
<i>No, wait, wait.</i>

84
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,461
That I don't remember--
what are you talking about ?

85
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,596
I played you the DVD ?

86
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,398
<i>One thing I will never</i>
<i>forget is 42 inches of HD</i>

87
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,567
of Randy and Tosha.

88
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,002
"Basic Instinct"
without the ice pick.

89
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,572
Oh, my God.

90
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,074
Randy would ice pick me
if he found that out.

91
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,442
Child, there's just one
thing I've been wanting

92
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,679
<i>How were you able to breathe</i>
<i>with the way his foot</i>

93
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,581
<i>was kind of--</i>
<i>I gotta go, I gotta go--</i>

94
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,648
-- kind of wrapped--

95
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,818
Hey, Bob.

96
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,853
Sandy.

97
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:08,954
Oh, my God.

98
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,055
Oh, my God.

99
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,427
Are those new glasses ?

100
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,429
Interesting.

101
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,498
I've got so much information.

102
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm gonna make you
two look so good.

103
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,642
( doorbell )

104
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,210
Oh, God.

105
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,346
( knocking )

106
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,117
I got it, baby.

107
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,285
Okay.

108
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,353
Hey !
Hey !

109
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,788
Just like white people,
always on time.

110
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,891
And it doesn't hurt that
we live right next door.

111
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,393
Hello.

112
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,628
Hey, how you doing ?

113
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,629
Good.

114
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,630
Oh hey, look at that.

115
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,365
Balance your life.

116
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,700
Elevate your mind.

117
00:08:55,702 --> 00:09:00,505
To you, bring harmony to
family, peace and love.

118
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,640
Lavender ?

119
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,742
No, it's more like-- like
a mix of Old Spice

120
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,344
and cheap French perfume.

121
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,746
What is that ?

122
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,916
Century-old potion that brings
about harmony to your life.

123
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,351
What's with the incense
and the decorations ?

124
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,153
Oh, we're gonna play a
little game tonight,

125
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,855
see what everybody
thinks about sex,

126
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,723
love, happiness and...

127
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,191
Nice !

128
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,760
Oh, that sounds
interesting.

129
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,728
I got a bottle of vintage wine
for the queen of the castle.

130
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,432
Wow, I see that those online
courses in wines and vineyards

131
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,767
has paid off, right ?

132
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,768
Oh, you know it.

133
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,103
And for the king of
the castle...

134
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,172
a majestic offering.

135
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,274
Ah !

136
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,443
I see those hanging with
the brothers in the hood courses

137
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,412
are paying off, too.

138
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:44,249
Andy, I thought you said
you were gonna make a salad.

139
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,617
I did.

140
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,019
I had to make Martin go
to the store and get some salad.

141
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,355
Hey, you want to help me grab a
couple things out of the car ?

142
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,890
Oh, just like
the white man.

143
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,759
Give you a bottle of Crown and
you're indebted to him for life.

144
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,761
Go easy on him.

145
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,096
I gotta sit.

146
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,732
Yeah, sit-- oh, Andy.

147
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,902
Yeah, Tosh, you know, they say
three is the charm,

148
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,637
I'll tell you,
four is a bitch.

149
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,139
I have had so much pressure
down there all day today.

150
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,809
Three times, I thought my
water was gonna break.

151
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,546
Andy, do you remember last
week at our girl's night out,

152
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,214
do you remember
seeing my sex video ?

153
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,782
Did I see it-- my God.

154
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,652
Girl, where'd you learn
to balance like that ?

155
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,121
Andy, please tell me
that you have it.

156
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,056
The DVD ?

157
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,124
Yes.

158
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,759
No, why would
I have that ?

159
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,728
Oh, goddammit-- Ahh !

160
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,129
What ?

161
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,731
Okay, okay.

162
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,732
What is the
matter with you ?

163
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,933
I'll talk to you
inside, just--

164
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,434
I need a moment,
I need a moment.

165
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,435
What ?

166
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,670
Let's go, go inside.

167
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,572
Oh.

168
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,675
No, no, don't.

169
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,077
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, what's wrong ?

170
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,246
Nothing.

171
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,015
Why don't you come help
me in the kitchen ?

172
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,531
She's just freaking
demanding in the bedroom, dude.

173
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,099
She's like a god damn
drill sergeant.

174
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,501
Up, down, up, down.

175
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,703
What are you
laughing about ?

176
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,872
She's not funny, man,
I got to beg her to be quiet.

177
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,040
I got kids in the house.

178
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,308
Yeah, Martin, how long has
Andrea been wearing

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,878
the pants in
the family, huh ?

180
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,559
Really ?

181
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,061
Yeah, I said no.

182
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,896
I think Gabby took
it with her.

183
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,031
Oh... God.

184
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,032
Take it easy.

185
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,500
What's the big deal ?

186
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,636
So Randy finds out that your
raunchy video went mainstream.

187
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,238
Randy doesn't know we
have a raunchy video.

188
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,074
Tosh !

189
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,811
Ooh, you dirty bitch !

190
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:56,214
And to top all that, I
really need to gain some insight

191
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,216
from this game that we
play tonight in order for me

192
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,751
to finish this
research paper in time.

193
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,186
Don't worry
about it, okay ?

194
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,554
I got your back, girl,
don't worry about it.

195
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,089
Listen to me--
listen, listen.

196
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,423
You gotta be cool.

197
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,493
You cannot let Randy
see you freaking out.

198
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,894
All right ?
All right.

199
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,931
Now help me go get
on that couch.

200
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,102
Grab those cookies.

201
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,905
Another Crown ?

202
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,774
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

203
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,175
I gotta swing
by the lab.

204
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,710
Swing by the lab ?

205
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,747
Martin, you promised...
not again.

206
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,115
I'll be gone two
hours, tops.

207
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:33,218
That's my husband:
over-dedicated to his job,

208
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,953
but not his pregnant wife
and three kids.

209
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,921
( Tosh )
No, no, no, love,
remember.

210
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,357
Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

211
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,126
To you bring harmony
of family,

212
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,628
love and peace.

213
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,263
I am a chemist.

214
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,965
There's always an experiment to
monitor, there's a--

215
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,634
You know, all this time
that you spend at the office,

216
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,770
what you're doing is you're
testing the experiment

217
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,871
that is our marriage.

218
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,307
I said, balance
your life,

219
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,477
elevate your mind, to
you, bring harmony,

220
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:04,149
family, love and
peace !

221
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,317
Okay.

222
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,155
The prophet says, the
body and the soul

223
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,890
are bonded together,

224
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,458
so the body and the
environment

225
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,894
are linked
together as well.

226
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,896
Okay ?

227
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,798
All right.

228
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,999
Fine, whatever.

229
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,500
Do what you do.

230
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,169
Oh.

231
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,249
Martin.

232
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,252
I'd be in trouble, too,
if I didn't set Tosha straight.

233
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,954
You ever see
"The Color Purple" ?

234
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,958
Well, there's a secret word to
making women do what you want,

235
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,327
and it ain't "Mister."

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,300
He's always gone.

237
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,801
He's leaving me with the
kids all the time,

238
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,369
I'm just sick of it.

239
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,772
Oh, come on, don't
stress, baby.

240
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,307
Tonight is
about having fun.

241
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,308
( doorbell )

242
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,410
Oh, let me get that.

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,014
Hi !
Hey, Tosha.

244
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,383
Gabby !
How are you, you
look great.

245
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,018
Thank you.

246
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,821
This is my friend Miles,
Miles, this is Tosha.

247
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,856
She's the lady
of the house.

248
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,390
What it do, Ma ?

249
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:24,062
I-- Don't I know you
from somewhere ?

250
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,334
I-- I think
I've seen you...

251
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,970
Um, Tosha.

252
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,473
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:40,245
Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

254
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:45,216
To you, give harmony
to peace love and happiness.

255
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,820
Hey, you're getting that on my
new Mariah fragrance.

256
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:49,888
What is that, anyway ?

257
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,991
It smells like vanilla.

258
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,325
Actually it smells
like bubble gum.

259
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:58,096
I can't even
smell my cologne anymore.

260
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,533
Tonight's party theme,
we are gonna explore sexuality,

261
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,436
love and romance and this is
gonna help.

262
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,838
Wow.

263
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,274
Sexuality.

264
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,776
The place looks
really nice.

265
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,012
Smells good and
everything, <i>que rica.</i>

266
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,114
Thank you.

267
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,850
Listen, I-- I gotta
take this call.

268
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,118
Can you put this on
the table for me ?

269
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,086
Thank you.

270
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,856
( spraying )

271
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,161
Come in.

272
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,872
Gabby, did I just hear you call
that young man, "baby" ?

273
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,107
Only because from here, he
actually looks like one.

274
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,476
Ha, ha, hello to
you, too.

275
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,548
Wow.
Oh my God.

276
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,651
So, Gabby, on our last
girls' night here ?

277
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,255
Did I let you
borrow my sex video ?

278
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,923
Mamita, you know what
y'all were doing

279
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,060
is outlawed
in other countries.

280
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,329
I mean, how the hell did
Randy get so flexible ?

281
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,264
So do you have it ?
No, no.

282
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,932
Oh.

283
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,801
So Gabby, what's up
with the little tyke ?

284
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,070
That young man is
my boyfriend.

285
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,104
Right, so let me guess.

286
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,240
You told him you
were 39 ?

287
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,909
Seven.

288
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,746
So I guess 45
is now the new 37.

289
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:25,650
You know damn well you haven't
seen 37 in almost a decade.

290
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,518
And girlfriend,
what is this ?

291
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,753
What ?

292
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,621
Is that from your
daughter's closet ?

293
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,789
You like my boots ?

294
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,524
What does she think about
you dating a boy

295
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,460
that's just four
years older than she is ?

296
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,195
<i>Por favor,</i> we went to the
club the other night

297
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,296
on a double date.

298
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,631
Oh, my God, not only
are you robbing the cradle,

299
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,633
but you're taking it
clubbing, too ?

300
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,603
Look, I didn't come here so
y'all could give me a hard time.

301
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,139
I just wanted y'all to
meet him and be happy for me.

302
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,842
Listen, you guys, I need
to find this DVD.

303
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,876
What about Kim ?

304
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,779
I asked her already,
she doesn't have it.

305
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:55,780
What's the big
deal anyway ?

306
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,048
You can barely
see your faces.

307
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,051
It's the other body parts
that I'm worried about.

308
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,519
Look, don't worry.

309
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,720
Continue with
your night.

310
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,122
Stick to your plans.

311
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,189
You've got that
paper due.

312
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,991
Sweetie, you've
got to stay focused.

313
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,226
Yeah.
Yeah.

314
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,394
As soon as
everyone arrives,

315
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,462
we'll figure out where
the movie is.

316
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,766
Randy will never
find out, okay ?

317
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,235
Excuse me, ladies.

318
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,903
Here you go, Mami.

319
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,571
Gracias, Papi.

320
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,707
<i>Ah, te quiero mucho.</i>

321
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,243
<i>Y yo a ti.</i>

322
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,247
Oh, he is right
to call you "Mommy."

323
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,649
Cut it out before
he hears you.

324
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,252
Excuse me, young man,
I didn't get your name.

325
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,887
I'm Randy, Tosha's
husband.

326
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,157
Oh, cool, nice to meet
you, I'm Miles.

327
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,758
Martin-- what's up ?

328
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,827
Not much, being
easy, man.

329
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,230
True dat, true dat, I am
doing the same.

330
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,165
That's my wife
Andrea over here.

331
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,834
She-- she be easy, too.

332
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,170
Wow.

333
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,571
What do you do, man ?

334
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,106
Oh, what do I do ?

335
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,709
I'm learning to invest,
invest my money.

336
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,710
Oh, smart.

337
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,845
Do you talk with
a financial analyst,

338
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,447
like at Schwab or
Merrill Lynch ?

339
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,450
Nah, I'm meeting with my
financial professor...

340
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,118
yeah, over at GSU.

341
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,686
GSU ?
Yes.

342
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,054
You're a college
student.

343
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,122
Yeah.

344
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,257
So what are you, 20,
21, tops ?

345
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,260
No, I'm 25.

346
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,197
Yeah, I'm a
grad student.

347
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,702
So where'd you
meet Gabby ?

348
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,804
Ah, Gabby.

349
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,072
She's hot, right ?

350
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,308
She's beautiful.
Yeah.

351
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,877
Well, you know, one night,
I needed to get out, you know.

352
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,313
I had a long work
week, you know.

353
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,914
You mean-- you
mean schoolwork ?

354
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,316
Right, right.
Gotcha.

355
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,951
So you know, I crept
in this place.

356
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,253
The music
was bangin', you know,

357
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,155
everybody's having a good
time, socializing.

358
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,456
But I wanted
to lay back.

359
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,127
You know, peep the spot out for
places to post up, you know ?

360
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,128
Of course.

361
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,262
You know, for the
rest of the night.

362
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,131
And there she was, man.

363
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,133
She's looking good at the
bar waiting on a drink.

364
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,400
Gabby.
Gabby.

365
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,070
So before she had a chance
to pull out her wallet

366
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,806
and pay for her drink,

367
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,008
I whipped out the
plastic, you know ?

368
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,144
Instantly.

369
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,981
And I'm like,
"No, let me, I insist."

370
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,949
She was so excited,
you know Gabby.

371
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,152
She's like,
"Oh <i>gracias,</i> Papi."

372
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,655
And you know I'm like,
"It's <i>nada</i> ."

373
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,789
You know, "nada."

374
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,158
Right, right, right,
right, right

375
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,626
You know, in Spanish, that
means it's nothing,

376
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:22,994
you know what I mean ?

377
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,096
So we sat there, you
know, and we talked and chatted

378
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:29,433
until about, I say 11:00,
when the place closed.

379
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,637
A hopping club
closed at 11:00 ?

380
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,306
Club ?

381
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,441
We were at Starbucks.

382
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,143
Yeah.

383
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,278
The coffee place.

384
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah.

385
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,382
It's a great place
to meet the ladies.

386
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,684
And free Internet, too.

387
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,952
Right.

388
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:48,986
Wow.
Y'all gotta step
your game up.

389
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,021
Y'all are married, right ?

390
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,489
Y'all-- You don't know--?

391
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,523
I gotta get in the game.

392
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,658
Right.

393
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,326
And those cards ?

394
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,194
What ?

395
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,562
Gift cards come
in handy.

396
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,031
Starbucks.
Yeah.

397
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,366
You want something
else to drink ?

398
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,335
Apparently a macchiato
of some sort.

399
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,204
Apparently.

400
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,673
There's a Starbucks
on the corner, right ?

401
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,341
( laughing )

402
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,243
( Miles )
Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.

403
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,178
Wow.

404
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,448
You need--
Yeah.

405
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,322
Did she move or
paint her house ?

406
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,161
Dr. Simmons , I know you got
your eye on me now.

407
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,998
There it is.

408
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,252
Oh boy, she pretty.

409
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,022
Never quit.

410
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,269
Are you okay ?

411
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,405
I'm fine.

412
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,574
Kind of a strange
place to put a curb.

413
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,776
I've never seen parking
like that before.

414
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,212
Oh, I'm James Brown.

415
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:22,713
That's your name ?

416
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,215
As the Godfather
of Soul.

417
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,217
Hey !
Hey.

418
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,385
And you are ?

419
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:32,156
I'm Liz Simmons, as in
godmother of all things holy.

420
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,157
Shonda.

421
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,159
( door bell ringing )

422
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,395
Hey, guys.

423
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,496
Hey, girl.

424
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,764
Hi.

425
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh girl, you gotta get
that driveway fixed.

426
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,468
What are you talking--

427
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,337
Don't ask.

428
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,439
I brought something
for tonight's special occasion.

429
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,642
Well, so did I.

430
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,413
Hot damn, that smells
like new leather.

431
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,414
And I'm a loner.

432
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,748
I don't bring sand
to the beach.

433
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,917
Okay.

434
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,522
Oh, Gabby.

435
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,458
Oh my God, look at you.

436
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,193
How long has it been ?

437
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,496
Oh, don't you
look beautiful.

438
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,166
How are you and
the boys doing ?

439
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,335
These last two years have
been pretty trying

440
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,704
to say the least.

441
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,641
Oh, with my beloved
Reverend Dr. Simmons

442
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,377
ascending into heaven,

443
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,847
the rightful place
next to his father.

444
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,116
My boys going off to school,
on their own.

445
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,285
Wow.

446
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:38,322
Well, I've gotten
closer to my father.

447
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,459
My savior.

448
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,462
Oh, my Jesus Christ.

449
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:49,367
He is my alpha
and my omega.

450
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:54,839
My beginning and my end,
but for his grace.

451
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:58,376
Ooh, I would not
be here, I praise him.

452
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:03,647
Ooh, I praise him, Lord,
♪ I love the Lord

453
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:08,519
♪ He heard my cries

454
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:12,022
Oh, Jesus, glory, thank
you God almighty !

455
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,324
Hello.

456
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:16,560
Oh, thank you.

457
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,528
Hey, James.

458
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,163
Hey, Andrea.

459
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,998
Look like you about to have that
knucklehead any moment now.

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,001
Oh yeah, trying to kick
its way out as we speak.

461
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,836
Gabby.

462
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,572
You look as
lovely as ever.

463
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,074
So you ready to take
a brother out ?

464
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,944
Yes, with my 9mm,
but it's illegal.

465
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,013
Why do you keep fighting ?

466
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,183
You know you want this.

467
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,786
Fellas.

468
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,726
Oh.

469
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,628
Ah-ah !

470
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,563
That had better
be holy water.

471
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,465
Be come spraying me with
no foolishness.

472
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:58,002
Well, it's not holy
but it's definitely spiritual.

473
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,605
Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

474
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,576
To you give harmony to family,
love and peace.

475
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:09,113
Now you're gonna have me
smelling like Red Hots.

476
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,648
You gotta excuse
her, Liz.

477
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,417
She's a little on edge.

478
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,552
What's wrong ?

479
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,620
Randy and I made
a sex video

480
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,422
and me and the
ladies watched it last week

481
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,924
and now I can't find it.

482
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:23,627
Oh, dear Jesus in heaven,
bless this child.

483
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,398
Randy's sure gonna bless her
once he finds out, <i>de verdad</i> .

484
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,533
Randy doesn't know ?

485
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:35,406
Oh dear Lord, please show this
woman the error of her ways.

486
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:38,642
What the hell are you
doing making a sex tape ?

487
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,678
Well, I was taking
an online course.

488
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,147
I thought it would be fun
for us to have our own movie.

489
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,282
Well, where's the last
place you saw it ?

490
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,285
Here, in our ladies'
night last week.

491
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,687
And neither of
you two took it ?

492
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,289
No.

493
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,791
What about Kimberly ?

494
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,693
You know, I wouldn't put
it past that bitch.

495
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,094
Watch your mouth.

496
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,195
Just saying.

497
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,698
Look, Kim definitely
doesn't have it.

498
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,266
Are you sure Randy
doesn't have it ?

499
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:05,669
Trust me, if Randy had
it, I would know it.

500
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,973
I just hope and pray that he
doesn't find it before I do.

501
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,941
Well, you should be in
here tearing this house up

502
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,176
looking for that thing.

503
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,345
I am, but I just don't
want Randy to think

504
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,679
that something is going on

505
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,515
so we have got
to be discreet.

506
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,616
Discreet ?

507
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,484
You should have
been discreet.

508
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,622
Making that old
sin-filled sex movie.

509
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:28,726
Why don't you just be
honest and just tell Randy ?

510
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,494
Bitch, are you crazy ?

511
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,296
I'm just saying.

512
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,731
I mean, you're already
in enough trouble.

513
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:34,565
You might as
well cut your losses.

514
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,704
Oh...

515
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,741
Ooh !

516
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,677
Whose little cute
nephew is that ?

517
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,546
He's my date.

518
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,548
Your date ?

519
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,250
That baby ain't nothing
but about 20 years old.

520
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,818
He's 25.

521
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,821
Okay, and you're 45.

522
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,858
Oh my God, you're over
here making these sex movies

523
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
and you're dating
Nickelodeon.

524
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,595
Oh Lord, I've
been gone too long.

525
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:07,231
The devil done moved
up in this house.

526
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,999
He's my man and
I'm his woman.

527
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,067
What's the big hoopla ?

528
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,770
We're just dating,
having fun.

529
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,838
<i>Y esta buenissimo</i>
<i>en la cama.</i>

530
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,106
What does that mean ?

531
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,609
That means they
have good sex.

532
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,744
I am thirsty.

533
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,180
Drink this.

534
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,786
Tosha, there better not be any
alcohol in this.

535
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,355
You know I don't let
that sin penetrate my lips.

536
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,223
Something penetrated
your lips.

537
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,092
You got two boys.

538
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,728
( laughing )

539
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,598
I'm gonna say a special
prayer for you.

540
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,232
You better
be lucky I'm saved.

541
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,934
Drink up, girl,
drink up.

542
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,603
Mm-hmm.

543
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,943
Oh, I gotta swing
by the lab, guys.

544
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,447
I got a project producing
catalysts for use in production.

545
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,782
The way you jumped up,
look like you

546
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,951
about to meet
a nice piece of tail.

547
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,952
What ?

548
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,953
No.

549
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,954
No, not a woman.

550
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,223
It's a computer,
filled with data.

551
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,658
I'll be back
in a little while.

552
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,095
Hey, Andy will have a shit fit
if she sees me leaving.

553
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,163
You care if I slip
out the back door ?

554
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,898
You gonna sneak out
without telling your wife ?

555
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
Man, she gonna slide your
ass on the couch

556
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,635
when you get
home tonight.

557
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,902
No, she'll be fine.

558
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,005
Why don't you just try
telling Andrea the truth ?

559
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,374
It works for Tosha
and I.

560
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,846
I'm gonna take my chances
with the backdoor.

561
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,014
Okay, my friend,
it must be important

562
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,248
because I've seen you
coming and going

563
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,816
all hours of the night.

564
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,284
No, I'm busy.

565
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,621
I hope your couch is
really comfortable.

566
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:38,989
Oh, hey, man.

567
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,524
I'm James Brown.

568
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,792
I'm Miles Whittaker.

569
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:42,826
Nice to meet you, sir.

570
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,927
Hi.

571
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,864
Miles here is
with Gabby.

572
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,600
My Gabby ?

573
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,668
Oh, you must be
with her daughter.

574
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,503
Terry's friend.

575
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,673
Actually, I'm her date,
Mr. Brown.

576
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,508
No.

577
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,842
Yeah.

578
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,846
Ah.

579
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:07,885
You can't be no more
than, what, 20 ?

580
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,187
25, sir.

581
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,190
Oh.

582
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,326
Oh, yeah, I gotta go.

583
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,128
I'll be back.

584
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,230
Okay.

585
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,735
Yeah, okay.

586
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,912
( Andy )
Where could he be going ?

587
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,047
Listen, you're pregnant,
you do not need this, okay ?

588
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,482
No, I don't need this.

589
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,884
But that makes
absolutely no sense.

590
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,386
Listen, Andy, the quicker
he leaves,

591
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,855
the faster he'll
return, okay, relax.

592
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,758
It's fine, it's fine,
I got you, okay ?

593
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,394
Oh, stop spraying me with
that wit that rosewater

594
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,829
and quit chanting.

595
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,897
There is no balance
in my life.

596
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,033
I am like a
frickin' psycho right now.

597
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,068
There is no harmony,
there is no peace,

598
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,737
and I have
questionable love,

599
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,972
or maybe you haven't noticed.

600
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,777
Okay then, damn.

601
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,754
<i>( Jeff )</i>
<i>You always give</i>
<i>me a hard time.</i>

602
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:17,955
I'm not doing this
with you, Jeff.

603
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,389
No, no, no, stop, don't
interrupt me.

604
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,390
Do not--

605
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,892
No, you've
had three months.

606
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,861
We've been divorced
for three months.

607
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,797
Get your shit out
of my house, please.

608
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
<i>You're always giving me a</i>
<i>hard time, you know that ?</i>

609
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,567
You should have made
the time, okay ?

610
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,735
You should have
made the time.

611
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,103
You're just doing
this to fuck with me.

612
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,105
You have 30 days to get
your shoes, your pants,

613
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,573
your cufflinks, your
little gadgets,

614
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:40,244
all that shit, I want it
out, I want it out !
<i>Yo, yo, yo, whatever.</i>

615
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,478
Or I swear, I
will go Angela Bassett

616
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,880
in "Waiting to Exhale"
on your ass.

617
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:43,881
<i>Hush.</i>

618
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,949
Try me !
<i>( Jeff laughing )</i>

619
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,992
What was that about ?

620
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:58,228
Man, I opened my heart up
to Gabby, man, and--

621
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,798
And she took a
bite out of it.

622
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,833
Yeah.

623
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:08,071
You know, in the Tantra, I was
told that sexuality is total.

624
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,406
It's full of bliss.

625
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,910
It's not about sex.

626
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,945
Man, what are you
talking about ?

627
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,015
It's obvious that Gabby
and that boy

628
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,349
are fucking
like jackrabbits,

629
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:24,855
but maybe, just maybe, she's
falling in love, too.

630
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,924
You sound like Oprah,

631
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,625
but you look
like Ali Baba.

632
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,127
( laughing )

633
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,330
Do I have a choice ?

634
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,665
Thanks, man.

635
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,166
You got it.

636
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,168
Just let it go.

637
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,504
God, Jesus.

638
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,708
He's not answering.

639
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,610
Who, Martin ?

640
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,012
No, the Pope.

641
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,014
Yeah, Martin.

642
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,983
( Gabby )
Andy, quit nagging
already.

643
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,052
I mean, maybe Martin
needed a break from you.

644
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,987
Oh shut up,
Nanny McPhee.

645
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,056
Isn't it time for
his nap ?

646
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:02,159
Tosha, can you please
get me some more punch.

647
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,561
Girl, you put your
foot in that.

648
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,563
Sure thing.

649
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,767
( Kimberly)
Oh, ugh.

650
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,904
Damn girl, don't you
know how to knock ?

651
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:14,905
Oh you know what,
don't even,

652
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,139
don't even start
with me, okay ?

653
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,875
I just had to hike past
three houses

654
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,744
'cause some beat-up
rusty old Volkswagen

655
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,179
is parked in my spot.

656
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,914
Hey, that's my
first car.

657
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,515
I am trying to
build my credit.

658
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,650
Okay...

659
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,018
Who is that and why
is he talking to me ?

660
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,419
Seriously ?

661
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,988
And Gabby, why the hell
are you hugged up with someone

662
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,890
who looks like he's
half your age ?

663
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,425
Because he's my
boyfriend.

664
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,095
Oh, God, Oh, God, please.

665
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,097
I can't take any more
high drama today.

666
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,932
Tosha, ome on, honey.

667
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,534
Make your girl something
strong and hard.

668
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,004
Please, now, please.

669
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,574
Guys, I'm so--

670
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,675
I'm just so done.

671
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,678
I am just so over Jeff,
he is so pompous.

672
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,113
( Andy )
What's he done now ?

673
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,849
Finding ultra-creative
ways to piss me off.

674
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:01,518
If I don't ever see him
again, it'll be too soon.

675
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,056
Okay, pass that to her.

676
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,124
Give it to me.

677
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,426
And here you
are, Madame.

678
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,129
Why the hell do you look
like Florida Evans ?

679
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,231
( Tosha )
Oh, we're gonna
play a little game tonight

680
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:17,567
in accordance to this course
that I'm taking.

681
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,136
Kama Sutra.

682
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,705
I'm just waiting for
everybody else to get here.

683
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:25,208
Okay, well,
everyone's here.

684
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,611
Okay, here we go.

685
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,813
Oh !

686
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,149
Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

687
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:37,120
To you, bring harmony
to family, love and peace.

688
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,891
Oh, smells like
new money to me.

689
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,993
You would say that.

690
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,831
What's her problem ?

691
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,066
Martin.

692
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,501
Oh, out of town
again, huh ?

693
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:56,440
So, sweetie,
what's your name ?

694
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,808
His name is Miles.

695
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,942
Gabby.

696
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,110
It looks like he has a
mouth, I think he can

697
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,913
speak for himself,
okay ?

698
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,582
So how old are you ?

699
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,184
25.

700
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,419
25, huh.

701
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,654
Good year.

702
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,490
I have a Prada stilettos
older than you.

703
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,860
Well, I guess the devil
really does wear Prada.

704
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,595
( laughing )

705
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,665
It's really
sad, you know.

706
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,268
You're that desperate that
you have to date a teen.

707
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,503
You should know
desperate.

708
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,273
Didn't Jeff leave your
trifling ass behind ?

709
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,441
Please.

710
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,542
( Tosh )
Hey-- hey, hey, hey, hey.

711
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,277
Play nice, ladies, okay ?

712
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,614
Leave it to Kim
to go for the jugular.

713
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:38,849
Oh.

714
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,685
Honey, don't even start
with me, knocked up, okay ?

715
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm surprised Martin
even had time

716
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,355
to get your
little self pregnant,

717
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,358
seeing that he's always
working, huh ?

718
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,527
Oh, do not go there
with me, bitch,

719
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,497
'cause I am in no mood
for your bougie ass tonight.

720
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,134
Okay, this is
getting good.

721
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,402
( Tosh )
Okay, okay !

722
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,370
Enough, enough.

723
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,205
And take it easy, okay ?

724
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,041
You're gonna end up
having a miscarriage.

725
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,309
She better keep my man's
name out of her mouth.

726
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,744
You better keep your
finger out of my face

727
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:08,912
and put a pretzel in it.

728
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:09,913
Oh, shut up.

729
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,914
Listen, listen, shh !

730
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,416
Just peace, love !

731
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,384
Happiness !

732
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,759
Bitch.
( Kim )
Slut.

733
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,262
Y'all are rowdy.

734
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,164
Is it like this
all the time ?

735
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,599
Papi, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

736
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,104
( clicking )

737
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,251
What the hell
are you doing ?

738
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,088
I'm trying to get the
score from the games.

739
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,222
The only game
I'm concerned about is

740
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:55,092
what that boy is playing
with my Gabby.

741
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,983
All right, all right, I know
what you're gonna say,

742
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:23,487
okay, I know it, Tosha,
but that bitch, she started it.

743
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,123
Well, which bitch is that,

744
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,091
because apparently, we're all
bitches to you

745
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,393
and you seem to be
the only one in bitch mode.

746
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,295
All right,
look, I'm sorry, okay ?

747
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,164
I'm sorry, but I'm
stressed, Tosha.

748
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,266
Jeff keeps wiggling his
way back into my life,

749
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,168
leaving stuff in
my house purposefully

750
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,737
just so he'll have an excuse
to just pop back in there.

751
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,173
I'm just-- It's a lot.

752
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,175
You're stressed.
Yeah.

753
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,810
You said you
were stressed.

754
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,678
Can't you see it ?

755
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,281
I've got a friend out
there who's dating the boy

756
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,850
from the "Karate Kid" remake.

757
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,520
I've also got a friend
out there who's pregnant

758
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,456
whose husband continues
to dip out on her.

759
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,359
Let's not
forget about my friend

760
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,262
who's the freakin'
Jesus freak.

761
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,535
And I also have a friend who
cares more about her feelings

762
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,370
than anybody else's.

763
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,971
Not to mention...

764
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,206
Not to mention...
Okay.

765
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,309
that I have a research
paper that's due in two days

766
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:23,213
that still sits incomplete,
which, by the way,

767
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,149
is the reason why I'm
giving this little get-together

768
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:30,554
in order to play a game based
on love and happiness

769
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,857
when there's not one,
not one little ounce of--

770
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,959
shred of love
or happiness

771
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,195
coming from this household !
You know what ?

772
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:41,464
And I also have to come to
grips with the fact

773
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,202
that there is a
movie, a sex video,

774
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,338
a tape of me and
my husband

775
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,041
just floating around out
there somewhere in cyberspace.

776
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,343
I don't know where it is,
and you're telling me

777
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,812
that you're stressed ?

778
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,180
Oh, God.

779
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,216
Look at me, look at me.

780
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,251
Look at me, look at me.

781
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,852
Give me that !

782
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,889
Okay, I'm just trying to
get you to calm down.

783
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,357
It's too much, Tosha.

784
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,493
You're gonna wear
yourself out, okay ?

785
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,062
What is this on
my forehead ?

786
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,163
It's driving me nuts.

787
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,264
I have no idea and
it's awful,

788
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,900
it does not even
go with this whole ensemble.

789
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,501
( Andy )
So no luck, huh ?

790
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:22,272
You sure you looked
everywhere ?

791
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,345
I took the DVD.

792
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,451
Why ?

793
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,787
I don't know, it was there
and I wanted to see it again.

794
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:42,225
Kind of see if maybe you knew
moves that I didn't know.

795
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:45,295
Oh, that's got to be the
stupidest way

796
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,597
you could have
answered that question.

797
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,134
Okay, it's fine.

798
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,737
So where's the DVD now ?

799
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,705
I don't know.

800
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,041
Now, that's the stupidest way
you could have answered

801
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,476
that question.

802
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,444
I think one of my daughters
maybe got a hold of it,

803
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,114
I drilled them, asked them and
they said they didn't have it.

804
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,415
You know, they promised me
they didn't have it,

805
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,150
I searched the
house up and down.

806
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,052
Gabriella,
Gabriella, wait-- Shh !

807
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,754
Gabriella, just give me
a moment !

808
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:13,089
But I couldn't find it.

809
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,926
So you're telling me
that you stole my DVD

810
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,896
and then you left it where
your teenage daughters

811
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,499
could find it
and then you lost it

812
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,502
all because you didn't
want to ask me to use it ?

813
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,936
Because you know what ?

814
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:32,108
Had you asked me to use
it, I would have simply said no.

815
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,410
You know what ?

816
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,744
I'm lost for words.

817
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:35,845
How about that ?

818
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,514
Calm down, calm down.
I'm lost for words.

819
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,349
She gave it to her
teenage daughters.
I know, I know.

820
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,251
Her teenage
daughter saw it.
I know, I know.

821
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:44,020
What, did she put it on
her little Twitter account ?

822
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,588
You know what ?

823
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,825
This doesn't surprise
me, Gabriella.

824
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,493
This doesn't
surprise me.

825
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,830
So you forgive me ?

826
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,334
I wish...

827
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,969
I wish that I could have
you fucking deported right now.

828
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:03,106
Do you know what's gonna
happen if Randy finds out...
Hey, mami, that's harsh.

829
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,841
about that movie ?

830
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,310
Tosha, calm down, Tosha.
Oh my God, oh my God.

831
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,311
Count to ten, count to ten.
Oh my God.

832
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,479
Listen, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie,

833
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,015
you cannot have her
deported, okay, okay ?

834
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,118
You could kill her,
which I would do.

835
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,453
I know people.

836
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,722
I'm sorry, Tosha.

837
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,491
You're sorry,
you're sorry.

838
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:27,964
I think we are so far
past an apology, Gabby.

839
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,566
I mean, like I said
before, you can barely tell.

840
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:32,068
You can't even see the
faces of who's in the movie.

841
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,538
( Miles )
Right, you can only ass
and tits.

842
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,510
Quick question.

843
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:46,049
How did you get both arms
and legs over your--

844
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,486
You let this boy
see my movie ?

845
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,354
No, no !

846
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,423
Nah, nah, shorty,
listen, listen.

847
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,225
She didn't let
me see anything.

848
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,394
Calm down, it's not
even that serious.

849
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,195
You can't even
see your face.

850
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,331
Well, how'd you
see it, boy toy ?

851
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,665
Look, I saw it online.

852
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,734
Oh !

853
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,505
Oh, God, oh, God !
( mouthing a prayer )

854
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,873
Get me a wet rag,
get me a wet rag.

855
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:13,710
Somebody get me a wet
rag, wet the towel.
I'm busy.

856
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:14,944
( Kim )
Use the spray.

857
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,379
( Gabby )
I shouldn't have
done that.

858
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:17,747
( Kim )
Stop... yeah, wipe
her down, wipe her down.

859
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,082
You're drunk, Liz.

860
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,850
No, I do not drink.

861
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,585
You don't drink ?

862
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,753
No, that's like...

863
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,522
Well, what's in that glass
you've been sipping on

864
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,956
for two days?

865
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,459
( Tosh )
Randy's gonna hear,
Randy's gonna hear.

866
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,470
Tosha, baby,
snap out of it.

867
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:42,238
Tosha, Tosha.

868
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,907
Baby, answer me.

869
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,042
Tosh.

870
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,811
You see what you did ?

871
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,814
Randy's gonna
divorce me.

872
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,283
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

873
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,484
No, no, no, no.

874
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:59,489
Randy loves you.

875
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,492
Now, he might not
love seeing what God

876
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:07,897
blessed him with on the
computer screen.

877
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,935
God did bless
him, right ?

878
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:16,005
Anyway, he ain't gonna
leave you, baby.

879
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,607
I got the word here.

880
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,943
A little something
for the occasion.

881
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,077
( Kim )
Listen.

882
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,979
Randy is not gonna
find out, okay ?

883
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,113
We're gonna make
sure that he doesn't

884
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,582
get on the Internet,
all right ?

885
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:26,616
And you're
gonna make some calls

886
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:30,019
and get this thing
taken down, okay, okay.

887
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,120
( Andy )
Doesn't he have
an iPhone ?

888
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,957
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get
it, I'll get it.

889
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,493
Liz, be subtle.

890
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:42,298
About as subtle as the Holy
Spirit whispering in your ear.

891
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,601
( Kim )
Oh Lord, you need to
put that drink down.

892
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:48,938
You know, you ain't been to
church in a hot minute.

893
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,341
Listen, we're gonna get
everybody together, okay ?

894
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,109
Tosh, we're gonna play this
little game of yours,

895
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,277
all right ?

896
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,712
And that way you can make
sure that Randy

897
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,648
doesn't get on the
Internet, all right, okay ?

898
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,484
But you have got to get out
of this funk, all right,

899
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,520
or else he's gonna
suspect something.

900
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,688
Tosha, do you hear me ?

901
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,690
Yes, yes, you're right, you're
right, you're right.

902
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,493
I just have to
keep him distracted.

903
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,897
I could have it taken down
in the morning, right ?

904
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:15,198
Yeah.

905
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,232
( Andy )
Yeah, yeah.

906
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,201
Okay... Okay, listen
to me, Gabby.

907
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,503
Go to my bedroom and
disconnect the Internet.

908
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:21,538
Okay.

909
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,872
Please.

910
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,873
All right.

911
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,476
Man, I ain't no
player hater.

912
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,413
The hell does that mean ?

913
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:31,681
It means that he's
not a snitch,

914
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,516
he's not gonna rat
you out.

915
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,985
Right.... I feel you, Ma.

916
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,687
That means "yeah."

917
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:40,290
Oh, God.

918
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,497
( clicking )

919
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,668
Liz, what are you doing ?

920
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,771
Tosha needs your phone.

921
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,940
Tosha has a phone.

922
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,613
The Bible says as the man
of the house,

923
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:06,783
when your wife says
she needs your phone,

924
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,586
you don't ask no questions,

925
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,689
you just give it
to her.

926
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,691
Liz, what is going on ?

927
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:17,727
Give me back my phone.

928
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:18,761
No questions.

929
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,598
No questioning.

930
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:23,800
You got it, you got it ?

931
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:24,867
Okay, good.

932
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,936
( Tosh )
Oh my God.
Okay, you ready ?

933
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,937
Okay.
You ready ?

934
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,072
Yeah.
Focus on me.

935
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,473
Okay, here we go.

936
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,474
Jazz hands.

937
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:32,575
Jazz hands.

938
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:33,743
Okay.
Let's do it.

939
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:34,911
We're good.

940
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,613
( Kim )
All right...
Got it, girl, got it.

941
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,947
Should we do a toast
first, maybe ?

942
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,449
You don't need any
more toasting.

943
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,217
Look at--
you are toasted.

944
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,452
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah !

945
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,253
That is my special blend.

946
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,222
Your special blend ?
You're just jealous.

947
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,423
Your special blend
has you jacked up.

948
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:48,625
Whatever, Tosha made
this for me

949
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,461
'cause she loves
me more than she loves you.

950
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,339
Baby, you still
have my phone ?

951
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,641
Yeah, baby, yeah.

952
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,009
We're about to
start the game.

953
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:07,810
You can't use your
phone anyway.

954
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,247
Okay, so the game is
called the Great Divide.

955
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,849
So why the Great Divide ?

956
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,686
Because it deals with
love, sex, romance and such

957
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,521
between the genders.

958
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:20,990
I heard love and sex,
so let's continue.

959
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,125
( doorbell )

960
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:23,826
Oh, let me get that.

961
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,094
It better be Martin.

962
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,429
I thought everybody
was here.

963
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:27,864
Okay.

964
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,599
I need a refill.

965
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,802
Anybody... anybody ?

966
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,470
So y'all gonna
leave me hanging ?

967
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,805
You don't need anymore.

968
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,974
Okay.

969
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,109
Hey.

970
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,477
Baby, who is it ?

971
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,478
Jeff.

972
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,781
Jeff as in Kimberly's
ex-husband, Jeff,

973
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:47,483
and he has the gall to
bring some hussie with him ?

974
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,651
Tosha, calm down.

975
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,354
I told him last week
about the engagement

976
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,723
and he said he was
gonna be out of town.

977
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,461
Hey, man.

978
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,363
Hey, Tosha.

979
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,132
Randy.

980
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,901
My goodness.

981
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:06,736
Come on.

982
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,074
Hi.

983
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:12,408
Hi.

984
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,680
This is my very, very good
friend, Evelyn Vasquez.

985
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:21,851
This is Tosha and
Randy Landry.

986
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:22,852
How you doing ?

987
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,188
You wouldn't know that,
'cause she closed the door

988
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,422
in our faces.

989
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,926
Well, Jeff has told me so
much about you guys.

990
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:33,730
Well, I made you guys some
taquitos, they're handmade.

991
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,231
They're really good.
So good, so good.

992
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,499
Thank you.

993
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,134
Thank you.

994
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,673
Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

995
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:46,209
Give harmony to you--

996
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,777
Oh, whatever.

997
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,278
After you, please.

998
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,379
Balance your mind ?

999
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,681
What the hell
was that about ?

1000
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,783
I thought you said you
were gonna be out of town.

1001
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,085
Well, trip got canceled,
so I'm here.

1002
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,287
Who's that ?

1003
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,857
I know.

1004
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,458
It's hard.

1005
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,763
Hey, hi.

1006
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,932
It's a pleasure to meet
you all, especially you, Kim.

1007
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,934
( laughing )

1008
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,369
I can't say I
feel the same.

1009
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:16,305
Okay, so... everybody.

1010
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,775
( spraying )

1011
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:23,880
Why don't we balance
our lives, elevate our minds.

1012
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:28,818
To you, give harmony to
family, love and peace.

1013
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,921
You know, the more you
spray that, it smells like

1014
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:34,557
lotus blossoms
in the spring.

1015
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,326
I detect a hint of musk.

1016
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:42,131
( Kim )
That's so interesting,
because I detect a scent, too.

1017
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,001
And it smells
awful like shit.

1018
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:47,837
Okay, Randy, why don't you
go and escort Jeff and Evelyn

1019
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,439
over to our bar so they can
partake in spirits.

1020
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:51,440
( Randy )
Sure thing.

1021
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,809
Thank you, baby.

1022
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,950
Kim, relax.

1023
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,518
Calm down.

1024
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,120
No drama.

1025
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:05,822
Okay, okay, I'm fine.

1026
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,924
Please !
Okay, fine.

1027
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:09,525
I'm trying to
elevate stuff.

1028
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:10,927
You know, had I known his
trifling ass was gonna be here,

1029
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,029
I wouldn't have come.

1030
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:15,131
But I can handle
this, okay ?

1031
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,599
I'm fine.

1032
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:20,803
If he was my man, I would
have kicked her ass.

1033
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,005
Well, that's
his ex, right ?

1034
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,675
Still.

1035
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,511
The last thing you want to
do is piss off a woman.

1036
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:34,217
Hell knoweth no fury
like a woman scorned.

1037
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,986
( Miles )
But why kick her ass ?

1038
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,021
'Cause I save my
bullets for him.

1039
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,623
You'd shoot the boy ?

1040
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,826
Like a rabid dog.

1041
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:46,028
( Andy )
You seen "Old Yeller" ?

1042
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,964
Woof, woof, woof.

1043
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,833
Papi, you have nothing
to worry about, okay ?

1044
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,035
Jeff is a piece of shit.

1045
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,670
And you're a good man.

1046
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,073
Randy, can you start the
music, please, baby ?

1047
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:00,142
Okay, Evelyn, I'll
need you to stand by Gabriella

1048
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:04,013
and Jeff, I need you to
stand over by Randy.

1049
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,381
Okay.

1050
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,051
The object of this game
is for men to challenge women

1051
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,854
with a clear definition
of the statements

1052
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:15,424
that are written on these
marked cards in the basket.

1053
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,226
( Andy )
That sounds like fun.

1054
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,561
I'm sure it does...

1055
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,429
south of the border.

1056
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,832
Kim.

1057
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,835
I didn't know she
spoke Spanish.

1058
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:28,037
So Tosha, does this game
have anything to do

1059
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:32,008
with the lavender --
you've been doing all night ?

1060
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,076
Smell like...

1061
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,078
... Red Hots to me.

1062
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,782
I smelled vanilla.

1063
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,384
( Kim )
Oh, please, y'all
are tripping.

1064
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:43,185
That smells
like new money.

1065
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:45,955
I could have sworn it
smells like bubble gum.

1066
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,027
Did I hear you
say bubble gum ?

1067
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:54,063
Yeah, that's
what I smell.

1068
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,632
We both know why,
don't we, J ?

1069
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:02,071
Well, if you must know, this
potion is from another country.

1070
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,706
The purpose of
this potion

1071
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,043
is to bring out the true
character through smell,

1072
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:10,980
and obviously, all of you have
smelled something different.

1073
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,949
Okay, so back
to the game.

1074
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,817
You will noticed different
colored numbers

1075
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,052
as you're picking.

1076
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:18,120
The blue numbers are
questions and statements

1077
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,990
that relate to feelings
men have about women.

1078
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,426
And the pink numbers
represent the feelings

1079
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:26,128
that women have
towards men.

1080
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,067
The purple numbers
represent the statements of sex,

1081
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:35,604
love, romance and happiness.

1082
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,673
The group with the most
amount of points

1083
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,275
at the end of the game

1084
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:45,414
will be considered as
the stronger sex.

1085
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,317
So, who goes first ?

1086
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,855
Well, let's start with
the weakest link, my man Miles.

1087
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,123
Honestly.

1088
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,125
( Kim )
Oh.

1089
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,694
See, you're already off
to a bad start.

1090
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,763
He's not
your weakest link.

1091
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,203
Okay, so what number
did you pick ?

1092
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,938
Seven.

1093
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,241
Dip into the pink basket,
pick a card and read it.

1094
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,448
"Men tend to be the needy
ones in a relationship."

1095
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,150
Now that's fake, I don't
believe that,

1096
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,319
'cause speaking
from experience,

1097
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,121
the women that I've dated
tend to be way more

1098
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,622
needier than myself.

1099
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,457
They always want
to know where you been,

1100
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,627
who you're with, why can't
I come with you.

1101
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,030
And that's because
they young and dumb.

1102
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:37,299
I know some old and dumb
ones act that way, too.

1103
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,736
Miles, are you
saying I'm needy ?

1104
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,871
Aw, come on.

1105
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:43,806
It's just that I feel like
some women think

1106
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:46,242
that their man should
spend all the time with them.

1107
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:47,643
That ain't what's up.

1108
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,145
I didn't make you
come tonight.

1109
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,213
You could have hung
out with your little friends.

1110
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,315
Why do all men's friends
have to be little

1111
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,817
like we're
still little boys ?

1112
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,218
Oh, please, come on.

1113
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,021
It's not our fault you guys
still want a nipple to suck on.

1114
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,489
Jeff is no longer a
little boy anymore.

1115
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:04,226
He grown up, divorced
you and moved out.

1116
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,062
Yeah, yeah, little boy
Jeff did move on,

1117
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,430
but here's the thing.

1118
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:12,368
Jeff can't distinguish
between a mother and a woman,

1119
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,938
especially when it comes
to a nipple to suck on.

1120
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,606
Ooh.

1121
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:20,042
You often acted like
my mother,

1122
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,845
because you got
serious issues,

1123
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:26,549
and I would know, because
I'm a professor with a PhD.

1124
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:29,885
Oh my gosh, how could I forget
Mr. Scholarly person ?

1125
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,353
And I'm sorry, is
this what, your--

1126
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:34,090
Your foreign
exchange student, <i>que</i> ?

1127
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:38,694
Okay, so the men have been
awarded seven points

1128
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,197
because of Miles'
explanation.

1129
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,698
( Randy )
Yeah, Miles.

1130
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,367
Great start to an
easy victory.

1131
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,870
( Liz )
Whoa, whoa.

1132
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,272
It's ladies turn,
ladies turn.

1133
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,874
Okay.

1134
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,375
( Kim )
You got it, get it ?

1135
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:56,145
Okay, all right.

1136
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:59,115
Okay.

1137
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:01,617
"Men are extremely jealous."

1138
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,119
Oh, hell no.

1139
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,254
Oh, hell yeah.

1140
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,823
You guys are
possessive by nature.

1141
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,558
Martin's always asking me
when I'm on the phone,

1142
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,793
"Who you talking to ?"

1143
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,462
When we go shopping,
somebody asks a question,

1144
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,665
he feels like he has to answer
all the questions himself

1145
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,502
and it's like he's trying
to keep me away from other men.

1146
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,303
( James )
Stupid.

1147
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,472
Women are more
jealous than men.

1148
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,407
All we have to do is
glance at a woman

1149
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,176
and they got
something to say.

1150
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,478
Now see, James, that
antiquated attitude right there,

1151
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,648
that's why a woman ain't glanced
at you in about a decade.

1152
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,583
( laughing )

1153
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,819
( Tosh)
Okay, Andy, you got one
minute left, baby.

1154
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,287
Okay, all right.

1155
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:42,324
So to sum things
up, men think that it's manly

1156
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,661
to be possessive and jealous
and make that apparent,

1157
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,331
but you all just look like
big, silly fools in the end.

1158
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,169
( clapping )

1159
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,170
Nice, sweet playin'.

1160
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,338
Here we go... my turn.

1161
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,773
All right, fellas ?

1162
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,609
Ah.

1163
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:02,811
"Men feel that women
are more concerned

1164
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:05,714
"with a man's earning power
and social position

1165
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,384
than love and happiness."

1166
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,986
Well, it shouldn't really
matter how much you make

1167
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,322
if you look this good.

1168
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:17,059
I can be happy until the right
person finally comes along.

1169
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,728
Well, he's not gonna ride
up on a white horse

1170
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,166
or a school bus
in your case, Gabby.

1171
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:29,371
Basically marriage is
as respectable as paid work,

1172
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,807
so basically,
we're just--

1173
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:32,875
What are we doing, ladies ?

1174
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,009
We're doing our job.

1175
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,311
That's right.
That's right.

1176
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,246
Women used to bring more
to a relationship

1177
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:39,415
than fake boobs
and head full of horse hair.

1178
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,317
They used to bring
emotional support and insurance

1179
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,319
that the kids they
bore were his.

1180
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:46,589
I actually have to disagree with
the ladies on this one.

1181
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,756
Here she goes.

1182
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,024
Wait.

1183
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:50,893
I believe that a woman
should follow her heart

1184
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,730
and not just marry a man
for his checkbook.

1185
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:58,434
I mean, gold-digging
is so '90s.

1186
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,870
Backdoor prostitution
is what it is.

1187
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,105
Oh, really, backdoor
prostitution ?

1188
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:04,373
Well then you know what ?

1189
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:08,611
Then you should owe me money
from that weak-ass divorce.

1190
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:11,580
If we did charge, we'd
have to charge $50 a minute,

1191
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,283
'cause they can't last more than
a minute-and-a-half.

1192
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,384
Speak for yourself.

1193
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:18,287
I'd be coughing
up thousands.

1194
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,923
( murmuring )

1195
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:28,197
♪

1196
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,618
Whoa !

1197
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa !

1198
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,454
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh !

1199
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,457
It looks like we've got a
tight one going on here.

1200
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,525
( doorbell )
It's close.

1201
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:30,959
Oh, let me get the door.

1202
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,163
( laughing )

1203
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,432
( Randy )
We got a tight one.

1204
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,200
( Kim )
I said what ?

1205
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,836
Hey, hey, hope I
didn't miss much... hey.

1206
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,504
Where were you, where the hell
have you been ?

1207
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,440
I knew you weren't
coming right back.

1208
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,508
I went to work.
Where were you ?

1209
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,509
I told you I
went to work, come on.
For two fucking hours ?

1210
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,610
Yeah, I was busy.

1211
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,446
Where-- for two hours,
I do not buy it.

1212
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,548
You are full of shit.

1213
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,684
Yo, Speedy Gonzales.

1214
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,785
It's none of your
business anyway.

1215
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,555
I don't even know why
you're even here.

1216
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,660
All right.

1217
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:06,362
Kim, what's the problem ?

1218
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:09,365
J-E-F-F.

1219
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,899
Look, you know something ?

1220
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:14,570
You've always given
me a hard time, you know that ?

1221
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,205
And that shit you're doing
with my clothes,

1222
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,873
that's just
plain ridiculous.

1223
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,476
Yeah, that was
pretty stupid.

1224
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:22,378
Why would you burn
good quality clothes ?

1225
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,513
Obviously you
need the money.

1226
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,181
Excuse me,
what was that ?

1227
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:27,416
What did you just say
to me ?

1228
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,584
Obviously, you
need the money.

1229
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:29,585
Oh, really ?

1230
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,586
Sweetie, no, I don't
need the money

1231
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,521
and at least
I know about quality.

1232
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,223
You run around here with
that tired old piece

1233
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,491
of the motherland.

1234
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:37,426
Okay, yeah, why don't you
and your little <i>taquitos</i>

1235
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,094
roll up out of here ?

1236
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,597
<i>Mira</i> , it's pronounced
<i>"taquito,"</i> just for me.

1237
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,533
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
All right-- Kim !

1238
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:45,534
You know what ?

1239
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:46,535
You little prostitute.

1240
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:47,569
I don't need to know
how it's pronounced.

1241
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,670
Prostitute ?
Yeah.

1242
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,506
All right, with your
tutu on right now.

1243
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,540
Oh honey, with
your little--

1244
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,741
Really-- I don't know
what that little--

1245
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,009
What you wear,
what you wear !

1246
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,411
Look, look, Evelyn--
Evelyn--

1247
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,279
What is that,
what is that ?

1248
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,516
Hey, hey, hey-- <i>callate</i> !

1249
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:02,718
Kim, please, I don't
want to hear it.

1250
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,852
I don't
want to hear it.

1251
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:06,989
( yelling )

1252
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,592
Take your geisha girl and her
two-for-one dress outta here.

1253
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,095
Fine, fine.

1254
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,897
Are you serious ?

1255
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,533
Your toes need to catch up
with your shoes, honey.

1256
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:20,302
Okay, you know what,
that's it, I'm getting my A

1257
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:22,104
and my $200 from you by
tomorrow,

1258
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,406
if not, I'm telling
the dean everything.

1259
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,441
Everything.

1260
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,209
You were paying
her, man ?

1261
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:29,144
Oh man, I'm gonna have to
confiscate your player's card.

1262
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,612
No more freebies
for you, okay ?

1263
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,613
What ?

1264
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,781
No, no, crazy lady.

1265
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,918
Tell your broke-ass husband to
stay away from our club,

1266
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,985
how about that ?

1267
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,153
Take care of him
at home, <i>mami</i> .

1268
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,656
Broke ass ?

1269
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:41,623
Did you just--

1270
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,925
Oh !

1271
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,927
Okay, all right,
all right, whoa !

1272
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,929
All right, all right,
all right !

1273
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,564
We're going, we're going !

1274
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:50,399
Goodbye, we're going !

1275
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:52,468
All right, we're
going, bye !

1276
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,070
All right, all
right, all right !

1277
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,509
Hey, hey, hey, hey !

1278
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,311
Coffee, coffee !

1279
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,445
Great time.

1280
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,547
( Liz )
Don't you bring her
back here again.

1281
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,351
Don't you bring her
back here again.

1282
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,019
I'll Pray for you !

1283
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,855
Go !

1284
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,193
No, you
bring me over here--

1285
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,128
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

1286
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,597
Evelyn, you're an
educated woman.

1287
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,366
I'm done-- no, I'm done
and I want my $200.
Get in the car, please.

1288
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:25,868
I'm done.

1289
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,935
Open the fucking car door?

1290
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,103
It's open, it's open.

1291
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,338
Stop cursing.

1292
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,772
Some bullshit ass got me
over here,

1293
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:32,708
getting my ass whipped--

1294
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,177
Okay, everybody, back
in the living room.

1295
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,278
Martin, who was that ?

1296
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,546
I have no idea.

1297
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,381
( Randy )
Okay, everybody
back in the room.

1298
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,616
You have no idea ?
I have no idea.

1299
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,184
Why does she think she
knows you like that ?

1300
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,685
I look like a
lot of people.

1301
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,522
I can't believe this...
Babe, please, please.

1302
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:47,623
Martin, I swear to God.

1303
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,425
Everybody back in the
living room, please.

1304
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,532
This whole night...

1305
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,542
All right.

1306
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,246
Tss, tss, hey, where are
you going ?

1307
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:12,481
Gabby, I--

1308
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:15,050
I can't do this
with you.

1309
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,685
This is how it is ?

1310
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:18,687
I can't handle this.

1311
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:20,022
Gabby, I'm not lying
to you anymore.

1312
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:21,757
You know what, I'm 19.

1313
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:24,092
Goddamn, I knew his
ass wasn't no 25.

1314
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,761
19 ?

1315
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:27,563
You've been lying to
me this whole time ?

1316
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,665
No, you been lying to
me this whole time.

1317
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,767
In here flirting
with Eddie Kane, Jr.

1318
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:34,002
Y'all motherfuckers
crazy, man.

1319
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,439
Eddie Kane ?

1320
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,907
You sitting up here,
you're talking about

1321
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,109
whipping ass
and shooting people.

1322
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,744
We're done.

1323
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,747
<i>Enanito de</i>
<i>mierda, mamon.</i>

1324
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:46,848
You can't even
handle this.

1325
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,517
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah ?

1326
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:50,052
You got this gold-digger
right here,

1327
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:52,120
this crazy-ass
white chick,

1328
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,690
not to mention your
manslaughtering ass,

1329
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:57,526
drunken Jesus freak and
a straight-up freak.

1330
00:59:57,528 --> 00:59:58,794
What the fuck
you just say ?

1331
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:00,262
No.

1332
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:03,799
If I were you, I would check all
those porn sites right now,

1333
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,634
'cause your wife probably
fucked every Kama Sutra

1334
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,768
in the business.

1335
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,637
What ?
Everybody, just--

1336
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:09,938
Balance your life.

1337
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,774
Elevate your mind.

1338
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,644
Fuck this shit, you
adolescent motherfucker !

1339
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,045
Are you--

1340
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,482
Yeah, that's right.

1341
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:21,950
You can walk your
punk-ass home.

1342
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh, and you
are a player hater.

1343
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:27,756
What was this talk about
being a freak and porn sites ?

1344
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,057
Nothing, baby.

1345
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,226
Tosha, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

1346
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:34,129
What was he talking about
when he said porn sites

1347
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,065
Hot damn !

1348
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,468
That's my ass.

1349
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,969
No, it's not.

1350
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,673
Well, that's your ass, so
that damn well better be my ass.

1351
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:47,509
Baby, it's not.

1352
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,779
That is my ass.

1353
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:53,448
That-- I know my ass like the
back of my hand.

1354
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,417
Do you know how much time
I spend looking at myself

1355
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,285
in the mirror ?

1356
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:00,856
How did you get your legs
around your head like that ?

1357
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,792
Maybe we should go.

1358
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,694
Oh... oh...

1359
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,497
Does anybody mind
making a pit stop ?

1360
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,831
We could take my Benz?

1361
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,767
I think everybody should
be able to fit.

1362
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:12,834
I'm the only one
ain't been drinking.

1363
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,137
Oh my God, no, you're
not driving me.

1364
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:16,204
Where are--

1365
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,639
Who's got the keys ?

1366
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:20,042
Give me those
fucking keys.

1367
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:22,978
What-- I'm coming.

1368
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,580
( siren blaring )

1369
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,386
( Gabby )
Okay, yeah.

1370
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:32,387
All right.

1371
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,222
Hi, hi, yeah, excuse me, hi.

1372
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,525
Okay, we have a pregnant woman
who is about to bust, okay ?

1373
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,660
And her husband's
already been busted,

1374
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,028
you know what I'm
saying, girl ?

1375
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,029
Sister ?

1376
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,864
Can we roll ?

1377
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,700
Okay, ma'am, there's a
waiting room over here.

1378
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,669
You can take a seat and
somebody will get to you.

1379
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,337
Waiting room ?

1380
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,806
Okay.

1381
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:52,874
You know what, um, apparently
you didn't hear me, sister.

1382
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,710
Why don't you turn up your
little Miracle Ear, okay ?

1383
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:56,244
And get us a room !

1384
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:59,581
Come on, country
girl, come on... Please.

1385
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,750
Are you getting
loud with me ?

1386
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:03,385
Of course I'm getting
loud with you.

1387
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,387
We need a room.

1388
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,724
They do not pay me enough
money to deal with streetwalkers

1389
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,726
coming in here talking
any kind of way.

1390
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,729
Clearly, you, sister, with
that wig sitting

1391
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:14,730
three inches
from your scalp,

1392
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:15,731
you know all
about streetwalking.

1393
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,365
Don't have me pull
Esmerelda off.

1394
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,668
Okay guys, come
on, come on !

1395
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,902
We gotta
baby going come.

1396
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,171
Oh Lord, we gonna
have a baby !

1397
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:24,539
It'll be all right !

1398
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,174
We got a baby on
the way.

1399
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,944
( excited chattering )

1400
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,913
Hallelujah, Lord, a baby !

1401
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:35,283
Hallelujah, hallelujah !

1402
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,791
Uh-uh, uh--
Oh, wait a second.

1403
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:45,026
Only patients allowed
from this point on.

1404
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:46,928
Oh, no, no, no, but
these are our friends.

1405
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,063
I'm sorry.

1406
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:49,064
Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

1407
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:51,533
Like she said, those
are our friends.

1408
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,135
Can I ask you something ?

1409
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,436
Yes.

1410
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,571
You got a boyfriend.

1411
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:57,572
Really ?

1412
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:58,740
Oh, okay--

1413
01:02:58,742 --> 01:02:59,775
There's a waiting
area outside,

1414
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,476
you guys are welcome
to wait in the area.

1415
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:02,911
What's wrong with the
sisters in this hospitals ?

1416
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,813
The sisters ?
Yeah, the sisters,
sister.

1417
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,815
There.
You know what ?

1418
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:08,650
The Lord said
we can be up in here.

1419
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,852
I'mma pray for you.

1420
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,960
Oh God.

1421
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,562
Oh, I don't-- It just hurts.

1422
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:22,097
I need something.

1423
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:26,134
Ma'am, ma'am, is this
man your husband ?

1424
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,937
Give me drugs !

1425
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,772
Oh, oh !

1426
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,141
Okay, let's get
her on the bed.

1427
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,309
Martin, Martin...

1428
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,677
You okay, Andrea,
you okay ?

1429
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,446
You son of a bitch,
you did this to me !

1430
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,816
Your bachelor days
are over, dude !

1431
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:43,018
Get up and watch the
goddamn birth of your child !

1432
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,486
Get up there !

1433
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,455
( man )
Okay, let's get
her on the bed.

1434
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:52,427
Let's get her
on the bed, come on.

1435
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,996
Do you have any drugs ?

1436
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,865
I need something,
it hurts.

1437
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,936
You okay, baby ?

1438
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:02,137
It's gonna be okay.

1439
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,939
Okay, okay.

1440
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,217
Tosha, you have five
seconds to tell me why

1441
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:18,753
I was looking at
our naked bodies on my iPhone.

1442
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,957
Okay.

1443
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,893
Well, baby, do you realize
that there are more

1444
01:04:24,895 --> 01:04:26,695
divorced people
in this country

1445
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,197
than there
are married people ?

1446
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,968
And half of those marriages fail
because of bad sex lives.

1447
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,871
There's nothing wrong
with our sex life.

1448
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,539
Well, maybe now
that the rest of the world

1449
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,008
has seen our sex life.

1450
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,410
Baby, I just wanted to
keep us intimate,

1451
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,547
which is really why I
took that online course anyway.

1452
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,048
Which is one of the reasons
why I had us play

1453
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,351
that stupid
game tonight.

1454
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:52,721
And what does that have to do
with a freaking sex movie ?

1455
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:55,390
Because I just
learned it in class.

1456
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,660
Baby, I swear to you, that
tape was just meant for us.

1457
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:01,730
And Kim and Andrea and
Gabrielle and Liz ?

1458
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,831
No-- No, no, no, no, no.

1459
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:05,000
Liz did not see it.

1460
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:10,405
Baby, baby, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry, I just--

1461
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,375
I just wanted
to help us.

1462
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:18,546
And you wanted your
friends to see for what ?

1463
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:23,752
Maybe I just
wanted to...

1464
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:26,021
gloat.

1465
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:29,758
Just a little.

1466
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,295
I should have never bought
you that damn camera.

1467
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:37,399
Now can I have a
little bitty kiss ?

1468
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:40,068
No, you're on
punishment.

1469
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,304
What's wrong with you ?

1470
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,281
Everyone here
with the O'Neils ?

1471
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,717
( Tosh )
Yes, yes.

1472
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,986
Excuse me, are
you with someone ?

1473
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,423
Well, it's a boy.

1474
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:02,958
Aw !

1475
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,963
Hot damn, I guess the stronger
sex tonight were the men !

1476
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,297
And a girl.

1477
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,099
Ha-- must have
been a tie.

1478
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,101
Oh, twins !

1479
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:14,436
Twins !
Twins.

1480
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,571
They're twins, oh !

1481
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:17,906
Oh my God, I knew it.

1482
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,507
Wow!

1483
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,410
Well, I'll see
you all later.

1484
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,645
Oh, thank you,
Doctor.

1485
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,747
Excuse me, excuse
me, Doctor, excuse me.

1486
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:27,182
That's so sweet.

1487
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,652
( all )
Oh....

1488
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:33,655
God did good,
God did good.

1489
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,790
But I'm gonna say a
special prayer for this one.

1490
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,492
( Liz )
The girl or the boy ?

1491
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,095
The girl's over there...
hey baby.

1492
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,330
( Kim )
And the other one.

1493
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,766
Great job.

1494
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,034
I didn't know what I was
gonna do with the one.

1495
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:48,203
Two.

1496
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:50,138
No more late nights, baby.
no more late nights.

1497
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,007
So cute.

1498
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,009
Hey...

1499
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,944
We'll see you.

1500
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:58,113
Good work, baby.

1501
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,048
( Liz )
Give her kisses
for us.

1502
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,183
No more late nights.

1503
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,219
Little prayer for my baby,
little prayer for my baby.

1504
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:05,687
I'm gonna ask the Lord.

1505
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:07,989
You did it, man.

1506
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:08,990
They did a good job.

1507
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:11,159
Excuse me, Doctor...

1508
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:12,193
Feelgood.

1509
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,195
Oh-- Dr. Feelgood.

1510
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:17,866
I just wanted to--
Oh God.

1511
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,034
Whoa, whoa.

1512
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,335
I'm so sorry, wow.

1513
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:21,369
It's been a long day.

1514
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,637
You need an appointment ?

1515
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,207
Actually, I happen to need
my vitals checked.

1516
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,475
I feel a little hot.

1517
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,544
We have a room--
I'm just joking.

1518
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,514
Oh-- A room.

1519
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,382
You move fast, don't you ?

1520
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,884
Don't joke with me.

1521
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,652
I'm joking-- Get it ?

1522
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,054
Oh God.

1523
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:42,223
Okay.

1524
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,163
Hope you don't
mind me sitting.

1525
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:50,198
All the seats are taken.

1526
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,599
I'm Miles.

1527
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,101
Lolita.

1528
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:56,237
Lolita, nice to meet you.

1529
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,238
How you doing ?

1530
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,340
Good, how are you ?
I'm fine.

1531
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,710
Actually, I'm--

1532
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,179
I'm not fine.

1533
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,448
Just going through a
few things, you know ?

1534
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,950
Just going through
a breakup.

1535
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,518
She's a lot older
than I am, you know.

1536
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,421
And I don't think she
understands me.

1537
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,723
You know what, I think
I should have dated someone,

1538
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,959
you know, closer
to my age.

1539
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,127
You know, someone
I can grow with.

1540
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,796
Maybe someone like--
someone like you.

1541
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:25,266
Oh, I was just leaving,
but good luck with everything.

1542
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:28,203
Wait, wait-- Wait, I wasn't
finished talking.

1543
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:29,170
Where you going ?

1544
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:34,242
She's leaving me with...

1545
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:36,911
... little-ass kids.

1546
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,280
Old ass women.

1547
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,282
Andrea.

1548
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,284
You did so good.

1549
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,553
You did so good,
look at this.

1550
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:46,588
It's amazing.

1551
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,755
There's two of 'em.

1552
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:48,890
I know.

1553
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:54,129
Oh my God--
I am so sorry.

1554
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:56,097
I love you, Martin.

1555
01:08:56,099 --> 01:09:02,670
I love you, too,
I love you, too.

1556
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:06,341
Hey, I love you, too...
Hello.

1557
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,243
Hey big guy, we
love you too.

1558
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:10,345
Oh, everybody...
we love everybody.

1559
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:13,081
Oh my God, amazing.

1560
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,383
Hello.

1561
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:18,753
( laughing )

1562
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,088
Two, two.

1563
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,289
I don't know how
the hell...

1564
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,858
I'm so not jealous.

1565
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,861
Hey, hey, same
time next week ?

1566
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,496
Not if I can
help it.

1567
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,831
Goodbye.

1568
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:30,932
All right, girl.

1569
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:32,167
Call me next
week, I'll let you know

1570
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,868
how my date with
Dr. Feelgood went.

1571
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:37,005
Girl, a prayer for
you and all y'all.

1572
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,640
No, we gonna
pray for you.

1573
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,608
The power of prayer.

1574
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,211
Oh, baby, I'm tired.

1575
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,913
Sweetie, let's go home.

1576
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,023
Is that for me ?

1577
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,892
Well, I'm sure the hell
not gonna drink it.

1578
01:09:57,894 --> 01:09:59,694
Caffeine.

1579
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,802
Gabby, why did you
turn around and--

1580
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,470
I don't do hospitals.

1581
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:13,041
My father passed away in
a hospital and I can't do it.

1582
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,943
I understand.

1583
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,713
So they're twins.

1584
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,249
Twins-- Wow, that's
great, twins.

1585
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:22,817
A boy and a girl.

1586
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,592
Gabby.

1587
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,527
Why are you intent on
denying the fact

1588
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,362
that I've always
had feelings for you ?

1589
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:38,199
James, you're
not my type.

1590
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,101
Aw, come on, Gabby,
and that kid is ?

1591
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:42,270
You're a ladies' man,
a player, you know.

1592
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,771
I need something more.

1593
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:46,140
I need stability.

1594
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,777
Gabby, can I tell
you something ?

1595
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,381
Mm-hmm.

1596
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:59,921
I was with this
girl once, right, and...

1597
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,456
James.

1598
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,625
Hold on, Gabby, Gabby, no,
Gabby, stop.

1599
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:05,460
Come on, Gabby.

1600
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:08,863
Just hear me out, okay ?

1601
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:11,466
I was with this
girl once.

1602
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,435
And we were living
together, the whole nine yards.

1603
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,471
Every time I would
come home from work,

1604
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:19,474
she would always have
dinner cooking.

1605
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:24,979
But this one day that
I got home, I came home early.

1606
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,948
That was the day that I
got laid off.

1607
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,485
I was trying to figure out
how I was gonna tell this woman

1608
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:37,792
that I loved so very much that
I didn't have a job anymore.

1609
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,795
So I...

1610
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:47,435
I drove in the driveway,
my eyes still wet from crying.

1611
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:52,073
I didn't know what I was
gonna tell her.

1612
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:57,345
I walked in the house,
didn't smell nothing cooking.

1613
01:11:57,347 --> 01:12:03,184
Then I remembered,
I was home early.

1614
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:07,355
So I went looking for her.

1615
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:10,992
I walked up to the
bedroom, I opened the door.

1616
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:21,969
I...

1617
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:27,508
I saw the woman that
I loved so much

1618
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,878
riding another guy.

1619
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,383
A guy that I never seen
before in my life.

1620
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,520
Come to find out it
wasn't the first time.

1621
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,557
She had a little business
going on on the side,

1622
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:44,525
guys coming in and out,

1623
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:48,463
carrying on and going on
their merry way.

1624
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:53,034
So what did you do ?

1625
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,071
I...

1626
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,946
I just left.

1627
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:12,253
Look, Gabby.

1628
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:17,592
I just want you to know,
I was hurting.

1629
01:13:17,594 --> 01:13:18,659
And I'm not
this insensitive guy

1630
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:21,929
that everybody thinks
that I am.

1631
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,966
I hurt, too.

1632
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:40,448
You know, I'm so done with the
whole club scene after tonight.

1633
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,684
Really done.

1634
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:47,789
But, um...

1635
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:54,095
maybe we can hook up
for a cup of coffee sometime.

1636
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:58,099
Really ?

1637
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:05,640
I'll walk a mile to a Starbucks
just to hang out with Gabby.

1638
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,909
Just for future reference,

1639
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:11,145
don't ever use the word
"miles" and "Starbucks"

1640
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:14,449
in the same sentence,
ever again.

1641
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,517
Okay.

1642
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,462

worried about our sex life.

Never again, baby.
