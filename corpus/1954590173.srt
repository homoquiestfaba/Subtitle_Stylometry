1
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>You gotta stop listening
to the same voices playing</i>

2
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,307
<i>over and over in your head.</i>

3
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>I can pretty much get
the voices to stop now</i>

4
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:50,649
<i>but it's the images
that keep coming back.</i>

5
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:57,122
<i>Certain ones like the day
they raided us,</i>

6
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:03,195
<i>the tear gas burning my eyes,
the moment they cuffed me,</i>

7
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,633
<i>watching one of
my best friends die.</i>

8
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:19,711
<i>Maybe it's a good thing
that I can't get rid of 'em.</i>

9
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:23,715
<i>So I can't forget
where I came from.</i>

10
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,164
<i>Everyone has their number.</i>

11
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,534
<i>My number is 18.</i>

12
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:47,239
<i>This is my 18th foster home
placement</i>

13
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,309
<i>and that goes along
with other numbers,</i>

14
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>11 misdemeanors, 9 felonies,
4 convictions and 1 new haircut</i>

15
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,218
<i>at the insistence
of my case worker.</i>

16
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,759
<i>They say that when you
get released from prison</i>

17
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,662
<i>you have the glow,
a new attitude.</i>

18
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,764
<i>Who knows?</i>

19
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,802
<i>I'm just hoping 18 will be
my lucky number.</i>

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,671
We thank you for the food
that you have before us

21
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:23,142
and we thank for the loving
hands that have prepared it.

22
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,278
Lord, we have a new member of
the family at the table tonight

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,580
and we thank you for bringing
Brendan into our lives

24
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:32,618
and for the new life
that you have given to him.

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,486
We ask that you give him
strength and wisdom

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,421
in his new endeavors at school

27
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,758
and may he always
rely upon you.

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,496
This we ask in Jesus' name,
amen.

29
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,231
Amen.

30
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,535
So, you must be excited
about school.

31
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:53,338
Tomorrow morning we have
a meeting with the principal.

32
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,207
It's nothing special.

33
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,443
that the transition's
going smoothly.

34
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,478
Okay.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Northside's a good school.

36
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:06,652
I've been a teacher there
going on 25 years.

37
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,688
Vanessa was a nurse there
for how long, sweetheart?

38
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,391
Long enough.

39
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,693
Well, speaking
of smooth transitions,

40
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,596
your curfew will be 9:00
on school nights.

41
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,364
You've had a curfew before?

42
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,302
I've had a lot of practice being
on time in the last few years.

43
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,237
Yes, yes, I suppose you have.

44
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,774
But it will be different without
someone looking over you.

45
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,543
I'm sure it'll all
work out fine.

46
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,212
Of course, it'll be fine.

47
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,248
I just want to be clear
on our expectations.

48
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,319
There'll be plenty of time
for these things later.

49
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,578
I smell alcohol on your breath,
weed on your clothes,

50
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,413
we have to report it.

51
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,883
Same with fighting
or erratic attendance.

52
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,286
Now, what's going on with
the community service?

53
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,522
The Faith Club's working
on a few projects this fall.

54
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,890
He'll pick up the hours there.

55
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,425
It's important that you
don't fall short

56
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,359
in that area either, Brendan.

57
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,594
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,795
Sorry I'm late.

59
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,464
He's volunteered
to show you around.

60
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,068
So you just moved in
with Mr. Stubbs, huh?

61
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,069
Yeah.

62
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,771
That's cool.

63
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,339
Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy.

64
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,840
He mentors our Bible study
after school.

65
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,344
Yeah, that's what he was
telling me.

66
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:16,448
Well, look, Northside is
just like any other school.

67
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,684
We got jocks, geeks,
princesses

68
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,787
and even a few cool kids
such as myself.

69
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,791
When you are working with
absolute value inequalities,

70
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,759
there's a lot you have
to keep straight.

71
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,796
You have to combine everything
you know about inequalities

72
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,533
with everything you know
about absolute values.

73
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,081
Did you tell him he could work
on Lewis's car?

74
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,118
- Hmm?
- He's working on Lewis's car.

75
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,987
Yeah, he said he took
some shop classes

76
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,655
and asked if he could.

77
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,723
Well, sweetheart,
I really don't think

78
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,692
that was your decision to make.

79
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,026
Since when do you care
about cars?

80
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,161
You know what I mean.

81
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,430
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.

82
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,766
Guess I should have said
something to you.

83
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,534
I can tell him.

84
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,437
Well, you can't tell him now
that you let him start.

85
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,805
I thought we agreed we were
gonna try to help

86
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,974
the kid turn his life around.

87
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,845
Well, I just didn't know
that Lewis's car would be

88
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,647
a part of that plan.

89
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:05,991
So in the garden, we see him
pitting man against God

90
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:10,929
and in Job, we see him trying
to turn God against man

91
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,033
and in Matthew,
we see him scheming

92
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,769
to turn Jesus from God.

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,071
Now, Jesus has just begun
his ministry.

94
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,674
He's only been baptized
a few days prior.

95
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,811
He hasn't even performed
a single miracle

96
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,015
and yet the enemy is already
trying to bring him down.

97
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,520
So, Brendan, how are you
finding it so far?

98
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,023
- Uh, it's...
- He doesn't say much.

99
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,560
He's got that quiet thing
going for him.

100
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,228
Yeah, he keeps to himself.

101
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,963
So does that mean you're
not gonna join

102
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,064
our volleyball team then?

103
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,632
Volleyball team?

104
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,535
Yeah, the Seekers has
an intramural team

105
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,671
and we play after school
at the park.

106
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,873
You should come out,
Friday night.

107
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,108
It's more like jungle ball
than volleyball.

108
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,910
And then afterwards you can
check out my band.

109
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,546
See, we play mostly
alternative rock

110
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,950
with some Christian skate
punk thrown in and...

111
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,052
They change their name
weekly.

112
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,988
Well, we're just still trying
to find our identity, you know?

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,123
Okay.

114
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,702
He helped him get
insurance, too?

115
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:27,239
Yeah, set up a payment schedule.

116
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,975
Where's he getting his money?

117
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,610
Mike arranged that
he would cut grass

118
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,712
at the school in the fields.

119
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,113
I told Mike this was a bad idea.

120
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,748
I mean, he barely
knows this kid.

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,685
How do you make a person
trustworthy? Trust them.

122
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,854
Mike trusted those roofers
a couple of years back.

123
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,023
They did half the job
for the full price

124
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,892
and then they disappeared
on him.

125
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,593
Hey, Russell.

126
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,095
How you doin', man?

127
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,997
What, you hit a number
on the lotto?

128
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,932
You're giving away cars?

129
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,601
I could use
a high definition TV.

130
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,037
You only fall asleep
in front of it.

131
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,972
Not if it was HD.

132
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,608
You know, if you're thinking
of passing on

133
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,313
there's this new rec center
the department is sponsoring

134
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,181
and they're looking
for donations.

135
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,051
I remember Lewis had
that foosball table

136
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,987
he used to play on night and day
when he was a kid.

137
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,724
We're not sure what we're
doing with that yet.

138
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,060
Yeah.

139
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,250
Brendan, right?

140
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,052
I'm Detective Russell Dwyer.

141
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,122
I work for the county.

142
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,692
ever since I heard that Stubbs
took you in.

143
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,328
You've been in the system
long enough to know

144
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,031
that your record isn't
gonna fold up neatly

145
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,299
and disappear on you.

146
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,202
I mean, conditional discharge
where they seal your records,

147
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,271
that's for misdemeanors.

148
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,906
Drunk and disorderly,

149
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:19,711
whacking mailboxes
with a baseball bat.

150
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,147
But that's not you.

151
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,948
Now, I know what
you're thinking,

152
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,252
another cop hassling me
for no good reason,

153
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,154
but I have a reason.

154
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,924
I am a stat man, Brendan.

155
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,994
You into fantasy football
or baseball?

156
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,195
Oh, you should try it.

157
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,065
It's a good distraction.

158
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,435
Now, I love it because
it's all stats

159
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,871
and the guys that are
really great at it,

160
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,275
well, they learn how to dig
through all the useless data

161
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,945
and find what's
really important.

162
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,282
I checked the recidivism
statistics on that boys club

163
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,484
you spent the last
three years in.

164
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,786
Do you know what
recidivism means?

165
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:06,725
It's a 50 cent word that means
messing up again.

166
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,893
Do you know the recidivism rate
of those rats

167
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,262
that came out of that hole
you were in?

168
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:15,366
90% arrested within
two years of release.

169
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:20,839
Nine out of ten and that's
why I'm here, Brendan.

170
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,175
Nothing personal,
just the stats.

171
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,746
Now the Stubbs,
they're good folks.

172
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,281
Never took a shortcut
in their lives.

173
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,819
And they had a son.

174
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,488
He was a cop.

175
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,025
He was killed in the line of
duty, routine traffic stop.

176
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:45,363
Guy shot him dead on the side
of the highway.

177
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,932
They don't need any more
heartache.

178
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,868
Yes, sir.

179
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,403
I will be seeing you, Brendan.

180
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,017
I heard some kids talking
about you at school today.

181
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,253
I guess they found a story
about a Brendan King arrested

182
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,823
in a drug raid in the city
about three years ago.

183
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,392
If you're uncomfortable talking
about it, I completely...

184
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,128
No, it's cool.

185
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,965
Anyway, I wouldn't worry
if it gets out.

186
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,333
Girls love a bad boy.

187
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:26,237
They love the challenge to
reform a rebellious boy.

188
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:33,812
No, they've done studies
on it, man.

189
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,047
Did a car just go off
the road up there?

190
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,416
Wait, Brendan, stop the car!

191
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,862
Whoa.

192
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,096
Hey!

193
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,299
Hey, you gotta be careful, man.

194
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,074
Hey.

195
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,611
Call for help!

196
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,991
Hey, you okay?

197
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,227
Sorry, it's gonna be okay,
I'm gonna get you outta here.

198
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,863
One, two, three.

199
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,365
Ow!

200
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,519
- She gonna be okay?
- She's gonna be all right.

201
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,455
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure, no problem.

202
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,326
We found these
on the floor of the car.

203
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,463
Wanna tell me about it?

204
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,431
A Northside High student
risked his life

205
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,334
to pull a girl from her
burning car yesterday.

206
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,069
The 17-year-old girl
who is yet to...

207
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,172
It's a good thing you were
coming by.

208
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,341
That was a darn heroic thing
you did.

209
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,677
Anyone would have done it.

210
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,479
I don't think so.

211
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,547
Could have easily have gone
another way.

212
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,250
Well, the car looked like
it was about to explode,

213
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,486
so I hung back, but my friend...

214
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,288
You being there was no accident.

215
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,657
God has a plan.

216
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,993
Hope you believe that.

217
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,175
Hey, is this seat taken

218
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,011
or does Katie Couric want it
so she can interview you?

219
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,114
No, she just left,
so it's all yours.

220
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,417
We're rock stars, dude.

221
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,651
Did you catch me on the news?

222
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,453
I plugged you big time.

223
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,223
You saved the homecoming queen,
how crazy is that?

224
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,959
You talked to her since then?

225
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,527
No.

226
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,529
Dude, you gotta get on that.

227
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,663
You're like a super hero.

228
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,399
- Now you've lost it.
- I haven't lost it.

229
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,968
What are you doing
in this class?

230
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,503
I've never been in this
classroom before.

231
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:18,977
Yeah, well... there are a lot
of pretty girls in this class.

232
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,511
<i>Mr. Sheedy.</i>

233
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,313
Sorry.

234
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,217
Just don't let this fame go
to your head, all right?

235
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:41,065
Brendan,
Brendan King.

236
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,070
It ain't a dream.

237
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,206
- It's me, Eli.
- Eli?

238
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,174
Big surprise, huh?

239
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,409
Who's with you?

240
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,477
You know I got Rish.

241
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,413
What up, Bren.

242
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,248
Big Lex came, too.

243
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,450
Right.

244
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,618
When you guys get out?

245
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,253
I got out last May,

246
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,355
but Rish, he been stomping
for about a year now.

247
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,590
Anyone else?

248
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:09,360
Tev's somewhere.
How you been?

249
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,529
Thought you was gonna contact me
when you got out.

250
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,433
I had to see you on the news.

251
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,337
Of course, I couldn't recognize
you, grew your fade out.

252
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,472
Y'all see this?

253
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,341
Baby boy's all brand new.

254
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,376
Nah, he ain't brand new.

255
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,578
He's just a pretty boy now.

256
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:34,385
But even if they all forget,
I seen you go pit bull.

257
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,455
I ain't seeing it now.

258
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,594
Yeah, I heard about you making
a name for yourself

259
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,664
while you was inside.

260
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,567
Got all cleaned up, huh?

261
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,836
Yeah, I can't roll with
the old crew anymore, Eli.

262
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,272
Old crew?

263
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,808
We family, brother.

264
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,579
So I'm gonna get to why
we really here.

265
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,251
Been to the woods where
Tuck kept the stash.

266
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,655
It's empty, completely dry,
you feel me?

267
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,490
What makes you think there'd
be anything there?

268
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,691
Because Tuck kept a stash...

269
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:19,163
weed, money, 'caine,
liquor, all that.

270
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,666
And I know the police got work
during the raid

271
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,669
but there should be more,
a lot more.

272
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,105
Look, I don't know, Eli.

273
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,173
Tuck didn't mention
any other spots?

274
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,442
Come on, man, you were
in that more than me.

275
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:36,614
Yeah, maybe.

276
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,318
Tell you what,
you think about it.

277
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,787
Maybe something pops up.

278
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:48,392
But I need you to give it
serious thought.

279
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,129
It's good to see you, brother.

280
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,598
We'll be in touch.

281
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,802
Later.

282
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,664
Brendan, right?

283
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,800
Hey, how are you?

284
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,669
Broke my arm.

285
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,671
Could have been worse.

286
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,907
Yeah, I'll say.

287
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,443
I don't really remember
much of it.

288
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,746
Thanks for helping me.

289
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,714
No problem.

290
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,784
Guess I'll see you around.

291
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,623
I'm sure the club can find
a few ways

292
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,693
for you to fill up
your service hours.

293
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,828
Don't look at it
as a punishment.

294
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,898
Mistakes are a normal
part of life.

295
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,801
Use it as an opportunity, okay?

296
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,939
Thanks, Mr. Stubbs.

297
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,642
She's distanced herself from me
and from everybody.

298
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,246
She comes in, she goes
right up to her room.

299
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,815
She got that tattoo without
talking to us about it.

300
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,317
That is so not like her.

301
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,320
She would never do that.

302
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:28,326
then maybe you'd see that
something's really wrong.

303
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,427
I'm not blaming you,

304
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,229
but you can't say that
your moving away

305
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,564
hasn't played some part in this.

306
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,799
Look, call her later.

307
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,635
Maybe she'll talk to you.

308
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,377
What did he say?

309
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,680
That I could do my hours
with them.

310
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,652
Did he give you any idea
what you'd be working on?

311
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,787
We didn't get into that.

312
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,680
Hey, Bren.

313
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:26,550
a skater kid cracked up
near the park,

314
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,819
dropped a couple of hits
of acid.

315
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,556
I haven't seen that out here
in a long time.

316
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,859
Kind of a coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

317
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,294
Wasn't me.

318
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,863
No, not you.

319
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,732
You're on a new path now, right?

320
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,902
The hero.

321
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,638
Do you remember that story
I told you

322
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,508
about the Stubbs' son?

323
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,811
We never caught the guy
who did that.

324
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,646
Now, I know you didn't do it,

325
00:21:55,648 --> 00:22:01,686
but you're what I picture
when I think of him.

326
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,355
Have you talked to any
of your old crew lately?

327
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,591
What do you want from me?

328
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:14,832
Yeah, there's something in
your eyes that bothers me.

329
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,636
Like you're waiting for
someone to challenge you

330
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:22,006
so that you can prove
them wrong.

331
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,841
When all that usually
happens is

332
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,445
is that you prove them right.

333
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,833
I just have a lot
on my mind...

334
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,742
I'm sorry, it's over.

335
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,611
Yeah, just walk away, right?

336
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,855
Wanna ride?

337
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,690
No, thanks.

338
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,760
Are you sure?
It's kind of dark out here.

339
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:19,096
I kind of just wanna be
left alone.

340
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,731
Usually when I just
wanna be alone,

341
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,702
I could really use some company.

342
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,991
So what's the deal with you
and the Seekers?

343
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,860
Are you there by choice or are
you court ordered like me?

344
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,764
Why would you think I was
court ordered?

345
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,566
Kids talk.

346
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,936
No, I'm not court ordered.

347
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,744
The police found some stuff
I bought off this kid at school.

348
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,012
I had an AP history exam

349
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,949
and was having some
trouble focusing.

350
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,853
Look, I don't have a problem.

351
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:20,724
and crush up smart drugs
just to get my G.P.A. up.

352
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:25,129
I never thought I had a problem,
till I got locked up.

353
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,965
I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but I'm not like...

354
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,935
What? Not like me?

355
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,536
I'm sorry, I didn't...

356
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,838
It's okay.

357
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,140
I'm not like me anymore, either.

358
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,147
It's the next one
on the right.

359
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,694
Brendan, right?

360
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,095
Yeah.

361
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,931
I'm Zack. Natalie's boyfriend?

362
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,901
How's it going?

363
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,604
I've been meaning to thank you
for helping her the way you did.

364
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,038
It's no problem.

365
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,573
I appreciate it.

366
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,575
Me and Nat been going
through some things.

367
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:16,080
because we're in one of those
on again, off again cycles

368
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,516
but that's the deal, dude.

369
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:25,789
I just pulled out of her car,
that's it, dude.

370
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,158
Later.

371
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,740
You got my message.

372
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,542
Are you okay?

373
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,976
What's goin' on?

374
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,613
I want you to tell me
about Brendan.

375
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,616
I wanna know the things
I said I didn't wanna know.

376
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,652
What happened, he do something?

377
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,787
No, no.

378
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,091
I just changed my mind.

379
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,060
Maybe you should talk to Mike.

380
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,931
I'd rather hear it from you.

381
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,666
Please?

382
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,959
Hey, got a minute?

383
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,027
What's up?

384
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,733
Those rumors going around,
are a lot of them true?

385
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:46,737
Yeah.

386
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,839
I was talking to the club,

387
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,309
and we haven't run any of this
past Mr. Stubbs yet

388
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:57,648
but it is our club and so a lot
of the decisions do fall on us.

389
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,216
You want me out?

390
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,819
No, no, no, just the opposite.

391
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,822
Well, sometimes I see
the work we do

392
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:08,192
and I feel like we're just
going through the motions,

393
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,394
you know, cleaning up garbage
in the park,

394
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,929
stuffing Red Cross envelopes.

395
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,665
It's good and everything,
but we're a faith club

396
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,700
and I just don't feel like
we're making

397
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,203
the spiritual connection
we should be.

398
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,038
What do you want me to do?

399
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,074
Well, we wanna really
transforms lives

400
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:28,145
and your experiences
may show us how.

401
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,814
We'd like you to help us
find projects

402
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,816
that can really make
a difference.

403
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:40,190
maybe something in your
old neighborhood.

404
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:44,261
Look, I'd like to help the club,
I really would,

405
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:49,933
but I just think it's better
if I don't go back there.

406
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,201
Oh.

407
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm just trying to move
past all that.

408
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,738
No, yeah, no, no worries.

409
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,209
We didn't think about that part.

410
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,944
Sorry.

411
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,819
Brendan, we believe in you.

412
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,929
Hey.

413
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,198
What's goin' on?

414
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,468
Somethin' on your mind?

415
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,271
Well, the Seekers, they asked me
if I'd take them into the city

416
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,373
and do some service work
down there.

417
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,110
Well, sounds like a real sign
of respect for you,

418
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,312
everything you've been through.

419
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,181
Well, part of me wants to do it.

420
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:41,118
Another part just doesn't
wanna go there.

421
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,320
That's totally understandable.

422
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,823
But let me just tell you this,

423
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,859
everything you do,
every decision you make,

424
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,329
you need to do a cost benefit
analysis.

425
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,832
You get to that in
economics class yet?

426
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,868
Uh, no.

427
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,071
How will something benefit you,
what will it cost you,

428
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,740
what do you have to risk.

429
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,008
But see, what people forget
sometimes is

430
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,845
there's a cost for not
doing something, too.

431
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,413
We don't only pay for
what we do in life,

432
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:13,183
we also pay for
what we don't do.

433
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,954
Yeah, it's a scary deal, I know.

434
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:21,959
You wanted to leave that part
of your life behind.

435
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,027
Pray on it.

436
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,197
Right decision will show
itself to you.

437
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,398
I know it did for me
just a little while back

438
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,134
when I was trying to decide
whether or not

439
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:33,504
to bring this young guy
into my house.

440
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,542
Thanks, Mike.

441
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,405
Next on the agenda
is the auction.

442
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:12,009
The posters are almost
ready to go,

443
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,478
we just need to select
a charity.

444
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,979
That looks good.

445
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,247
I'll get working on the charity.

446
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,883
How's the online bidding
for nominees coming?

447
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,853
Well, last week
the website crashed,

448
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,155
but other than that,
it's running smoothly.

449
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,957
We have a lot of bidders now.

450
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,493
That seems to be okay.
What else?

451
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,195
Great. John?

452
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,831
We just need to get
the decorations signed off on.

453
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,966
Who are we going to talk
to about that?

454
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,367
- Can you talk to her?
- Yeah.

455
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,603
All right, yeah, we need
refreshments...

456
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:53,050
Hey, Hannah, did Mr. Stubbs
talk to you about my situation?

457
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,919
Yeah, he said you'll be doing
some community service with us.

458
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,889
Yeah, I'd like to get my hours
in as soon as I can,

459
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,124
so if anything comes up.

460
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,393
What are you doing right now?

461
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,928
Just going to the mall.

462
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,464
Brendan's taking Chris Sheedy
and me downtown.

463
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,967
He's got an idea for a project
he wants us to see.

464
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:13,470
He said that if he told us,
we might not wanna go.

465
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:18,342
But it could count
towards your hours.

466
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,977
Kind of short notice.

467
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,511
Sure, whatever.

468
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:29,353

00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,976
What is this place?

477
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:29,279
This is where I used to live.

478
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,138
I told myself I would never
come back to this hole.

479
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,715
One of my friends died
right here.

480
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,030
Before I got locked up,
I used to run wild.

481
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,499
Bumped in and out
of foster homes.

482
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,570
Out of control, selling drugs.

483
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:30,207
Kids in the system
become your gang

484
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:34,711
and your gang becomes
your family.

485
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:39,349
And that type of living
almost got me killed.

486
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:44,488
The first six months I was
inside, I was so angry.

487
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,291
I was in solitary more
than I was out of it.

488
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:52,462
One day a chaplain came by
and handed me a Bible.

489
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,598
I laughed.

490
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,602
God never came to these places.

491
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:02,239
But I read that book

492
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:06,510
because it was the only book
they'd let me have.

493
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,579
And, I swear...

494
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:18,255
I realized that I hadn't
even been living at all,

495
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:21,158
had been going about it
all wrong.

496
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:34,204
I wanna rehab this house.

497
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:39,843
for neighborhood kids to come
and hang out.

498
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,611
A place where they can
work out their problems

499
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:46,516
with no struggles.

500
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,485
Just a good home to turn to.

501
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,520
How are you gonna do that?

502
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,623
Buy the house, fix it up?

503
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,492
- Who's gonna run it?
- I don't know.

504
00:34:55,494 --> 00:35:00,764
It's like I have a vision
and I have to just step into it.

505
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:06,203
What's impossible for man
is possible for God.

506
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,405
That's right.

507
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:14,478
I mean, look at my life,
the way it was.

508
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,347
It's a lot like this house.

509
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,149
And look at me now.

510
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,119
Nothing is impossible.

511
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,854
If God could give me
a second chance,

512
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:30,260
he could turn this house
into a castle.

513
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,129
What are you gonna call it?

514
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:36,233
Yeah, it needs a name.

515
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:41,738
Check this out:
House of Redemption.

516
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:47,811
That sounds like one of
your lame band names.

517
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,815
King's Castle.

518
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,919
Or how about just The Castle.

519
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,655
Yeah, I like that.

520
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,692
So explain to me again,

521
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:06,696
how exactly are we gonna
buy this place?

522
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,769
I don't know.

523
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,639
It's ambitious,
I'll tell you that.

524
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,742
Well, if it helps, I did a cost
benefit analysis last night.

525
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:20,677
Oh, so what,
you're a funny guy now?

526
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,747
I figured I could talk to some
local businesses

527
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:24,948
and see if they'd help out,

528
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,717
kick in some paint
and lumber and stuff.

529
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,721
sometimes can be purchased
for back taxes,

530
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,691
maybe even less if the city
wants to unload them.

531
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,659
You just need to prove to them
that you can take on

532
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,661
that sort of responsibility.

533
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,830
With your history,
that might be a tough call.

534
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,732
Yeah.

535
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,268
Might need me to co-sign
with you.

536
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,537
You'd do that for me?

537
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,373
I just did a quick cost
benefit analysis.

538
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,676
you can come stay in
the garage with me.

539
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,843
No joke.

540
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,278
Well, thanks, Mike.

541
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,381
figure out what you have to do
to pull this together,

542
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,884
I'll do whatever I can to help.

543
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,553
God will take care of the rest.

544
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,958
Power of faith, huh?

545
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,959
Hello, Natalie.

546
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,694
Hey.

547
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,531
- Got a second?
- Yeah.

548
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,003
I couldn't sleep last night.

549
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,504
That story you told in the house

550
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,241
just kept running over
and over in my head.

551
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,310
Well, I'm glad you were there.

552
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,778
I have an idea.

553
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,882
but the bachelor/bachelorette
auction is next month.

554
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,285
The money we raise,
we donate to local causes

555
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,388
and we still haven't decided
on a charity to support.

556
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,689
I'd like to talk
to student council

557
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,591
into donating to The Castle.

558
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,560
Do you think they'd go for that?

559
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:44,761
I don't see why not.

560
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,830
I am the president.

561
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,800
What?

562
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,770
I'm just surprised, I guess.

563
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,605
Well, don't be.

564
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,973
Thank you.

565
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,775
There is one catch, though.

566
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,876
You're gonna have
to do me a favor.

567
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:00,910
Name it.

568
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,545
Put yourself up for auction.

569
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:07,017
winners revealed at a party
we're throwing at the pavilion.

570
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,818
You're kidding, right?

571
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,889
to put money down
on a date with you.

572
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,025
It's kind of not my thing.

573
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,661
Yeah, but you're the face
of the franchise.

574
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,862
Can't raise money for The Castle

575
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,798
if its leading player
isn't in the game.

576
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,971
Hey, you know, maybe we can
auction Sheedy instead.

577
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,908
Do I detect an element of fear
in Mr. Fearless?

578
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,364
Shorty is poppin'.

579
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,098
What's her name?

580
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,399
What are you doing here?

581
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,468
Just checkin' in.

582
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,804
Shouldn't be here.

583
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,639
I bumped into Tevin
the other day

584
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:06,509
and he seems to remember
you and Tuck packing

585
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,478
a couple of shovels in a car

586
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,947
a couple of days before
we got busted.

587
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,549
Don't know what he's
talking about, man.

588
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,718
See, that's gang property, Bren,

589
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,988
and it's not doing anybody any
good sitting wherever it's at.

590
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,890
We need it working for us.

591
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,460
We need it in the streets
helping us build back up.

592
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,829
If Tuck did it, I don't know
where it is, okay?

593
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:28,865
See, I wish that I could
believe that.

594
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,867
Probably should think
about this some more.

595
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,636
I don't need to think on it, E.

596
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,707
You like these people, huh?

597
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,843
This place you are now?

598
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,979
You like the people you
hanging out with now, huh?

599
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,849
Seems like a nice place,
nice people.

600
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,986
And that girl...
she real fine.

601
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,721
What's that mean?

602
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,958
Take it easy, baby.

603
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,795
We just having a general
conversation, that's all, B.

604
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,981
<i>County clerk's office.</i>

605
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:21,851
Hi, I'm looking for information
on how to purchase a house.

606
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:25,021
I checked the website that lists
properties that have a tax lien.

607
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,023
<i>Do you have a parcel ID number?</i>

608
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:32,896
Yes, ma'am, 13004201.

609
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,964
<i>Please hold.</i>

610
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,436
Yes, ma'am.

611
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:43,840
Brendan, Brendan King.

612
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,742
Okay.

613
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,076
Natalie, I know you've
already locked down

614
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,745
a band for the auction,

615
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,847
but if you're looking
for an opening act,

616
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,550
you should check us out.

617
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,585
We play mostly
alternative rock...

618
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,020
I thought we discussed this.

619
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,021
Oh, I forgot you're
the gatekeeper

620
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,789
to the student council now?

621
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,525
No, we just don't need
an opening act for the auction.

622
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,827
Fine, I was just throwing it
out there...

623
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,762
Shhh!

624
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,797
No, I'm sorry.

625
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,200
So what do I do?

626
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:14,904
I just go down there
and... okay.

627
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,606
All right.

628
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,141
Thank you.

629
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,079
Thirty-five.

630
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,014
Thirty-five dollars?

631
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,954
They do realize the place isn't
even worth 35 cents, right?

632
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:33,957
Yeah, well, how it works is
we can go down there

633
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,227
and file a petition for it
and that sort of makes it ours.

634
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:40,063
But then we have 60 days
to come up with the rest.

635
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:45,935
Last year's auction
raised $3,500.

636
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:49,138
So, how much to file for
a petition, Brendan?

637
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,776
Ten dollars.

638
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,945
We're gonna do this.

639
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,524
Hey, sweetheart.

640
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,159
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,833
I talked to Stan today.

642
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,234
That job's coming open.

643
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,905
Anne Marie's going
on maternity leave.

644
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,643
I told them I'd discuss it
with you.

645
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,081
I don't think it's time yet.

646
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,017
Yeah, but when we talked
about it a couple of days ago,

647
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,985
you said it might be.

648
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,720
I know.

649
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:42,025
This could be a good thing,
Vanessa, getting back to work.

650
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:45,061
I worry.

651
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,097
You're out here in
the garden a lot,

652
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,333
but sometimes it seems to me

653
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:54,103
I mean, you grow all these
beautiful flowers...

654
00:42:56,341 --> 00:43:00,076
Maybe it's time for you to bring
them to some other places,

655
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:07,083
you know, back to the school,
back to work, back to church,

656
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,019
back to your friends
who care about you.

657
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:18,361
I talked to Russell
about Brendan.

658
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,231
Okay.

659
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,601
This was supposed to be
about healing?

660
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,603
Well, this does not feel like
healing to me.

661
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,870
It feels like more pain.

662
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,874
Vanessa, you don't
have to fear the boy.

663
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,877
He left that world behind
the day he was saved.

664
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,679
- Saved?
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,247
Is that it, Mike?

666
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,117
The dark clouds part,
the sun shines down

667
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,853
and the choir rejoices in song.

668
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:47,023
I didn't... I...

669
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,758
Sweetheart.

670
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,838
Got a second?

671
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:03,973
What's up?

672
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,208
That's what I'm wondering.

673
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,243
Lot of stories flying.

674
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,912
I've got nothing against you
personally.

675
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,781
You did a cool thing
helping Natalie

676
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:14,851
but some of the stuff
I heard you're into,

677
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,420
she doesn't need to be
around that.

678
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:21,190
You're right, she doesn't.

679
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,126
She won't.

680
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,794
Good.

681
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:28,131
'Cause if I find out she was,
we're gonna have a problem.

682
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,800

00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,821
My friends and I, we get in
with these clubs

709
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:34,290
and it's all about
the resume spike.

710
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,225
We pick a charity
and throw an event

711
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:39,362
and pass the money along
to someone else,

712
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,465
never really getting
our hands dirty.

713
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,901
It feels good, doesn't it?

714
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:46,369
Feels right what we're doing.

715
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:49,338
Hold still.

716
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:57,914
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened to your family?

717
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,119
Sorry.

718
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:09,258
No, it's... my mom died, drugs.

719
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:14,263
And my dad, I don't know
who he is.

720
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:17,333
Any brothers or sisters?

721
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,505
How does anyone make it
through that?

722
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:27,443
My parents are divorced
but I know who they are,

723
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,513
I know where they are.

724
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:39,055
Is that like a girlfriend
tattoo?

725
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:45,461
No, it's kind of like something
to remind me of how I got here.

726
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,063
A broken heart?

727
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:50,333
It's a mended heart.

728
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:53,336
Is that a cross in the middle?

729
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:56,539
Yeah, I kind of messed
that part up.

730
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,375
I like that it's not perfect.

731
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,015
There.

732
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,021
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

733
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:18,661
Well, I've made a lot
of bad decisions,

734
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:24,200
but at least I never
killed anybody.

735
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:29,572
It's just, um, I'm not
proud of them.

736
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,674
I have to go.

737
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,542
Hey, wait.

738
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,278
Natalie, hey, hang on.

739
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,914
Hey, hang on.

740
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:38,915
Whatever it is you're going
through, you don't,

741
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:42,418
you don't have to do it alone.

742
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,490
Brendan... yeah, I do.

743
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,316
You're not returning my texts.

744
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,417
You thought I would?

745
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,052
You said friends, right?

746
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,987
I broke up with you.
You should hate me right now.

747
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,555
Well, I can't.

748
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:21,691
We never really talked
about things,

749
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:25,294
about the accident
and the other stuff.

750
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,463
I don't know what else to say.

751
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,499
You're not answering
any texts, any calls

752
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,034
and anyone sees you
outside school,

753
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,136
you're hanging out
with the Seekers.

754
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,406
Yeah, you used to go out
and have fun

755
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:40,142
and now something's changed.

756
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,444
So what are you saying?

757
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:44,981
You can't tell me you're
having it with the Seekers.

758
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:49,752
So it's official then,
you've become one of them.

759
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:51,554
Maybe I have.

760
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,256
Really?

761
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,064
How's Natalie doing these days?

762
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,532
Why don't you ask her
yourself, man?

763
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,501
She doesn't talk to me much
lately and when she does,

764
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,804
it doesn't sound much like
the Natalie that I know.

765
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,572
What is it with you?

766
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:48,811
You saved her life, now maybe
you think you can save her soul?

767
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:52,181
I mean, isn't that what you guys
do in your club?

768
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,283
Huh?

769
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,585
Let me make this as straight
as I can for you.

770
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,055
Stay away from her!

771
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,159
I don't want any trouble.

772
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,594
Yeah, see, I've been
on the field

773
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,330
against teams loaded with
city trash waving their tats

774
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,599
and their thug signs.

775
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,502
They ain't so bad when it's
an even playing field.

776
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,372
When they don't have the posse
and the hardware.

777
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:19,642
What about when they do got it?

778
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,243
Eli, it's okay, man.

779
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,212
Yeah, it's okay, bro.

780
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,581
Yeah, I know.

781
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,349
Got your posse here, don't you?

782
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,552
- Put the gun down!
- I'm sorry!

783
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,153
You got my man outnumbered
four to one.

784
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,421
Hey, put it down!

785
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,423
- Huh? It's more even now, right?
- I'm sorry.

786
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,158
I know you're sorry.

787
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,662
So what you're gonna do is
go give my man an apology.

788
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:41,397
I... I apologize.

789
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,665
- Put it down.
- I ain't buying it.

790
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,101
- Say it on your knees.
- Enough.

791
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,436
- On your knees!
- I apologize!

792
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,505
Back off!

793
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,674
Get out of here, man.

794
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,577
What's wrong with you?

795
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,645
What's wrong with me?

796
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:02,418
What I don't get is why you
taking this from them.

797
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,155
and start waving guns
in people's faces.

798
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:11,560
Wow, you got stale
in the joint, bro.

799
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,331
Come on, you're taking
a ride with me.

800
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,599
No, man, I'm getting
out of here.

801
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:19,668
- Curfew.
- Curfew?

802
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,707
You don't get it do you?

803
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:28,878
They ain't never gonna
accept you out here.

804
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,679
You'll always be trash.

805
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:36,585
No matter how many houses
you fix up with them.

806
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:40,656

00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:44,620
Why is that?

820
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:47,823
the behind the music
special on me,

821
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:51,794
you can tell them, "I remember
meeting Sheedy in the hallway.

822
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:57,499
that his band had just gotten
the gig at the charity auction. "

823
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,568
- Seriously?
- Totally.

824
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,503
But I thought they already
had a band.

825
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,373
Well, they backed out.

826
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:08,377
Would you mind helping me
hand out these flyers, though?

827
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:10,879
Isn't that your publicist's job?

828
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:14,583
That's cold, man, that's cold.

829
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,396
Hmm, you think that's him
right there, right?

830
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:28,731
Yeah, I know that's him.

831
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,933
- We got a winner.
- Hey, I'm on it.

832
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,803
Bad day for a bike ride.

833
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:37,006
I'd say so myself.

834
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,883
You want me to keep following
him or should I get him now?

835
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,486
Yeah, we follow him.

836
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,792
Stay close.

837
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,927
When we hit him,
we hit him hard.

838
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,497
Got it.

839
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,579
Did you get a look
at these guys at all?

840
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:21,550
How many, height, weight,
what they're wearing?

841
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:24,019
I really didn't see that much.

842
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,355
Hey, Mr. Stubbs.

843
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:27,690
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

844
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,625
I'm doing all right.

845
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:32,528
Brendan, don't I look pretty.

846
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,496
It is an improvement.

847
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,898
Hey, Russell.

848
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,100
Mike.

849
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:41,003
Look, I just got one more
question for you.

850
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,938
We got some security video
from the school,

851
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,907
caught a glimpse of a van
driving pretty fast

852
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,742
around the time you were hit.

853
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:50,813
Black van, ring a bell?

854
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:53,916
Look, I really don't
remember that much.

855
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,117
Give it time.

856
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,853
- It'll come back to you.
- All right.

857
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,988
- Mike.
- Yeah.

858
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,890
Look, thanks for coming, guys.

859
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:07,830
Yeah, we'll have you back
in math class in no time.

860
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:13,896
Brendan?

861
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:17,966
I heard about Chris.

862
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,035
I feel so bad.

863
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:27,176
About the other day, I'm sorry
I just took off like that.

864
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:29,445
It's cool.

865
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,917
I guess I just got scared

866
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:38,987
of what you'd think of me
if I told you.

867
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,857
Well, you don't have to be.

868
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:44,059
Yeah, I do.

869
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,628
It'll change things.

870
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,931
Maybe you're playing it
just right then.

871
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:50,699
Keep whatever it is
buried inside

872
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,067
and let it eat away at you

873
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:55,504
until you can't feel or care
about anything at all.

874
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,076
Yeah, maybe you're right.

875
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,058
Natalie?

876
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,260
Natalie!

877
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,697
Hey, wait!

878
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,904
Natalie?

879
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:39,982
I got pregnant last year.

880
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:45,687
I didn't tell anybody.

881
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,891
Zack didn't know,
or my mom.

882
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,698
It was a mistake,

883
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,770
but it happened
and I dealt with it.

884
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,576
I thought it was for the best.

885
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,081
Thing of it is I didn't think

886
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:19,087
I was strong enough
to have a baby,

887
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:28,697
but now I don't think I'm strong
enough to carry this emptiness.

888
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:32,100
I'm not sure of anything
anymore.

889
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:34,269
But please, don't tell me
faith can fix me,

890
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,073
because I cut myself off
from God forever.

891
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:43,345
It's okay, I promise.
It's okay.

892
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:07,869
Brendan around?

893
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:11,974
He's not here right now.

894
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:15,043
You know, I think
it's really nice

895
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:16,912
what you guys are
doing for him,

896
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,114
the way you gave him
a second chance

897
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:23,785
after all the trouble he's been
through, you know.

898
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,254
Not like it's his fault, though.

899
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:31,660
Kind of like a dog that's
bred to be vicious.

900
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,895
Can't help it.

901
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:37,199
I think you should leave.

902
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:40,235
See there's a funny thing
about fighting dogs,

903
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:43,739
'cause no matter how many times
you try to save them,

904
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:46,174
there's not enough
TLC on the planet

905
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:49,111
that can keep him down.

906
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:55,784
Sooner or later, they'll turn.

907
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:58,987
I said he's not here right now.

908
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:05,060
You tell Brendan...
Eli says, hey.

909
01:01:11,402 --> 01:01:16,972
My mom has this vision of
what she wants me to be.

910
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:24,046
I'm afraid that if I tell her,
that vision will be destroyed.

911
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:42,030
What about Zack?

912
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,865
Where does that stand?

913
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:48,270
Where does that stand?
It stands still with Zack.

914
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:52,708
My whole life feels like
it's been standing still

915
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:57,012
and then you showed up.

916
01:01:57,014 --> 01:02:00,749
You really need to talk to Zack.

917
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,721
Yeah.

918
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,929
Mom?

919
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:20,168
♪ You and I will pull the tide
and steal the sand ♪

920
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:24,339
♪ From beneath your toes ♪

921
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:35,283
♪ and bring you closer
to the center of the world ♪

922
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:42,324
♪ and the center of you ♪♪

923
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,069
Yo, E, it's me.

924
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,271
Yeah, we gotta talk.

925
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:39,414
Looks like the transformation
stuck,

926
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,184
'cause he ain't the same old, G.

927
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,252
What's up, Bren.

928
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,557
So this is it, huh?

929
01:03:55,132 --> 01:04:00,435
Man, we was family,
bonded through blood.

930
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:06,942
Blood that we spilled,
blood that we saw spilled

931
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:11,046
because Tuck bled out
in front of both of us.

932
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:13,181
You got something you wanna say?

933
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:17,252
Yeah, you wanna hurt
somebody, hurt me.

934
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:23,091
That's all you got, huh?

935
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,895
E, what you're looking for
isn't the answer.

936
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:27,929
Let it go, man.

937
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,098
You cannot let go who you are.

938
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,300
I did and it's so much better.

939
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:35,370
You can, too, life is supposed
to be good, Eli.

940
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:40,108
You've got
to be kidding me.

941
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:44,045
Listen, I promise you there is
a hope so great

942
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,115
that it changed me
and it can change you.

943
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:52,153
Last chance, stop trying
to save me

944
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:56,057
and save yourself
and your new people.

945
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,226
You don't have to do this.

946
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:05,400
Did you hear that?

947
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,104
- Hmm?
- What was that?

948
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,172
Can't sleep?

949
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:18,980
Mike.

950
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,348
Huh?

951
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,418
- Brendan's not back.
- Hmm?

952
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,393
Mike, Mike!

953
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,628
What?

954
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:37,165
Brendan, Brendan!

955
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:43,004
- Brendan.
- I'll call 911.

956
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,973
No, they'll put him away.

957
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:46,608
Brendan.

958
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,610
Help me get him up!

959
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:51,112
Vanessa, help me, please!

960
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,455
Don't let him fall.

961
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,592
Don't let him fall off the back.

962
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:06,661
Watch his head.

963
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:13,168
Looks like they've gotten
to him pretty good.

964
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,270
I don't wanna bring
this in here.

965
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,638
I don't want this in here.

966
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,140
Vanessa, we already have.

967
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,675
I'm gonna call the police.

968
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:24,512
Vanessa, help me, please.

969
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,681
You know what to do, I don't.

970
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:46,634
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- Shh...

971
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:50,171
There's no way for me to
know what is going on,

972
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,774
if there's internal bleeding or
anything, I don't know that.

973
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,078
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

974
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,615
I need a cover.

975
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,387
It's okay, buddy.

976
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,589
Relax, Brendan.

977
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:16,564
It's okay, it's okay, relax.

978
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,633
Ice pack.

979
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:21,436
Place it right over there.

980
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:28,576
Two minutes on, two minutes
off this area.

981
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:31,146
This is all I can do.

982
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:33,648
Okay.

983
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,533
<i>Hello, County.</i>

984
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:53,435
Detective Russell Dwyer, please.

985
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,670
<i>I haven't seen him yet, ma'am.
It's a bit early.</i>

986
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:56,571
<i>Can I help you?</i>

987
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,440
When will he be in?

988
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:01,342
<i>His shift starts at 7:00.</i>

989
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,310
Oh.

990
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:03,611
<i>Is there a message?</i>

991
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,146
<i>Ma'am?</i>

992
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:07,215
No, no message.

993
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,647
It's okay, son.

994
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,584
I know what you set out to do,
you know, I do,

995
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:43,852
but it's too much.

996
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:46,621
I mean, first the car,
the house, now this?

997
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,189
- V...
- Listen!

998
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,191
The boy needs to be
under the care of a doctor!

999
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,360
He needs to be in a hospital!

1000
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,363
Hospitals ask questions.
You know that.

1001
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,265
He's aged out of the system.

1002
01:08:57,267 --> 01:09:00,135
This is his last stop.
Then what?

1003
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:01,736
He goes back out to the streets?

1004
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,838
If that happens, Mike,
it's not our fault.

1005
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,374
It's not on us.

1006
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:09,878
Maybe not,
but it feels like it is.

1007
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:16,317
I have always been
surrounded by men

1008
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,687
who could never turn their backs
on people in need

1009
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,389
and I guess I should feel like
that's a blessing,

1010
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,691
but I feel abandoned!

1011
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:24,893
Lewis never abandoned you.

1012
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,729
Well, then why am I here
and he's not?

1013
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:30,398
Oh, really, V, really?

1014
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,468
You're not here in any sense
that I remember.

1015
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,602
Lewis was taken,
but then you've gone

1016
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,538
and given everything else away.

1017
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,876
I was abandoned by whoever I was
praying to all those years.

1018
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:46,514
Why did he let it happen?
Why?

1019
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,652
I mean, I have tried, Mike,
I swear to you I have tried

1020
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:52,720
to believe that
there's a reason.

1021
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,556
I mean, there's a reason
for everything, right?

1022
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:55,857
That's what we're always
telling ourselves, right?

1023
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,395
Well, I can't think but that
maybe the only answer is

1024
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,530
that there is no answer!

1025
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:06,834
there's just random chaos
and that's all there is.

1026
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,370
Lewis's death was a tragedy,

1027
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,507
but God will use it
for a better purpose.

1028
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,275
I believe that, V,
I really do.

1029
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:16,778
I know.

1030
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,848
Now, we can turn away from
this kid or we can turn to him.

1031
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,755
I wish I could believe
like you believe.

1032
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:36,497
It's been a long, long, long,
long road

1033
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:40,301
and I... I really don't know
anymore.

1034
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:42,737
I just don't know.

1035
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,671
V...

1036
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:47,976
No, I can't, just let me get...

1037
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:13,001
He was in a fight.

1038
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:14,736
Where?

1039
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:16,704
Don't know.

1040
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,406
He's not saying.

1041
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:20,375
He got roughed up pretty bad,
though.

1042
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,610
Can I see him?

1043
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,580
He's resting now
and I'm not so sure

1044
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:29,884
he'd want you to see him
like that.

1045
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:32,620
He didn't say what happened?

1046
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,924
I'll tell him you stopped by.

1047
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,808
Maybe I should help you
with that.

1048
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,009
I got it.

1049
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:56,077
Look, it's not a request.

1050
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,347
Just take a break.
I'll do it.

1051
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,417
Okay.

1052
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,821
Thank you.

1053
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:25,707
Hey! Hey!

1054
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,821
What happened with you
and Brendan?

1055
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:40,888
What?

1056
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,724
Did you get in a fight with him?

1057
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:47,428
No, but he's been in a fight,
got hurt pretty bad.

1058
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,963
Wasn't me.

1059
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,733
What do you see in him anyway?

1060
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,802
With all his baggage,
where is he really going?

1061
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,371
He's turned his life around.

1062
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:59,140
Right, through Jesus.

1063
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:00,908
What is it that you don't like?

1064
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:04,612
or someone that has
a relationship with God?

1065
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,614
Both. Some kids just
substitute the God thing in

1066
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,916
for whatever else they've
been using or abusing,

1067
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,920
instead of whatever other kind
of crazy they were before.

1068
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:14,989
Some are downright scary,

1069
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,625
not to mention being
the biggest hypocrites.

1070
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:19,894
Brendan's not crazy
and he's not a hypocrite.

1071
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,929
You haven't
known him long.

1072
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,699
He could just be using you,
using your issues

1073
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:26,834
and his religion thing
for whatever he wants.

1074
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,837
Stop calling it a thing,
a God thing, a religion thing.

1075
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,106
It isn't a thing to him,
it's a way of life,

1076
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,942
a way to life when he was
headed for death before.

1077
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:37,678
Listen to yourself!

1078
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,814
You sound like a Bible thumper.

1079
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,451
I'd rather sound like anybody
in the world right now

1080
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,953
than what you sound like.

1081
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,854
Just be still.

1082
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:23,057
Be still, Brendan, shh.

1083
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,978
You're safe. Shh.

1084
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:54,655
Shh... shh.

1085
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,873
Morning, V.

1086
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,140
Russell.

1087
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,876
I was passing on my way to work

1088
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:17,144
and the scent of that omelet
stopped me in my tracks.

1089
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,279
Well, you know what?

1090
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,581
You can just have
half of this one.

1091
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:23,184
That sounds good.

1092
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:27,755
Hey, listen, you didn't happen
to call my number

1093
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,858
at the station
the other morning?

1094
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,093
Me?

1095
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:36,130
Yeah, caller ID put
the number here.

1096
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,298
What call where?

1097
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,733
- Hey, morning, Mike.
- Morning.

1098
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:41,202
Did you call the station
the other morning?

1099
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,271
Did I?

1100
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:52,246
Look, if there's something
you wanna say, I'm all ears.

1101
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:55,950
Nothing to be afraid of.

1102
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:57,852
Is that kid causing you
some trouble?

1103
01:15:57,854 --> 01:16:00,621
Brendan? No.

1104
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,996
Oh! My brain.

1105
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:11,999
It was me. I did call you.

1106
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:15,102
Yeah, you know you were telling
us about that rec center?

1107
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,070
Yeah.

1108
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:20,207
Well, Mike and I discussed it

1109
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:24,679
and we want to donate
some of Lewis's things.

1110
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:25,980
- Right.
- Yeah.

1111
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:29,183
You're starting to part with
some of Lewis's things.

1112
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:32,119
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1113
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:33,754
Well, did you get it?

1114
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,856
Did I get what?

1115
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:38,926
The rec center's number.

1116
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,662
No, not yet.

1117
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,611
Thank you.

1118
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:33,381
Brendan really thinks that
he's gonna take the house.

1119
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:38,219
That should be and could be
making us a whole lot of money.

1120
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:40,054
And make a clubhouse.

1121
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:46,293
Make it hot, Lex.

1122
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:48,896
You wanna play games?

1123
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,136
<i>Breaking news this morning,
firefighters were busy</i>

1124
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:58,172
<i>in the city last night with
a suspected case of arson.</i>

1125
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,075
<i>A fire apparently started
shortly before 2:00 a. m.</i>

1126
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:02,743
<i>at a house on Scio Street.</i>

1127
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,812
<i>They put it out about 15 min...</i>

1128
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,451
How you feeling?

1129
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,123
Can I get you something
to eat, drink?

1130
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,993
Sure.

1131
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:42,349
Brendan, you know that house
that you guys were working on?

1132
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,985
There was a fire.

1133
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,258
I'm sorry.

1134
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:55,322
Hey.

1135
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:58,025
Hey.

1136
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,972
Look, I didn't mean
to just pop in on you.

1137
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,242
I just wanted to know
you're okay.

1138
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:24,985
Here, I got something for you.

1139
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:29,990
It's not a big deal, just saw it
at the mall last week and...

1140
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,368
Brendan?

1141
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:47,308
- I can't take this.
- What?

1142
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:51,078
Brendan, we'll find
another house.

1143
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,848
We'll start all over.
I'll talk to student council.

1144
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:58,452
We can still use the auction
to support this.

1145
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:00,354
If you're trying to scare me,
it's working.

1146
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,556
Maybe you should be
scared of me.

1147
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:06,460
Yeah, well, you would be if
you know what's inside me.

1148
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,196
What does that mean?

1149
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,068
Come on, you can
tell me anything.

1150
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,471
Brendan, will you please
say something?

1151
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:19,139
Why don't you say something?

1152
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:21,041
Say something to Zack,
say something to your mom.

1153
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,376
Let them know what
you're dealing with.

1154
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,111
They're the ones you should
be concerned about.

1155
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:26,380
Forget about me, I'm...

1156
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,387
You should just go, Natalie.

1157
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:37,491
That's it? After everything?

1158
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,686
Packing?

1159
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,491
I put you and Vanessa
in a bad spot, Mike.

1160
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:14,094
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

1161
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:18,699
I helped a friend bury some
stuff before we got arrested.

1162
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:22,236
Drugs.

1163
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:24,571
The guys that beat you up,
they know that?

1164
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:27,508
Yeah, and they're gonna
hurt some people

1165
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,478
if I don't get it back to them,
people close to me.

1166
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,950
Like Sheedy, like the house
that they burned down.

1167
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,085
- Then give it to them.
- It's not that simple, Mike.

1168
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:41,455
If I had it my way I'd let it
stay buried, let it rot,

1169
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,324
but they won't let that happen.

1170
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:47,094
it's out there on the streets
hurting people and ruining lives

1171
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:51,065
and I won't let that happen.

1172
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:54,435
That doesn't leave you
many options, does it?

1173
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,403
Only one that I know of.

1174
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:59,740
Only one because you're only
listening to your own voice.

1175
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:03,010
You're shutting out God.
Can't you see that?

1176
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,745
Yeah, I did that, too.

1177
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:08,549
When they took away my baby boy,
I turned my back on God,

1178
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:11,151
tried to handle it on my own.

1179
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,720
I held my thumb out
for a way out, Mike,

1180
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:15,255
and it didn't come, okay?

1181
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:16,657
So now I gotta do this my way.

1182
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,093
- It is not too late, Brendan.
- I gotta go, Mike.

1183
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:22,096
No, no, you wanna make this
a fight of flesh and blood,

1184
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:23,464
but it's not.

1185
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:26,433
It's spiritual with the powers
of darkness.

1186
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:30,437
The enemy is afraid of what
you can truly become.

1187
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,340
You need to turn this over
to God right here, right now.

1188
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,010
Mike, I gotta go.

1189
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,144
- Put the bag down.
- Mike...

1190
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:39,079
Put it down!

1191
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:42,483
Sit down. Sit down!

1192
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,323
Trust in the Lord with
all your heart

1193
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:53,193
and lean not on your
own understanding.

1194
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,561
In all your ways, submit to him

1195
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:57,498
and he will make
your paths straight.

1196
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,633
If you do not stand
firm in your faith,

1197
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:02,636
you will not stand at all.

1198
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:06,573
He will fight this fight
for you, son.

1199
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,642
I know.

1200
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,614
We should talk to Russell.

1201
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,558
You come on down
when you're ready.

1202
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:13,740
Brendan!

1203
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,442
Where in the city is he going?

1204
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:49,710
I don't know.

1205
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:50,744
Well, what do you know, Mike?

1206
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:52,679
What can you tell me?

1207
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,381
There's been a van
hanging out here

1208
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:56,650
for the past couple of days,
a black van.

1209
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:59,319
Here's the license plate.

1210
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,188
Look, I told you
this is a bad idea

1211
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:04,758
Russell, the kid's heart is
in the right place.

1212
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,261
I've seen inside their hearts,
Mike.

1213
01:26:07,263 --> 01:26:09,463
The day I found Lewis
on the side of the road.

1214
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:10,731
No, no, that's not what it is!

1215
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:12,666
Yeah, it is.

1216
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:13,667
It's not your fault, Russell.

1217
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:16,370
- What?
- Lewis.

1218
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:18,672
Look, I'm talking about Brendan,
Mike, not Lewis.

1219
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:22,743
in every conversation we've had
for the past four years.

1220
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,878
- Oh.
- You and Vanessa both.

1221
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,447
I told you once
and I'll tell you again,

1222
01:26:27,449 --> 01:26:29,883
Lewis did not become a cop
because you encouraged him

1223
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,285
or you nudged him.

1224
01:26:31,287 --> 01:26:35,355
He became a cop
because he wanted to!

1225
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:40,227
It's not on you, Russell,
and you don't have to make it

1226
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:43,230
your mission to protect
Vanessa and me.

1227
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:46,233
Well, it feels like I do.

1228
01:26:46,235 --> 01:26:49,836
You got to let it go.

1229
01:27:56,872 --> 01:28:02,309
All right, where is it?

1230
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:03,944
Should be right here.

1231
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,313
Should be where?

1232
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,748
Look, we buried it 15 feet
from that tree.

1233
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:14,655
- Calm down.
- I said it's under here.

1234
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:16,556
Let's dig.

1235
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:18,725
That's what we came to do.

1236
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,861
Just shut up and dig, man.

1237
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:24,364
You shut up. Let's go.

1238
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:25,499
You guys been fighting
like little girls

1239
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:28,468
since you joined the set.

1240
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:40,580
You know, we weren't happy
doing what we had to do, Bren.

1241
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,349
It hurt, man.

1242
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:45,852
I just want you to know.

1243
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:50,590
You are a brother to us.

1244
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:53,794
And Lex, you're digging
incredibly slow.

1245
01:28:53,796 --> 01:28:55,762
Rish, will you help him, please?

1246
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:58,565
Yo, this dude's playing us, E,
there's nothing in here.

1247
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,703
Calm down, all right,
because Brendan knows

1248
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:05,072
what happens when
people play me.

1249
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:13,613
Come on, dig, man.

1250
01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:15,015
This is empty, man.

1251
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:17,851
Brendan, where's the box?

1252
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:20,987
Oh, yeah.

1253
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:23,924
And the gong sounds,
tough guy.

1254
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:26,827
That's the music I was
waiting to here, come on.

1255
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:29,896
Funny how the memory works,
huh?

1256
01:29:35,437 --> 01:29:38,905
Yeah, yeah, it's supposed
to be heavy.

1257
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,876
This is what you do for family.

1258
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:43,810
Let me see it.

1259
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:46,413
Got your blade?

1260
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:33,527
Back up.

1261
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:34,895
Get up!

1262
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:37,964
Get over there.

1263
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:41,635
Get up!

1264
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:43,136
- Get on your knees.
- All right.

1265
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:45,939
All of you.

1266
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,980
What are you doing, Brendan?

1267
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:55,916
You're not gonna shoot us...

1268
01:30:55,918 --> 01:30:58,785
Oh, come on, man, take it easy,
Brendan, take it easy.

1269
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:01,488
Get the brick, Lex, and put it
back in the cooler.

1270
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:03,590
Close it up.

1271
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:06,126
This is not how you treat
family, Brendan.

1272
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:08,094
You ain't my family, Eli.

1273
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:10,897
Family's supposed to care
about each other.

1274
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:13,767
All you ever did was care
about yourself.

1275
01:31:13,769 --> 01:31:15,969
This is gonna stop.

1276
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,504
This is gonna stop right now!

1277
01:31:17,506 --> 01:31:20,040
Don't, man, don't.

1278
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,042
All right.

1279
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:25,078
Just take the stuff, all right,
take it and go.

1280
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,048
I don't want it, Eli.

1281
01:31:40,262 --> 01:31:42,996
Don't, don't.

1282
01:31:57,112 --> 01:32:00,113
Just get out of here.

1283
01:32:10,726 --> 01:32:12,192
Get the box.

1284
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,694
Get the box.

1285
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:24,771
This ain't over, Bren.

1286
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:27,240
And you know it.

1287
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:48,922
You never came to bed.

1288
01:33:48,924 --> 01:33:50,991
I couldn't.

1289
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:55,629
Just hope he's all right.

1290
01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:01,835
I thought for sure I heard him
come back last night

1291
01:34:01,837 --> 01:34:05,238
and when I looked outside,
it was the car next door.

1292
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:12,012
And if it was him, would you let
him stay after everything now?

1293
01:34:12,014 --> 01:34:15,081
This scares me, Mike, it does.

1294
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:18,051
I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

1295
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,799
He was addicted to this game.

1296
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,969
Tried to teach it to me
a million times.

1297
01:34:35,971 --> 01:34:38,271
I could never seem to get
the hang of it.

1298
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:08,101

I was just having a conversation
about you not two minutes ago

1314
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:08,194
and now here you are parked
across the street

1315
01:36:08,196 --> 01:36:12,031
from my parking spot.

1316
01:36:12,033 --> 01:36:14,834
What are the odds?

1317
01:36:14,836 --> 01:36:17,403
I don't know.
You're the odds man.

1318
01:36:17,405 --> 01:36:22,375
Oh, they got to be
1,000 to 1.

1319
01:36:22,377 --> 01:36:26,212
Where'd you get those bruises
on your face?

1320
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:32,385
Vanessa and Mike know
you're here?

1321
01:36:32,387 --> 01:36:34,120
No.

1322
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:41,261
Well, maybe you could clear
a few things up for me.

1323
01:36:41,263 --> 01:36:44,264
We caught the guys that ran
into your buddy, Sheedy.

1324
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:46,866
- When was this?
- Early this morning.

1325
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,305
Exit the vehicle slowly!

1326
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:54,274
On your knees! On your knees!

1327
01:36:54,276 --> 01:36:56,309
Hands on your head!

1328
01:36:58,078 --> 01:37:01,414
Mike called, said he saw
a black van

1329
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:03,883
hanging around the house
a couple of nights ago.

1330
01:37:03,885 --> 01:37:06,486
Pegged the plate to a T.

1331
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:13,159
And get this, they were old
buddies of yours from downtown.

1332
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:28,007
Crazy, huh?

1333
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:32,178
You wanna know something else?

1334
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,015
They were driving around
with a cooler full of heroin.

1335
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:54,167
Looks like those boys are going
back inside for a long time.

1336
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:02,141
What were they doing hanging
around Mike and V's place

1337
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:08,214
and what does all this
have to do with you?

1338
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:11,117
I didn't know what to do.

1339
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:14,454
You didn't know
about the cooler?

1340
01:38:14,456 --> 01:38:16,055
I thought I could handle it
on my own.

1341
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,457
I shoulda came to you.

1342
01:38:17,459 --> 01:38:19,325
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

1343
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:23,596
You're sorry?

1344
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:25,665
You know what's supposed
to happen now, don't you?

1345
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:28,301
Yeah.

1346
01:38:28,303 --> 01:38:30,503
Well, what are you doing here?

1347
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:34,540
Turning yourself in?

1348
01:38:34,542 --> 01:38:36,576
I guess so.

1349
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:50,523
Go home, Brendan.

1350
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:54,494
Mike and V are looking for you.

1351
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:04,337
For the record,
I still got you at 90%.

1352
01:39:04,339 --> 01:39:07,640
Doesn't mean I'm not
pulling for you,

1353
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:11,377
but I'm not betting on you yet.

1354
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:29,595
You all right?

1355
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:30,997
Yeah.

1356
01:39:30,999 --> 01:39:33,700
Just stick this right on
the end, okay?

1357
01:39:33,702 --> 01:39:36,336
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1358
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,082
Everything okay?

1359
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:53,319
Everything, uh,
worked itself out.

1360
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,127
You hungry?

1361
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:05,164
Uh... yeah.

1362
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,632
Give me a hand with this.

1363
01:40:06,634 --> 01:40:08,568
Sure.

1364
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:18,378
Let's eat.

1365
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,780
All right.

1366
01:40:43,805 --> 01:40:46,406
Hello, Sandra.
How are you?

1367
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:18,438
Ta-da. Not broken anymore.

1368
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,839
How does it feel?

1369
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:21,641
Like rubber.

1370
01:41:21,643 --> 01:41:22,842
How are you making out?

1371
01:41:22,844 --> 01:41:24,477
Well, I've never been
auctioned before,

1372
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:27,113
so kind of weird, I guess.

1373
01:41:27,115 --> 01:41:28,648
Don't worry, my sources tell me

1374
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:30,216
that someone cracked open
their piggy bank

1375
01:41:30,218 --> 01:41:34,387
and dropped some
serious coin on you.

1376
01:41:34,389 --> 01:41:38,124
I talked to my mom and Zack.

1377
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:39,692
I'm glad.

1378
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:42,595
- Step one, right?
- Yeah.

1379
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:46,365
I don't wanna give up
on this, Brendan.

1380
01:41:46,367 --> 01:41:49,102
- On any of it.
- Me neither.

1381
01:41:55,477 --> 01:41:57,877
You think he's gonna
be all right?

1382
01:41:57,879 --> 01:42:01,848
I think he's gonna
be just fine.

1383
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:03,649
Ready for this?

1384
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:06,652
I guess so.

1385
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:10,790
Hold tight, Brendan.

1386
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:13,860
Greater things are yet to come.

1387
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:19,332
Everyone, put your hands
together

1388
01:42:19,334 --> 01:42:21,667
and welcome this year's
nominees.

1389
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,474
<i>Everyone has their number.</i>

1390
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:31,811
<i>Mine is holding at 18.</i>

1391
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:33,880
<i>If you would have told me
that last year</i>

1392
