1
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,106
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,147
<i>in an English castle
far, far away,</i>

3
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,115
<i>there lived a pampered
personage by the name of...</i>

4
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,345
<i>...Prince.</i>

5
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,779
All right,
everyone, he's awake.

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,881
Hurry! Hurry!

7
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:06,981
Come along, quickly.

8
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,118
Right, are we all ready?
Get the Carlyle log.

9
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,800
<i>Prince knew no other life</i>

10
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,137
<i>than a life ofluxury.</i>

11
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,211
<i>Oh, did I mention
that Prince was a cat?</i>

12
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,175
Good morning, Prince.

13
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,749
Your tea.

14
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,050
Mm-hmm-hmm! Breakie.

15
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,716
I have your favorite dish.

16
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,260
Carlyle log.

17
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,297
Ah, lovely.

18
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,269
Super.

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,541
Oh, it's good to be the king.

20
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,382
<i>On the other side of the world,</i>

21
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,956
<i>there lived
an equally pampered cat</i>

22
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,855
<i>who thought he was a king,</i>

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,293
<i>but who ruled over
a somewhat smaller domain.</i>

24
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,092
Meow.

25
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,594
I'm the king of the cul-de-sac.

26
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,671
That's what I'm talking about.

27
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:30,709
Jon and I have everything
I could ever want.

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,540
Food in the fridge.
Cable and satellite.

29
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,238
And don't forget lasagna.

30
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:39,307
That's right.
It's good to be king.

31
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,554
I want you to know, you're the
most important thing in my life.

32
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,820
Let me sleep, please.

33
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,624
Before I met you,
my life had no meaning.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,756
I was incomplete.

35
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,357
Oh, you still are, really.

36
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,835
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

37
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,998
...will you marry me?

38
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,167
Eh? Marriage?

39
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,901
Well, this is kind of sudden.

40
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,878
There may be
some legal issues here.

41
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,973
Look, I like you,
but not as a spouse.

42
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,247
Maybe as a servant, we could
stay together, make it work.

43
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,084
So what do you say... Liz?

44
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,126
- Wait a second. Liz? Liz?
- Garfield.

45
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,320
Liz is a girl.

46
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,659
No, worse.
She's a girl vet.

47
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,029
Turkey's ready.

48
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,761
Well, I think
Jon has touched bottom now.

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,668
Hmm, we gotta put an end
to this torture.

50
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,172
Time for a new DJ.

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,690
Somebody take my temperature.

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,520
Garfield!

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,186
Whoa!

54
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,889
Man, you have changed.

55
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,331
I can't have you messing
this up for me, okay?

56
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,232
- Oh, I get it. It's her.
- Come here.

57
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,396
She doesn't like our music.

58
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,565
Whatever happened toJon?

59
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,575
My metal-head guy. My dude.

60
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,077
You were so much cooler
when you wore a mullet.

61
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,646
Now stay here.

62
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,648
So much cooler.

63
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,845
I suppose she likes
this haircut.

64
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,080
- Coming!
- Tell me she likes it the way it is now.

65
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,356
- Hey, Liz.
-Jon, I have incredible news.

66
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,556
Guess who's going to be
speaking at this year's fund-raiser

67
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,723
for the Royal Animal
Conservancy.

68
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,664
Siegfried and Roy?

69
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,736
- Oh, come on.
-Just Siegfried?

70
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,429
Jane Goodall dropped out
at the last minute

71
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,801
because she's nursing
a sick chimp

72
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,135
and they asked me.

73
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,300
I mean, it's gonna be at
this really cool castle

74
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,342
on a huge estate.

75
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,844
Well, Liz, that-that's...

76
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,914
I am flying to London
tomorrow morning.

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,812
- Can you believe it?
- What?

78
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,885
I mean, I have
to pack, and...

79
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,510
Oh, are these rose
petals and candles?

80
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,385
Yeah, well, Liz,
I have some...

81
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,790
some important news
of-of-of my own.

82
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,953
Uh...

83
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,894
Hey, me, too.

84
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,896
Excuse me, do you believe
in love at first sight?

85
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,733
I was hoping you'd say yes.

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,799
You have made me
so very, very cat-happy.

87
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,537
- Uh...
- Well, come on.

88
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,443
- What's the news?
- The news is, I, uh...

89
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,741
I finally house-trained Odie.

90
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,286
- Really?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,754
That would explain
the rose petals.

92
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,789
I have to pack.

93
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,158
I'm so sorry
about dinner.

94
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,629
But you know what?

95
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,461
I will send your
regards to the queen.

96
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,795
Okay, congratulations
on Odie.

97
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,268
Oh, oh, yeah.
And, hey, you, too.

98
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,497
They're lucky to have you.

99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,398
Bye.

100
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,737
Oh, I thought she'd never leave.

101
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,975
Garfield, you ate
the whole turkey?

102
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,016
Well, yeah.

103
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,518
What are you
doing with this?

104
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,918
Oh, never mind.

105
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,480
It's too late.
She's already off to...

106
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,518
Good stuffing.

107
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,291
Well, come on, cheer up.

108
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,195
- I saved you the wishbone.
- There's nothing I can do.

109
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,324
Sure there is.

110
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,699
Return the ring and
get your money back.

111
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,795
Wait a minute.
I'll go to London.

112
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,840
- Oh, you poor sap.
- She'll love it.

113
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,169
- She'll be surprised.
- Please don't do this.

114
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,436
- She'll be thrilled.
- Tell me you're not gonna do this.

115
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,011
- She'll say yes.
- Please, don't.

116
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,307
I gotta go pack.

117
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,472
You moron.

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,117
This is a huge mistake,Jon.

119
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,981
One of your biggest.

120
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,986
Don't roam. Stay home.

121
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,182
Odie and I are not just coming
along for the ride, pal.

122
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,256
This is actually
an intervention.

123
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,065
Okay, guys. Here we are.

124
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,533
Oh, quick flight.

125
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,467
We must have been
in the jet stream.

126
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,496
England is no great shakes, huh?

127
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,805
I mean, the buildings here look
like, uh, the kennel back home.

128
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,379
That is the kennel back home.

129
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,506
They'll never take me alive.

130
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,641
They're gonna
be fine,Jon.

131
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,741
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,345
Garfield's never stayed
in a kennel before,

133
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,219
so I'm afraid
he might have

134
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,622
some separation anxiety.

135
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,852
No.

136
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,828
He's probably fast asleep
in his cage by now.

137
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,420
You hear me, warden?!

138
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,500
I have the right
to remain silent!

139
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,195
Anything I say can and
will be held against me

140
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,770
in a court of law!

141
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,897
And I have the right
to an attorney, too, pal!

142
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,407
And if I can't afford one,
one must be provided for me

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,842
by the court!

144
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,776
Never mind!

145
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,042
I just broke out.

146
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,707
He likes a belly rub
twice a day.

147
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,217
And, oh, if you
could give him

148
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,014
a pan of lasagna
between each meal,

149
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,918
that would be great.

150
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,388
Oh, almost forgot Pooky.

151
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,458
Can't be
without Pooky.

152
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,573
Oh, great.Just when
things were looking up.

153
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,642
Look, why don't
you stay here

154
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,607
and get your
fleas removed,

155
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,268
maybe get a brain transplant?

156
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,873
Okay, go away. Beat it.

157
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,039
Hide beneath the wheels.

158
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,980
Agh! You're
ripping my fur!

159
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,779
Aah! Get off. Get off.
Get off. Get off.

160
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,285
Get in here!
Get in! Get in!

161
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,685
Okay, so you have
my cell phone

162
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,086
and you have
the hotel number.

163
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,317
- Don't worry, I do. Bye now.
- Okay.

164
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,759
Airport, and step on it.

165
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,491
Jon won't mind if I repack him.

166
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,499
We're gonna need
some room in this bag.

167
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,004
Aah! You savage beast,
how dare you!

168
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,506
Get out of here!
Smithee!

169
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,509
There's something
in the pool! Smithee!

170
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,176
There's a duck in my pool,
Smithee.

171
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,444
A duck!

172
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,315
A duck, sir?

173
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,821
Filthy wild animal
soaking itself in my pool.

174
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,391
What do you intend
doing about this?

175
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,655
I shall speak
to the duck, sir?

176
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,456
Mmm.

177
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,289
Oh, by the way,
the solicitors are here

178
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,832
for the reading
of Lady Eleanor's will.

179
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,368
Excellent.

180
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,529
In a few moments,
I'll be the master

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,402
of this entire estate.

182
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,633
And from this day on,

183
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,404
things will be done my way.

184
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,089
This is the last will and testament

185
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,890
of Lady Eleanor Carlyle
of Carlyle Castle.

186
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,830
"I declare this to be my last
will and testament,

187
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,901
which I make,
this first day of September"...

188
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,563
Keep still.
They're reading Lady Eleanor's will.

189
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,107
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

190
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,266
I can't watch.

191
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,934
If Lord Dargis gets the estate,
we're done for.

192
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,012
We're doomed!

193
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:20,771
Shh! Quiet.

194
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,041
"To my devoted Smithee,

195
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,049
"I make thee caretaker
of my estate.

196
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,244
"Care for my beloved
animal friends

197
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,786
"as you have in the past

198
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,948
and you will always have
a home at Carlyle Castle."

199
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,118
Thank you, Madame.

200
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,354
She's dead, Smithee.
You can stop sucking up.

201
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,296
"The rest of my
worldly possessions,

202
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,026
"my castle
and surrounding grounds,

203
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,761
I leave to the love of my life,

204
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,862
somebody who was like
a son to me..."

205
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,204
Thank you, Aunt Eleanor.
Oh, thank you.

206
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,437
Please let me finish,
Mr. Dargis.

207
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,777
I'm sorry. I always get
a little ahead of myself.

208
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,510
"I leave all my worldly possessions
to my beloved kitty,

209
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,710
Prince the 12th."

210
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,720
- That's incredible.
- Oh, my word.

211
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,720
Entirely without
precedent.

212
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,881
This is what it says.

213
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,185
But I'm her nephew,
her only heir.

214
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,591
She can't have left it all
to a cat.

215
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,722
I, Prince,
the new lord of the castle?

216
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,825
Good show, Lady Eleanor.

217
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,665
Oh, bless her heart.

218
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,399
Can it be?
We are delivered.

219
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,236
Thank you, Winston.

220
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,072
The will clearly states
that you may stay on

221
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,476
at Carlyle Castle and
receive your usual stipend

222
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,243
of, uh...
50 pounds a week.

223
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,786
- Fifty pounds?!
- Upon Prince's passing,

224
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,788
after what we assume will
be a long and happy life,

225
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,289
you will receive
the castle, the land

226
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,154
and your title.

227
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,128
But that fat ball of fur
could last for another 15 years!

228
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,166
Let us hope so.

229
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,238
The castle was built
over 600 years ago

230
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,068
by Lord Franklin Carlyle.

231
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,041
Now, the initial structure
is late medieval in style...

232
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,806
In the west wing, we'll put the pool and spa.

233
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,404
Yes, and where would
the squash courts be?

234
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,108
Oh, there he is!

235
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,082
- That's unbelievable.
- Oh, hello.

236
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,883
Snap your photos. Unfortunately,
I can but spare a few moments...

237
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,514
Hey, buddy, do you
mind stepping aside?

238
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,024
I can't get a good
shot of the cat.

239
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,926
Greetings, all.
Hello.

240
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,497
So glad.
So very, very glad.

241
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,465
May I remind you
this is private property?

242
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,331
Oh, relax, bro, it's not
like you own the place.

243
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,166
We shall see.

244
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,401
To all the royal
subjects,

245
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,002
I give you the new possessor
of Carlyle Castle:

246
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,412
Prince the 12th!

247
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,813
To one and all,

248
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,981
I pledge, from this day forward,

249
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,651
to rule my kingdom
with wisdom and valor.

250
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,888
And as long as I reign,

251
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,362
you shall continue
to have safe haven

252
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,593
here on the bountiful grounds
of Carlyle.

253
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,761
Thank you. That is all.

254
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,930
Hip-hip hooray!

255
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,871
Long live Prince!

256
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,875
I think that went
frightfully well.

257
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,444
Don't you, Winny?

258
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,240
Sire, I hasten to remind you

259
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,815
that Lord Dargis has every
reason to get rid of you.

260
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,077
Oh, Winny, pooh-pooh.

261
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,245
I'm his favorite kitty-cat.

262
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,633
Hello, little Prince.

263
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,760
What a beautiful day
for a picnic, of course.

264
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,769
Oh, no, thanks, old boy.

265
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,305
You just run along
and enjoy yourself.

266
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,772
Hey! What the devil...?!

267
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,367
So it's hide-and-seek
you want to play.

268
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,343
All right,
I'll count to 100.

269
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,244
Hello, Rommel.

270
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,943
...three, four, five...

271
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:51,114
...35, 36, 37, 38...

272
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,024
...96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

273
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,117
All right, fair warning.

274
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,460
Ready or not, here I come...

275
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,802
Bon voyage, Prince.

276
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,472
Oh, dear me.

277
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,478
I may have misjudged
the old boy.

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,673
Perhaps he is somewhat
of a scoundrel.

279
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,081
After all, this is not the way
one plays hide-and-seek.

280
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,655
Oh, blimey.

281
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,650
Will that
be all, sir?

282
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,853
Oh, yes, thank you.

283
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,760
Uh... thank you.

284
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,728
Thank you, sir.

285
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,959
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, um...

286
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,626
how do I look?

287
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,499
Lovely, sir?

288
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,504
No, see, I'm proposing
to my girlfriend.

289
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,631
She's staying
just down the hall.

290
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,869
I want to make sure I look...

291
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,377
Well, let's see now.

292
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,313
It needs a certain...

293
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,973
Ah!

294
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,018
May I, sir?

295
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,088
There we are.

296
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,680
- Hugh Grant.
- Great.

297
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,988
Uh, oh, could you deliver this
to the girl in room 407?

298
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,528
Of course, sir.

299
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,655
Oh, and, uh...

300
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,631
and this.

301
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,896
Cary Grant, sir.

302
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,870
Jon?

303
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,312
Hey!

304
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,610
But, what are you doing here?

305
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,708
Well, it's just Fashion Week.
Where else would I be?

306
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,717
This is incredible.

307
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,344
I cannot believe
that you're here.

308
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,353
So you're glad?

309
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,356
Glad? I'm thrilled.

310
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,221
But London?

311
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,955
I mean, did you come all
the way here just for me?

312
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,223
Yeah, it's nuts.

313
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,628
In fact, I, uh...

314
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,828
I want us to be together, uh...

315
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,372
Odie!

316
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,443
Come here!

317
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,704
Oh, yeah.

318
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,248
Air... water... lasagna.

319
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,281
Garfield?

320
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,010
That's the hello I get?

321
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,882
13 hours in a bag
with a farting dog?

322
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,616
Ooh, you know, they have
quarantine laws here.

323
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,589
Don't let Odie
out of your sight.

324
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,590
They might deport him.

325
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,024
Deport Odie?

326
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,153
Oh, I like this country already.

327
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,196
Oops!

328
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,797
Okay, I'm gonna need
a litter box,

329
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,928
a room service menu
and the TV remote,

330
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,164
and in that order.

331
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,672
Anyone needs me,

332
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,401
I'll be in my office.

333
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,805
Where are my clothes?

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,508
Cool.

335
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,244
My very own cat tub.

336
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,226
Gol-lee!

337
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,726
Got it.

338
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,356
Could have just come down
and told me that, couldn't he?

339
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,560
All right. Listen up! Listen up!
Farmyard news flash!

340
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,364
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

341
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,836
Which would you
like to hear first?

342
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,372
The bad news.

343
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,602
Lord Dargis just threw
Prince in the river.

344
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,470
Okay, give me the good news.

345
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,049
He was
in a lovely picnic basket.

346
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,681
If he throws us in the river,
we'll never survive.

347
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,620
- You're ducks; you can swim.
- Oh.

348
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,157
Winston, I'm next in line
for the throne.

349
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,351
Uh-oh. This could get ugly.

350
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,018
I have here a list of new rules
of governance.

351
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,563
Preston, I hardly think that's necessary...

352
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,064
Rule Number One:
The barnyard animals congregate

353
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,294
entirely too close
to the castle.

354
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,734
We house pets need our space.

355
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,931
Oh, you've got enough space,
laddie,

356
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,405
right between your ears.

357
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,067
You take that back!

358
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,508
I command you, as your new king.

359
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,102
Look, there's still a chance

360
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,147
Prince may find
his way back here.

361
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,049
In the meantime, Claudius,
you get into the castle

362
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,814
and find out
what Dargis is up to.

363
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,583
I'm on it.
I'm your mouse on the inside.

364
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,181
I'll see
what I can learn from my end.

365
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,524
I want to do something
more cultural.

366
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,724
Okay, all right...

367
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,528
You're cold.

368
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,669
Getting colder.

369
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,930
You're an icicle.

370
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,062
You're frozen stiff.

371
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,437
Let's remind ourselves
what we're looking for.

372
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,203
It's a hamburger.

373
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,575
A squeaky hamburger.

374
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,238
We take a walk
through Hyde Park...

375
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,374
Excuse me? We "walk"?!

376
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,452
Then we stroll down

377
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,952
the incredibly cultural
Piccadilly.

378
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,382
"Stroll"?

379
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,457
And then, boom--
Carnaby Street.

380
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,684
Aren't we about 40 years

381
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,089
too late for Carnaby Street?

382
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,126
No, luv.

383
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,354
That's where
all the swingin' birds are.

384
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,362
Oh. Well, then we
are definitely

385
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,091
going to the British
Museum.

386
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,027
Any cuter, I'm gonna need
a barf bag.

387
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

388
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,573
I'm security, pal.

389
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,372
Just protecting you
from yourself.

390
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,309
Garfield, you have caused
enough trouble today.

391
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,881
Now you have food,
water and company.

392
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,609
Which one is he?

393
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,776
- Be good.
-Jon, you're delirious.

394
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,820
Be careful!
She's a man-eater!

395
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,082
Oh, no. He's under her spell.

396
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,221
Okay, Odie,
I'll give you one small clue.

397
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,059
It's not in there!

398
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,859
Prince!

399
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,962
Where is that cat?

400
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,302
Prince!

401
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,941
Prince!

402
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,316
Prince!

403
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,616
Prince!

404
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,319
Prince!

405
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,088
Pull!

406
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,435
Sir, have you,
by any chance, seen Prince?

407
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,266
I can't seem to
find him anywhere.

408
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,466
Oh... dear!

409
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,136
You mean our little orange
bundle of fun is missing?

410
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,504
Pull!

411
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,615
Crikey!

412
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,118
The man's got a cannon!

413
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,785
And he's pointing it at us!

414
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,482
We're sitting ducks!

415
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,456
Careful, sir.

416
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,457
You wouldn't
want to injure

417
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,857
the creatures,
would you?

418
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,123
Run away!

419
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,163
Of course not.

420
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,823
That would make me
some kind of monster,

421
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,865
wouldn't it?

422
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,866
By the way, Smithee,

423
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,867
I've a little errand
for you.

424
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,902
Could you go to London

425
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,835
and pick up my new suits
at Willoughby's?

426
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,066
Oh, very good, sir.

427
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,378
Pull!

428
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,083
Can you imagine

429
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,713
taking a nap on that table?

430
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,988
Just lie there
for hours and shed.

431
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,063
In other news today, the
queen's corgis, Milly and Tillie,

432
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,893
returned from their world
cruise with the queen,

433
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,523
aboard Her Majesty's yacht.

434
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,726
The animals are said
to have suffered

435
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,429
a mild seasickness,
but now are back to eating

436
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,402
the finest calf's liver.

437
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,437
Oh, boy.

438
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,167
Must be sweet.

439
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,835
"My tummy's upset.
May I have some liver?"

440
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,605
Boy, I wish Jon was a queen.

441
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,203
Housekeeping.

442
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,145
Okay, blockhead, time
to bust out of here

443
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,147
and catch up with Jon.

444
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,148
First, let's
grab some chow,

445
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,048
before I eat your liver

446
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,122
with some fava beans
and a nice Chianti.

447
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,551
Sorry, we left
a bit of a mess

448
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,130
in the bathroom.
Thanks.

449
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,399
All right,
keep your eyes peeled

450
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,867
for a goofy-looking
guy with a map.

451
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,834
They're not up here.

452
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,906
I'm coming down!

453
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,975
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

454
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,236
Hee-yah!

455
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,608
Jon? Jon? Jon?

456
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,614
Where's Waldo?

457
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,617
Take the picture.
Take the picture.

458
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,812
Take it! Take it!
Take the picture!

459
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,888
Halt!

460
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,258
Right face!

461
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,296
Excuse me.

462
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,297
Did you see
a couple of people

463
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,424
who look like
they might be tourists?

464
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,229
Oh, I know this drill.

465
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,237
They won't crack up,
no matter what you do.

466
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,671
Hey, Freeze-Frame,
your knee's on fire.

467
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,175
Hmm. I know
I can get this guy.

468
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,336
No, seriously,
your zipper's down.

469
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,641
Hey, Dry Goods.

470
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,807
Yeah.

471
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,077
Anybody ever tell you
you look like Tina Turner?

472
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,246
That was effective.

473
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,220
Her Majesty, the Queen of England!

474
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,985
What's all the hubbub?

475
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,958
Attention!

476
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,359
Hey, Odie, look,
it's those royal corgis.

477
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,133
Hey, lady,
you got any leftover liver?

478
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,204
Stuck-up little punk.

479
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,636
Oh, I know she heard us.

480
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,968
They had the top down.

481
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,632
Odie? Odie?

482
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,643
D'uh-oh! Odie, no!

483
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,610
Don't do the
ugly-American thing!

484
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,012
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

485
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,484
Well, you made him
crack anyway.

486
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,953
Ew, disgusting!

487
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,616
It's so smelly down here.
I must get out.

488
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,125
Hello? Someone help a chap?

489
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,330
I'm in the sewer.

490
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,297
This is hopeless.

491
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,799
We'll never find Jon.

492
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,300
Face it, Odie:
nobody cares

493
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,961
whether we live or...

494
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,077
Prince, I've found you.

495
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,409
Oh, dear.

496
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,950
Why is it the weird ones
always go for the cat

497
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,019
and not the dog?

498
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,848
Odie, help, please.

499
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,752
Is that a cologne

500
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,721
or a disinfectant, sir?

501
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,848
I just got you

502
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,189
a special treat:
minced pie.

503
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,693
Odie, call a cop.

504
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,196
I mean, bobby or jimmy.

505
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,697
Never mind, Odie.
Don't bother.

506
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,199
There's a pie here.

507
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,201
I'll be just fine.

508
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,191
Dear heavens!

509
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,358
That was absolutely
the most horrifying...

510
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,096
But I'm alive.
I'm alive!

511
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,833
And... covered in filth.

512
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,908
Here, here.

513
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,135
I must return to my throne.

514
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,940
What, ho?

515
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,912
Oh, indeed.

516
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,416
Seeing me in this state
must be shocking.

517
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,486
I've lost my bearings.

518
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,079
You must lead me with all due
haste to the castle at Carlyle.

519
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,091
But first, I require a bath.

520
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,626
Here, come on.

521
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,559
Do you expect me to lick myself?

522
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,722
Garfield?!

523
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,265
Odie? Wh... What
are you doing here?

524
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,961
Garfield?
What the devil is a Garfield?

525
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,436
What am I going to
do with you guys?

526
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,767
Do you know how
bad I would feel

527
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,705
if I lost you here?

528
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,242
From now on,

529
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,336
I'm not letting you
out of my sight, okay?

530
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,277
Oh, dear heaven.

531
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,746
Why is it
the weird ones

532
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,340
always go for the cat
and not the dog?

533
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,249
Oh! Bath time
for you, buddy.

534
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,754
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all day.

535
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,756
The dog's not
very bright, is he?

536
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,756
Where are you taking me?

537
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,757
Is it somewhere lovely?

538
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,191
Somewhere special?

539
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,904
Mmm!

540
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:47,972
Ah!

541
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,803
Hey, Mario Andretti.

542
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,900
You're drivin'
on the wrong side of the road,

543
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,502
and I've got an entire pie
in my stomach.

544
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,377
Don't worry, Prince.

545
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,349
You'll feel better when
we get back to Carlyle.

546
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,645
Oh, excuse me.

547
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,722
Yes, hello.
Hobbs here.

548
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,122
Ah, Hobbs,
this is Manfred Dargis here.

549
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,059
A terrible thing
has happened.

550
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,993
Prince is missing.

551
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,087
We've searched everywhere.

552
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,223
Prince is missing?

553
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,960
Missing?!
- This is a rather sudden

554
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,501
development,

555
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,504
- don't you think?
- Well, actually, it's quite common.

556
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,938
In the absence, or in this
case, the death of an owner,

557
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,031
it can be quite

558
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,340
confusing and disorienting
to a cat-- I mean,

559
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,847
let's face it, they have brains
the size of a gum ball.

560
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,383
All the same,

561
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,851
this seems
rather fishy to me.

562
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,548
I don't particularly care
what it seems to you.

563
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,217
Legally,
since he is gone,

564
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,317
the title of the Carlyle estate
falls to me.

565
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,828
Am I not correct?

566
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,000
Uh, yes, very well.

567
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,692
Good-bye.

568
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,734
He's up to something.

569
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,864
He's got some plan
for the estate,

570
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,034
and I want to find out what.

571
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,714
Ah, Miss Abby
Westminster, I presume.

572
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,546
Lord Dargis, an absolute pleasure.

573
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,779
Hello.

574
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,719
I'm so pleased you've shown

575
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,053
such an interest in
our little enterprise.

576
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,458
Well, my investors
are very interested.

577
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,154
Cheers, dear.

578
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,198
To a long-lasting
business relationship.

579
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,894
To Carlyle
Resort and Spa.

580
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:31,666
Allow me to introduce
you to my dream.

581
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,967
What's this?

582
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,274
State-of-the-art spa,

583
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,713
meditation garden
and, of course,

584
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,148
luxury condominium.

585
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,553
But what of the woodland
and barnyard areas?

586
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,955
Allow me.

587
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,651
If you would...

588
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,956
Oh. Very clever.

589
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,998
No woodland,

590
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,158
no barnyard area.

591
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,757
Whoosh-- gone!

592
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,133
So what will you do
with all the animals?

593
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,798
Let's just say

594
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,774
those we don't chase off,
we will serve up

595
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,401
to the guests.

596
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,817
I must alert the others
at once.

597
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,686
Bus driver, pull it over.

598
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,264
I got a pie belch coming
that might break your windows.

599
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,268
Ah.

600
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,968
Come on, Prince.

601
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,111
Yeah, yeah,
I used to be known as Prince.

602
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,118
Now you can just call me
Ga...

603
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,519
...arfield.

604
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,784
Wow.

605
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,690
Get a load of this dump.

606
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,462
Thanks.

607
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,693
No pet door, huh?

608
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,498
Holy cow, I can
hear my footsteps.

609
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,231
Mom?! Dad?!

610
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,137
I'm home!

611
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,402
Your Highness.

612
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,977
You talking to me, froggy?

613
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,477
It's me,
your trusty servant,

614
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,911
- Winston.
- Hey.

615
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,176
Warning:
I don't fight fair.

616
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,149
I scratch, and I bite.

617
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,310
It's all right, sire.

618
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,409
All is well now.

619
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,385
You're home.

620
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,581
Home?

621
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,714
What, retirement home?
Happy home?

622
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,757
Where, uh,
what is this?

623
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,190
Is this an insane asylum?

624
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,352
Am I being kidnapped?

625
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,792
Very funny, sire.

626
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,761
Your loyal subjects
await you.

627
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,925
They need to be comforted
by your words.

628
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,002
Hey, trust me,

629
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,592
windbag, there's no way

630
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,672
I'm going to give a speech
to a bunch of strangers.

631
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,070
And then, of course,
following your words,

632
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,232
a royal feast.

633
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,606
I think I'm just going to do
a tight two minutes.

634
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,111
See if that
will calm them down, okay?

635
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,545
Oyez!

636
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,445
Oyez!

637
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,075
Prince the 12th
has returned.

638
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,183
Thank you, windbag,

639
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,416
for that slobbering
introduction.

640
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,425
Hello, everybody!

641
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,756
Hey.

642
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,421
- Listen up.
- Ooh.

643
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,522
Is this an audience
or a landscape?

644
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,828
Okay. Great to
be back here

645
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,334
at the palace.

646
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,927
I look out and I see

647
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,233
a sea of dumb
barnyard animals.

648
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,037
I'm here in your country
to break up a romance

649
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,078
between, uh, you know,
the guy who owns the house

650
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,614
I live in and a girl who
is way out of his league.

651
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,240
I know that whatever it is

652
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,818
that you have,
there is some sort of affliction

653
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,979
that produces this glazed look
behind your eyes,

654
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,080
I hope you defeat it.

655
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,385
I wish I could take every one
of you home with me.

656
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,119
Thank you.

657
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,353
I killed.

658
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,930
Very funny, sire. Well done.

659
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,829
I didn't realize
it was amateur hour.

660
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,162
What's up with Prince?

661
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,294
Oh, he's on the catnip again.

662
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,599
Hold on, chaps!
Have I got news for you!

663
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,173
What's the word, Claudius?

664
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,266
Dargis is going to bulldoze
the barnyard

665
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,776
and feed us to the tourists.

666
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,140
Let him try.
He'll have to deal

667
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,804
with these fists of fury,
won't he, eh?

668
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,439
Well, that's dreadful.

669
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,642
Calm yourselves, everybody.

670
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,119
We're all right
as long as Prince is alive.

671
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,749
Well, obviously that feline is
not Prince, you idiots.

672
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,692
He's not even the cat
formerly known as Prince.

673
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,195
He's right, you know.

674
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,630
Wait, he doesn't have to be
Prince.

675
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,792
He just has to
look like him.

676
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,836
If he fooled me,
he'll fool them.

677
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,704
But what's to stop Dargis from
getting rid of this cat, too?

678
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,070
McBunny is right.

679
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,077
We must protect this cat
at all costs.

680
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,806
Our fates rely on it.

681
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,041
Mr. and Mrs. Jon Arbuckle.

682
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,551
Liz Arbuckle.

683
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,177
Elizabeth Arbuckle.
Yeah.

684
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,813
Listen, you dolt.
There's been a coup d'etat.

685
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,516
Attempted murder most foul.

686
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,117
I am Prince the 12th
of Carlyle.

687
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,356
You there, with the wise
and thoughtful look.

688
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,899
Hello.

689
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,195
Convince this man
there's been a mix-up.

690
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,634
Garfield, I want you to be in my wedding party.

691
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,638
Wedding party?!

692
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,640
Think you can hold a basket
of flowers in your mouth?

693
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,733
Enough with the grooming, you dunce.

694
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,278
My subjects face
mortal jeopardy.

695
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,813
Dog, approach.

696
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,752
We must plan my escape,

697
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,048
and I'm relying on your
expedience and cunning.

698
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,188
Okeydokey.

699
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,419
New plan.

700
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,524
Call my pumpkin, windbag.

701
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,892
I'm ready to roll.

702
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,489
Roll? Where to?

703
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,431
You know,
to the hotel, toJon.

704
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,936
Your master, the one who's
leaving you for his new wife?

705
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,233
He's not leaving me.

706
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,036
It's more of a...
temporary insanity thing.

707
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,839
Garfield, your master's
started a new life.

708
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,937
It's time
for you to begin yours.

709
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,414
Come on, I want to show
you something.

710
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,077
Do have any idea what runs
through your veins?

711
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,017
Yesterday's dinner,
I guess.

712
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,316
Royal blood, sire.

713
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,790
You are the long-lost heir
to the Carlyle throne.

714
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,389
You kill me.

715
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,466
These are your ancestors,
dating back 400 years.

716
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,091
Mine?

717
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,295
Wow.

718
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,066
Like, I'm a royal cat?

719
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,640
Well, of course.

720
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,608
And anything you need is
only a flick of your tail away.

721
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,769
A flick of my tail, huh?

722
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,574
So, if I said, drool
on your foot...?

723
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,545
Not bad.

724
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,015
How about roll over
and whistle "Dixie"?

725
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,416
How's that?

726
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,511
Nice. All right.

727
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,454
Tough one:jump up
and touch the ceiling.

728
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,752
How's that, sire?

729
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,258
You don't get up
there too high

730
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,328
there, do you, fella?

731
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:30,561
I give you your royal
bedchamber.

732
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,001
I could do some snoozing here, yeah.

733
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,164
Even a king needs a catnap.

734
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,172
Get up!

735
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,334
Get down.

736
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,139
Get up!
This baby is spring-loaded.

737
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,476
Why do you think
they call me...

738
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,812
Highness...?

739
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,351
Are you all right? Sire?!

740
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,854
The royal trapeze?

741
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,118
That is how you ring, sire.

742
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,319
You pull it
whenever you require something.

743
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,158
- And what is that?
- Your playhouse.

744
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,459
Oh, I needed a playhouse.

745
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,832
I've got a house
inside of a house.

746
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,498
Does this castle make
my butt look a little too big?

747
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,539
Fits you like a glove.

748
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,171
- Ooh! Blimey.
- Pardon.

749
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,145
Well struck, sire.
Good tone, smooth finish.

750
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,546
Well, you took that
in the best spirit, didn't you?

751
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,311
Shall we have a look
in the kitchen?

752
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:25,219
Did I hear you say...
the kitchen?

753
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,233
Here we are.
I present your cookery.

754
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,734
All mine?

755
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,030
Every morsel,

756
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,972
down to the last crumb.

757
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,235
Okay. All right.

758
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,573
You can just call me...
Your Highness.

759
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,235
Yeah, you can just drop
that anywhere.

760
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,572
All right, I'll give it to you straight:

761
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,650
it's disappointing.

762
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,808
Your doughnuts are dry

763
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,317
and don't have
holes in them,

764
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,388
and your coffee's so weak,
it looks like tea.

765
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,286
I don't suppose,
Miss Westminster,

766
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,120
you could find time
in your busy life

767
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,626
for a wealthy duke.

768
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,788
Lord Dargis,
I'm afraid I'm taken.

769
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,493
As I am myself...
by you.

770
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,831
Oh, don't mind me.

771
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,168
I'm just an
incorrigible old...

772
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,673
- Cat!
- What?

773
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,140
Nothing, nothing.

774
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,506
Nothing at all,
nothing at all.

775
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,840
Gosh, is that
the time already?

776
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,345
Time, I've
always said,

777
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,915
flies like an arrow.

778
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,348
Don't be afraid
to just show up

779
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,352
and bring some
of those investors--

780
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,853
those lovely investors.

781
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,013
We'll throw a party.

782
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,091
Cheerio!

783
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:49,461
Ah... Smithee, d-did
I see Prince in here?

784
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,591
Isn't it remarkable?

785
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,896
I found him wandering
the streets of London

786
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,266
as I left Willoughby's.

787
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,135
Indeed.

788
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,730
Extraordinary.

789
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,207
And where is

790
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,368
the little fiend...

791
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,241
fellow at the moment?

792
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,904
Oh, I'm sure
I don't know, sir.

793
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,950
Well, I'll maybe take
a little look-see, hmm?

794
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,780
Make him welcome.

795
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,648
Yes, sir.

796
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,119
Look at this room,
for example.

797
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,787
Uh... how would you
liven this place up?

798
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,386
But, sire, this castle

799
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,829
is centuries old.

800
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:22,830
It's a museum.

801
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,127
It's boring.

802
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,329
And you know what's missing
when your crib is a museum?

803
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,530
It's called fun!

804
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,334
Fun?

805
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,339
It's not that hard.

806
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,340
You got to get
a running start

807
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,341
at something
this dull.

808
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,877
Who-o-o-o-o-o-a!

809
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,539
This is gonna end so badly.

810
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,549
Oops.

811
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,652
It was already cracked.

812
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,187
Nothing escapes you,

813
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,916
does it, sire?

814
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,184
Yeah. I like
the way this feels.

815
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,691
You just slide, baby!

816
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,523
Whoa...!

817
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,721
D'uh-oh!

818
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,888
Don't worry about it.

819
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,329
That one was cracked as well.

820
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,957
Oh, I can relax.

821
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,000
Oops!

822
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,238
What the...? Ooh! Oof.

823
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,209
Smithee!

824
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,336
Get this thing off of me!

825
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,005
All right, let's go try
another room.

826
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,083
Good idea, sire.

827
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,913
Yes, yes.

828
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,509
I've got the deed and
the paperwork in order,

829
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,712
and I've contacted
the other solicitors.

830
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,790
We'll be out there on Monday.

831
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,822
Monday?

832
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,052
But... but I need more time.

833
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,127
More time?

834
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:25,787
More time for what?

835
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,731
Oh... n-n-nothing. Nothing.

836
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,359
That'll-that'll be fine.

837
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,869
Oh, very well,
we'll be there Monday,

838
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,439
unless, by some miracle,
Prince returns.

839
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,735
We can only hope, Mr. Hobbs.

840
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,081
What's the news?

841
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,421
Dargis is sure to make a move
on the cat.

842
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,222
The solicitors
will be here Monday.

843
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,921
Right. Good work.

844
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,264
Careful.

845
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,859
That's high-grade
American cardboard

846
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,438
you're tossing
around there.

847
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,767
Beautiful, fellas.

848
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:10,772
Hang the plasma

849
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,604
right over the
Slip 'N Slide.

850
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,768
Sire, a word.

851
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,778
Jowls, my man.

852
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,780
Guess what your
enlightened,

853
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,849
all-powerful ruler

854
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,644
has brought
to the castle?

855
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,912
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

856
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,952
Don't tell me.

857
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,419
A Renaissance painting.

858
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,423
Foosball, you know?
Foosball!

859
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,856
F-F-F-Foosball?

860
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,790
What does he think this is,
a pub?

861
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,988
Just because we don't
have opposable thumbs

862
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,327
doesn't mean we
don't play bar games.

863
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,493
Yes, sire, but I feel
your life is in danger.

864
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,661
Listen, Winnebago--
if I may call you that--

865
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,033
when history
speaks of me,

866
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,334
and she will, I want
to be remembered

867
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,967
as the "Party Prince."

868
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,339
As you wish.

869
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,209
You chaps know me--
I'm no snob.

870
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,340
Right? But this cat is too much.

871
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,112
He's an embarrassment to our whole way of life.

872
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,517
Oh, he's a disgrace
to the furry race.

873
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,111
"My pillow isn't soft enough.

874
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,554
My TV remote won't work."

875
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,285
Don't get your knickers
in a twist.

876
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,951
I know he's a pain in the neck,

877
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,894
but we just got to keep him
safe till Monday.

878
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,699
Yeah. My loyal

879
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,665
and fragrant subjects, please.

880
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,396
Thank you.

881
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,028
Briefly, I
hate Mondays.

882
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,106
Just hate 'em.

883
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,505
Therefore, I decree,
from this day forward,

884
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,543
there will be no more Mondays.

885
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,576
- What?
- What?

886
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,010
Got it? Today is Tuesday, then.

887
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,580
Happy Tuesday, everybody.

888
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,711
Yeah, I think he's lost it.

889
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,978
Like I said,

890
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,486
we just got to keep him safe
till Tuesday.

891
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,725
Hello, Rommel.

892
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,385
Ah-ha-ha!

893
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,862
I have a present for you.

894
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,830
Prince's favorite pillow.

895
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,202
Sniffy, sniffy, Rommel.
Sniffy, sniffy.

896
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:50,171
Ooh, bad pillow. Ooh!

897
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,038
Kill kitty.
Kill kitty.

898
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,112
Oh, what a clever boy.

899
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,373
Eat the cat.

900
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,108
Yum, yum, yum.

901
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,921
I think you're ready.

902
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,387
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

903
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,048
Eat the pussycat.
There's a good chap.

904
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,490
Operation Feline Protection
under way.

905
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,686
I'm on it. Hoo-hoo!

906
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,770
Yeah, yeah.

907
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,140
Oops.

908
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,237
Bon apptit.

909
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,279
Here, kitty, kitty.

910
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,716
Come to Rommel.

911
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,050
Where are you,
my little furry friend?

912
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,556
Hello, Rommel.

913
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,921
Eat kitty.

914
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,551
No, no kitty, Rommel.

915
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,153
But we have something
better to chew on.

916
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,458
No kitty?

917
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,295
That's right: no kitty.

918
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,268
Bring Lord Dargis's
new trousers, please.

919
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,304
Pig, the trousers!

920
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,479
Uh, trousers.

921
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,878
Thank you, Sam.

922
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,008
And now, Rommel,
how about

923
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,642
a nice tug of war?

924
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,118
Yeah.

925
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,888
Ooh! Lord Dargis
better watch out

926
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,430
next time
Rommel's on the loose.

927
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,067
Hello, Smithee.

928
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,437
You're in good spirits today,
sir.

929
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,272
Yes. For some reason I feel
a great burden has been lifted.

930
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,175
A burden, sir?

931
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,305
What do you make of
my new suit, Smithee?

932
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,882
Hmm?

933
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,349
Oh, very smart, sir.

934
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,944
Oh, Smithee, I've invited Miss
Westminster for tea on Monday,

935
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,456
and it's extremely important
she feel welcome.

936
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,460
Why don't you bring up a bottle
of the very best champagne?

937
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,325
And set out
the Prince Royal china,

938
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,488
silver service.

939
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,395
You know the type of thing.

940
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,297
Very good, sir.

941
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,233
Uh, trousers.

942
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,736
Yes, I'd like to speak

943
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,713
to Miss Westminster, please.

944
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,080
Hello, Rommel.

945
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,846
Did we enjoy

946
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,854
our little snack, then, hmm?

947
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,389
Trousers.

948
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,425
Ah, Miss Westminster...

949
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,426
Trousers!

950
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,894
Care to pop over
and have a little...

951
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,266
Oggy! Oggy! Oggy!

952
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,666
Oi! Oi! Oi!

953
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:34,669
Oggy! Oggy! Oggy!

954
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:35,932
Oi! Oi! Oi!

955
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,207
Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah.

956
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,675
Who ordered the pasta?

957
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,077
- Oh, it's for the kitty.
- Oh, good Lord.

958
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,876
What gruel is this?

959
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:47,882
Quite right, old boy.

960
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,850
They must have given me yours.

961
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,513
Garfield, since when
do you say no to lasagna?

962
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,354
You do realize I'm a cat,
don't you, sir?

963
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,394
You know, he doesn't
seem like himself.

964
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,190
He's probably
just a little jet-lagged.

965
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,197
I suppose I should probably
force down a bite or two

966
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,791
to keep up my strength.

967
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,337
Oh. It does have
a unique texture.

968
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,633
So, Liz, I don't know
if you've noticed,

969
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,832
but I've been
kind of anxious to, um...

970
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,936
Why am I clapping?

971
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,378
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

972
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,039
Oh, spot on.

973
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,118
Never have I tasted its equal!

974
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,208
Oh!

975
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,989
Oh, Garfield,
that's gross!

976
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:33,223
Please, sir,
may I have some more?

977
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,469
Oh! Does a Great Dane live here?

978
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,012
It's a Carlyle log, my lord:

979
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,173
a savory of liver and spleen

980
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,182
served in a sleeve
of sheep's intestines.

981
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,718
And you're supposed to eat it?

982
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,219
What is this, "Fear Factor"?

983
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,483
Intestines? Spleen?

984
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,115
I'm the king, right?

985
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,625
Prince, actually.

986
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,661
Same difference.
I rule, yes?

987
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,321
Yes, Your Highness.

988
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,160
Great. Then feed this
to the humans

989
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:14,636
and just bring me a piping hot
dish of lasagna, okay?

990
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,433
I'll see to it

991
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,475
at once, sire.

992
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:23,342
Now it says
we add the ricotta cheese.

993
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,345
Ducks!

994
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,380
You're supposed
to sift

995
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,712
the flour, not sit in it!

996
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,547
Don't yell at us.

997
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,814
We're not the ones who drank
all the cooking sherry.

998
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,859
Hmm. Carrots make
everything better,

999
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,955
and it can't hurt lasagna.

1000
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,137
What the heck is...?

1001
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,235
That was close.

1002
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,809
Now slip in the eggs,

1003
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,139
ooze in the tomatoes.

1004
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,803
Now stir the
whole thing up

1005
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,609
in a bowl and let the bowl...

1006
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,682
Okay.

1007
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,772
You know what
I'm talking about.

1008
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:01,646
Hold it

1009
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:02,912
right here,

1010
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,884
all you animals.

1011
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,080
What goes on
here, Winston?

1012
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,122
We're preparing

1013
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,987
the royal lasagna, sire.

1014
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,219
Unless you prefer
another dish.

1015
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,226
Did you say "dish"?

1016
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,661
Lasagna's not
a dish, windbag.

1017
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,097
It's a way of life,
a state of being.

1018
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,829
Man's one perfect achievement.

1019
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,666
What did the Indians serve
to the Pilgrims?

1020
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,171
Lasagna.

1021
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,332
What did Marie Antoinette
scream to the rabble?

1022
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,342
"Let them eat lasagna."

1023
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,241
What did Neil Armstrong say

1024
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,574
when he landed
on the moon?

1025
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,912
"That's one small slice
of lasagna."

1026
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,177
It's not a dish.

1027
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,014
It's the stuff of dreams.

1028
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,054
It's the food of the gods.

1029
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,716
It's what's for lunch.

1030
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:45,420
Yeah, well, the problem is,
it seems we've mucked it up.

1031
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,929
You just need a little
guidance, that's all.

1032
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,301
Where's the flour?
Who's got it?

1033
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,736
I need a mixing bowl.

1034
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,967
One large mixing bowl.

1035
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,839
And someone to mix it.

1036
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,343
Thank you.

1037
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,809
Much obliged.

1038
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,586
Sheba, did you remember
to wash your hooves?

1039
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,424
Ladies... thank
you so much.

1040
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,223
Strike. Strike. Strike.

1041
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,059
A little outside.

1042
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,928
Step on it,
will you?

1043
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,296
I need that dough.

1044
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,270
Yeah, we'll need
about a half a pound of this.

1045
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,465
What are barnyard animals

1046
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,734
doing in the kitchen?

1047
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,400
I demand you all leave at once.

1048
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,603
This is completely against
my castle health code.

1049
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,701
Getting hot in here.

1050
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:37,905
Turn on the exhaust fan,
will you, somebody?

1051
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,414
What are you doing?

1052
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,778
Get away from there!

1053
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:43,953
Sorry!

1054
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,919
Proof more accidents happen
in the kitchen

1055
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,752
than any other room
in the house.

1056
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,792
Hey, where did
that big ball of dough go?

1057
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:55,354
All I see are magnificent
ribbons of perfection.

1058
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,933
Yo, it's lasagna,
not shish kebab.

1059
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:58,933
Taste that.

1060
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,594
Is that too
sweet for you?

1061
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:04,533
One time.

1062
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,478
Whoa!

1063
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,983
Here comes the parsley.

1064
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,577
All right, bring it back.

1065
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,054
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Bring it in.

1066
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,886
Bring it back, back, back,
back, back, back, back, back. Good.

1067
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,187
We need somebody
with a hard head.

1068
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,921
Thank you.

1069
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,193
It's out of
our hands now.

1070
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,143
This lasagna's fabulous!

1071
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,576
Oh!

1072
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,307
That's a bit of
all right, that is.

1073
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,144
Those Italians got it right,
didn't they?

1074
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,581
Mmm! Oh!

1075
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,016
Two cheeses.

1076
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,054
That is delicious!

1077
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,747
Yeah, not bad on short notice.

1078
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,586
It's beautiful!

1079
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,989
What'd I tell you?

1080
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,652
If you'd just let me be your
king and lead you, all right?

1081
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,490
Any more?

1082
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:00,995
Oh, one more piece.

1083
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,429
Oh!
- Would anyone mind if I...?

1084
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,658
It's mine!
I would!

1085
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,825
Move!
- Easy, easy!

1086
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,402
- Hold up a moment!
- I said it's mine!

1087
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,765
That piece has
Nigel's name on it.

1088
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:08,997
Uh-oh.

1089
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,339
Please, I command you.

1090
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,468
Leave room for dessert.

1091
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,381
Here it is, one step...

1092
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,075
A half-inch adjustment
from his last shot!

1093
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,243
Oh, nearly!

1094
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,618
Oh, heavens, I fear
there was something urgent

1095
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,691
to which I was supposed
to attend,

1096
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:32,387
and yet I can't for the life of
me begin to recall what it was.

1097
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,259
You really like it?

1098
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,490
I do. It's great.

1099
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,566
Thank you.

1100
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,725
Let me see.

1101
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,863
I got to go.

1102
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:42,961
Are you sure I
can't go with you

1103
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,301
to this castle
tour thing?

1104
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,636
They won't mind.

1105
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,643
It's a Conservancy function
for speakers only.

1106
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,474
I guess the woman
who owned the place

1107
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,672
was a big animal lover.

1108
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,181
You hang with the guys.

1109
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,649
Odie could use a walk,
and Garfield could use...

1110
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,785
...some serious ab work.

1111
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,756
Anyway, I'll be back soon.

1112
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:02,790
Have fun, boys.

1113
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,453
My entire world seems to
revolve

1114
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,429
around napping,
television and lasagna.

1115
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,128
Still, I'm plagued by a vague
notion of a duty unfulfilled.

1116
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,134
Oh, well.

1117
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,797
Back to sleep.

1118
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:18,837
What is it, woof-woof?

1119
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,807
"Castles of England"?

1120
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,843
Good Lord!

1121
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:22,969
There it is!

1122
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,571
Carlyle Castle
on the Upper Thames.

1123
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,411
Oh, brilliant, Odie.

1124
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:31,248
All this time, I took you for...
well, a complete simpleton.

1125
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,454
Now destiny calls.

1126
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,650
To the battlements!

1127
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,623
Sound the horns!

1128
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,956
For king and country!

1129
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,620
Farewell, my loyal squire.

1130
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,129
The legend cont...

1131
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,360
What, ho!

1132
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,371
Garfield?

1133
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:56,304
Okay, sore bottom, a little
disoriented, but undeterred.

1134
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,607
Garfield!

1135
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,443
Now, which way is the river?

1136
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:01,608
I think this way.

1137
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,946
Garfield!

1138
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,953
Sorry,Jon.

1139
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,759
Oh, here it is.

1140
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,298
Now one needs
some kind of conveyance.

1141
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,458
Oh, hello.

1142
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,968
Oh, it's an awfully long way
down, but I must,

1143
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,539
and I shall, and I...

1144
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,468
Ow.

1145
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,925
Well, Miss Westminster,

1146
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,927
I have the papers
all drawn up.

1147
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,053
We need only sign them,

1148
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,688
and it's on to
the ground breaking.

1149
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,129
Oh, that's wonderful.

1150
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,133
I would like to move forward
as soon as possible.

1151
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,099
Just think.

1152
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,137
Bulldozers, paving machines

1153
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:59,470
busily transforming this dump
into beautiful luxury condos.

1154
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,444
You and I striding
through centuries of dust

1155
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,881
like giants surveying
our emerging empire.

1156
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,010
Two proud parents.

1157
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,251
I-I'll just check on Smithee.

1158
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,156
See if tea is ready.

1159
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,850
Filthy monsters!

1160
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,218
Come back here,
you smelly creature!

1161
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,290
Come here!

1162
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,620
Pigs, mark your man!

1163
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,953
Come here,
you smelly individual!

1164
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:56,795
You know what?

1165
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,595
I got two words for that guy.

1166
00:53:58,702 --> 00:53:59,669
"You're fired."

1167
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,636
If only it were
that simple, sire.

1168
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,433
Swine!

1169
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,602
Is there a problem, sir?

1170
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,679
Is there a problem?

1171
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,304
There's a bull drinking
my champagne,

1172
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,382
the pool's full
of wild animals,

1173
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,472
and a pig just
tried to kill me.

1174
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,643
Yes! I would say
there was a problem.

1175
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,015
I'll tend to it, sir.

1176
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,351
You'll tend
to it immediately!

1177
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,981
And we'll have tea indoors.

1178
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,252
Do you think you
could handle that?

1179
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,952
Thank you.
There's a good chap.

1180
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,457
Oh!

1181
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,500
Has there been an accident?

1182
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,127
I'm afraid tea will have to wait
till later, Miss Westminster.

1183
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:35,863
Oh.

1184
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,010
He's about 42
and a half pounds.

1185
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,641
He has orange fur,

1186
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,310
more like a burnt sienna.

1187
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,047
And he answers
to the name Garfield.

1188
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,417
I-E-L-D.

1189
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,047
Okay,

1190
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,060
well, fortunately, Scotland Yard
isn't very busy this week.

1191
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,720
So, uh, we'll put together

1192
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,058
a task force
and our best men

1193
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,632
and, uh, turn all

1194
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,667
our resources and attention

1195
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,566
towards finding your fat cat.

1196
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:08,865
Really?

1197
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,166
No.

1198
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,675
Come on, Odie.

1199
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,421
Now, Rommel,
it's really quite simple.

1200
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,081
Uh...?

1201
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,887
Me... Prince.

1202
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,157
Prince... me.

1203
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,788
Provider of food...

1204
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,332
Food.

1205
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,696
Right, governor.

1206
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,203
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm!

1207
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,500
Yum, yum.

1208
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,176
Kill...

1209
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,608
Kitty!

1210
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:52,910
Attaboy, Rommel! There you go!

1211
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,540
Well done!
That's the spirit!

1212
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,911
Bad boy! Bad boy!
Go on, get along!

1213
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,252
Smithee.

1214
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,417
How are you?

1215
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,756
Do me a favor.
Have that polished.

1216
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,227
There's a good chap.

1217
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,763
So, what's on
your mind, Smithee?

1218
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,095
Uh...
Mr. Hobbs's office called.

1219
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,034
Are the solicitors
convening again, sir?

1220
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,230
It's nothing at all,
Smithee.

1221
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:19,035
Papers to sign.
You know-- boring.

1222
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,871
Incidentally,
when did you

1223
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,002
last have
a holiday, Smithee?

1224
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,308
Holiday, sir?

1225
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,713
I can't remember.

1226
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,045
- Seriously, man?
- Mm.

1227
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,212
What an embarrassing
oversight on my part.

1228
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,122
I insist you have a week's
holiday, starting today.

1229
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,352
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think...

1230
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,826
Oh, Smithee, I won't
hear a word of it.

1231
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,988
I can just see you
cycling in the Dordogne,

1232
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,535
fighting the wild boar
in Tristan da Cunha.

1233
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,662
Farewell, wind to your sails
and bon voyage, Smithee.

1234
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,003
Well, then...

1235
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,100
thank you... sir.

1236
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,417
What am I going to do?

1237
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,250
How am I supposed to find
Garfield?

1238
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,324
London's really... big.

1239
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,588
I don't care about some
alien love baby, okay?

1240
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,360
I'm worried about Garfield.

1241
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,136
Odie, you know what?
You're being a real...

1242
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,298
"Lady Eleanor of Carlyle
has left her entire estate

1243
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,673
to her beloved cat,
Prince the 12th."

1244
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,713
Maybe someone mistook this cat
for Garfield.

1245
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,147
Odie, come on.
Come on, buddy!

1246
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:38,447
The Venetian crystal chandeliers
in this room were commissioned

1247
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,786
by the Third Earl of Carlyle
in the late 18th century.

1248
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,622
Over here, we have several
family portraits painted

1249
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,787
by the Dutch master
Van Dyck.

1250
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,161
These are amongst
the many treasures

1251
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,790
to be found at Carlyle.

1252
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,636
- Oh, hogwash!
- Huh?

1253
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,207
I tell you, this cat is
mocking us at every turn.

1254
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,833
Preston, calm yourself.

1255
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,139
We're only doing what is
best for everybody.

1256
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,680
How much longer must we sustain this charade?

1257
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,876
I can't believe this cat
is so stupid as to think

1258
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,452
he's actually royalty.

1259
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,852
Well, he does, and house cat
or not, we need him.

1260
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,154
Wha...? House cat?

1261
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,659
Just have a little patience.

1262
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,025
Patience? Ha!
Admit it, Winston.

1263
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,089
This buffoon couldn't groom
the paws of a real king.

1264
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:28,261
Buffoon?!

1265
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,865
Golly, this is without a doubt
my all-time crummiest moment.

1266
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,630
Huh?

1267
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,640
Jon.

1268
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,438
Man, I've been such
a stupid, selfish cat.

1269
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,275
I've lost my friend.

1270
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,872
I've got to find him.

1271
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,143
The original medieval kitchen
has stood

1272
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,687
on this site since 1485...

1273
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,849
Yes, yes, it's big.
It's old and it's musty.

1274
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,587
Uh, Lord Dargis, uh,
please meet the tour group

1275
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,492
from the Royal
Animal Conservancy.

1276
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,896
Oh! By all means,
save the little darlings.

1277
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,991
That's my motto.

1278
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,797
Big fan of Free Willy,
Born Free,

1279
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,633
all the Free movies.

1280
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,435
Bravo! Now off you go.

1281
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:13,566
If you come this way,

1282
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,940
we'll visit some of the
underground passages,

1283
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,273
one of which...

1284
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,008
Hello. Welcome to
Carlyle Castle, my dear.

1285
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,243
Thank you.
It's, it's beautiful.

1286
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,286
Well, that makes
two of you.

1287
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,322
Did I mention how much
I abhor fox hunting?

1288
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,823
Unless, of course,
in self-defense.

1289
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,394
- Bye.
- If I may...

1290
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,156
Uh, one question, uh...?

1291
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,457
Liz.

1292
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,625
Ah, the same as our own
dear queen. Cordial?

1293
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,364
- One question, Liz.
- Liz?

1294
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,940
What would you say
if I were to donate

1295
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,134
one of my priceless
oil paintings

1296
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,540
to your conservancy?

1297
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,637
Um... Thank you?

1298
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,682
Mm! But how
would you say it?

1299
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,514
That royal sleaze
is hitting on Liz.

1300
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,315
Perhaps you would consider
dining with me

1301
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,684
at the castle tonight?

1302
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,784
Nobody hits on my best friend's
girlfriend... and succeeds.

1303
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:10,264
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Pinata-Head.

1304
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:12,664
You!

1305
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,398
Me?

1306
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,496
Excuse me for one moment.

1307
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,768
- Sure, but...
- Mi castle es su castle.

1308
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,281
- Aha!
-Not now!

1309
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,545
Your nine lives are up!

1310
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,746
No. No, not now.

1311
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,848
Good Lord,
do these people never sleep?

1312
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,790
Oh, why now?

1313
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,260
Ah, Mr. Hobbs,
punctual as usual.

1314
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,299
Just taking out the rubbish.
Won't be a jiffy.

1315
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,334
Oh, please!

1316
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,994
Okay, you got me.

1317
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,236
Oh, you are so stupid.

1318
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,413
Dungeon.

1319
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,486
I'm just a cat!

1320
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:14,462
Oh... Please! I'm so weak...

1321
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,658
and, and you're so strong,
so powerful.

1322
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,662
You creep!

1323
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:27,504
There's more than one way
to skin a royal cat.

1324
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,770
I'm not a royal cat!

1325
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,072
I'm a self-centered house cat!

1326
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,168
Hey! Wait! Wait!

1327
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,908
What, you think I'm going
to crack in here?

1328
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,280
Uh-uh. No.
This is gonna be a treat.

1329
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,445
I'm finally gonna have
some quality alone time.

1330
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,149
I'm gonna write that novel
I've been putting off.

1331
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,249
I'm gonna learn a couple
of foreign languages,

1332
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,794
and I'm gonna start a whole
new workout regimen.

1333
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,056
I'm gonna lose all this.

1334
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,995
Get myself
in top physical condition.

1335
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,294
Thank you! Yeah!

1336
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,663
Ha, ha!

1337
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,328
I love it here!

1338
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,565
You've done me
an enormous favor!

1339
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,800
Who's laughing now?

1340
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:17,486
It's nice to get away
from the urban sprawl.

1341
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,561
"Carlyle, 28 miles."

1342
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:23,689
Going my way?

1343
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,900
Piece of cake, really.

1344
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,838
So we make a left up ahead.

1345
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,144
Oh. Right turn.

1346
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,736
Thanks, buddy.

1347
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,879
I'm afraid
there's just no sign of him.

1348
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,683
Really? Well, then...

1349
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,554
let's make it official.

1350
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,958
Well, if we must, we must.

1351
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,926
Then there's the time
I got hit by that car...

1352
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,229
and the time that I ate
that six-day-old halibut.

1353
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,269
Hey, that's only seven lives.

1354
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,564
I got two more.

1355
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,503
All right, I'm gonna
get out of this.

1356
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,270
Bingo!

1357
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,903
Winston and I have come
to your rescue.

1358
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,447
Took you long enough.

1359
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,416
What, did you finally hear
my stomach growling?

1360
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,682
No, but we heard your tiresome
monologue. Bad halibut, indeed.

1361
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,085
Let's get you out of here,
Your Royal Highness.

1362
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,456
Winster.

1363
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,927
The solicitors are here.

1364
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,520
We have to move quickly.

1365
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,099
Huh.

1366
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,226
Uh, then we luncheon,
Your Royal Highness.

1367
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,067
Yeah, you can drop that shtick,
drool boy.

1368
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,765
I heard you
and the bird.

1369
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,742
How about the house cat part?
I loved that.

1370
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,436
Aw, all right, all right.

1371
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,537
So we weren't exactly honest.

1372
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,615
We had to do it.

1373
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,876
What would
you have done?

1374
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,452
Save your breath, chubby cheeks.

1375
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,717
I shall abdicate my throne
and return to my TV chair.

1376
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,451
You were our only hope.

1377
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,221
The only hope of the hopeless.

1378
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,625
What do they want, blood?

1379
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,996
I have been eating and sleeping
my heart out for these animals--

1380
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,363
still not enough.

1381
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:12,169
Like I'm not as good
as a royal cat could be.

1382
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,640
Huh?

1383
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,582
Hmm...

1384
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,613
Hmm?

1385
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:28,917
Hmm...

1386
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,522
Hmm?

1387
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,494
Blah!

1388
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,201
Hmm?

1389
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:04,485
Aha! I so knew you weren't me.

1390
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,220
And you must be Garfield.

1391
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,853
How do you know my name?

1392
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,626
I've lived your life
for the past few days.

1393
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,692
Yes, if ever a man loved a cat,
it's yourJon.

1394
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,567
Return to him, Garfield.

1395
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,731
Return to your home.

1396
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:24,704
Your Highness, you don't have
to tell me twice. Bye-bye.

1397
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,213
Sire, thank heavens.

1398
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,509
- You've returned.
- The real prince!

1399
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:28,583
The prince is home,
back with us!

1400
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:32,051
It's the real prince--
the genuine article.

1401
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,246
Yes, my friends,

1402
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,848
I have returned to you
at this, our darkest hour.

1403
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:40,656
So, Winny, what exactly is
Lord Dargis up to?

1404
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:43,994
He intends to level our homes
and kill us all.

1405
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,034
O... kay.

1406
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,204
Well, in that case, I decree
that we pack our bags

1407
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,003
and get our scraggy bottoms
out of here.

1408
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,702
Perhaps to the castle next door.

1409
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,244
- Oh, boy.
- What?!

1410
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,836
Well, that was inspirational.

1411
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,006
Brilliant.

1412
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,879
I am so fired up.

1413
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,747
You know, I have to believe
we can do better.

1414
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,514
I thought you were leaving.

1415
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,851
Hey, button the beak,
Fruit Loops,

1416
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,482
or I'll stick that thing on
backwards.

1417
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,187
Look, Lord Doofus is
just another bully.

1418
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,126
And what do we do to bullies?

1419
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,426
Well, generally,
we run from them.

1420
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,433
No, we don't leave.

1421
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,026
We stand
and we kick royal butt.

1422
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,732
Trust me, if you beasts...

1423
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,001
can bake a two-cheese
lasagna,

1424
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,474
you can beat Dargis.

1425
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,909
Well, do you have a plan,
Garfield?

1426
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,810
Tell you what.
For the duration of this battle,

1427
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:36,078
I would prefer
to be called G-Cat.

1428
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:40,315
And we have two plans.

1429
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,653
Oh, teamwork. Oh, yes, yes.

1430
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,832
Hey, girly dog!

1431
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,896
Yeah, you girly girl!

1432
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,234
You're such a silly sissy dog!

1433
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,239
Go! Go!

1434
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,575
The game is afoot.

1435
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,945
Sissy, silly dog.

1436
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,922
You don't move so good, bozo!

1437
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,392
Uh-oh!

1438
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,989
Here, kitty-kitty.

1439
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,231
Yoo-hoo!

1440
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:32,034
Oh, Mr. Stinky Dog.

1441
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,439
Hey, loco.

1442
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,306
Oh, no!

1443
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,880
Run away!

1444
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,608
Oh, yay-yip-yip-yahoo!

1445
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,549
Yahoo!
Yow-yow-ya-ya-yip-yip-yip-yahoo!

1446
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,923
The loss of Prince...

1447
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,651
I'm not quite
sure that...

1448
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,785
any of us will ever
get over it.

1449
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:58,162
Prince and Carlyle Court
were... were one.

1450
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:02,135
Sometimes, it's, it's almost
as if his...

1451
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,173
his spirit was still...

1452
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,310
His spirit's still what?

1453
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:16,544
...still ro-roaming
the grounds.

1454
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:23,088
I wonder if you could
excuse me for a little...

1455
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,683
Do you hear running water?

1456
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,555
I-I won't be long.

1457
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,363
He's a bit of a tool,
don't you think?

1458
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,368
Yes?

1459
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:41,500
Lord Dargis. Am I early?

1460
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,135
Only just, Miss Westminster.
Only just.

1461
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:48,273
Please, please. Please.

1462
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,147
I was just
finishing something.

1463
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,948
I wonder if you'd like
to wait in the library.

1464
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:53,919
Okay.

1465
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,888
Make yourself at home.

1466
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,458
Have a seat.

1467
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,584
Thank you. Um...

1468
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,820
Tally-ho!

1469
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,557
Oh! On the other hand,
this simply won't do.

1470
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,099
- Why?
- Smithee's been painting again.

1471
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,259
I can't smell anything.

1472
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,858
Oh, you never can,
my darling.

1473
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,130
Next thing you know,

1474
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,172
you're salsa dancing
in your knickers.

1475
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,639
- What?
- I won't be long.

1476
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,807
Ah! Mr. Dargis,

1477
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,045
will we be starting
sometime today?

1478
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:26,951
Absolutely, Mr. Hobbs.

1479
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,648
Hello again.

1480
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,350
- What's the matter?
- Matter with what?

1481
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,226
- You screamed.
- No, I didn't.

1482
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,800
Why don't you adjourn
to my study?

1483
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,406
And now, I'll retrieve
the papers.

1484
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,279
Where are you,
you rat-headed devil?

1485
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,089
Oh, no!

1486
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:11,360
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Fancy-pants.

1487
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,702
Wait till I get
my hands on you!

1488
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,000
Ha-ha! He's brilliant!

1489
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,121
Dargis!

1490
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,991
I got two words for youse:

1491
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,893
Me. Yow.

1492
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,229
Come here, you!

1493
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,037
Oh, no, you won't do.

1494
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,007
I specifically requested
a feline masseuse.

1495
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,744
Somebody get this thing
off of me!

1496
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,587
Hey, bozo!

1497
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,821
Yeah, you, buster!

1498
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,089
Hey!

1499
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:25,263
Stupid, red-haired,
flea-bitten...

1500
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,706
Whoa-aah!

1501
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:34,282
Lord Da... What is...?

1502
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,112
What is that?

1503
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,913
- I felt a slight chill.
- What?

1504
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,545
I thought a simple wrap
would be just the ticket.

1505
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,248
- There!
- There what?

1506
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,223
There is absolutely no reason

1507
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:47,090
why you can't have
a cool, refreshing drink

1508
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,222
to make you feel calmer
in this steamy weather.

1509
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,357
Wait in the room.

1510
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,095
Stupid cat!

1511
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,400
Nobody makes an idiot out of me.

1512
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,441
Oopsie-daisy.

1513
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,038
Medic!

1514
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,015
Well done, old man.

1515
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,518
Thank you.

1516
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,986
Never seen a welcome mat
on the way out.

1517
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,253
Get your cameras ready, ladies.

1518
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,056
Come back here, you flea-bitten monster!

1519
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,395
Oops! Oh, no!

1520
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,781
Ooh!

1521
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,448
Trousers!

1522
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,965
Trousers!

1523
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,435
Target sighted!

1524
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,139
Shaken him off.

1525
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,215
Pull!

1526
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:17,513
Take that!

1527
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,883
And that!

1528
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:23,822
- Down a bit. Down a bit. Up.
- Bob's your uncle!

1529
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,989
Good Lord, it's a conspiracy!

1530
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,162
Oh, dear.

1531
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,464
Trousers!

1532
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:41,100
Smithee!

1533
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,043
Excuse me, sir.

1534
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,511
Is that Carlyle Castle?

1535
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,740
It is.

1536
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,077
Maybe you can help me.

1537
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,913
Have you seen a cat
that looks like this?

1538
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,284
Ah, yeah... that's Prince,

1539
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,084
the cat of Carlyle.

1540
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,723
It's also Garfield,
the cat of the cul-de-sac.

1541
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,261
Do you mean to say,
you have a cat

1542
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,728
that's Prince's doppelganger?

1543
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,732
No, I'm saying
they look exactly alike.

1544
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,064
And there's a chance
they may have gotten mixed up.

1545
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,728
I see.

1546
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,708
There you are, man.

1547
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,268
Good God! What happened
to your clothes?

1548
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:23,249
Indeed, it's been
that kind of day.

1549
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,047
Mr. Dargis, I demand
an explanation.

1550
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:27,713
I had no choice.

1551
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,122
The cat just won't die.

1552
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,625
What did you say?

1553
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:38,030
You will sign the deeds
over to me, cat or no cat.

1554
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,122
Oh, my!

1555
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,758
Mr. Hobbs, you were right.

1556
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,860
Lord Dargis was willing
to go to any lengths

1557
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,063
to get the estate.

1558
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,639
I can see you're busy.
I'm just gonna...

1559
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,232
Uh! Young lady.

1560
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,004
Get over there.

1561
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,712
Traitoress. You were working
with them all along!

1562
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,681
Odie! Odie, wait for me!

1563
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,052
Odie!

1564
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,922
Get on with it!

1565
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,655
Hello, everyone.

1566
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,924
Sorry I'm late.
Shall I ring for tea?

1567
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,500
Well, it's Prince,
and he's alive!

1568
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,966
I am bushed.

1569
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,401
All this running-for-my-life
stuff.

1570
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:17,802
What say we break for lunch,

1571
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,771
take a quick nap
and pick it up later?

1572
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,069
Sound good?

1573
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:24,168
There are two
of you little monsters, hmm?

1574
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,181
For those keeping score
at home, that's 18 lives.

1575
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,807
This is unbelievable!

1576
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,852
Two cats?!
- No matter.

1577
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,182
I have plenty of ammunition.

1578
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:37,156
Aah!

1579
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,591
Something's biting me!

1580
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,299
Odie, let him go!

1581
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,561
Help! Oh!

1582
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:51,036
Your lunatic dog
just bit my bottom!

1583
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,835
All right.
Well played, you.

1584
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,844
Hey, look, it's Little Jon.

1585
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,346
Good show, old man.

1586
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,849
I'll go quietly.

1587
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,111
Jon?

1588
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,084
- Liz?
- What's going on?

1589
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,655
Well, hello, my dear.

1590
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,087
Hello.

1591
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:11,455
And not a moment too soon.

1592
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,357
Uh-oh!

1593
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,396
Is this part of the tour?

1594
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,829
- Let her go.
- All in good time.

1595
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,195
Now if you'll be so kind...

1596
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,566
Okay, stay calm.
Okay?

1597
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,434
Mr. Hobbs, the papers, please.

1598
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:26,734
I've seen enough.
You want to call in your weasel?

1599
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:27,900
Sic him, Nigel.

1600
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,272
Oi! I'm a ferret.

1601
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,073
And I mean business...
trouser-leg business!

1602
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,076
I'll take a leg, please.

1603
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,378
Ooh, on second thought,
I'll have some white meat.

1604
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,475
Aah! Good Lord!

1605
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,988
There's a wild animal
in my trousers!

1606
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,128
Hoo-dee-doo-dee-doo.

1607
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,198
Uh, who's next then, eh?

1608
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,595
Glass jaw.

1609
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,668
He can dish it out,
but he can't take it.

1610
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:54,861
That was amazing!

1611
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,369
Are-Are you okay?

1612
01:17:56,471 --> 01:18:00,202
Yeah, I...
I never felt better.

1613
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,240
Well done, Garfield.

1614
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,641
I was rooting for you
the whole time.

1615
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:04,973
Did you hear something?

1616
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,104
Yes, one did.

1617
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,444
I'm here to discuss
my new position in your...

1618
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,778
There he is, gentlemen.

1619
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,013
Come along.
There's a good boy.

1620
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:15,351
Oh... It was the animals,
you know.

1621
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,688
Plotting, planning,
every one of them against me!

1622
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,887
I assume that
will be all, sir.

1623
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:24,124
Smithee.
He'll vouch for me.

1624
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:25,597
Smithee!

1625
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,259
Odie, thank you.

1626
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,269
You're a hero
and a gentleman.

1627
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,965
Whoa. There are
two Garfields?

1628
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,542
Well, how can you
tell them apart?

1629
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,975
Oh, you forgot imbecile.

1630
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,944
- That's Garfield.
- Garfield.

1631
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:40,082
Liz, I've been...

1632
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,975
I've been trying
to get the courage up

1633
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,312
to ask you something
all week.

1634
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,386
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh...

1635
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,825
Oh, come on...
Really?

1636
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,918
Looking for something?

1637
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,504
Thanks, pal.

1638
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,940
Liz, will you marry me?

1639
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:10,475
Yes.

1640
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,474
Aw...

1641
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,485
You know a dog's mouth
is cleaner than a human's?

1642
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,988
Come on! The coast is clear!

1643
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,030
Hooray!

1644
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,931
McBUNNY:
Let's hear it for the cats!

1645
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:35,764
Hooray!

1646
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,600
Go, Garfield.

1647
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,003
That's right. Come on!

1648
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,075
Do you do
the Carlyle jig?

1649
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,473
It goes like this.

1650
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,242
Can you do this?

1651
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:47,679
Oh, boogaloo.

1652
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,115
Jolly good.

1653
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,381
Bust a move, man.

1654
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,821
No, it's something
like this here.

1655
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,258
And so, my loyal subjects,

1656
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,330
I leave you
with a final legacy.

1657
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,795
Cannonball!

1658
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,537
Brilliant party, sire.

1659
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,548
Yeah, when the going gets tough...

1660
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,550
the great ones party.

1661
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,518
Who wants to play
Marco Polo?

1662
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,027
Marco!

1663
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,759
I refuse to partake in this
sinful display of hedonism.

1664
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,698
Oh! Those nuts look good.

1665
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,133
Get a load of this!

1666
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:45,104
Bombs away...!

1667
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,606
I love this pond.

1668
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,767
We rule the pool, goosey.

1669
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,276
Give me some feathers!

1670
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,455
Watch the ears.

1671
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,959
Thank you.

1672
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,190
Oh, you're so kind.

1673
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:18,461
Odie, could you
beat it, please?

1674
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:21,406
It's good to be king.
