1
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,381
- I dunno,

2
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,182
he just seems to be working
us a lot harder lately.

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,151
Like, practices are
getting a lot rougher

4
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,420
and just, like, a lot of
exercise and a lot of running.

5
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,389
You know how I love running.

6
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,224
I dunno.

7
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,625
Yeah, I heard there was a
party going on tonight,

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,761
I dunno if I want to go.

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,531
I don't know if I want to sit
around Robbie's basement

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,434
while you guys make out
in the laundry room.

11
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,771
Which mark, mark mendola?

12
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,140
It doesn't matter.
I'm babysitting.

13
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,108
Yes, again.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,376
I dunno maybe.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,778
How late are you
gonna be hanging out?

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,646
- Hi, sorry.
- I gotta go.

17
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,314
- Do you know where
the post office is?

18
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,150
- Uh, the post office?

19
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,786
Uh, I'm not real good
with directions, uh...

20
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,972
Oh, hey.

21
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,157
Can you help this lady
get to the post office?

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,126
- Are you Anna?
- Uh... yeah!

23
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,623
- Jacob can
you come down here?

24
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,264
Your dad should be home any
minute with a new sitter.

25
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,834
Get down here and help
me with your brother.

26
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,385
- Bye, mom!

27
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,592
- Hi.

28
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,993
You must be Anna.

29
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,761
- And you're Mr. Thompson?

30
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,430
- Yeah, yeah,
call me Dan though.

31
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,899
- It's so nice to meet you.

32
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,969
- Yeah, Maggie has been
a lot less reliable

33
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,570
since she got her braces off.

34
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,340
I dunno what's
going on with that.

35
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,943
It's me and my wife's
anniversary tonight,

36
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,512
so you're really
saving our butts here.

37
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,648
- Aw, happy anniversary.

38
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,317
- Thank you.
Thank you.

39
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,588
So, the kids have had play dates
with the abbott girls.

40
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,925
Ashley and - what's the
little quiet one's name?

41
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,294
Um...

42
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,830
I forget.

43
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,698
- I just call them
sleepy and grumpy.

44
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,402
- Sleepy and grumpy,
that's good.

45
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:34,906
Yeah, well, our kids,
they tend to be more energetic.

46
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,676
They're good kids,
great kids.

47
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,745
They're just...Woo!

48
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,980
And then there's--
then there's our oldest.

49
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,583
He's 11,
he just started middle school

50
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,687
and you know, and...
Stones are dropping.

51
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,455
You know what I mean?

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,691
- That's okay, I can handle
an 11 year old.

53
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:57,029
- Yeah, Maggie said you were
quite the child herder.

54
00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:01,500
You got a Facebook page
and everything.

55
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,871
- Did you see my page?
- No, no. I don't um...

56
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,707
I barely go on the computer.

57
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,010
Yeah, I don't have one of those.
It's a little too much sharing.

58
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,713
But Joyce might've.

59
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,754
- And what age
are the other two?

60
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:26,925
- Uh, Sally just turned 9,
she just had her birthday.

61
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,862
And Christopher is 4.

62
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,732
He's a--
he's a cute little guy.

63
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,401
He won't give you
much of a problem.

64
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,470
- They're good ages.

65
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,409
- Give it back, Christopher!
- Boys, slow it down.

66
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,782
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,484
- Is the new babysitter a girl?

68
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,052
- Yes, she's a girl.

69
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,022
- Because I like it when I'm
not the only one all the time.

70
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,057
- You can't catch me!
- Guys!

71
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,897
- You guys. No, no, no.
No jumping.

72
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,566
Come on,
keep it downstairs.

73
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,868
Jacob! Hey!

74
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,738
Jacob!

75
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,939
- I'm okay, mommy.

76
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,908
- Little idiot!
- Jacob.

77
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,810
- You know what?

78
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,811
- What?

79
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,514
- Hand it over.

80
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,083
Jacob!

81
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,452
- Hand it over!
- He won't leave me alone!

82
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,454
The kid won't leave me alone,
it's not my fault.

83
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,790
- Give me the game.

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,992
Till the weekend.

85
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,093
- For what?!

86
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,396
- I can't keep
doing this with you.

87
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,997
You want me to keep
paying for babysitters

88
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:39,998
till you're in college?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,434
- Yes.

90
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,403
- Like it or not,
you're the big brother,

91
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,705
and I need you step up.

92
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,841
You're not a little anymore.

93
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,043
- Jakey's gotta take
care of us.

94
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,578
- Shut it, meat bag.

95
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,847
- Hey!

96
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,852
- Hey Jake.
Jake you there?

97
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,020
Pick up!

98
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,122
- Hey. Yeah. Howie.
What do you want?

99
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,591
- Wanna come watch me
play the new dark realm?

100
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,095
- Uh, no, no, I can't.
Getting babysat tonight.

101
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,497
- Ooh...
Maggie's coming over?

102
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,667
She so fine now she
got her braces off.

103
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,903
- Uh, no, not Maggie.
Someone new.

104
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,439
Her best friend
or something.

105
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,574
- My mom lets me watch
my sister after school

106
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,842
till she gets home from work

107
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,677
and I'm born
three months after you.

108
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,978
- Good for you.

109
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,581
- Hey, so, remember how my
cousins went on vacation

110
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,716
to Nevada?

111
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,850
Well they brought me
back something

112
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,119
that's gonna blow your hole.

113
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,153
- What is it?

114
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,456
- I stashed it in
your tree house.

115
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,224
Meet me there after bedtime.

116
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,526
- Alright.

117
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,594
I'll think about it.

118
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,697
- Over and out.

119
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,765
- Hon?

120
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,169
Hon, how we doing?

121
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,572
Hon?

122
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,706
Okay.

123
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,141
- Hi, I'm Joyce.

124
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,676
- Hi.

125
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,210
It's so nice to meet you.
Your house is beautiful.

126
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,813
- Sorry it's kinda a mess.

127
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,549
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

128
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,955
- Can I get a hug before we go?
- Daddy!

129
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,992
- Miss you.
- Thank you. I'll miss you, too.

130
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,894
- You smell funny, dad.

131
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,630
- It's Cologne.
Your mom got it for me.

132
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,031
- What's Cologne?

133
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,933
- It's like perfume
for daddies.
- Yeah.

134
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,535
- Okay, guys.

135
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,136
This is Anna, she's your
babysitter for tonight.

136
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,906
- Anna!
- Hi.

137
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,742
- I'm Sally.
- And I'm Christopher!

138
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,010
- That's my brother Christopher.

139
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,044
- Hey, Christopher.

140
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,213
- Beep, beep, beep.

141
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,651
- Oh, who's that guy?

142
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,052
- That's glow nose.

143
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,587
- Glow nose.
Okay.

144
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,855
- He was my--
- he was my--

145
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,807
- no, he was Jake's,

146
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,758
when he was a little kid,
and then he was Sally's,

147
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,194
and now he's mine.

148
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,896
- He looks like he's
had a lot of love.

149
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,064
- Yes, he does.

150
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,309
- Chris and sal are babies.

151
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,245
I don't need her here.

152
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,948
- You know, this a
really special night

153
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,684
for your mom and me.

154
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,220
- When are you gonna be back?

155
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,655
- Jake's gonna
be in trou-ble.

156
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,823
Ha-ha, ha, ha-ha!

157
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,326
- You'll be asleep.

158
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,568
Get downstairs
and meet the new sitter.

159
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,404
- They already ate dinner

160
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,905
but if they get hungry
they can have a snack.

161
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,042
There's cookies, crackers,
gummies are in the cupboard.

162
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,244
There should be some
baby carrots in the crisper.

163
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,979
Yes, there are...

164
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,982
-I left the number
for the restaurant--
- I have a pet hamster.

165
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,350
- And the number
for my cell phone.

166
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,985
- His name's admiral wubbles.

167
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,654
- Yeah?
You'll have to introduce me.

168
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,289
Do the kids have
their own phones?

169
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,991
- "No cell phones
till high school."

170
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,960
- That's right, family rule.

171
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,662
But feel free to call my cell
anytime, with any questions.

172
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,830
- Okay.

173
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,997
- He's coming down.
- Daddy!

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,366
- What else does
she need to know?

175
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,602
- Ah, let's see.

176
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,237
They will probably
try to convince you

177
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,039
to let them play
in the garage.

178
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,374
Do not let them.

179
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,677
- What's in the garage?

180
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,979
- A '73 corvette stingray
coupe that I restored myself.

181
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,846
So...

182
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,915
- Nice.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,983
- Yeah, I had it bored
and stroked to a 383.

184
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,385
Got about 400
horsepower in that--

185
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,754
- I thought we were in a rush?

186
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,623
- Yeah, yeah we are.

187
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,660
And we're taking the minivan.

188
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,262
- So, bedtime is nine o'clock.

189
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:35,000
Jacob can stay up till 9:30
but only to read.

190
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,101
They so should go down easy

191
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,869
because we had
soccer practice today.

192
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,839
This one had ballet.

193
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,074
- Any allergies or medications
i should know about?

194
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,843
- Ah...
No, nothing like that.

195
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,244
- Nope, good genes.

196
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,880
- You have to watch
Christopher brush his teeth.

197
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,016
Otherwise he just
eats the toothpaste.

198
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,051
- Ah.
There he is.

199
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,419
This is Jake, our oldest.

200
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,955
Jake, this is Anna,
the new sitter.

201
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,691
- Hi, Jake.

202
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,027
- Say hello.

203
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,294
- Hey.

204
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,230
- A wealth of conversation.

205
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,432
He's mad at me because
i took away his -

206
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,701
what is it called,
hand-held dx thing.

207
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,203
- Oh.

208
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,704
- Okay, where is my good coat?
Is it upstairs or where is it?

209
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,239
- Right in front of you.

210
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,274
- Alright kids, gather around.

211
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,877
Where's Christopher?
Christopher!

212
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,845
- It's your anniversary!

213
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,313
- Say goodnight.
- Goodnight.

214
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,448
- Nighty night!

215
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,450
- Alright,
listen up you three:

216
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,453
Anna here is in charge,
okay?

217
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,722
You be good
and do what she says.

218
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,389
Capiche?

219
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,824
- Ka-peach.

220
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,060
Ka-peach, ka-peach,
ka-peach!

221
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,161
- Good night, guys.

222
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,462
- Good night.

223
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,764
- Home by eleven.
- Yeah.

224
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,065
- Enjoy your meal.
Happy anniversary!

225
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,332
- Thank you.

226
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,234
- Bye guys, I love you!
- Love you.

227
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,236
- Love you, too!

228
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,473
- What shall we play?

229
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,477
- Do you want to draw?
- No.

230
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,778
- What do you want to do?

231
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,848
We could play board games?

232
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,221
We could do make-up.

233
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,356
- No!
I'm a boy!

234
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,892
- Can we get ice cream?

235
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:13,498
Um...
Oh, let's play dress-up!

236
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,937
Yes, let's play dress-up!

237
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,778
- You coming, Jacob?

238
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,879
- Don't bother.

239
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,882
Jacob never plays
with us anymore.

240
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,890
- Dress-up's for girls, Chris.

241
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,892
- Okay, what dress
should I wear?

242
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,294
- This one, this one,
or this one?
- That one!

243
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,530
- Which?
- This one.

244
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,098
- Right?
- That's awesome!

245
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,968
- That's the best darn dress
that I ever saw!

246
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,836
- And then she becomes queen.

247
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,839
And so then they can't decide
who's gonna be queen again--

248
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,076
- so why don't they play 'rock
paper scissors says shoot?'

249
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,245
- they can't play
rock paper scissors.
- Oh yeah.

250
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,813
- And so then they decide

251
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,782
that they're both
gonna rule together.

252
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,017
- Hey guys.

253
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,854
What if I told you that you
don't have to be a boy,

254
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:14,392
or a girl, or a human,
or really anything?

255
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,995
You can be
whatever you wanted.

256
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:22,133
And all you had to do
was pretend.

257
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,871
Because pretending is this
super power we all have.

258
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,540
When we pretend,

259
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,143
we can be anyone
we want to be.

260
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,280
And if you get
really good at it,

261
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,549
people won't even know
you're pretending anymore.

262
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,417
- I wanna play pretend!

263
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,186
- Okay.

264
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,213
Cool room.

265
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,984
- It's alright.

266
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,230
- Lemur-boy, huh?

267
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,032
You ever read death vice?

268
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,802
- No.

269
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,970
Mom and dad say
it's too violent.

270
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,441
- Well, your parents
aren't here right now,

271
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,143
are they?

272
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,893
See ya later?

273
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,932
- I never feel great
leaving them with someone

274
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,501
we don't know.

275
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,637
- I thought Anna seemed
like a very nice girl.

276
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,673
- Yeah, I noticed.

277
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:17,248
- The kids are gonna
be fine, okay?

278
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,450
Jan abbott said that Anna
is great with her girls

279
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:23,321
and we both know that
they're nightmares.

280
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,089
Tonight's about us.

281
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,226
Thirteen years.

282
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,030
Our marriage is a teenager.

283
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,500
I think we deserve a night off.

284
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,670
- I agree.

285
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,539
- New dress?
- Yes.

286
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,574
- Now you notice.

287
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,010
- I, I noticed before.

288
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:52,216
It just took a little while
for the polaroid to develop.

289
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,585
- Thank you.

290
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,960
- I am Princess petalsong.

291
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,029
My leaves are vibrant,
my fruit is tart,

292
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,731
and my roots run deep.

293
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,399
She's from enchanted forest.

294
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,101
On toon tube?

295
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,502
Mommy bought it for me.

296
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,204
It's my favorite show.

297
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,007
- Rarr!

298
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,509
- Wow,
what a big scary bronto!

299
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,611
Look how the floor
shakes when he moves.

300
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,013
- What the heck?!

301
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,481
Were those mommy's
good pillows?

302
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,718
- Rarr!

303
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,686
- What'd you stuff it with?

304
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,254
- Sweatshirts.

305
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,290
- Now this is pretending.

306
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,994
Not some out-of-a-bag
get-up your mom bought you.

307
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,464
- He ruined mommy's
good pillows!

308
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:44,035
- Sometimes it's okay to
destroy things for fun.

309
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,438
Good job, christosaurus.

310
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,609
- Jacob!

311
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,545
Daddy's old uniform!

312
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,781
- Jacob's gonna do
pretend with us!

313
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,449
- Leave me alone.

314
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,018
- Just get offa.

315
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,121
- Anna, we're not allowed
to play with this stuff.

316
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:09,227
- Well sal, mom and dad
aren't here, are they?

317
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,199
- That's right.

318
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,335
- No fair.

319
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,469
- Hey, you were supposed
to be pretending

320
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,205
to be something, too!

321
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,441
- I already am.

322
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,644
- Whatdya mean?

323
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,549
- I'm a photographer!

324
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:37,355
Yeah, I travel around the world
taking photos
of amazing creatures.

325
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,424
Hey Christopher,
what do dinosaurs do?

326
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,692
- Sit down and eat meat!

327
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,495
- That's right.

328
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,198
Smile.

329
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,369
Alright, give us a twirl,
Princess.

330
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,240
Beautiful.

331
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,708
Stand up.

332
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,645
Come on, big boy.

333
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Alright stand together.

334
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,418
Raise that trophy
over your head.

335
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,087
But not like you're victorious,

336
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,190
like you're going to
smash it on top of her.

337
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,860
Sally, stop smiling.

338
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,531
Stop smiling.

339
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,667
Good.

340
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,822
- Did you do this?

341
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,690
- Yeah, I did that.

342
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,692
- When did you have
time to do that?

343
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,928
- I had enough time
on my lunch break

344
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,198
to run them here
from Vinnie's.

345
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,167
- Vinnie!
- Remember Vinnie?

346
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,735
- Vinnie.

347
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,302
- Vinnie was 75
when we first met him.

348
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,771
- How old is he?
- Vinnie was 75.

349
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,439
- So he's a 104 now.

350
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,643
- Remember what he said?

351
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,544
- I don't remember
what he said.

352
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,579
- "Red is for the passion.

353
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,882
White is for the longevity."

354
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,318
- That's right.

355
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,287
- We got that.

356
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,700
- We got them both.

357
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,112
- I don't want to
play this anymore.

358
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:53,524
- Yeah, let's play a
different game.

359
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,759
- Alright.

360
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,061
How about hide & seek?
Not it!

361
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,329
- Not it!
- Not it!

362
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,397
- Jake's it!

363
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,967
- No.
No, no, I'm not playing.

364
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,203
I'm not-- I'm not playing.

365
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,337
I don't want to play.

366
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,306
- Oh, come on, Jake.

367
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,841
Don't you want to find me?

368
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,220
- One hundred...

369
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,521
Ninety-nine...

370
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,456
Ninety-eight...

371
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,858
Ninety-seven...

372
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,962
- No peeking.

373
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,670
- Ninety-eight,

374
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,640
ninety-seven,

375
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,942

00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,311

378
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,349

379
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,451
ninety-two,

380
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,287
ninety-one,

381
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,822
ninety,

382
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,657

383
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,392
eighty-eight,

384
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,494

00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,498
eighty-five,

387
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,318
seventy,

388
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,020
sixty-nine,

389
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,555
sixty-eight,

390
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,472
fifty-eight,

00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,974

00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,643

fifty-three,

396
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,983
fifty-two,

397
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,085
fifty-one,

398
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,987
fifty...

399
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,544
Thirty-nine,

400
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,978
thirty-eight,

401
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,714
thirty-seven,

402
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,115
thirty-six,

403
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,883
thirty-five,

404
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,719
thirty-four,

405
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,954
thirty-three...

406
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,500
Ten,

407
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,735
nine,

408
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,604
eight-seven-six-five-
four-three-two-one!

409
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,508
Ready or not,
here I come!

410
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,654
Now where could they be?

411
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,094
- You found me.

412
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,635
Jake?

413
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,538
Jacob?

414
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,985
Hey.

415
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,926
Hey, will you find
me a new tampon?

416
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,794
- A what?

417
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,764
- I have my period.

418
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,169
You know what that is, right?

419
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,071
- Yeah.

420
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,675
- So, where does your
mom keep her stuff?

421
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,882
- This?

422
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,555
- No, that's for when your
mom has an infection.

423
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,662
Look for 'pamtax.'

424
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,668
- which color?

425
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,639
- Green.

426
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,011
Can you open it for me?

427
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,748
- Okay.

428
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,971
- Thank you.

429
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,932
- Oh man!

430
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:13,571
- Jake.

431
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,972
Come in, Jake.

432
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,774
Jake!

433
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,244
Jake.

434
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,947
Come in, bro.

435
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,787
Dude, you gotta
come see this stuff.

436
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,223
- Howie...

437
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,794
- Yo.

438
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,264
- I think I just saw
my first China hole.

439
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,867
- You know eventually
we're going to have to have

440
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,604
'the talk' with him.

441
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,173
- What talk?

442
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,976
- 'The talk'.

443
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:53,911
- Yeah.
- No.

444
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,845
- Yeah.
- I don't want to
think about that.

445
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,983
- I don't even like picturing
him with armpit hair.

446
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,951
- You know the little Stevie
kid down the street,
- mm-hmm.

447
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,686
- He's got the little starter
mustache going on.

448
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,188
- Starter mustache...
- Yeah.

449
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,624
- It's just a weird time,

450
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,059
especially when you're the
last one to sprout.

451
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,995
- You think they're
making fun of him?

452
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,696
- Mm-mm.

453
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,548
- They better not be.

454
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,399
I will punch them in the face if
they're making fun of my baby.

455
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,301
- Joyce...

456
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,336
- He's my baby!

457
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,940
- Well your baby has a pretty
interesting browsing history.

458
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:23,741
- Hey!
Give it back!

459
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,845
- I already dipped the feet!

460
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,046
- Anna!

461
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,948
Tell him to give it back!

462
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,349
- Don't be a drama queen,
Sally.

463
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,118
- Yeah, sal.
Really?

464
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,955
- Christopher!
- Just get a different cookie.

465
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,640
- Chill out, okay?

466
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,324
- But I had a whole
cookie family

467
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,161
and then the papa was about
to take them to the pond,

468
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,797
and now no one else
can drive stick!

469
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,816
- Anyone can drive stick.

470
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,834
- There's a whole package
of cookies here, so...

471
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,935
Pick a different papa.

472
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,170
- Yeah, pick a different one.

473
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:58,409
- Yeah sal, there's a
whole pack of cookies.

474
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,378
Yep, look at all of these--

475
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,914
- Jacob!

476
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,984
- Mmm.
So many cookies.

477
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,119
- Anna!
Do something!

478
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,988
- Lots of options.

479
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,389
- Can I have one?

480
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,892
Please.

481
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,264
- I want juice.

482
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,131
- You have juice.

483
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,368
- I want that juice.

484
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,003
- Go get it yourself.

485
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,739
- Okay.

486
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,212
- You know now that your DNA
is all over those cookies...

487
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,747
I guess you're gonna
have to eat all of them.

488
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,882
- No fair!

489
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,351
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,886
I mean it.

491
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,855
Eat them all.

492
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:45,823
Go.

493
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,225
- What?

494
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,396
- They yummy?

495
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,499
- Mmm.
- This is a loada b!

496
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,080
- Can I have some milk?

497
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,117
- Not till you finish
those cookies.

498
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,935
- Best babysitter...

499
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,773
- Hey, what's your
favorite color?

500
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,141
- Black.

501
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,510
- Black?
- Yeah.

502
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,846
That's my favorite color, too.

503
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,319
Hey, how about we go
cheer up your sister?

504
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,288
- Yeah.

505
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,538
- Aw man, which of you guys put
the wrong cap on the marker?

506
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,406
- How's that masterpiece coming?

507
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,975
- Good.

508
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,011
- It's the right one.
- Uh-uh.

509
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,346
- See there's blue
under the green cap.

510
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,950
And now I've got
a blue flower stem.

511
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,941
Hey, Jacob.

512
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,911
- If you open your mind
I'll tell you--
- fascinating.

513
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:51,215
- So, this the flower queen.

514
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,950
- Queen!

515
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,618
- And then this is
the Princess.

516
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,220
- Who is the king?

517
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,121
- There isn't a king.
- Wow. The royal family.

518
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,157
- It's a queendom.

519
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,129
- Hey Anna, check this out.

520
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,031
- Yeah.

521
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,867
- Wow.
Christopher, what's this?

522
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,202
- Attack of the killer olives!

523
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,037
- What happened to that guy?

524
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,439
- You mean this guy?
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,107
- He got stepped on by
the monster's toe claw.

526
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,060
That's the toe claw

527
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:23,012
and this where he chewed
off his legs and arms.

528
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,649
- Hey Anna, wanna help
me feed my python?

529
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,551
- Can we come, too?!
- I don't wanna go.

530
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,353
- No, you guys
know the rules.

531
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,154
Just me and Anna.

532
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,257
- Please?
- Yeah he's right.

533
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,292
- We're too little.

534
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,427
- You know,
that's just rude.

535
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,562
- Fine.

536
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,097
- We'll all go.
- I don't wanna go.

537
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,098
- Come on.

538
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,201
- No.
I'm not going.

539
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,903
I don't wanna see
the python!

540
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,137
Please!

541
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,073
I wanna finish the stain!

542
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,121
- Can I hold the mouse?
- No.

543
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,923
- Please.
- Nope.

544
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,124
- Can I feed the snake?
- Nope.

545
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,325
- Why not?

546
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:12,262
- Because you suck.
- Hey. Jake.

547
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,499
- In the wild, these
animals are hunters.

548
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:18,969
They always devour
their prey alive.

549
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,505
Warm.

550
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:24,207
This is cold.

551
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,010
But this...

552
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,947
Is warm.

553
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,114
- Admiral wubbles?

554
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,282
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,484
What's he doing here?

556
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,654
- Tonight I think Drake
deserves a special treat.

557
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,722
- Cool!

558
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,590
- No.
No, nope.

559
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,060
- Drake's gonna eat
Sally's hamster?

560
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:44,962
- No, he is not!

561
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,697
- You know, I've never
seen Drake eat anything

562
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,065
that big, sal.

563
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,967
- That's not funny!

564
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,502
- Let's see.

565
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,472
- No!

566
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,540
- Hey!

567
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,176
- Yeah, yeah,
you wanna get him?

568
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,044
- Get out the way!
Move it, Jacob!

569
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,313
- Is that what you want?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

570
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,516
Nope. No.
Can't get pass me.

571
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,358
- Christopher, what are you--
- no, no, no!
Christopher, no!

572
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,431
- Get him out!

573
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,066
Stop! Stop!

574
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,102
Get him outta there, Jake!

575
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,237
- Yeah,
we should get him out--
- wait.

576
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,305
- Just watch.

577
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,642
- He's scared.

578
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,012
No!

579
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,083
Get him out!

580
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,185
Let go!

581
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,088
Get off of me!

582
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,092
Do something, Jake!
Please!

583
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,330
Let go!

584
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,633
Ah!

585
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,065
No!

586
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,687
- I'm sorry, sal.

587
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,756
- Don't be sorry.

588
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,826
Everyone dies at some point.

589
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,680
- Okay, I'm really bad
at keeping this secret.

590
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,848
I was gonna wait till dessert

591
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:23,253
but since you busted out
the champagne...

592
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,754
Happy anniversary.

593
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,757
- Oh, ho, ho, alright.

594
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:32,796
Coupons for those mittens
that I wanted to get, right?

595
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,298
- Slippers?
- Open it.

596
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,142
The nascar sprint cup?!

597
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,694
- Two seats.

598
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,245
'Pit terrace,' the guy
aid those were the best.

599
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,347
- Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,282
They are the best.

601
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,750
How did you...

602
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,217
- How did you even--
- don't worry about it.

603
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,654
- I've been putting away
for this for a while.

604
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,923
I got hooked up.

605
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:00,991
And you deserve it.

606
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,196
You deserve it.

607
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,932
- You're the best.

608
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,847
You know who's gonna
freak out about this?

609
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,883
Pete.

610
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,918
He's gonna flip his lid
when he hears about this.

611
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,388
He's been talking about this
for three or four months now.

612
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,958
- I was kinda thinking
you might take, Jake.

613
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,564
- Yeah.
Of course...

614
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,333
- It's stupid of me--
- it's not stupid.

615
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,669
- To not think about
taking Jake. I just...

616
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:48,705
- You just haven't had a lot
of time together lately.

617
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,740
I think he needs it.

618
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,611
And I thought that would be a
fun way to spend time together.

619
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,514
- Screw Pete.

620
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,727
- Hey.

621
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,431
Come on,
look who's here.

622
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,534
Look who's here.

623
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,237
You want him?

624
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,975
It's okay.

625
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,744
We'll get more wubbles.

626
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:34,317
Wipe away the tears.

627
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,886
Wipe away them!

628
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:40,557
Come on,
wipe away those tears.

629
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,428
Where's the big Sally I know,
where is she?

630
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,798
Where is the old sal?

631
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,635
Soaked.

632
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:56,006
Where is the old Sally
i know?

633
00:37:56,008 --> 00:38:00,810
Where is she,
is she still here?

634
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,347
- Kids, movie time.

635
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,784
- Come on.
It's movie time!

636
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,754
It's movie time.

637
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,325
- Come on.
- What arce we watching?

638
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,007
- I hate movies.

639
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,876
- I don't
know what's wrong,

640
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,644
it won't turn off...

641
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,813
- No, you're with me.

642
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,317
- Jake, where are you going?

643
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,485
- Bathroom.

644
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,822
- It's mommy!

645
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,457
- That's not mommy.

646
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,626
- What
are you doing to me?

647
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,861
Oh my god.

648
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,763
- Just trying out
the camera.

649
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,099
- Get over here.
I want to take your pants off.

650
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,368
- Daddy's naked!

651
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,870
- Oh my god.

652
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,533
- Oh my god,
you're so hard right now.

653
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,741
- Jacob!

654
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,852
- Jacob!

655
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,878
- Howie?

656
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,947
Howie?

657
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,582
Go to bed, Jacob.

658
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,683
- Mrs. Parker?

659
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,919
- Howie's had his
walkie taken away.

660
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,087
Supposed to be
doing his homework

661
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,955
and he's out doing
god-knows-what.

662
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,957
Go to bed, Jacob.

663
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,695
- Mrs. Parker, there's something
wrong with the new babysitter.

664
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,771
Mrs. Parker?!

665
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,541
Crap...

666
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:27,217
That's private!

667
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,155
- Alright.

668
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,558
Well, I think
it's time for bed.

669
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,861
Come on, babe.

670
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,282
"Once upon a time
in a faraway land

671
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,886
lived a mama bear
and her little cubbie.

672
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:14,163
They lived in a cave
in a snowy forest.

673
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,168
Mama bear loved
her cubbie so much.

674
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,170
He made her smile in a way

675
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:24,741
mama bear never thought
she could.

676
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:31,548
- Mama bear worked very--"
- this book is strange.

677
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,084
- You're strange, Sally.

678
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,987
- "Mama bear worked
very hard to pay for--"

679
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,224
- it's my night to
pick the story!
- Then shut up and listen!

680
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,092
- Is that my mom's bracelet?
- Get out!

681
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:46,763
- Get out!
- You get out!

682
00:42:56,107 --> 00:43:01,110
- "Mama bear worked real hard
to pay for food, and the cave.

683
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,464
When she came home at night

684
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,949
and saw her cubbie's
chubby little face,

685
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,618
it just made it all worth it.

686
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:15,959
And then one day mama
bear made a mistake

687
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,765
and her cubbie died.

688
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:36,279
This made mama bear
very sad.

689
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,649
She missed her
cubbie so much

690
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:42,919
that her mind cracked.

691
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,023
It didn't break,
it didn't break.

692
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:49,892
It just cracked.

693
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,768
And then mama met
a skinny hyena.

694
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,638
His mind was cracked
worse than mama bear's

695
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,007
but he liked her a real lot

696
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,176
and said he'd help
her make a new cubbie,

697
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,914
but it didn't work.

698
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:17,320
Mama bear's insides
were twisted shut

699
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,722
and the rulers of the kingdom
wouldn't give mama bear

700
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,258
a new cubbie,

701
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,828
even when she asked nice."

702
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,400
- That's mean.

703
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,370
- I think so, too.

704
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,843
"Mama bear and the
skinny hyena were angry

705
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,713
and they got
into some trouble,

706
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,916
so they decided to
escape to a new land

707
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:50,053
and become new animals.

708
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:04,333
And began their search
for a new cubbie.

709
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,138
But it couldn't
just be any cubbie.

710
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,742
It had to be her cubbie.

711
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,152
And then they searched..."

712
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:27,023
- What happens next?

713
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,127
- I don't know.

714
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,796
What do you think
should happen?

715
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,331
- I want mama bear
to find a new cubbie

716
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,868
so that she can smile
like that again.

717
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:51,214
- She's trying.

718
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,324
Jacob, Sally, time for bed!

719
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,353
- Hey sal.

720
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,806
- Shh.

721
00:46:32,807 --> 00:46:35,258
- Sal, what are you doing?
Get into your pjs.

722
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,795
- It's daddy's gun.

723
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,301
- Don't.

724
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:48,571
- The babysitter left it out.

725
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:57,580
- She's no babysitter.

726
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:04,320
No real babysitter would
give us a gun to play with

727
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:09,292
or show us
private movies.

728
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:12,094
Her name's not even Anna.

729
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,597
- What?

730
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:26,475
- It's emelie.

731
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,548
- Who's emelie?

732
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,625
- You're a liar

733
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,963
and I know it.

734
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:50,333
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

735
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,874
Are you gonna shoot me?

736
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,316
Shoot me.

737
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,622
Shoot me!

738
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,427
- What you guys doing?

739
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,297
- Nothing.

740
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,477
- Give me the gun.

741
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,979
- Can't you just
leave us alone?

742
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:40,216
- I'm not gonna say it twice.

743
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,450
Christopher.

744
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,152
- Christopher!

745
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,654
- Hey. Hey.

746
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,622
- It's not a toy, Christopher!

747
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,258
- Hey, gimme the gun.

748
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:57,333
- No escape from chase hunter.

749
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,538
- Give mommy the gun.

750
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:19,522
- I knew it was you.

751
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,464
No!

752
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,598
Hey!
No, no, no, no.

753
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,734
Stop. Stop!

754
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:32,802
Stop.

755
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,704
Okay?

756
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:36,005
Inside.

757
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:37,273
Christopher?

758
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:38,341
Christopher!

759
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,546
I do not know who that is

760
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,348
but I do not want
to hear one word

761
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,183
about all the games
we've been playing.

762
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,218
Okay, now I've been nice
to you guys so far--

763
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,320
- you haven't been
nice at all.

764
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:57,093
- That is what happens
when you misbehave.

765
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:01,130
Now I want you to stay here
and be quiet until I come back,

766
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,566
do you understand?

767
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:04,633
Do you understand!

768
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,675
- Who are you?

769
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,578
- I'm the babysitter.

770
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,748
- Um, no you're not.

771
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,750
- Of course I am.
Who are you?

772
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,752
- I'm Maggie.

773
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,455
You know,
the Thompson's usual sitter?

774
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,557
See, I was supposed to
watch the kids tonight

775
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,592
but this guy I know that
goes to college asked

776
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:04,819
if I wanted to hang out

777
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,045
and I've been really
wanting to hang out with him

778
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:07,271
so I couldn't say no, right.

779
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,497
So I called my friend Anna to
see if she could babysit for me

780
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,849
and she said she would

781
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,200
and I've been texting to
see how it's been going

782
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,802
but Anna hasn't gotten
back to me which is weird

783
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,303
because she's like the most
promptest text backer ever--

784
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,138
- it's Maggie!

785
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,373
- Maggie...

786
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,508
- And the last
thing she posted

787
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:19,642
was that she was coming here

788
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,243
and since then she
hasn't posted anything

789
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,711
so I just thought I'd like
come by on my way back

790
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,563
to make sure everything's okay
but then like,

791
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:26,414
you're here and she's not
and I'm kinda like,

792
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,485
wtf is going on.

793
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:34,123
- Right, Maggie.

794
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:39,361
Yeah, so you're a
friend of Anna?

795
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:40,429
Yeah. She got sick.
Food poisoning.

796
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,633
And the Thompson's called me.

797
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,403
They're a family friend.

798
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,105
- Oh...

799
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,140
Well, do you think I could
just say hi for a second?

800
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:52,541
- No! No.

801
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,210
You know what,
they're asleep.

802
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,178
- Oh come on.
They never go down on time.

803
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,446
I won't tell Dan and Joyce,
i promise.

804
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,747
- No.

805
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,449
You know what?
Stay there.

806
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,517
I'll get them.

807
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:05,121
Sally, Jake, Christopher!

808
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,479
- Is that Maggie?

809
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:33,616
- Yeah.
And you like Maggie.

810
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:36,152
You wouldn't want
anything bad to happen to her,

811
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:38,254
right?

812
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,423
Okay, stand up.

813
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,526
Stand up.

814
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:45,728
Go.

815
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,932
We're friends, right?

816
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,000
Come on.
Come on.

817
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,411
- Hey, doodies!

818
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,181
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, Maggie.

819
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,516
- You guys having fun
with the new sitter?

820
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,952
- Yes.
- Yes.

821
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,856
- Uh, what have you
guys been doing?

822
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,325
- Playing.

823
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:21,830
- Pythons prefer live prey.

824
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,335
- Kids.

825
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:30,439
- Um...

826
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,776
Anna literally like,
just texted me.

827
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:35,344
She is sick.

828
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:38,614
And she called and cancelled.

829
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:39,748
Well...

830
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,317
I guess I better get going,
okay guys?

831
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:42,551
- No Maggie, don't go!

832
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,620
- Yeah.
Please stay and play with us!

833
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:46,355
- I have a life of my own,
ya know!

834
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:47,423
But I see you guys in like,
two days

835
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,357
so we'll play then, okay?

836
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,659
- No, wait!
- Hey--

837
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,494
- oh.

838
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,797
Hi!
What's this?

839
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,000
- I just...
Love you, that's all.

840
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,370
- Bye, Maggie!

841
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:03,405
- Okay.
Bye, guys.

842
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,473
- Get in.

843
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:17,813
Go over there.

844
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,416
Sit down.

845
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,786
No, no, no,
where I can see you.

846
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:15,804
Drink.

847
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:16,971
- Why is the juice dark blue?

848
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,374
- It's gonna give you
good dreams.

849
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,709
So drink.

850
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:23,779
- Ow!

851
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,648
Ow!
Ow, stop it!

852
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,917
Please.

853
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,155
- Good.

854
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,123
Come on.

855
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:34,990
Come on!

856
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,725
- Hey. Hey!

857
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,459
No, you already had...
Get outta here!

858
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,129
- What are you doing?
Don't you dare.

859
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:41,419
- Uh, uh, uh.

860
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,708
- Don't you dare.
- That's my bite!

861
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:43,997
- You've had more
than your half, sir.

862
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,835
- Your half is in your
stomach already.

863
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:49,638
- Wait. Wait.

864
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,142
- What's the matter?
- I never called Anna!

865
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,110
I never called Anna.
I told her I'd call her.

866
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,478
- Oh yeah,
it's bed time, too.

867
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,845
You better call her.
I'm worried about her

868
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,848
- will you get me--
- with those kids.

869
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,528
- Will you get the bill?

870
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:03,207
I'm going to just
give her a call.

871
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,886
- Kids are probably driving
her crazy, it's bedtime.

872
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:07,523
- Hey, you ready
to go to sleep?

873
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:11,193
- Where's Jake?
Where's Jake?

874
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,530
- He's upstairs in bed.

875
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,151
- Hello?

876
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,786
Hey, Joyce!

877
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,255
Yeah, they went out
like a light.

878
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:48,056
- Oh, I hope they didn't
give you too much trouble.

879
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,526
- No problem at all.
- Oh, that's good.

880
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,344
I'm proud of them.

881
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:54,161
- Oh, they're so good.
Well behaved.

882
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,265
- Thanks.
Did they need to eat anything?

883
00:58:56,267 --> 00:59:00,936
- Um... well, they did,
they ate some snacks.

884
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,237
- Oh good.

885
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,007
- Nothing too big.
- Okay.

886
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:07,042
- Well, it sounds like you
guys enjoyed your meal.

887
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,877
- Yes,
it was delicious.

888
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,546
I can't believe
I've never been here.

889
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:13,148
- It's a terrific place.
- Good.

890
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:15,617
- Great.

891
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:16,885
Well, that's good.

892
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,287
- I meant to ask you,

893
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,688
can you make sure you
leave the hall light on

894
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,256
for Christopher?

895
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,823
- Yeah, I will do,
i will do that,

896
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,726
but no worries at all.

897
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,762
- We're just getting
the bill right now

898
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,798
so we'll be home in
about twenty minutes.

899
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,933
- Okay.

900
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,302
Yeah. Sorry.
Wait, say that again?

901
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:34,903
- I don't know what
we'd do without you.

902
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,205
- You saved out night.
- Great.

903
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,641
- Absolutely.

904
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:44,012
Yeah.
That's great.

905
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:47,249
- Okay.
- - Okay, bye.

906
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,850
- Mom? Mom!?

907
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,286
Mom?

908
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:02,190
- Time to go, little cubbie.

909
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,975
- Howie!
Howie, thank gosh!

910
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,310
- Dude, check it out.

911
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,778
Fourth of July up in here!

912
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,280
- Howie, do you have
your cell phone?

913
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:01,850
- Hey, I thought we might
stick them in Becky's mom's--

914
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,719
- Howie, shut up!

915
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:06,455
There's something wrong
with the new sitter.

916
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:18,967
- We need more time.

917
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,813
- You're not listening,
Howie!

918
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,448
She hurt Maggie really bad.

919
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,818
And she's got this weird
obsession over Christopher.

920
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,954
She has my dad's gun, okay?

921
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:41,056
I think she's trying
to kill us!

922
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,058
- You gotta help--
- and you left...

923
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:48,063
Chris and Sally
alone with her?

924
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,808
- I don't think I should drive.
- I'm not driving.

925
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,910
- Can you drive?
No?

926
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:04,446
Lets see if there's a taxi.

927
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:07,516
Taxi!

928
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:14,389
Woo-hoo!
There you go.

929
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,002
- Ow.

930
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,139
- Get off me, Maggie!

931
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,120
Ow!

932
01:03:57,367 --> 01:04:01,102
- No, no.
No, no, no!

933
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,056
- You okay?
Are you okay?

934
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:36,458
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

935
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,126
- Oh my god.

936
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,395
- Oh my god...

937
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,364
- Dan, what are you doing?
- Stay in the car.

938
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:45,200
- Stay in the car.
- Dan, be careful!

939
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,267
- Dan!

940
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:37,719
- Fuck...

941
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,188
Fuck...

942
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,787
- Sal?

943
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,756
Sally?

944
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:18,226
Maggie?

945
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,400
- Oh.

946
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:27,669
Ah...

947
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,289
Maggie...

948
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,659
Maggie.

949
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:58,266
Maggie.

950
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,818
Wake up!

951
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,654
Maggie...

952
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:29,330
- I told you what
would happen if you misbehaved.

953
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,833
- Where's my sister.

954
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,302
- I have her, but
she's not the one I want.

955
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,771
Where is my little cubbie?

956
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,775
- He's not your cubbie!

957
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,378
He's not your fucking cubbie!

958
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:46,381
He's my brother!

959
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:55,623
- Do you want your sister
to end up like your friend?

960
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,594
Backyard.
Five minutes.

961
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:03,431
I'll trade you Sally
for Christopher.

962
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,308
- Is he dead?

963
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,544
- He died on impact.
- Oh my god.

964
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,845
- You know who he was?

965
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,814
- We still don't know.

966
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:21,382
The vehicle was
reported stolen

967
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,485
and he didn't have
any ID on him.

968
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,559
- Oh my,,,
oh god.

969
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,827
- He was alone.

970
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:35,597
- Thank god.
I wanna go home.

971
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,398
- I wanna go home.
- Officer?

972
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,300
- Do you know how much
longer you need us here?

973
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,269
We uh--
our kids are at home

974
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:43,972
and we told the babysitter we'd
be back fifteen minutes ago.

975
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:45,707
Can we...?

976
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,809
- Okay, let's get
you guys outta here.

977
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,745
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

978
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,602
- Jacob?

979
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,608
Jacob!

980
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:37,625
Christopher?!

981
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:15,530
- Dan, something is wrong.

982
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:18,166
Something's wrong.

983
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,900
She's not picking up and
our machine's not picking up.

984
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:22,804
- I'm sure she just
fell asleep.

985
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,710
- Yo!

986
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,604
- I don't...

987
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,088
I just have her home number
i don't her cell number.

988
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,757
- Car 82110?

989
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,359
- Go ahead.

990
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,994
- Report back
to Pearl and court.

991
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,930
- The accident site?
- - Affirmative.

992
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,065
- The body of a young
girl was found in the trunk.

993
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,735
- Jesus Christ,
did you hear that?

994
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,404
- ID says victim's name
is Anna Coleman of Amherst.

995
01:12:56,406 --> 01:13:00,007
We're sending a cruiser
to her family home now.

996
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:03,111
- That can't be.
That's our sitter?
- Anna Coleman is our sitter?

997
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:04,946
- 10-4, I'm on my way.
- That's our sitter!

998
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,681
- Officer, I'm sorry,
can you please hit the gas.

999
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:07,982
Hit the lights.
It's an emergency.

1000
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:10,151
We need to get home.
Go, go, go!

1001
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:03,971
- Jacob, get out of the car!

1002
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,072
Jacob!

1003
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,448
Jacob!

1004
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:48,249
- This is it, we're pulling
onto our street right now.

1005
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:51,619
- God damn it!

1006
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:54,689
Can we go faster,
please, sir?!

1007
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,023
- There's a car.
- Dan, there's--

1008
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,158
there's a car, man.
Hit the brakes!

1009
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,593
- Look out!
- Hit the brakes!

1010
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,067
- Jacob?!
- Dad.

1011
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,569
- Sally!

1012
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:10,638
Christopher?

1013
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,175
Sally! Sally!

1014
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:17,278
Sally!

1015
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,047
Dan!
