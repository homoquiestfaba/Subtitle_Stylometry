00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,120
Do you have a better way of
greeting someone at the door?

183
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:27,826
How about, "Hey Brody, come
on in, you want a beer?"

184
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,028
Hi Brody, come on in.
Do you want a beer?

185
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,097
No, I'm good.

186
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,699
You look terrified.

187
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,234
First time on Grindr?

188
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,269
No.

189
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,071
Maybe.

190
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,656
Yeah.

191
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,240
Ok, well, relax,
we're gonna have fun.

192
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,243
How about you, do
you want a beer?

193
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,045
Actually I'd love one.

194
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,346
Ok.

195
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,117
(BELCH)

196
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:59,057
Well, that's a
nice compliment.

197
00:10:59,059 --> 00:10:59,991
That was amazing.

198
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,693
I'm glad.

199
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,528
How did the client
meeting go today?

200
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,362
I hope you got all the, "I'm
thinking of you" texts I sent.

201
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,097
Yep.

202
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,699
All ten.

203
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,872
You seem a little,
tired tonight.

204
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,908
Why don't you just take
your shoes off, relax.

205
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,712
I'm just...

206
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,714
I'm trying to figure
out the best way to

207
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,749
talk to you
about something.

208
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,185
As long as it's not,
"let's see other people".

209
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,021
Uh.

210
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,756
You want to see
other people.

211
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm just thinking that
we're moving too fast.

212
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,028
We've been
dating a month.

213
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,997
I see you once a
week for dinner and sex,

214
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,966
and I do all the work
for both. How is that
possibly moving too fast?

215
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,885
I just want to pump
the brakes a bit.

216
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,803
Well, do you think you could
have pumped them on a day

217
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:50,475
I didn't spend cooking
an elaborate dinner and
planning erotic massages?

218
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,177
Wow.

219
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,349
Myles, one day,

220
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,921
you are going to make someone
the most amazing husband.

221
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,222
Just not you.

222
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,058
No.

223
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,965
I'm gonna leave.

224
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,899
Yeah.

225
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:32,016
(GRUNTING)

226
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,485
Oh Yeah.

227
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,121
Can I get you
that beer now?

228
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,789
You're a
quick study.

229
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,823
I like you.

230
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,325
Enough to see me again?

231
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,861
Enough to introduce
you to my friend.

232
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,329
Threesome?

233
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,531
I don't think I'm
ready for that, yet.

234
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,832
Sure you are.

235
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,439
Myles, say
hello to David.

236
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,273
Say Hi David.

237
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,274
Hi.

238
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,109
Hello David.

239
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,045
It's always a pleasure meeting
one of Brody's "hookups",

240
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,415
especially after I've
just been dumped.

241
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,550
What happened?

242
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,519
Like you have to ask?

243
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,021
You want me to come over?

244
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,657
That depends.

245
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,292
Do you like strawberries
infused with cognac hand
dipped in dark chocolate?

246
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,895
Strawberries and cognac?

247
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,096
Can I come?

248
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,264
You already did.

249
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,999
Twice.

250
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,066
I'll be right there.

251
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,946
Since when did you start
fucking Martha Stuart?

252
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,282
One does what one has
to, to get a man.

253
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,850
I've had a lot of men,

254
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:42,420
I have never injected a
strawberry with cognac before.

255
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,156
Well, not in the
literal sense.

256
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,828
It doesn't
matter anyway.

257
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,930
I'm done. I'm in
my mid-thirties.

258
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:55,567
Time to acknowledge the
fact that I'm destined
to be a gay spinster.

259
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,304
If the thought of dog hair
everywhere didn't disgust
me, I'd be a gay cliche.

260
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,206
Trust me.

261
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,107
You don't need a small
dog to be a gay cliche.

262
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,409
Thanks.

263
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,278
Either way, I'm
tired and done.

264
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,348
I'm sick of chasing
men only to have my
heart broken every time.

265
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,133
Ok, enough.

266
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,917
I'm taking you shopping. If
you're going to be single,

267
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,019
you need the
proper tools.

268
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,487
I'm afraid of
you right now.

269
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,256
You're smarter
than you look.

270
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,457
Come on.

271
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,328
*

272
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,398
If I know you, a kinky
evening of sex means
using your left hand

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,102
and your toy arsenal is
nothing more than a two
year old jar of lube.

274
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,105
Look being single requires
the proper equipment

275
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,909
and there's no better
place to get it than here!

276
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:38,910
Fleshjack.

277
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,612
Better than a real mouth.
Why?

278
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,550
Because it doesn't speak.

279
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,053
Dildo. No more
gambling with what's on
the other side of the zipper.

280
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,990
Nothing is worse than
unwrapping the whopper
only to find they

281
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,943
skimped on the pickle.

282
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,895
Now you can come home to
Jeff Stryker every night.

283
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,497
Mini projector.

284
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:04,569
Now, you can watch your favorite
pornos in HD above your head!

285
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,405
I can see you've done extensive
research on the subject.

286
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,274
Hey. I may not be
good at many things,

287
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,176
but the things I'm good
at, I'm an expert in.

288
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,344
Minty Fresh.

289
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,614
Here.

290
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,271
Richard.

291
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,188
Thank you very much,
enjoy sir.

292
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,095
I can't believe you
make me eat here.

293
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,647
Are you kidding me?

294
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,198
Everyone knows the best food
in LA comes from food trucks.

295
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,434
Yeah, so does E. Coli.

296
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,269
Hey, I got you something.

297
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,540
Its a sex toy.

298
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,443
If this goes where
I think it goes,

299
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,979
you and I are gonna have
a big problem, buddy.

300
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,297
It doesn't.

301
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,614
Trust me, you're
going to like this.

302
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,051
I went shopping with
Myles last night.

303
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,054
I was trying to cheer him
up, he just broke up with
his newest boyfriend.

304
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,188
Another one?

305
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,057
I feel so bad
for that guy.

306
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,525
Yeah, me too.

307
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,060
Myles is a bit much.

308
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,461
No, I meant Myles.

309
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,532
You feel bad for Myles.

310
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,401
Don't. If you want to
pity someone, try me.

311
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,071
Myles and I made a deal
ten years ago that if
we were still single

312
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,074
by the time we're
thirty-five, we'd be a couple.

313
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,626
That's ridiculous.

314
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,177
Myles is a successful,
smart lawyer.

315
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,144
He can do so much
better than you.

316
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,312
I know, right.

317
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,897
Wait, what?

318
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,481
I don't even know why
you're complaining. I
think it's a great idea.

319
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,217
You'd be lucky to have
a guy like Myles.

320
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,353
That is the last thing
in the world I need.

321
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,655
You're crazy, but
we both know that.

322
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,690
Seems like if you don't want
to be Myles next boyfriend,

323
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,660
you're going to have to do
something about it - quick.

00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,396
Myles turns thirty-five
in one month,

325

find Myles a boyfriend.

You ready for
boys night out?

331
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,586
Yeah, can I get
you a drink?

332
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:02,787
I trained you well.

333
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,355
Nope, I got it.

334
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:09,727
Hey, can we stop by my
place, I didn't have time
to go back to the station.

335
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,196
Sure, whatever
you need to do.

336
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,603
Ah. I waited all
day for that.

337
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,038
What are
you looking at?

338
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,607
I rarely see you
in uniform.

339
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,142
You like a
man in uniform?

340
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,077
Who doesn't?

341
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,430
What do you think?

342
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:30,782
I think you look less
like a real cop and more
like a male stripper.

343
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,720
No wonder you're so easily
able to catch the bad guys.

344
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,422
Oh really?

345
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,223
Male stripper.

We should get going.

Yeah, we should go.

00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,016

If you're worried about
not being gay enough,

358
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,259
I'd say you're good for the
next...year, maybe ten.

359
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,712
Two martini's so dirty

360
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,164
the health department will shut
your ass down for serving them.

361
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,632
What is is with
you and gogo bars?

362
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,368
Hey, now I have four of
my favorite things.

363
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,838
Booze, music, hot,
almost naked men.

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,772
That's three.

365
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,309
Awww.

366
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,844
You shouldn't snub your
nose at gogo bars.

367
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:11,816
They are an important tool in
the gay mans sexual arsenal.

368
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,218
Like candles and chocolate
dipped strawberries?

369
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,786
Yes and No.

370
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,756
Look, you need less
romance and more sex.

371
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,191
Ok, bear with me.

372
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,160
Define gogo boy.

373
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,861
A young.

374
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,630
Fit, attractive male.

375
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,899
Wearing next to nothing -

376
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,668
thrusting his engorged...

377
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,637
Let's just say he's
a sexy male dancer.

378
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,106
Yes, exactly, SEXY!

379
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,574
Men are visual animals. We see
a hot guy, we get turned on.

380
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,444
Gogo boys are just
eye candy here to

381
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:44,215
stimulate our adrenaline and
boost our testosterone.

382
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,052
Ok.

383
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,655
So, they're here to tease.
You can't have them, you can
just look and gently touch.

384
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,426
This is all fine,

385
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,428
but has nothing
to do with me.

386
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,665
That is where you
are wrong. It has
everything to do with you.

387
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,501
Guys want them, but
they go home with me?

388
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,503
Finally, yes!
You want a man,

389
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,672
these boys will
help you get one.

390
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,640
I want someone who
cares about me.

391
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,160
Not someone who
has sex with me

392
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,679
while thinking of some greased
up muscle twink in a g-string.

393
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,980
Sex is sex.

394
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,716
For you.

395
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,751
You need to relax, ok?

396
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,321
Look, see that
cutie over there?

397
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,289
He's serving up mouth
shots, go get him.

398
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,924
Along with possible meningitis.

399
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,859
I think I'll stick with
my cocktail, out of my

400
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,596
partially clean glass.

401
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,232
I'd rather not.

402
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,235
I know, but do it anyway.

403
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,336
Here you go.

404
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,010
Wow.

405
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,246
If I'm going to do it, I
might as well do it right.

406
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:58,656
(OFFICE SOUNDS. PHONES RINGING)

407
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,724
Got a minute?

408
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,660
No. I'm up to my
nose in briefs.

409
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,795
And not the good kind.

410
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,403
What is wrong with men?

411
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,038
Oh, at least its not a
complicated question.

412
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,507
Let me clear my calendar
for the next decade

413
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,594
and we can figure it out.

414
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:22,680
Do you have any idea what its
like to have an ovary full of
eggs screaming "fertilize me?"

415
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,616
It adds a whole new dimension
to the misery of being single.

416
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,551
No, and I don't want to either.

417
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,604
In fact, I'd rather
not discuss it.

418
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,656
Being gay does not excuse you
from having to deal with this.

419
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,625
I'm pretty sure it does.

420
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,029
Besides, I'm newly
single now too.

421
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,165
Aw.

422
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,300
Soon it will be time
for you and Brody to be
a couple, how sweet.

423
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,802
No! And when did I
tell you about that?

424
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,907
If I know Brody, he's probably
forgotten all about it.

425
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,459
Remind him.

426
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,010
And videotape his
expression when you do.

427
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,979
It'll be a good one.

428
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,348
I'm planning on Brody not
remembering our little plan.

429
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,517
Why? He's a great
catch, and so hot.

430
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,420
But he's not
relationship material.

431
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,022
Well, what about the two
of you just fooling around?

432
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,792
I cannot understand how your
best friend is a sexy cop

433
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,094
and you have
not hooked up yet.

434
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,395
Contrary to what you may
think, gay people don't all
just sleep with each other.

435
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:16,434
Really? I didn't get that
memo and neither did the
rest of West Hollywood.

436
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,440
Brody is my friend. You
don't sleep with your friends.

437
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,875
How is it that I've never
heard of any of these rules.

438
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,911
I swear you make them
up as you go along.

439
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,547
Well, Brody and I don't
see each other that way.

440
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,382
Don't tell me that
you're not his type.

441
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,384
Brody only has one type.

442
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,653
Facing down.

443
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,391
Ok, thanks.

444
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,459

Aw.

455
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,186
Great.

456
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:46,617
(FACETIME RINGING)

457
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,220
Hey Brody.

458
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,921
Someone's getting busy.

459
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:51,689
Huh?

460
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,191
Oh, wow, no.

461
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,061
Talk about
incriminating evidence.

462
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,780
I'm just cleaning up.

463
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:00,498
Everything is
covered in lube.

464
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,866
That a boy!

465
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:05,669
It's not what it looks like.
What do you want Brody?

466
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,938
I just called to tell you I
went south of the border

467
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,074
and I'm not talking about a
little road trip to Tijuana.

468
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:13,511
I just made it with a
smoking hot Latino "Papi."

469
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,880
Dude, I don't know what's
gotten into me lately.

470
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,581
Probably about nine inches.

471
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,616
Quick.

472
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,683
Nice.

473
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,221
Well, I was having a
nice night by myself.

474
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,956
I could tell.

475
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,476
Not that.

476
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:30,995
I cooked a terrific
dinner, read a good
book, played cards.

477
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,698
I was about to get into this
big, soft bed without some
strange guy next to me,

478
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,734
snoring and farting his
way through the night.

479
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,237
You sound miserable.

480
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,805
I am.

481
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:50,147
I'm going to find you
the perfect guy.

482
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:53,501
No, no.

483
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,854
Dude, I'm your best friend.
Who is more qualified than
me to find a guy for you?

484
00:25:56,856 --> 00:26:01,258
Your argument is compelling,
and as always, disconcerting.

485
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,726
Trust me.

486
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,962
I've met a lot of great
guys over the years.

487
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:08,098
If I wasn't a confirmed
bachelor, I would have
scooped one up myself.

488
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,268
But hey, my
loss is your gain.

489
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,304
I'm going to find you
a husband, buddy.

490
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:16,173
You better get buckle up, cause
we're going on a manhunt.

491
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,808
I'll brace for impact.

492
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,909
Bye.

493
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,714
Hi, I'm Myles.

494
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,982
It's really nice
to meet you.

495
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,117
Brody told me a
lot about you.

496
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,453
I'm Stu.

497
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,788
It's so funny you
picked this place. It's
my favorite coffee shop...

498
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,257
and you bought
me an eclair,

499
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,025
I love these.

500
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,595
Here's a double
decaf soy latte, too.

501
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:40,097
I like to do my research
before I meet someone.

502
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,267
When you say "you like to
do your research before
you meet someone,"

503
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,935
What exactly do you
mean by that?

504
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,838
I like to know
who I'm meeting.

505
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,740
I just do a standard
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn
search before I meet them.

506
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,142
You know, see
if we're compatible.

507
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,678
Find out what you're into.

508
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,249
So, you do this kind
of investigation with
every guy you go out with?

509
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,352
It helps me to come up with
some things to talk about.

510
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,354
There's nothing
worse than meeting a
guy for the first time

511
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:06,790
and having nothing
to talk about.

512
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,660
My research also helps me
do things like this...

513
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,733
It's your
favorite flower.

514
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,635
I also know you played
lacrosse in high school.

515
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,971
You love to go camping
and you have a French
Bulldog named Doug.

516
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,274
Could you excuse
me for one moment?

517
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,143
I need to use
the restroom.

518
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,112
Do you want me to
order for you?

519
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,748
Vanilla latte with
extra foam, extra hot.

520
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,116
Right?

521
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,318
Oh wow. My sister
just texted.

522
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
She swallowed
a rusty nail.

523
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,789
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to take her to the hospital.

524
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,993
Call me.

526
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,004
What's up?

527
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,673
Ok, I officially give up.

528
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,776
No more men.

529
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,878
Ok, let's start with the mildly
over-dramatic and work our way
back to the partially sane.

530
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,048
I'm like kryptonite
to my Superman.

531
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,316
I'll never find
someone to love me.

532
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,952
You're probably just coming
on too strong, buddy.

533
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,990
You just need to relax,
get to know someone,
have a little fun.

534
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,092
So it is me?

535
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,395
It's not you.

536
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,697
Look, I'm just setting you
up with the wrong guys,
give me one more chance.

537
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,921
No.

538
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:22,144
I'm heading straight
to the kennel.

539
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,367
I'm going to pick out
a little white dog

540
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,936
and spend the rest
of my days alone.

541
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,839
Come on, one more chance.
One more date, I promise.

542
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,993
Ok.

543
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,111
I'll consider one more
date, under one condition.

544
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,314
It's non-negotiable.

545
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,417
What are your terms, counselor?

546
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,852
Will you come with?

547
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,420
Oh God.

548
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,806
I won't do this alone.

549
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,191
You pick out a date for me, and
I'll pick out someone for you.

550
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,361
If you're there then
you'll get to witness the
disaster first hand.

551
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:54,431
It's like having
box seats at a

552
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,650
NASCAR event
where you know

553
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,868
there's going to be a multi-car
pile up before it's all over.

554
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,137
Well as long as
you're going into

555
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,272
it with such
a positive attitude.

556
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,175
Positive that I'm going
to end up alone again at
the end of the evening.

557
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,376
Bye.

558
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,754
I hope you
like this place.

559
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,355
They have the best
stuffed mushrooms.

560
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,890
I love stuffed
mushrooms.

561
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,793
I had them the last
time I was...

562
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,428
when my date
decided to ditch me.

563
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,898
Oh, sorry.

564
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,517
Well,

565
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,135
Hopefully, tonight will
be better for you.

566
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,836
Here's to not being
dumped tonight.

567
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:33,904
Wow, sorry.

568
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,839
Myles can be a tad
bit depressing.

569
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,375
Hence having the waiter
remove all the sharp
objects from the table.

570
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,777
You're an asshole.

571
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,081
You don't recognize
me, do you?

572
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,351
Grindr.

573
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,789
I tried to message you
a couple times, but...

574
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,490
you never responded.

575
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,893
I'm sorry, I'm not really
good with technology.

576
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:58,228
I'm just a
simple farm boy.

577
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,864
Oh yeah? Where
are you from?

578
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,499
New York.

579
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,135
How was the harvest in
Manhattan this season?

580
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,907
I'm originally from Colombia.

581
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,341
My parents are farmers.

582
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,443
Organic coffee trade.

583
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,913
There's no such thing
as organic coffee.

584
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,849
I hear it's just a
marketing ploy to drive
up the cost of beans.

585
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,619
My family's in the
coffee business, too.

586
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,388
We sell espresso machines and
roasted beans...mostly organic.

587
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,257
What's your family name?

588
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,258
Fiori.

589
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,227
I've heard that name before.

590
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,129
I think my family supplies
your coffee beans.

591
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:32,996
Get out of here.

592
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,031
I'm serious.

593
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,599
I'm a total coffee whore.

594
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,869
A double decaf latte, extra
soy, extra foam, extra hot.

595
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:42,840
You don't want to know
what I'd do for one of those
before work in the morning.

596
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,692
And you said it
was just a little

597
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,543
vanilla froth on the corner
of your mouth the other day.

598
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:50,113
Hey, what goes on between my
barista and I is my business.

599
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,382
Do you know Vincent?

600
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,119
Vincent Fiori. He's
only my brother!

601
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,888
Are you serious?

602
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,555
Yes.

603
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,357
What an awesome guy.

604
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,158
Yeah, Vincent's been
trying to get me to travel
with him for years.

605
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,261
I think he's even told
me about your farm.

606
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,062
No way.

607
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:07,014
Yes.

608
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,965
We have one thousand
acres of the lushest
farmland you've ever seen.

609
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,968
So how about them Dodgers?

610
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,254
I don't follow sports.

611
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,539
Sports are what straight guys
talk about when they have
nothing better to say, come on!

612
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,242
Yeah, right.

613
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,944
I'm starting to regret having
the waiter remove those sharp
objects from the table.

614
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:24,047
Yeah, I know. Give me a
minute and I'll forge a
shiv out of a breadstick.

615
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,616
Do you think they'll
notice if we left?

616
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:28,151
I've always wanted to
be the guy that leaves.

617
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:31,188
Myles. That is a horrible
thing to do to your date.

618
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,155
I know, you're right.

619
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,074
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,992
I didn't say we shouldn't
do it. I just said it was a
horrible thing to do.

621
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:38,095
Which makes it
so much fun!

622
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,464
Excuse me.

623
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,899
I'm going to go too.

624
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,443
"Fiori."

625
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,545
Well that went
predictably bad.

626
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,218
I'll give you that much.
Tonight needs to end
with a stiff drink.

627
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,386
Scotch?

628
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,156
No, I got a big
meeting tomorrow.

629
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,925
Come on, hang out, chill.
You don't have to rush
home to Jeff Stryker.

630
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,326
Jeff Stryker?

631
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,597
Oh, the dildo?

632
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:16,700
Here.

633
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,238
You know I can send
my cleaning lady
over if you want.

634
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,308
She's only seventy-five
bucks a visit. She'll
bring her own napalm.

635
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,143
Hey, I made a path
to the couch.

636
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,478
That counts for
something, right?

637
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,213
You need someone to
take care of you.

638
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,283
No, I need to hire a maid.

639
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,085
Everyone needs
someone. Even you.

640
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,204
What are you afraid of?

641
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,322
Of being nagged to
death about being single.

642
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,625
Oh, we need to
get you a man.

643
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,293
Give me your phone.

644
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,166
Alright, take your shirt off.

645
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,067
What?

646
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,386
Take your shirt off.

647
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,704
No. You're not putting
half naked pictures of
me up on the internet.

648
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,639
No way.

649
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,308
It's not the internet.

650
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,976
It's an app and
everyone does it.

651
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,979
Look, you need to try something
different for a change.

652
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,580
No.

653
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,282
How do you do it?

654
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:09,152
Very well and often
on all fours.

655
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,689
Trust me, it is better
than being alone.

656
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,158
I'm really not
comfortable with this.

657
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,195
It's all about advertising.
If you want to catch a fish,

658
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,097
you've got to show
him your worm.

659
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,266
No one is
seeing my "worm",

660
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,602
and the shirt stays on.
It's non-negotiable.

661
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,536
Fine.

662
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,071
Leave the shirt on.

663
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,639
Now smile and say,

664
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,677
"I'm a bad little boy who's
looking for a sexy daddy."

665
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,412
"Cheese"

666
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,549
"Cheese" will do.

667
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,389
Look at that!

668
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,189
Oh my god.

669
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,057
It's beautiful.

670
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,559
No its not.

671
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,060
It's awful, delete it.

672
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,528
No way.

673
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,099
I've got to delete this.

674
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,570
(BEEP)

675
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,073
Wow, ok.

676
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,608
(BEEP)

677
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,243
Wow.

678
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,310
(BEEP)

679
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,346
Now?

680
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:17,821
*

681
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,640
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

682
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,314
Cute.

683
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:48,518
I like the "Abercrombie meets

684
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,155
Log-Cabin-Republic can"
thing you've got going on.

685
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,491
I have to tell you I've never
done this kind of thing before.

686
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,460
And what kind of thing is that?

687
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,695
Meet up with a guy I don't know
in the middle of the night.

688
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,130
And what do you
think so far?

689
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,099
I'm nervous.

690
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,434
How adorable. You
want to come in?

691
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,104
You're not going to
kill me, are you?

692
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,172
Do you really think that someone
who is planning on killing you,

693
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:13,143
is going to answer that
question with a yes?

694
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,712
Feel like taking
your chances?

695
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:19,583
I wasn't planning on
revealing I was this
neurotic until much later.

696
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,219
The cat's out of the bag now.

697
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,454
Offer still stands.

698
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,379
Can I get you a drink?

699
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,348
I've got whiskey, beer, vodka.

700
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,782
I'm fine.

701
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,384
Hit?

702
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,520
No, I'm good.

703
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,621
You mind?

704
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,855
No.

705
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,395
Are you sure?

706
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,197
No, I'm fine.

707
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,435
So what happens now?

708
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,939
Whatever you want.

709
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,584
I don't bite...
very hard at first.

710
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,885
Sure I can't
change your mind

711
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,453
about that drink?

712
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,357
Make it a double.

713
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:50,507
(FACETIME RINGING)

714
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,575
What's up, buddy?

715
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,911
Hey, I took your advice.

716
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,246
Where are you?

717
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,382
I'm at this seriously
hot guy's house.

718
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,785
Don't even say you did it,
I will not believe you.

719
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,354
This is, so hot.

720
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,422
Where are you?

721
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,823
His name is Hunter.

722
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,359
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

723
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,995
Shh. Here he comes. I gotta
go; I'll call you later.

724
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,434
Hey, wait...

725
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,401
Was that your backup plan?

726
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,303
Oh, no it's just my buddy.

727
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:23,506
He always calls me when
he meets a hot guy so...

728
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,944
I just called him.

729
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:28,712
(PHONE RINGING)

730
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,680
I'm flattered.

731
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,015
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,283
You can get it if you want.

733
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:39,322
One second.

734
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,261
What do you want?

735
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,428
What are you doing?

736
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,863
I'm taking your advice.

737
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,365
My advice?

738
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,300
Yeah, meet people and have fun.

739
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,585
Look, I gotta go.

740
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:52,869
I don't want to be rude.
I'll call you later.

741
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:53,970
Hey wait.

742
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,538
No, I'll call you later.

743
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,846
That was ridiculous I know.

744
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,648
Now I'm embarrassed.

745
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,582
No.

746
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,350
Don't worry, it was sweet.

747
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,056
Well if there's no one
else you'd like to
ring up at midnight,

748
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,659
are you ready to get
to know each other?

749
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,497
Do you mind if we just
hang out tonight?

750
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,865
Oh.

751
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:25,402
Okay - no worries.

752
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,804
I'm down with whatever.

753
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,539
You sure?

754
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,807
Yeah, that's fine.

755
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,978
I just assumed that
was what you wanted.

756
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,815
I'm not really like that.

757
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,916
Me neither.

758
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,352
I'm really just a simple,

759
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:45,355
romantic homebody.

760
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:49,359
I'm good with just
hanging out tonight.

761
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,695
That's very cool of you.

762
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,764
You just seem like a
really great guy.

763
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,366
I do.

764
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:06,609
You know...if you want to put
your hand on my leg again, I
won't freak out, I promise.

How Sweet.

770
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,096
Well that was certainly hot.

771
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,865
I needed that.

772
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,000
Apparently several times.

773
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,568
Listen, I need to go,

774
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,904
I have class.

775
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:08,972
Oh.

776
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,440
What are you studying?

777
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,742
It's an aerobics class.

778
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,676
Oh.

779
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:14,644
Is it tough?

780
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,647
It's actually quite fun.

781
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,649
No. I mean getting back
to the 1980's when they
actually taught aerobics.

782
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,652
It's coming back,
I'll have you know.

783
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,021
I'll have to remember to
tell my leg warmers that.

784
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,690
What are leg warmers?

785
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,559
You're kidding, right?

786
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,829
No, and unfortunately I
don't have time to find out.

787
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,465
I need to leave,

788
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,766
I have to be
there at eleven.

00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,568

It's eleven?!

(PHONE RINGING)

791
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,180
Hey, what happened to
you? You never called
me back last night.

792
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,081
It's Diane.

793
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,083
Brody, do you know
where Myles is?

794
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,486
Well did you try him at home?

795
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:58,955
It's a wonder you're
not a detective yet.

796
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,058
Uh. I don't know. I haven't
seen him since last night.

797
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,895
Well, he had a client
meeting on the books at
9:30 and he missed it.

798
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:10,233
Ok. Let me go check in
on him. I'll get back
to you in ten minutes.

799
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,668
Thank you.

800
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,171
Myles. Are you in there?

801
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,573
Don't you have a key?

802
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,477
Why would I need a key, huh?

803
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:22,979
Is there a problem officers?

No sir. We're just
responding to a call.

805

Do you know Myles?

806
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,054
I do. Quiet fella, but nice.
Always a hello in the hallway.

807
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:33,223
Raised right.

808
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,225
Smells good too.

809
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,227
What did he do?

810
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,228
He didn't do anything. We're
just checking in on him.

811
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:40,530
Did you happen to
see him last night?

812
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,182
Nope.

813
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:43,833
Don't think he came home or
I would have heard him.

814
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,201
I hear everything.

815
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,538
Even with this bad
ear, I catch it all.

816
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,807
Let me know if you
need my help.

817
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,610
I'm a vigilante you know.

818
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,746
I think we've got it covered.
But, thank you for your help.

Myles you here?

823
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,573
Myles?

824
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,109
Myles?

825
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:33,182
Wow.

826
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,884
Who is his roommate, Mr. Clean?

827
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,840
A carafe?

828
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:41,925
Silver shaker? Who does he
entertain here? James Bond?

829
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,568
When blockbuster runs out of
DVD's to rent, do they come here
and borrow a few from Myles?

830
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,104
Ok. Enough with the running
commentary, can you just see if
you can find something please.

831
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,139
Like what, dust?

832
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:57,807
Good luck with that.

833
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:02,845
Come on.

834
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,150
He never came home last night.

835
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,185
I'm sure he's fine.

836
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,219
Yeah. Famous last words
before they find his
body in a dumpster.

837
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:14,324
Look, we need to put an APB
out and get more eyes out
there looking for him now.

838
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:18,261
Before we sound the alarm,
let's stop by his office
and see what we can find.

839
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,762
Relax.

840
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,797
It'll be fine.

841
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:22,131
Just one quick stop, okay?

842
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,333
Ok.

843
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,146
There you are!

844
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,498
Thanks for covering...

845
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:39,849
Wait a second. Why do
you look like this?

846
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,184
Is this a walk of shame?

847
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,419
I'm not ashamed of anything.

848
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,653
Well, you obviously
didn't do it right.

849
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,655
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

850
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:46,990
Ok.

851
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,859
I want to hear everything,
and it better be filthy.

852
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,828
Phone numbers,
names, descriptions.

853
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,296
Is video asking too much?

854
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,832
A gentleman never
kisses and tells.

855
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,234
A gentleman who doesn't tell
is asking for a beating.

856
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,637
Ok. But only because I'm
afraid of you right now.

857
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,639
Wait, hold that thought.

858
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:05,942
Before you start, I have
to call Brody and have him
call off the SWAT team

859
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,044
he's going to
send after you.

860
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,880
(PHONE RINGING)

861
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,415
I was just calling you.

862
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,317
See? I told you
he was fine.

863
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,386
Has he been here
the whole time?

864
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:19,022
He just got here. Hence
me trying to call you.

865
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,391
Hey, I'm standing
right here.

866
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:24,827
Diane called, said you
didn't come into work.
She made us all nervous.

867
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,296
I just came in a little
late. You really didn't
have to call Brody.

868
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,433
Don't blame me, it's my
maternal instincts -
I'm a slave to them.

869
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:35,371
Suddenly this day has just
taken a turn for the better.

870
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,775
Hello, my name is Diane.

871
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:40,877
I hope you enjoy the
softer of the two sexes.

872
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,313
Hi. I'm officer
Garcia...and I do.

873
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,151
Where were you?

874
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,352
I thought something happened.

875
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,120
Something did.

876
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,056
He was just about to tell
me all the sordid details.

877
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,323
I'm dying to hear them.

878
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:56,392
I have a feeling that
most of them are filthy.

879
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,762
Well, I can't right
now. I've got a ton
of work to catch up on.

880
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,264
So if you'd excuse me.

881
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,967
Are you serious?
Is he serious?

882
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,170
Look, could you
give us a minute?

883
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,705
You take all the
time you need.

884
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,740
You. Come with me.

885
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,145
Ok. What were you doing?

886
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,846
What were you thinking, going
to some strangers house

887
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:17,847
in the middle of the
night for a hook up?

888
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,916
It was your idea.

889
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,984
I'm trying new things.
Plus, you do it all the time.

890
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,419
I'm different than you.

891
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,921
How?

892
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,089
I'm a cop.

893
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,256
I can defend myself,
unlike you...

894
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,225
Oh please.

895
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,226
Myles.

896
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,512
I know guys,

897
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,797
some of them are real creeps. I
see what people are capable of.

898
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:35,998
I appreciate your concern.

899
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,966
Really, I do.

900
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,401
But I can take care of myself,

901
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,069
thank you.

902
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,672
Really?

903
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,274
Like the time those girls
scouts talked you into buying
a dozen boxes of cookies?

904
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,527
That wasn't my fault.

905
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:49,779
There were four of them
and only one of me.

906
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,215
So do you have a first
name, Officer Garcia?

907
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:55,218
It's Richard.

908
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,887
As in...?

909
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,156
Yes, Richard.

910
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,958
Uh huh.

911
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,494
I can see that you're
packing a lot of equipment.

912
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:09,265
Well, we're outfitted
with the proper gear to
handle any situation.

913
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,033
I can see that.

914
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,470
Look, I've got to get to work.

915
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,905
Can we fight about this later?

916
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:19,375
Maybe, if I'm
not too busy... dad.

917
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:25,214
So what does a girl have
to do to get her hands
on your nightstick?

918
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,482
Well, it's actually bigger
than it looks.

919
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:27,517
If you...

920
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,986
Let's go.

921
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:31,954
It's nice meeting you.

922
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,122
You too.

923
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,359
(mouthing) Oh My God!

924
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,262
So, what's the
deal with Diane?

925
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,230
I know.

926
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,197
I'm sorry you got
stuck with her.

927
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,399
She is a psycho.

928
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:47,203
I felt like a piece of meat for
her to chew on and spit out.

929
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:48,938
How awesome is that?

930
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,306
Wait.

931
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,174
What?

932
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,208
"Muy Caliente"

933
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,109
Diane?

934
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,011
As in, you and Diane?

935
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,045
No, No, No.

936
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,680
That is a bad idea.

937
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,314
The two of you
could not be more...

938
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,917
different.

939
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,518
Friction is what makes
the heat, my friend.

940
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,053
Besides, I'm packing...

941
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,389
and I carry a gun.

942
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:10,326
Let's leave the bad
sexual puns to me.

943
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,963
So, what happened with Myles?

944
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:17,366
He went home with
some guy last night.

945
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,467
That's great.

946
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,002
Your plan worked.

947
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,003
Yeah.

948
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,438
I guess it did, right?

949
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,173
You should be happy;
you're off the hook.

950
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,375
Beers on me. You
pick the place.

951
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,610
Deal.

952
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,950
*

953
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,885
He clearly doesn't
know I carry a gun.

954
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:42,091
Great. Now he's going to
like me that much more!

955
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:44,160
I have gone to plenty of
titty bars with you.

956
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,561
You can get your
gogo on with me.

957
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,930
In that case, I need
another drink.

958
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:51,200
Here, oh...

959
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,878
Hey! What the hell?

960
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:05,915
I'm sorry.

961
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:08,985
You just caught
me off guard.

962
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,454
I was going to warn
you about that.

963
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,006
No you weren't.

964
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:14,557
They're called mouth
shots for a reason.

965
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,192
What the hell other kind
of shots are there?

966
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,161
Don't answer that.

967
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,563
Alright, I gotta run.

968
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,349
Where are you going?

969
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,134
I told Diane I'd meet up with
her after she got off work.

970
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,970
Don't forget your handcuffs.

971
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,977
*

972
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:41,017
(PHONE BUZZING)

973
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:06,275
Someone's having WWF Smackdown,
screaming until your neighbors
bang on the wall-style sex.

974
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,110
It shows?

975
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,713
I'm talking about myself
and my spicy Latino lover.

976
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:12,615
You and Richard?

977
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,418
It's kind of like a spin class-

978
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,220
hot and sweaty, but with
handcuffs, a nightstick
and... pepper spray.

979
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:21,290
Ok, pepper spray is too much.

980
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,660
How are you and Hunter doing?

981
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:28,029
Judging by the recent playlist
of eighties love songs, I'd
say it's going pretty well.

982
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,000
Awww.

983
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,969
You really are an Easy Bake
Oven away from being a twelve
year old girl, aren't you?

984
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,671
Bye love.

985
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,151
You ok partner?

986
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,686
I took the new recruits
out last night,

987
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:51,754
to O'Malley's.

988
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:53,522
I don't know which is worse.

989
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,658
The gay bars or the Irish ones.

990
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,494
I guess it depends on
what you're looking for at the
end of the rainbow.

991
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,297
At this point I would settle
for a well hung Leprechaun.

992
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,299
That's why I'm glad
I'm dating again.

993
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,633
I'm in bed by 10 pm.

994
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,269
If I'm ever in bed by ten,

995
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,005
put a bullet in me.

996
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,740
I'm telling you, these past
two weeks have been great

997
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:13,309
and the sex with
Diane is amazing.

998
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,378
Which reminds me, I need
some more pepper spray.

999
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,750
I'm not going to ask,
besides, the image of Diane
having sex is not something

1000
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:22,118
I want stuck in
my head all day.

1001
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,718
Really?

1002
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,154
Because I do.

1003
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,723
Speaking of which, it's
been two weeks for Myles
and his boyfriend.

1004
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:31,127
I know because I'm
patiently waiting for him
to get dumped again.

1005
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,163
That's the kind of
postive, healthy support
a best friend deserves.

1006
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:39,168
Hey, I'm just waiting in the
wings like I always do for when
he gets his heart broken again.

1007
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,036
Face it.

1008
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:41,670
You miss him.

1009
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,407
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1010
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,375
If you say so,
but I do know this:

1011
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,444
if he were my friend
and I missed him,

1012
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,712
I'd grab a couple of beers,

1013
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,247
get some Chinese food

1014
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,149
and go over to his
place after work.

1015
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:57,720
Well, you're not me and I
don't need your advice.

1016
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,094
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1017
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,563
Come in.

1018
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,597
Oh hey.

1019
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,833
Brody.

1020
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,068
I thought it would be nice if
I surprised you with dinner.

1021
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,237
That's actually a
really nice surprise,

1022
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,924
but I already have plans.

1023
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:22,610
I can see you have plans.
Are you having Liberace over
for dinner? What is this?

1024
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,681
It's Hunter's first time
coming over tonight.

1025
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:29,351
I wanted to do
something special.

1026
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:33,122
Well, we can do
something another night.

1027
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:35,524
You know you don't have to go.

1028
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,193
You could join us if you want.

1029
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,795
Don't be ridiculous.

1030
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,396
You know I don't do threesomes.

1031
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,764
Since when?

1032
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,436
It's too much, isn't it.

1033
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,538
What?

1034
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,639
No it's ridiculous
and over-the-top,

1035
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:55,244
but it's you and that's what
I think is so nice about it.

1036
00:51:55,246 --> 00:52:01,250
Other guys may find it
terrifying, but I
think it's wonderful.

1037
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:02,585
You like that about me?

1038
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:04,220
What that you're a psycho?

1039
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:07,623
Yes, it makes me
feel more normal.

1040
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:14,330
Look finish getting ready and
we'll do something tomorrow.

1041
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,333
Happy hour?

1042
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:18,400
See you tomorrow.

1043
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,802
Later!

Hello Stone.

1046
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,374
I'll see you in five minutes.

Stone.

1049
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,541
Come on in, have a drink.

1050
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,243
I can see you've
done this before.

1051
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:36,445
Maybe once or twice.

1052
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,847
So, how do you want to do this?

1053
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:39,848
Quickly.

1054
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,517
I have dinner in an hour.

1055
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,452
I'm fine with
being an appetizer.

1056
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:48,357
Just so you know, you're
going to be late for dessert.

1057
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:57,700
Fine by me.

(PHONE BUZZING)

1059
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,024
Ignore it.

1060
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:06,608
It's probably my date tonight.
He's obsessive compulsive.

1061
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:07,643
How annoying.

1062
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,744
I know, right?

1063
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:15,417
I'm sorry, I can't.
Just get it.

1064
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,553
I'll send it to voicemail.

1065
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:24,994
Oh!! Please tell me your
name is not Hunter.

1066
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:28,330
No, of course it's not.

1067
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:29,898
Thank god.

1068
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,333
Hunter's my hook-up name,

1069
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,668
like "Stone".

1070
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,470
Oh, Fuck me!

1071
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,305
Sure, if you want
me to be on top.

1072
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,442
No. As in God-damn it.

1073
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,877
What's the problem?

1074
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:45,314
Oh Man, I really wanted you to
turn out to be a good guy.

1075
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,049
I am a good guy.

1076
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,719
Well, maybe not marriage
material, but...

1077
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:53,022
I gotta go.

1078
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,792
Dude, chill out!

1079
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,494
This is not a big deal.

1080
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,746
Actually it is.

1081
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:02,997
Myles is my best friend and
he's going to freak out

1082
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,601
when he finds out that I
hooked up with his boyfriend.

1083
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,635
Boyfriend?

1084
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,504
We're not boyfriends.

1085
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,339
Myles is a nice guy
and a decent lay,

1086
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,474
but that's about where it ends.

1087
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,543
Don't make me knock you out.

1088
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,578
Hey, you're in my
house, remember?

1089
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,513
Ok, look.

1090
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:18,681
This is how this is going to go.

1091
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:21,016
You go have dinner
with Myles and

1092
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:22,651
you don't say anything
about this.

1093
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,853
This never happened.

1094
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,455
You know what, I really
think you should leave.

1095
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:27,823
I'm serious, now!

1096
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,809
I'm not done here.

1097
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,794
Yeah you are, and if you don't
leave I'll call the cops.

1098
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:34,430
I'm a cop.

1099
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:36,477
Yeah.

1100
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:38,523
Well if that's the case,

1101
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:40,569
then I'll just call Myles and
tell him I hooked up with his
best friend...the cop.

1102
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,439
Ok, calm down.

1103
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,107
I'll go, but I need
you to promise

1104
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,543
that you're not going to be
an asshole to Myles, ok?

1105
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:53,015
Just go have dinner with him,
don't say anything about this.
I am asking you nicely.

1106
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,383
See?

1107
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:55,818
Now you're being a good boy.

1108
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,786
Just so you know,
I'll do what I want.

1109
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:58,987
And I'll start with
throwing you out.

1110
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,823
Got it?

1111
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:01,890
I got it.

1112
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:03,475
Good.

1113
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:05,059
I'm glad we're on
the same page again.

1114
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,428
Now leave!

1115
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:09,832
Asshole.

1116
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:10,833
Asshole.

1117

1120
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,165
Hey Myles.

1121
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:21,637
Hunter broke up with me.

1122
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:22,604
Awe.

1123
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,006
I'm so sorry, Myles.

1124
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:29,945
Could you come over?

1125
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,480
Death by chocolate?

1126
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,787
Death by homemade tiramisu.

1127
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,122
I'll be right there.

1128
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,797
One day, you are
going to find a guy

1129
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,233
who see's what a
great catch you are.

1130
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:54,002
You are going to make
someone the best husband.

1131
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,973
What about you?

1132
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,108
I am not a catch.

1133
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,076
Well that's not true.

1134
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,811
Yes, it is.

1135
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,081
Look, I'm not like you.

1136
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,250
Anybody who would pass up an

1137
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:10,919
amazing evening like this,

1138
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:16,658
with you, is a fool.

1139
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,595
Well, I'm obviously
doing something wrong.

1140
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,196
You have lousy taste in men.

1141
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,549
Take Hunter...

1142
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,901
- Let's not talk about him.
- I think we should...
- I really don't want to.

1143
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,503
Let me finish.

1144
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:37,646
Anybody who would break up
with you in a text is a creep
and not worth your time.

1145
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:41,950
You think I don't know that?
I didn't even text him back.

1146
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:46,288
I'm sick of being
mistreated by asshole guys
who don't appreciate me.

1147
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,658
Good for you Myles.

1148
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,996
Now, can we just move on?

1149
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:56,131
Let's just enjoy the fact that
we're hanging out together.

1150
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,567
Yes.

1151
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,002
Let's make tonight about this
amazing tiramisu that you made.

1152
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,071
- And us.
- And us.

1153
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:18,854
So, run this by me one more
time. Why didn't you tell him
what happened the other night?

1154
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:21,557
I just couldn't.

1155
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,259
If you knew Myles and how upset
it would make him, trust me, you
wouldn't have told him either.

1156
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,862
Actually, yes, I would have.

1157
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:29,064
Myles can't handle
these things.

1158
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,567
He's a grown man.

1159
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,069
Yeah, on the outside maybe but
on the inside he's all...

1160
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,771
Hello Kitty.

1161
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,172
He's never going to find out.

1162
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,691
That's not how it works.

1163
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:42,209
Trust me, they always find
out. And even if they don't,

1164
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,535
you'll always think in
the back of your head

1165
00:59:44,536 --> 00:59:46,859
that they know something, but
just aren't saying anything.

1166
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,183
Does someone have a little
baggage from a past relationship
they want to talk about?

1167
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,986
Let's just say, I had
to learn the hard way.

1168
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:55,057
Fine, I'll talk
to him tonight.

1169
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:58,293
-Ok?
- Alright.

1170
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:05,133
*

1171
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,671
How you doing?

1172
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:12,207
I liked him,
he was a great guy.

1173
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,176
He wasn't that great.

1174
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:17,429
Hi Brody... Martini?

1175
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,681
No thanks, I'm
probably just going to
get it thrown in my face.

1176
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:23,352
What did you do?

1177
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:26,021
Can I just start off by saying
that it was not my fault.

1178
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:29,858
That is the worst way
to start a conversation.
That's like saying,

1179
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,660
"I know this looks bad", or,

1180
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,695
"This is just going to
hurt a little bit."

1181
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,932
I can tell already,
this is not going to end well.

1182
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,968
I've known you
for over ten years.

1183
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,003
Nothing you say is
going to bother me
or surprise me anymore.

1184
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,038
So just tell me.

1185
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,775
I ran Hunter's ID
down at the station.

1186
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:50,312
His real name is Steven
Adams. He's from Nebraska.

1187
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,981
Well, I know where he's
from. I didn't know his
name wasn't Hunter.

1188
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,951
Yeah and it's
not Stone either.
That's my point.

1189
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,686
What's the point?
And who is Stone?

1190
01:00:57,688 --> 01:01:00,389
Exactly! Neither of
us knew his real name.

1191
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:02,157
Just tell me what happened.

1192
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:06,228
After I left your place
the other night,

1193
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,298
I went on Grindr
to meet someone.

1194
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:14,970
-You hooked up with Hunter?
-I didn't know it was him!

1195
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:17,906
He said his name was
Stone. I mean, who uses
that name anyway.

1196
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,908
He texted me on Grindr,
I went over there.

1197
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,845
I did not know what I
was doing was wrong. I
would never do that to you.

1198
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,580
You suck.

1199
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,314
How was I supposed to
know? It's not like you
introduced me to the guy.

1200
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,568
You're the one that
ruined this for me.

1201
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:31,820
I met a great guy and you just
couldn't stand it, could you?

1202
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:34,122
He is not a great guy,
believe me.

1203
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,191
Certainly not the Prince
Charming you think he is.

1204
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,859
Trust me, Hunter is a creep.

1205
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,795
Trust you?

1206
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:45,801
Think about it Myles. It's
always the same with you.
You bring this on yourself.

1207
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:50,338
You keep thinking that one
guy is going to be exactly
what you need to be happy.

1208
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,408
It is not the case,
never will be.

1209
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:00,015
Well, sadly that's
true isn't it?

1210
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,050
You're right, things
have got to change.

1211
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,386
I gotta to go, sorry
I can't do this anymore.

1212
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:08,023
-Wait, what?
-One martini. Dirty.

1213
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,894
Myles.

1214
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,463
Myles.

1215
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,411
Look at this guy.

1216
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,214
He didn't even attempt to
slow down when he saw us.

1217
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,350
So light him up!

1218
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,485
-He was only going forty.
-He's speeding right
in front of us.

1219
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:38,854
People need to learn to respect
authority. Light him up!

1220
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:42,290
-It's not a big deal.
-I said, let's get them!

1221
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,493
So now you're that asshole
cop who chases down

1222
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:47,262
an '87 Corolla for going fifteen
miles over the speed limit?

1223
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,633
Yes.

1224
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,933
You really need to straighten
this thing out with Myles.

1225
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,303
I've tried calling,
texting, emailing him.

1226
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:58,273
He obviously doesn't
want to talk to me.

1227
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,809
I may not be the
smartest guy in the world
but I can take a hint...

1228
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,377
...when someone doesn't
want to see me.

1229
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,944
You have to go over
there and work this out.

1230
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,947
Knock his door down
if you have to.

1231
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,451
-He doesn't want to talk to me.
-You're a cop for Christ's sake.

1232
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,154
Pull your balls out
of your ass and man up.

1233
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:15,090
You miss him. Make it right.

1234
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:17,993
Fine.

1235
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,304
Myles, open up.

1236
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,438
Myles, come on, open up.

1237
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,175
I need you to open
up, just talk to me.

1238
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:36,244
Knock one more time
and I'm calling the cops.

1239
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,885
Officer.

1240
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,555
Under-cover, huh?
A sting operation.

1241
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:48,056
I get it.

1242
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,591
Still after Myles?

1243
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,559
Have you seen him?

1244
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:53,361
Nope. What did he do?

1245
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,130
He didn't do anything.

1246
01:03:55,132 --> 01:04:00,068
It's always the quiet ones.
I knew he was a bad seed.

1247
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,537
That isn't the case, sir.

1248
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,506
Of course you
can't say anything.

1249
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,275
I know what's going on.

1250
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:10,345
I just hope you get
the son-of-a bitch!

1251
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,623
Myles.

1252
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,558
Come on.

1253
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:26,995
Myles.

1254
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:31,600
*

1255
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:33,635
Pizza, wings and beer.

1256
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:35,403
Who needs men?

1257
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:41,376
We'll have more
fun without them.

1258
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:45,347
-No we won't.
-You're right.

1259
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,515
I'll try not to bitch about
how much men suck tonight.

1260
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:51,052
Why? It's my favorite subject.

1261
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,255
Luckily for you I have
the perfect evening planned.

1262
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:58,226
Comfort food, ice cream and...

1263
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,161
a romantic movie.

1264
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,097
I love that we are doing this.

1265
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,466
-I do it every day.
-What about Richard?

1266
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:06,601
Are you kidding?
It's his favorite thing.

1267
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:10,605
Two bowls of pistachio
froyo, twin snuggies
and a romantic movie.

1268
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,607
We cry all night long.

1269
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,677
-Lucky bitch.
-I know.

1270
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:22,217
Diane, I need to
tell you something.
Please don't be upset.

1271
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:27,022
Any conversation
that begins with, "please
don't be upset", upsets me.

1272
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:31,526
I need to start fresh. Get
somewhere far away from here.

1273
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:33,328
You're moving to the Valley?

1274
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,364
No, I'm thinking of transferring
to the New York office.

1275
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:40,669
There's a job opening
there for a senior litigator
that starts next week.

1276
01:05:40,671 --> 01:05:42,437
I know you're not
going to agree with this...

1277
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:47,042
You want to leave
and move to New York?

1278
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,311
We both know I should go.

1279
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:52,280
Actually, we don't. I
think you're running
away from your problems.

1280
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,382
Please don't make
this any harder for
me than it already is.

1281
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:55,617
I really need to do this.

1282
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,804
No you don't!

1283
01:05:58,805 --> 01:06:01,990
It's an irrational,
impetuous and totally
emotionally clouded decision.

1284
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:06,061
I need to break this cycle and
I can't do it from Los Angeles.

1285
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:12,467
Fine. I'll concede.

1286
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:17,305
-But only under one condition.
-Let the negotiations begin.

1287
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,975
You have to let me
have a going away
party for you this weekend.

1288
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:21,476
Absolutely not. No party.

1289
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,345
Just a few friends over
for drinks at my place?

1290
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:26,414
-No more than six.
-Deal.

1291
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:36,658
So how are you going to tell
Brody that you're moving to
the other side of the country?

1292
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:44,532
I don't know yet.

1293
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,470
I could have Richard do it.

1294
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,612
Brody.

1295
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,186
And to think he's a cop.

1296
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:19,067
(TELEVISION SOUNDS)

1297
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:30,478
If you were a horse,
I'd be obliged to put you down.

1298
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,783
What time is it? Am I late?

1299
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:36,684
Let's just say you're
early for lunch.

1300
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,753
Why don't you get in the shower?

1301
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:43,091
So, how long is this
going to go on?

1302
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:46,528
Just give me five minutes
to take a shower, ok?

1303
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,496
Not the shower.
The self-pity and depression.

1304
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,765
It's been every night this week.

1305
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,301
Hey, I've finally found
something I'm good at.

1306
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:56,571
Why quit when I've
almost mastered it?

1307
01:07:56,573 --> 01:08:00,141
Well, since you're already down,
I've got something else for you.

1308
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,377
It's an invitation.

1309
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:03,778
From who?

1310
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,213
Diane.

1311
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:09,551
She's having a few people over.

1312
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,252
Is Myles going to be there?

1313
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,222
Yep.

1314
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,191
This is the perfect
opportunity for me to
smooth things out with Myles.

1315
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:20,695
In theory.

1316
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,564
Was this Diane's idea?

1317
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:26,734
Absolutely. So you'll come?

1318
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:30,505
Hell yeah. Now I got
something to look forward to.

1319
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:36,644
Me too.

1320
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:46,354
*

1321
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,490
I kept it small
like you wanted.

1322
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,358
I asked you not to do anything.

1323
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,128
This was my compromise.

1324
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,714
I'll miss you.

1325
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,299
I'm well aware. I still can't
believe you're doing this.

1326
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,736
Five days on the open
road will do me good.

1327
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,722
Wait until you hit Nevada.

1328
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,707
You're going to regret
that decision all the way
to the Statue of Liberty.

1329
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,092
Brody's here.

1330
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,476
I'll be in the bomb shelter
if anyone's needs me.

1331
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,362
Oh no, you're not
going anywhere.

1332
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,247
We need someone who
can operate a handgun.

1333
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:14,215
Hey!

1334
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:16,618
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

1335
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,171
It's good to see you.

1336
01:09:19,172 --> 01:09:21,723
So, what's the occasion?
You got a promotion, right?

1337
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,329
Richard, will you help me dear?

1338
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,431
Oh, and bring a shovel.

1339
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:33,985
Would you excuse us?

1340
01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:37,538
He's going to be really
busy digging a six by
three foot hole out back.

1341
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,908
What was that about?

1342
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,877
It's just that this
isn't exactly a party
for my promotion.

1343
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:45,380
So, you didn't get a promotion?

1344
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:47,916
I technically did,
I guess you could say that.

1345
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:50,351
Well, congrats!

1346
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,288
It's also a going away party.

1347
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,856
For who?

1348
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,330
Oh, you're leaving.

1349
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,434
Where?  When?

1350
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,371
I head out on Saturday morning.

1351
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,408
Drive across country
to New York.

1352
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:18,513
Saturday to New York
and this is how you tell me?

1353
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:23,418
-Well Richard was
going to tell you.
-You asked Richard to tell me?

1354
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,486
Diane did.

1355
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:32,627
How could you leave
and not say anything to me?

1356
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:33,795
I haven't left yet.

1357
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:37,498
Yeah, but you're
planning on it Myles.

1358
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,651
Why?

1359
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,803
Because I don't have
a reason to stay anymore.

1360
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:46,274
I'm not a good enough reason?

1361
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:48,643
You tell me, Brody.

1362
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,745
If this is about
the Hunter thing,

1363
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,846
I told you I did not
mean to mess it up for you.

1364
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,416
I was just trying
to protect you.

1365
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,719
I know that and I'm not
mad about it anymore.

1366
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:01,006
I'm the reason I need to leave.

1367
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,292
I need to grow up and
stop looking for my Prince
Charming to come and save me.

1368
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:06,861
That is what I've been
telling you the whole time.

1369
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:08,930
Well then, I agree with you.

1370
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:17,672
So you think that going to
New York is what's going
to make you happy.

1371
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:20,008
It's a start.

1372
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:25,446
Well then, I guess that's that.

1373
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,515
I guess so.

1374
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:50,805
*

1375
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,577
(PHONE BEEPS)

1376
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:36,851
-Can I get you another?
-No. I'm good, thanks.

1377
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:50,498
I'm mad at you.

1378
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:54,401
I know, but being
that I'm your only friend
now and your partner at work,

1379
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:57,138
I think you're going to have
to get over it pretty quickly.

1380
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:03,511
You knew that was
a going away party.

1381
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:08,549
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I figured you deserved
to hear it directly from Myles.

1382
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,786
Plus, if I had told you,
you wouldn't have come
to say goodbye.

1383
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:13,688
You don't know me.

1384
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,757
It's like we never even met.

1385
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,626
You know, he's right?

1386
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:22,530
It is better for both
of us if he just leaves.

1387
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:24,932
Well, you certainly
know what's best.

1388
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,835
I'm not like Myles,
I don't need anyone.

1389
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:31,939
It's true. You're not miserable
at all when he's gone.

1390
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,875
Myles is a hopeless romantic.

1391
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:36,577
All he wants is
someone to love him.

1392
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,614
Yeah, so unreasonable.

1393
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:43,651
Plus, he's a people
pleaser. All he cares
about is the guy he's with.

1394
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,920
That's horrible. I can see
why guys would hate that.

1395
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:51,659
Myles is like a penguin.
He will bond to you, he's
dependable and trustworthy.

1396
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:54,962
I'm really starting
to hate that guy.

1397
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:58,433
I mean, could you imagine
if Myles and I were together.

1398
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:03,037
Not at all. It's crazy
to think that two people
who care about each other

1399
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:08,910
as much as you two do
would ever, ever want
to be in a relationship.

1400
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:12,980
I know, right? I mean,
if Myles were the
perfect guy for me,

1401
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:15,450
I would have realized
that years ago.

1402
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:18,336
Absolutely.

1403
01:14:18,337 --> 01:14:21,221
I mean there is no way
you'd overlook something
so obvious for so long.

1404
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,791
Exactly.

1405
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,093
Myles just wants to be married.

1406
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:32,166
And all I want is for
him to be happy.

1407
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:39,507
Then I guess the only
way for that to happen
is to remove you from his life.

1408
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:45,780
Yeah, I guess.

1409
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:57,625
*

1410
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:57,585
To Brody.

1411
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,856
I hope you find
someone to love you.

1412
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:04,926
I hope you find
someone to love.

1413
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:27,048
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here
today to bear witness

1414
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:30,117
to the matrimony
of these two men.

1415
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:37,925
This is a relationship that
stands for love and loyalty.

1416
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:42,597
This is a relationship that
stands for honesty and trust.

1417
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:48,669
But most importantly,
this is a relationship
that stands for friendship.

1418
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:54,909
Because before they were
lovers, they were friends,

1419
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,947
and it is this seed of
friendship that love
was their destiny.

1420
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:04,118
One cannot dictate or
determine the course of love.

1421
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:10,191
For if love finds you worthy,
then love directs you.

1422
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:18,933
It is this sacred
and holy estate which
you enter into as one.

1423
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:25,072
And if there is anyone who
has just cause why these
two should not join as one,

1424
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:30,144
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1425
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:51,198
Do you take this man to love,
honor and comfort,

1426
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,035
and keep in sickness
and in health,

1427
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:56,804
in sadness and in joy,

1428
01:17:56,806 --> 01:18:01,375
and cherish and bestow upon
him your deepest devotion,

1429
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:04,445
for as long as you
both shall live?

1430
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,213
I do.

1431
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:14,088
Then, by the power
vested in me,

1432
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,424
I now pronounce you

1433
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:20,394
husband and husband.

1434
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:23,998
You may now kiss your groom.

1435

1436
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:14,448
Come on! Are you kidding me?

1437
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:25,526
Oh... I can't.

1438
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:28,796
Come on, Come on, Come on!

1439
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,341
Myles, are you in there?

1440
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:16,811
Myles, are you in there?

1441
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,245
Myles!

1442
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:20,981
-Myles!
-What are you
god-damned kids up to now?

1443
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:24,485
-I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
-I'm sorry officer, I
didn't realize it was you.

1444
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,520
Still haven't caught him yet?

1445
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:28,522
Have you seen him today?

1446
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:30,523
Saw him this morning. He
woke me up making a ruckus.

1447
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:33,260
I went back to sleep.
Which I never do by the way.

1448
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:36,063
Damn Sciatica kept
me up all night.

1449
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:38,566
I got one of these
dial mattresses.

1450
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:42,203
I changed it from a four to a
six, I thought that might help.

1451
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:44,305
I slept better on my old Sealy.

1452
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:47,909
You think they'd let me
take this one back?

1453
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:51,512
-It's only been six weeks.
-I really have to get to Myles,
so if you know where he is.

1454
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:55,149
Gone now. I guess
you missed him.

1455
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:57,218
Yeah. I guess I did.

1456
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:00,020
You're gonna go
after him, aren't you?

1457
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,623
He's not a criminal.

1458
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:08,896
I know that. I'm not blind and
stupid. You obviously love him.

1459
01:21:08,898 --> 01:21:11,866
I do.

1460
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:15,002
Then go after him!

1461
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:20,441
Don't make the same mistake
I did and end up like me.
Trust me.

1462
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:23,143
Don't just stand
there, go get him!

1463
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:25,179
He's going to New York.

1464
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:27,581
I don't know where he is. I'm
not going to catch up to him.

1465
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:31,886
You've got a cop car don't
you? Light up that son-of-a
bitch. I've seen them go

1466
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:38,292
two-hundred miles an hour.
Tear ass down that freeway!
Don't let him get away.

1467
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:42,363
Ok. Ok.

1468
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:46,567

01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,446
I'm sorry for getting you out
of bed so early for this.

1471
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,216
Who needs sleep on
a Saturday morning?

1472
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:04,318
Besides, this is fun.

1473
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,253
It's just like those movies
Diane makes me watch.

1474
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,289
I have to catch up to Myles
before it's too late.

1475
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,224
Do me a favor, call him
and see where he is.

1476
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:13,260
No way! That is not
how's its done.

1477
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,062
Myles is a romantic.

1478
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:16,614
We have to catch up with him.

1479
01:22:16,615 --> 01:22:18,165
It's the element of surprise
that will win him back.

1480
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,967
Yeah, and what if we don't
make it there in time?

1481
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,136
Trust me on this one.
I know how it's done.

1482
01:22:22,138 --> 01:22:24,538
You always get the
guy in the end.

1483
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:32,346
Calling doesn't seem like such
a bad idea now, does it?

1484
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,949
It always works in the movies.

1485
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:40,354
So what now?

1486
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:42,256
I don't know.

1487
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:45,192
It usually doesn't
turn out this way.

1488
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:49,263
I'm too late, aren't I?

1489
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,435
Might as well head back.

1490
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:58,439
I know you have
plans with Diane.

1491
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:00,240
Let me call her and let her
know I'll be a little late.

1492
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:02,176

be a little bit late.

Keep me company for
just a bit more?

1503
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:46,587
I've got three thousand miles
ahead of me and now all I'm
going to be able to think about

1504
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:48,389
is you and Richard playing
"cops and robbers".

1505

trying to resist arrest.

clean up and say goodbye.

mimosa for the road.

No one should drive into the
middle of this country without
at least one drink in them.

-You're awful.
-I know.

01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:18,685
Are you sure you don't
want to join us for brunch?

1512
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:22,056
You know a gay guy is tired
when he turns down brunch.

1513
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:25,826
I had a bad night
and a crappy morning.

1514

Bottomless drinks.

01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,797
I have a feeling you'll get
your money's worth today.

1516
01:24:29,799 --> 01:24:33,200
I really don't feel like
being around people.

here, he left a minute ago.

Charming that you imagine but,

1558
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:02,716
you know I would slay
a dragon for you.

1559
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:05,519
It's not enough, Brody.

1560
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:07,454
What else is there?

1561
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:13,660
Trust, love,
companionship, respect.

1562
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:16,730
We don't have all those things?

1563
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:24,972
Well then, I'll guess I'll have
to make this easy for you.

1564
01:27:24,974 --> 01:27:26,440
Cause you don't have a choice.

1565
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:29,576
I'm sorry, what?

1566
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,695
I'm glad you're here
because I need a lawyer.

1567
01:27:31,696 --> 01:27:33,813
Would you please tell me if
this is still legally binding?

1568
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:35,882
I charge seven-hundred
dollars an hour.

1569
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,953
Fine, I'll do it pro-bono.

1570
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,888
Let me see it.

1571
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:46,560
I'm sorry, it's not
legally binding.

1572
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:49,930
It states that this becomes
effective on Myles' birthday.

1573
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:53,533
Unfortunately, that's
not until tomorrow.

1574
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:56,737
I guess we'll just have
to wait twelve hours.

1575
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:59,973
We can put him under
house arrest until
the contract is due.

1576
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,376
I can leave this
perp in your custody.

1577
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:04,444
The law is the law.

1578
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:11,785
I'm so glad that everybody's
made the decision about
what I should do.

1579
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,658
Does anybody want to
know what I think?

1580
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,795
Yes, of course.

1581
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,865
I think after
waiting ten years,

1582
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:27,934
I deserve a proper kiss.

1583
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:35,309
*

1584
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:52,526
(FACETIME RINGING)

1585
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:57,464
You're calling me why?

1586
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:00,701
Well, I always call you after
I hook up with a hot guy.

1587
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,436
How was it?

1588
01:29:02,438 --> 01:29:05,605
Let me put it like this: I'm
gonna have to call you back,

1589
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:07,741
cause I'm about to do it again.

1590
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,943
It was that good?

1591
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:11,511
Oh yeah.

1592
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:13,547
And by the way,

1593
01:29:13,549 --> 01:29:15,449
Happy Birthday Myles.

1594
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,851
It certainly is.

1595
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:23,890
*

1596
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:50,717
