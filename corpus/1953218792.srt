1
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,930
Ain't gonna go, Austin.
Changed my mind.

2
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,460
She's a witch.

3
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,331
She ain't no witch, Donnie.

4
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,628
Ain't nothing up there,
but a stupid old lady...

5
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,471
who likes to give
presents to kids.

6
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,602
Everybody says she
don't want people seeing her...

7
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,968
on account of that
disease made her ugly.

8
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:04,442
You go up there,
I'm telling Pa.

9
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:07,348
Pa ain't gonna let us keep
no bicycle.

10
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:11,183
Fine, if you're such a
fraidy cat, then stay here.

11
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,623
Hello, Ms. Craven?

12
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:53,495
It's Austin Carter,
from down the road.

13
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:56,926
You left me a letter.
I'm here for the bicycle.

14
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,196
Are you alone?
Does anybody know you came?

15
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:01,567
It has to be a secret.

16
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:04,505
All alone, ma'am.
Nobody knows.

17
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,511
Nothing to be afraid of.

18
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,544
A trade's a trade.

19
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,073
Tooth first...

20
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:20,021
then a shiny new bicycle.

21
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,156
It's okay, child.
Just the wind.

22
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,398
Where are you?
I can't see you.

23
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:32,097
Step to the parlor.
No need to see me, child.

24
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:40,174
Where's the bike?
I came because of the bicycle.

25
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,544
I must have my tooth first.
A bargain is a bargain.

26
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,711
But it ain't come out yet.

27
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:50,612
There's a string on the table there.
Tie it 'round your tooth.

28
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,585
We'll pull it out.

29
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:55,446
I ain't doing this
'less I see the bike first.

30
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,919
I wouldn't lie, child.

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,395
The bike's right here.

32
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,422
Wow! A Schwinn.

33
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:06,097
She's a beaut.

34
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:08,960
I must have my tooth first.

35
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:11,700
I've done this many times.

36
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:15,575
The last tooth
is always the easiest.

37
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,743
Are we ready?

38
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:41,364
Now close your eyes
and get your prize.

39
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:23,176
CAMPBELL INN
BED AND BREAKFAST

40
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,013
Well... It's about time.

41
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,752
Yeah, sorry that took so long, Peter.

42
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,620
They ran out of hydrangeas
over at Sherman's Outdoors...

43
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:43,490
so I had to drive all the way over
to Twin Oaks.

44
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,092
We got a lot to do
before July first.

45
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,359
I couldn't do without you, Bobby.

46
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,967
All the kids I hired me the job
are just finding some shade.

47
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:54,741
I appreciate
all your hard work.

48
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:57,641
I have been looking at that
antique chipper thing in the woodshed.

49
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:01,510
Yeah. well. Y'know I'm thinking
of having that thing carted out of there.

50
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,950
It's a piece of junk.

51
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,117
I think I could fix it.
Pretty good with engines.

52
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:09,386
Threw a new battery in it this morning.
Just looks like it needs a lube.

53
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,747
Maybe after dinner,
I could see if I could get it running.

54
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:14,054
I could use it shred all that underbrush
we've been cutting outta there...

55
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,752
instead of hauling all on out of here by truck.

56
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,961
Alright, well, give it a shot.

57
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:25,593
Where the hell are they?

58
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:34,867
Hey! Pam-bam, look at this map
and see if you can find River Bend Road.

59
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,346
I could use a little help, Pammy.

60
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,484
I'm in East Oz here.
Nothing looks like the map.

61
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:43,979
- Can I ask you a question?
- Never stopped you before.

62
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,984
I think I'm going back to "Pamela".

63
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:49,091
"Pammy" seems so...
so lower school.

64
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,754
I thought you hated "Pamela".

65
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,664
I know you like pet names
like "Pam-bam" and "Pammy"...

66
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:57,065
but now that I'm ten and a half,
I think I'm a bit too old for that.

67
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:00,098
I love the name "Pamela".
That's why dad and I picked it.

68
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:01,600
Then, it's settled.

69
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:05,036
So, Pamela,
you see this road on that map?

70
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,442
I'm really pretty lost here.

71
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:12,749
Why don't you ask at that station?
You said you needed gas.

72
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,051
Okay.

73
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,214
Hello?

74
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,440
Please little help out here!

75
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,416
We need some directions.

76
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,924
Need some directions?

77
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:01,655
We're lost.

78
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,499
Get the hell out of that garage.
Leave her be.

79
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,237
She don't talk to strangers.

80
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:15,111
- I'm..I'm looking for River Bend Road.
- You ain't gonna find it in there.

81
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,010
- Watcha gonna do, Chuck?
- Shut up, Henry.

82
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:21,777
This map you got is as useless as
tits on fore-truck.

83
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:25,052
Now, get on outta there. Leave her be.
I ain't gonna say it twice.

84
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,190
I'm looking for a new bed and breakfast inn,
just outside of Constitution.

85
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,159
Should be near River Bend Road.
That's what Peter said.

86
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,560
- Son of a bitch! Right, Chuck?
- Shut up, Henry.

87
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:37,864
This Peter guy isn't by any chance
Peter "Step on my Dick" Campbell?

88
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,927
- I'm sorry What?
- What kind of business you got with that
melted down piece of shit?

89
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,132
Here's a fact of life, missy.

90
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,572
When you hang with shit,
you smell like shit.

91
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,002
Excuse me, but I won't appreciate
that kind of language.

92
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,677
- Pammy, we're leaving!
- What are we gonna do, Chuck?

93
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:55,783
Pammy!

94
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,989
- Pammy!
- It's "Pamela", mom. Remember?

95
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,689
Come on, honey.
Come on.

96
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,092
- Hey you ain't paid for your gas.
- Yeah! Ain't paid!

97
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,790
Is she Peter Campbell?

98
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:12,300
Is that raised on concrete motherfucker
you're good for nothing pa?

99
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,167
- My daddy's dead.
- Get in the car, honey.

100
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,004
- Let me go!
- Because of your boyfriend Peter...

101
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,201
the Chamber of Commerce had threat
to fuck over our property.

102
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,405
He thinks this is over,
but this ain't never gonna be over.

103
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,744
- There's bad shit coming.
- Get off me!

104
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,648
- Leave my mommy alone!
- What are you gonna do, Chuck?

105
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,878
You're gonna run around back
and pull down her panties?

106
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,041
Can I have seconds?

107
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,713
-Depends on how...
- Get off me!

108
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,557
- she is when I'm through.
- Get off me!

109
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,322
Damn!

110
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:38,624
Get off me!

111
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,155
Get her! Goddammit!

112
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,832
This ain't over!

113
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:03,009
Finally.

114
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,215
He-hey! Are those my girls?

115
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,028
Would you give me a hand
with this, uh, suitcase?

116
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:23,963
Got a lot of stuff.

117
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,772
Excuse me, but, you know,
we're not open yet.

118
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,234
Doug Freeman, at the bank,
said July 1 but I...

119
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:33,906
I let my place in town go and figured what's
6 or 7 days in the course of a lifetime.

120
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,745
I'm.. I'm Star Roberts;
I'm leasing a room.

121
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,909
I'm sorry, I thought your name
was "Stephanie".

122
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:41,615
Oh, it is Stephanie.
Stephanie Thorne Amanda Roberts.

123
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,520
S-T-A-R. "Star".
Get it?

124
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:48,425
Yeah. You know Mr. Freeman told
me you were going to Veterinary school...

125
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:52,563
down in Twin Oaks and you'd be leasing
a room only on the weekends.

126
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:56,928
He also said that you
were his, uhm, niece.

127
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,468
Yeah. All that's true.

128
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,300
Except for the niece part.

129
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,404
I used to dance on the Greased Monkey
in town...

130
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,412
and Mr. Freeman
was a happy hour regular...

131
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,539
but, uh, I’ve saved up enough
to retire from showbiz, so...

132
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,947
I'm going to Veterinary College.
New worlds to conquer, you know?

133
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,151
Sure.

134
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:19,554
Yeah, I hope me coming a week early isn't
gonna a big inconvenience.

135
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,628
We had a lease,
so, we'll make it work.

136
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,728
- Thank you, you're a doll.
- Sure.

137
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,134
Love it here.

138
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,693
Hey... look at those little guys.

139
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:34,270
I think they're called, uh,
Ruby-throated Archilochus colubris...

140
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,742
but hummingbirds have to eat four times
their weight in food everyday...

141
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,035
to just have enough energy to fly like that.

142
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,406
I'm taking aviary species
first semester.

143
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,546
I gotta jump start this summer
and read my text books.

144
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,447
- Sure.
- I love it.

145
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,979
Hey, Mr. C., where do you want
the rest of these flower..whoa.

146
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:53,355
Bobby Boulet, meet
Stephanie Roberts.

147
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,149
Hey!

148
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,058
- Whoa, sorry.
- He's been helping me fix the place up.

149
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,556
Call me "Star".

150
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,193
Alright, Bobby,
you can close your mouth, now...

151
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,533
and maybe, help Star with her bags?

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,662
Got it.

153
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:10,003
Your room is just up there on the...
the left.

154
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,599
- Great, thanks.
- Okay.

155
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:13,909
Mr. C., she's a hottie.

156
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:17,371
I'm telling you, if that's your first tenant
you hit the *jackpot.

157
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:22,249
- Just keep it in your pants.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,258
I missed you!

159
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,195
Okay, so...

160
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:38,964
what do you think?

161
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,469
It's so big.

162
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:42,730
It is big.

163
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,643
Y'know it's a little run down,
but I think it's getting there.

164
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,249
- Why don't you go and check it out?
- Okay.

165
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:56,115
- Hi.
- Hello.

166
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:02,283
I was a little worried about you.
You said 10 o'clock, it is almost...1.

167
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:03,959
We got lost.

168
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:07,628
Oy, talk about your fixer-upper.

169
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:11,869
It's not as bad
as it looks.

170
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:18,106
Believe me, it's a whole lot better than it was.

171
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,809
Your gas cap's off.

172
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,514
- Darc, what happened?
- I'm still shaking.

173
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,478
I pulled into a gas station
10 miles back...

174
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:34,550
to Bubba's who looked like
extras from "Deliverance" run the place.

175
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:37,355
The minute I mentioned I was coming up here,
they attacked me.

176
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,827
They  were about to rape me,
I almost didn't get away.

177
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:40,862
What?

178
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,833
I'm sorry, I should've
told you not to stop there.

179
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,799
- Are you okay?
- I'll feel better once I file charges.

180
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,363
- What the hell's their problem?
- That is a long story.

181
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,567
Let's just get you settled in, okay?

182
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,113
Mark.

183
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,586
The Morrison-Calley lawsuit just
finished pre-trial *daps.

184
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:06,919
Case got fast-tracked
so it's all over us.

185
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,717
If paralegal jobs weren't
so scarce right now...

186
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,319
I'd be out of there.

187
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:13,925
Well, I'm glad you're here.

188
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:17,890
You should've seen this place before, Darc.
The windows were painted black...

189
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:19,898
and all the mirrors inside
were covered over.

190
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:24,062
I'm telling you: You give me another week,
and you won't even recognize this place.

191
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,421
Now, that should help take the edge off.

192
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:44,424
Yeah.

193
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,318
- Thanks.
- Sure.

194
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:55,835
So, what do you really think of the place?

195
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:59,671
Once it's cleaned up, I think,
it'll be fine.

196
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,905
You know when I was working in Pediatrics,
that's how we used to describe ugly babies.

197
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:07,948
Come on, Peter, I'm up here.
I brought Pammy.

198
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,415
I kept my end of the bargain.

199
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:11,679
You're making it sound like
you have to take medicine.

200
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:15,589
It's your prescription.
You're the doctor, or at least you were.

201
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,320
Darc, come on! We've been
over this a thousand times.

202
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,626
I made a shitty doctor.

203
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,592
My heart was not in it.

204
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,462
You said you were gonna fill me in.

205
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,528
So... who are the idiots
who broke my window?

206
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,230
Those idiots were the
Hammond brothers.

207
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:33,570
They were squatting in the property with
their sister Maude when I bought the place...

208
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,667
so I had to get the municipal
court to kick them out.

209
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,371
And needless to say they
weren't happy about it.

210
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,615
Listen, let's...
Let's talk about you and I...

211
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,578
It...

212
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:53,820
What is it, Mark?

213
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,294
No, No, Brian has those papers.

214
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:58,522
- Great.
- I gave it to him before I left.

215
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,945
Hello! Anybody in here?

216
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:49,681
Wow!

217
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,757
It's a 1949 Schwinn.

218
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:00,984
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

219
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,721
I'm from down the lane,
but you can't tell.

220
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm supposed to be at home doing chores.

221
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:09,300
- You live on a farm?
- Yeah, about a mile from here.

222
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,529
Are there horses?

223
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:13,435
I've taken riding lessons,
English saddle.

224
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:17,909
- We had horses once but they died.
- I love horses.

225
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,841
This bike's got the new style.

226
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,647
Toolbox tank with the battery
clipped in switch built right in.

227
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:25,616
What if we can get these
tires and filled them?

228
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,111
Bicycle pump, right over there!

229
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:35,482
You just wonder into other
people's houses without asking?

230
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,695
In a house,
it's a woodshed.

231
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:40,391
I was just wondering
who's moving in. That's all.

232
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,991
Peter Campbell.
He and my mom used to be engaged.

233
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,030
He was a doctor then.
Now, he quit.

234
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,629
He just writes short stories.

235
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,141
Are you moving in, too?

236
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:52,808
There's not many kids to play with
around here. We could be friends.

237
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:55,244
Me and my mom are just here
for the weekend.

238
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:57,440
I was worried there won't be any kids...

239
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,414
so, I'm glad you came over.

240
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:02,312
- I'm Emma Inge.
- Pamela Wagner.

241
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,622
Wanna play dress-up?

242
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,820
Why don't we get this bike
working first?

243
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,988
Get it cleaned up
and go exploring.

244
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,231
- You gotta stop, Pamela.
- Why?

245
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:58,238
This is Witch's River.
It's haunted.

246
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,476
- How old are you?
- I'll be 11 in February.

247
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:07,912
Me, too. Mommy says we Aquarians
have active imaginations...

248
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:10,920
but, I think we're both too old
to believe in witches, Emma.

249
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:14,587
- Do you have any baby teeth left?
- So what if I do?

250
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,592
But it's just one,
so, it barely counts.

251
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:20,687
Best not to pull it 'til you're safe
at home. The witch collects teeth.

252
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,730
- How does she do that?
- Bad luck to talk about it.

253
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,294
Like Voldemort
in "Harry Potter"?

254
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:27,528
Who's Harry Potter?

255
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,035
"Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone".

256
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:33,140
"Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets"?

257
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:35,837
J.K. Rowling?

258
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,880
My parents died when I was 6.

259
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:41,575
I ain't allowed to leave the farm much,
so, I don't hear about a lot of things.

260
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:44,018
Yeah, but still, Harry Potter!

261
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:49,453
Okay. Go on.
Tell me about that silly old witch.

262
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:52,426
She used to live in the
house you're in...

263
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,188
a long time ago.

264
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,929
When she was alive,
she had a horrible disease.

265
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,669
Tumors grew in her mouth
and on her face.

266
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:03,135
Children teased her when
she went to school.

267
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:07,671
After her parents died,
she covered all the mirrors in the house...

268
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:11,371
and painted all the windows black
and never came out.

269
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,412
But as she got old,
she got meaner.

270
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,880
She started luring
children up there...

271
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,919
taking their teeth and killing them.

272
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,555
She'd put their teeth in
her magic music box...

273
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,685
and curse the children
so their souls would be trapped...

274
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,488
to wander the earth, forever.

275
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:31,057
And that's why they called her,
the Tooth Fairy.

276
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,061
And you say you never read
Harry Potter.

277
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:37,528
I have to get home before dark.

278
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:38,868
You better get home, too.

279
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,043
You be careful, Pamela.

280
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,511
Don't let the tooth fairy
have your last tooth.

281
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,019
She knows when they're loose.
When she has it...

282
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,581
she'll kill you.

283
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,096
Pam!

284
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,888
- Is she upstairs?
- No. No.

285
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:39,933
Pammy!

286
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,764
- I'll check the woodshed.
- She's not there, I already checked.

287
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,894
- What's the fuss?
- My daughter's missing.

288
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,462
- I'll help you look.
- Star and I can jump in the truck,
maybe we could...

289
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,668
- No, no, Bobby, let's go check back here.
- I used to live in this area. I know these roads.

290
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,074
I'll, I'll drive.

291
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,580
- Stephanie, I'm Darcy.
- Hi, nice to know you.

292
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,844
- What was she wearing?
- Jeans and a, a blue hoodie.

293
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,283
It's been a cold July.
Hope she's warm enough.

294
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,621
Is that her?

295
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:04,719
Peter, she's here!

296
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,596
Thank God I found you.
What happened to your mouth?

297
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,332
I fell, I knocked out my last baby tooth.

298
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,032
Good going, kiddo.

299
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,940
School picture's coming up in a week
and now you have a big hole in your smile.

300
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,373
Once she has your tooth,
she'll kill you.

301
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,591
I met this girl today,
her name's Emma Inge.

302
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,955
She lives on a farm
about a mile from here.

303
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:54,689
I was going to invite her over tomorrow...

304
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,292
so I asked Bobby about her.

305
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,100
He lives in town...

306
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,698
but he said he'd never heard
of an Inge family.

307
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,540
- It's kinda strange, huh?
- I never saw you playing with a girl.

308
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,872
- Was she nice?
- Yeah, but...

309
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,746
she dresses kinda weird.

310
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:15,979
Well... this is the country, sweetheart.
It's a long way to Melrose Avenue.

311
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,518
Do you believe in witches, mommy?

312
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:22,816
A life isn't a Harry Potter novel, Pamela.

313
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:26,693
But, didn't they use to burn
witches in Salem, Massachusetts?

314
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,324
In Salem, they didn't
understand disease...

315
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,296
and why so many babies were
dying during childbirth.

316
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:36,037
Since they couldn't understand it,
they found people who didn't fit in...

317
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,438
and called them witches and
burned them at the stake...

318
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:41,102
hoping to make their problems go away.

319
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,146
And, what's all this about?

320
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,250
Emma says there used to be a witch
that lived on this house.

321
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:50,781
Right here, in this house.

322
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:53,482
Well, she's not here anymore.

323
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:55,146
Okay?

324
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,319
Now it's time for you,
to go to sleep.

325
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,658
Leave the light on in the hall.

326
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,264
Okay.

327
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,932
Nice night.

328
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,262
I couldn't concentrate in this book
in my room for some reason.

329
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:45,171
Listen to what I just found.

330
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:49,110
<i>"Pigeons were originally brought to
this country as pets...</i>

331
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,704
<i>but they escaped and formed
feral populations...</i>

332
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,871
<i>that are now the number 1
pest bird in the US."</i>

333
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:57,812
- I didn't know that, did you?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,016
Yeah?

335
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,548
I mean, no.
No, I...

336
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:03,082
I'm not sure.

337
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:07,016
I always loved animals.

338
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:11,498
Even as a kid, I used to have all kinds of
broken birds, and sick lizards and stuff...

339
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,291
and nurse them back to health.

340
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:14,866
I...

341
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:17,438
I was always kind of your
girl-geek type, you know.

342
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,437
Then I started growin' up...

343
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,540
This is what I ended up with.

344
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,035
Yeah...

345
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,342
no kiddin', huh?

346
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,606
It's funny how you can end up
becoming what it is you look like...

347
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:32,347
but underneath all this,
I'm still just Star Roberts, girl geek.

348
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,419
Took me a mess of time to get
that sorted out, but...

349
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,557
I'm on the right track now,
and I can't hardly wait to start my classes.

350
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,561
I play football.

351
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:48,367
Won league championships this year.

352
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:50,267
- Really?
- Yeah.

353
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,865
Got a scholarship at Fresno State.

354
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,140
- Start two-day drills in about a week.
- What are you gonna study?

355
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,143
I thought I'd try
Electrical Engineering...

356
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:02,441
my folks, they wanted me in
Farm Management, but...

357
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,047
I don't know if I wanna be in Farm
Management the rest of my life.

358
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:10,885
Just 'cause you live on a farm and look like a
farm boy, doesn't mean you have to be one, right?

359
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,491
And take it from somebody who
just took a 3-year detour.

360
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:19,196
Your dreams will carry you but,
you gotta be willing to fly first.

361
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,297
It's so nice here.

362
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:28,874
I love it.

363
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:59,622
<i>Mommy!
Mommy, where are you?</i>

364
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,131
Who's that?
Who's there?

365
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,410
Uh, shut it.
Hush up!

366
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,907
You'll raise the dead.

367
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:50,972
Let go of her!

368
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,842
Who are you?

369
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,909
Mrs. MacDonald.
Your next-door neighbor.

370
00:29:56,987 --> 00:29:59,615
What're you doing sneaking around up here?
It's almost midnight.

371
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:01,522
What's going on?
Who was screaming?

372
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,920
You must listen to me, all of you.

373
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:08,494
Your lives are in great danger.

374
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:12,800
This house is a place of untold evil.

375
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,333
Awful things have transpired here.

376
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:17,836
Unspeakable things to children!

377
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,167
- She was in my room.
- Nonsense, child!

378
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:25,439
I saw you. You were leaning over my bed,
you tried to get my tooth.

379
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:26,913
That was not me...

380
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:28,776
it was her.

381
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:31,921
What do you mean "her"?
Who the hell are you talking about?

382
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,648
The evil one is awake.

383
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:37,381
All this work on the house has
disturbed her slumber.

384
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,458
And now, she will take
revenge on all of you.

385
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:44,794
Mark my words,
all who stay...

386
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:46,094
will die.

387
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:49,099
Pammy, I don't want you listening to this.
Come on.

388
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:55,832
Listen, Mrs. MacDonald...

389
00:30:56,113 --> 00:30:58,341
I want you off of my property.

390
00:30:58,547 --> 00:31:01,448
I don't care if you are
my neighbor...

391
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:05,283
you don't come sneaking around here
scaring that little girl half to death.

392
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:08,320
Well I have seen the witch, and I know.

393
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,080
All of you must leave...

394
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,151
before it's too late.

395
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,735
At least we know who not to
borrow a cup of sugar from.

396
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:56,266
Yeah!

397
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,069
Yeah!

398
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,465
He shoots, he scores!

399
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:27,556
Who is that?

400
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:30,164
Ms. MacDonald?

401
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:33,168
Peter doesn't want you
'round here anymore.

402
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:15,338
- Mommy!
- What?

403
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,533
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

404
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:18,337
Sounded like it came from the woodshed.

405
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:21,406
Come on, let's go.

406
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:32,389
Okay, listen. Darc, I want you to stay
here with Star and Pam, okay?

407
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:33,922
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

408
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:02,651
Bobby?

409
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,201
The hell...

410
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:29,337
Excuse me, folks.

411
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:34,081
I'm gonna have the coroner pick up
the whole ? to town.

412
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:37,652
But, uh, the contraption turned that
poor boy into tomato puree.

413
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,745
- You say he was fixing it?
- Yeah, the engine was all busted up...

414
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:44,418
but Bobby figured he could get it going, so.

415
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,687
Must have had his head down there.

416
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:51,665
Some damn thing try to free the chopper wheel
turned on by mistake and got pulled in.

417
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,768
That boy was a football player and a half.
It's a damn shame.

418
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,464
He wanted to study Engineering.

419
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:00,771
Why don't you folks go on back to the house?
I'll let you know when we're ready to leave.

420
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,343
Thanks.

421
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:04,513
Come on, Star.

422
00:36:13,622 --> 00:36:17,059
- D'you want to talk about this?
- Can't even bear to think about it.

423
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:22,091
Later, then.
But I don't think you should bury it.

424
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,926
We need to talk about what happened.

425
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,228
I don't want it to give you nightmares.

426
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:29,198
I'm too afraid to go
upstairs or go to sleep.

427
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:32,971
I understand, but you have to try.

428
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,605
She was in my room, mom.

429
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:43,141
Mrs. MacDonald won't come back.
Peter made her go away.

430
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:45,118
I think she's the witch
who killed Bobby.

431
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:47,252
There's no such thing as witches.

432
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,286
But if she's not a witch, how'd
she know my tooth was gone?

433
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,285
Emma says she always knows.

434
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:57,855
And when she gets my tooth...

435
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,393
she'll kill me.

436
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,439
You can't let your imagination
run away with you, honey.

437
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,940
And Mrs. MacDonald
is just a crazy old lady.

438
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,175
We'll lock up tight.
She won't get in again, I promise.

439
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:16,706
Come here.

440
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,368
Are you okay?

441
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:45,010
Yeah.

442
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:46,512
Fine.

443
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,550
How could something like that happen?

444
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:57,013
How's Pammy?

445
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,154
Not so hot.

446
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:03,453
Now that this has happened,
I don't know if I feel...

447
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,929
the same way about this place.

448
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,459
Maybe moving up here
to be a writer...

449
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:11,663
wasn't such a hot idea after all.

450
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:14,739
Maybe this whole thing was a big mistake.

451
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,301
No, you gotta do what you want.

452
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,340
I don't wanna put any pressure on you,
but Pammy and I...

453
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:23,041
would love to have you come home.

454
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,783
Can't you write stories anywhere?

455
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:29,181
Does it have to be in some inn
way out in the country?

456
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:30,724
Look, I admit that...

457
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,555
you know, this place hasn't
been very peaceful...

458
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,721
but, trust me, Darc...

459
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:40,697
I will not let anything
happen to you or Pam.

460
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,493
Come here.

461
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:57,273
Peter?

462
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,782
Yeah.

463
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,917
Where's my car?

464
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:10,086
It was right there when the cops left.

465
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,957
What kind of whack job takes a Hyundai?

466
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:16,134
One of the reasons you drive those things
is because no one ever steals them.

467
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,466
I got a hunch.
It's the kind of lame...

468
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:21,362
crappers dipshit Hammond
brothers would be pulling.

469
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:25,170
Sheriff Pepper, please.

470
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,377
Well, when will he be back?

471
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,244
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,177
Won't be back 'til noon.

473
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:36,755
We'll wait 'till Pammy gets up
and we'll take a trip into town.

474
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:53,603
Thanks.

475
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,636
To put a little sugar in your day.

476
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,505
- Thanks, Peter.
- You're welcome.

477
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:02,005
Now why don't you go check out
some of those cool sunglasses...

478
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,479
and your mom and I are going
to talk to the Sheriff, okay?

479
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:05,776
- Okay.
- See you in a minute.

480
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:52,226
Meet me in the changing room.

481
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:06,470
You'll never believe what
happened last night.

482
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:09,034
Bobby Boulet died,
it's all over town.

483
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:12,412
And the tooth fairy, she was in my
room, she tried to get my tooth.

484
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,949
She can't come after you
unless your tooth is out.

485
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,882
As long as it's in your
mouth, you're safe.

486
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:19,683
I fell off the bike, I knocked it out.
And last night...

487
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:22,683
<i>Only one person in the change
room at a time.</i>

488
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:27,589
I'm sorry, I'm all alone.
It's just my radio, I'll turn it off.

489
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:30,292
I'm so scared,
She almost got me.

490
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,961
And now,
she's after this tooth.

491
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:35,396
Now that the tooth fairy
wants that tooth...

492
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,268
she'll come after you wherever you go.

493
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,671
- You're not safe unless we stop her.
- How can we stop her?

494
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:44,146
If we give her your tooth,
she'll lead us to the magic music box.

495
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:46,043
That's where she keeps the teeth.

496
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:49,152
Once we have the music box,
I think her spell's broken.

497
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,116
Once she gets my tooth,
she'll kill me.

498
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:54,418
She can't bear to look at herself.

499
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,823
Yes, but how would that
keep me alive?

500
00:41:57,025 --> 00:42:01,394
We can use that,
we just have to be very, very clever.

501
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:13,565
He had been as involved as one of
Mark's notorious sleeping jurors.

502
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:16,940
Well, they got their hands full with
the media over Bobby's death.

503
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,274
And my car's probably halfway
to Bolivia by now.

504
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:23,676
Maybe not.

505
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,325
Wonder if they took anything?

506
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:43,001
- How do you unhook this thing?
- You don't unhook.

507
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:49,634
Oh, we got ourselves a
full-fledged innkeeper.

508
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,144
- What're you gonna do, Chuck?
- I want my car back.

509
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:55,803
You trespassed on private property
and stole it. That's against the law.

510
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:59,010
Well, I found this in
your backseat, missy.

511
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:03,984
It says here you're a paralegal.
It's some kind of lawyer's helper, ain't it?

512
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:08,051
See I'm figuring that this means you 
understand the concept of a mechanic's lien.

513
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,653
Well, me and my brother, we for one,
have thingamabob's your new car here...

514
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:13,393
on account of you took off
without paying for your gas.

515
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:14,831
- Bullshit!
- Darc.

516
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:17,767
Hey, shut up. And you,
keep your trap shut as well...

517
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,069
I'm gonna fill a hole in one of
my size 13 Danner boots.

518
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:25,709
She didn't pay for her gas,
and so we impounded the car.

519
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:29,407
Of course, calling this roller skate
a car is a might bit of a stretch...

520
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:32,112
but what the fuck, takes what
the good Lord provides.

521
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:34,381
If she owes you money
for gas, I'll pay it.

522
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:36,819
You obviously don't hear
too good, Mr. Pete.

523
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:38,256
I said just shut up.

524
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:42,021
This ain't some city court proceeding
where bullshit flows downhill...

525
00:43:42,095 --> 00:43:44,722
and honest folks who miss a few
payments on their house get...

526
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:46,698
run off like a rabid dogs.

527
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:48,791
You were squatting on my property.

528
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:51,435
And now just, unhook the car, asshole.

529
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,297
"Unhook the car, asshole."

530
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,234
Sounds like Mr. Pete needs
to get took down a notch.

531
00:43:56,308 --> 00:43:58,868
Don't get into a fight over this.
Pete, we'll just go to the sheriff!

532
00:43:59,078 --> 00:44:00,740
You mean cousin Claude?

533
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:04,851
Well that ain't gonna work out quite
like how you think. So go ahead,

534
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:08,713
see if you can take back your
Korean leaf blower with windows.

535
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,687
But I best warn you,
when the shit jumps off...

536
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:14,652
I am the hammer and
you're that dog shit.

537
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:18,294
Peter!

538
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:20,964
Stop it!

539
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:23,999
I said stop it!

540
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,438
Feisty little beaver, aren't you?

541
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,707
You son of a bitch.

542
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:47,553
Come on, Darc.
Come on, let's go home.

543
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:48,925
Wait a minute.

544
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:55,232
Go onto our property again,
I'll shoot your balls off..

545
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:22,120
- Cherise?
- Yeah.

546
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:24,726
Hey, Cherise. Come on out,
they're back.

547
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:32,202
Are you sure this guy
isn't like the other friend the...

548
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:35,362
Luis character, with
that meth habit?

549
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,206
You're gonna love Pete. His chakra
is as blue as a mountain lake.

550
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:41,507
He been my main man
since high school.

551
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:44,312
He-hey Darc, Pammy.

552
00:45:44,383 --> 00:45:45,441
- Cole.
- What's up?

553
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:49,049
O, what's the 411,
someone thrown in on you?

554
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:53,450
No, I just had a little
misunderstanding in town.

555
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:57,351
- So, what are you doing here?
- You asked me to come up and help, remember?

556
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:00,152
Yeah, but I thought you
said you had a gig.

557
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:01,356
Tomorrow.

558
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:04,500
Cherise, meet the big dog.
This is Cherise Lowe.

559
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:08,901
We hired her on as a roadie
for Praying Mantis, y'know.

560
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:10,804
she puts stuff up,
takes shit down...

561
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,610
sells CDs and t-shirts in the lobbies,
and sometimes on the street.

562
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:17,942
I also read chakras
and adjust auras.

563
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:21,506
We sure could've used some
aura-adjusting yesterday.

564
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:26,480
- I thought your gig was up in Portland.
- Wouldn't wanna miss the grand opening.

565
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:28,786
The grand opening's July 1st.

566
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:29,993
Oops.

567
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:32,290
My bad, come here,
give me a hug.

568
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:34,389
Right.

569
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:36,397
Look, I'm glad you're here.

570
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:39,127
I'm just gonna go inside and
get some ice on this.

571
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:41,261
Yeah, I hope you put the other
guy in the hospital.

572
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:44,267
Well, it was "guys", actually.

573
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,732
You can say we did
adjust their auras.

574
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:52,780
Your personal landscape is a
manuscript written by your actions.

575
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:56,443
When you fight, you always
lose more than you redeem.

576
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:58,486
Thanks.

577
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:05,290
But he sorta had to be there.
Come on, Pammy.

578
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:07,895
Listen.

579
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:11,898
A transcendent evil has
been awaken in this house...

580
00:47:13,268 --> 00:47:15,362
and it started to assert its will.

581
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,902
Tell me about it.

582
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,877
Easy on the freaky shit.

583
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:23,478
Man!

584
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:32,443
The worst part is, he was gonna
start in a college in a week.

585
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:35,412
So much to live for.

586
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,423
Well...

587
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:38,350
It kinda sucks, the big one!

588
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:42,191
So sad, I wish I could stop
thinking about it.

589
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:44,094
It really bums me out.

590
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,832
I totally understand.

591
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:51,566
What kind of music do you play?

592
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:56,142
It's an alternative country rap.
It's a genre I created myself.

593
00:47:57,346 --> 00:48:01,542
I always wanted to play an instrument,
but, God didn't give me that gift.

594
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,914
And I think I'm tone-deaf.

595
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:08,822
Oh you might be tone-deaf,
but you scored in some other departments.

596
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,220
I mean look at you.
You're fucking gorgeous.

597
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:14,023
God gave you plenty,
I mean, forget music.

598
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,460
You should be a model or something.

599
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,466
No, I already tried that.
Modeling's for losers.

600
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:23,829
I'm going to be a veterinarian.
Starting school next week.

601
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:25,936
That is so cool.

602
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:28,537
- You think so?
- Yeah.

603
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:33,109
Most guys try to talk me out of it.
They want me stay just the way I am.

604
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,047
Not me, man, no.
So many girls...

605
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,879
only think about is
dumb stuff like...

606
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:42,145
"How's my hair look?"
"Are my boobs too small?", you know?

607
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:43,813
"Do I look fat in this?"

608
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,885
It gets real old because
it's always about them.

609
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:49,184
I mean, to be truly beautiful...

610
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:53,522
you're gonna give the best part
of yourself to others.

611
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:58,001
You can't see real beauty.

612
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:00,640
It's transcendent.

613
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:03,407
This is very insightful...

614
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:05,604
and so...

615
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,440
poetic.

616
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:10,312
I'm a song writer, so...

617
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:13,182
poetry kinda comes with the territory.

618
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,910
Hey, who wants wine?

619
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:19,248
None for me, thanks.

620
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:21,756
I have two chapters
to get through tonight.

621
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:24,187
- Good night.
- Night.

622
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,159
Some things never change, do they?

623
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:32,338
Thank you.

624
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:36,274
Cole, I wanted again to say thanks
for coming up on such short notice.

625
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,936
I mean with what happened
to Bobby and all, I...

626
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:42,170
I just don't know how we'll get
the place open by July 1st.

627
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:46,810
Look, unfortunately, it took a lot
longer to get up here than I thought...

628
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:49,786
and we needed a new clutch
for the van. We...

629
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:52,120
burned through all of our contingency dough.

630
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,854
I got stuck in Bakersfield
for two days.

631
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:58,124
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to leave first thing in the morning.

632
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:02,632
Well, I mean...

633
00:50:02,702 --> 00:50:05,534
Our new CD is slammin', man.
You gotta hear it.

634
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:08,234
We sell it at our gig,
7 bucks a copy.

635
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:11,298
We're doing good. We're averaging
what? 75 copies per show.

636
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:13,708
Congratulations, Cole.
That's great.

637
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,577
There's just one little ant
stuck in the afterbirth...

638
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:20,281
we gotta burn a couple of hundred copies...

639
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:25,619
and with the van breaking down, and
the cost of the posters for the Oregon event...

640
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:28,615
You need to borrow some money.

641
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,755
Yeah. Look...

642
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,493
dog, uh, I don't want it to seem like
that's the only reason I stopped by.

643
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:39,926
I mean, if the clutch hadn't getto'ed on me,
we'd be movin' furniture...

644
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:42,769
and cuttin' back brush
for two days already.

645
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,431
So, how much do you need?

646
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:49,039
Uh, 7 would be good,
800 would be awesome!

647
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,781
800 dollars?

648
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:53,413
Peter doesn't have limitless
financial resources, Cole.

649
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,349
The inn isn't even bringing
any money in yet.

650
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,018
I ain't just come up for the money, Darc.

651
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:01,885
You know, I wanted to kick back with
you, guys. And catch up on old times.

652
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,760
I don't think we should stay.

653
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,930
I had a bad feeling about this place.

654
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:11,967
Cherise, ink isn't even dry on this
thing and you wanna boogie ?

655
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:13,068
No way.

656
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,271
A vengeful ghost...

657
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,032
seeks the souls of all who quarter here.

658
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:28,615
That's the exact same thing
that Mrs. MacDonald said.

659
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,577
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

660
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,240
How's the head?

661
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,647
Which one?

662
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,889
Well, you were very brave in town.

663
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:09,886
So were you.

664
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:14,756
We always did make
a good team, didn't we?

665
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:20,296
I just never figured that it would be
for beating up a couple of bubbas.

666
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,600
I've been trying to sort
some things out.

667
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,778
You know, all this stuff
with Pammy.

668
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,246
Her imagination is amazing, but...

669
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:36,647
sometimes I worry about her.

670
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:40,686
She has these weird fantasies
that she seems to believe in.

671
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,125
This is a critical time
in her life...

672
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:45,586
it's got me thinking.

673
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:48,193
Thinking about what?

674
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:51,892
Maybe being away at the office all the time
isn't so good for her right now.

675
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:54,231
You guys should move up here?

676
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:56,536
I'm not sure yet.

677
00:52:57,906 --> 00:53:00,534
I don't want to give up
everything I've been working for.

678
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,543
With you gone, I have to admit...

679
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:07,143
the apartment seems very empty.

680
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,041
Life isn't as good as it was.

681
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:13,883
I think the Hammond brothers
have redeemed themselves.

682
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:31,431
Maude? Maude?
Stop back there for a minute, that's far enough.

683
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:34,474
She's gonna go up the house,
make some noise, keep them busy.

684
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,008
We're gonna get the truck.

685
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:39,844
She isn't exactly been paddling
her straight canoe, Chuck.

686
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:41,678
What the hell is she gonna do
to keep them busy and...

687
00:53:41,749 --> 00:53:43,911
what is she doing with that
old kitchen knife, again?

688
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:44,917
Shut up!

689
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:48,712
Damn.
Let me do this.

690
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:51,313
Go on, Maude.
Get on in the back.

691
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,424
What are you gonna do, Chuck?
You gonna hotwire it?

692
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:06,130
Assholes cut the fuel line,
but ain't gonna be good enough.

693
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:20,279
Shh.

694
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,187
She had no fucking idea what she's doing.

695
00:54:27,492 --> 00:54:30,463
All roads wind uphill.

696
00:54:31,865 --> 00:54:36,324
Death is only a veil that shadows life.

697
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:42,205
Blood upon the altar.
Wings across the sand.

698
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:45,999
Now is a time for a cleansing song.

699
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,281
Evil witch, be gone.

700
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:00,921
What pagan sign are you?

701
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,124
From the Autumn Equinox?

702
00:55:04,196 --> 00:55:05,722
The Spirit of Beltrane.

703
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:07,956
Stop! I command you!

704
00:55:08,032 --> 00:55:11,900
I am initiated in the ways
of the unforgiven.

705
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,563
Return from once you came!

706
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,399
Be gone, evil spirit!

707
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:49,537
What the hell's going on in there?

708
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:50,768
Cherise, open the door!

709
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,442
Shit, man!

710
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,180
Mommy!

711
00:56:04,922 --> 00:56:06,118
Darcy, no!

712
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:12,996
Fuck!

713
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:38,981
- Why are you doing this?
- Tooth.

714
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:42,026
Pammy's gone.

715
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:44,061
No!
No, I won't!

716
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:47,727
Cole, grab the front.

717
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:50,359
Cole, come on!

718
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,632
Yeah.

719
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,608
Emma, I need you now!

720
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:10,210
Who the hell's that?

721
00:57:11,354 --> 00:57:15,086
It's the woman from the gas station.
The Hammonds' crazy sister.

722
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,625
That's who's been scaring Pammy.

723
00:57:16,693 --> 00:57:19,023
I don't think so, Darc.
It's something else.

724
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:21,689
We gotta find her, Peter.
Where could she have gone?

725
00:57:21,765 --> 00:57:23,665
I don't know. She probably
took her bike.

726
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:25,201
But she went looking for her friend Emma.

727
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:27,237
She thinks Emma's an expert on witches.

728
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:29,863
- Okay. Where does she live?
- I don't know.

729
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:32,066
We'll go to the neighbors
and we'll ask around. Okay?

730
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:35,044
Cole, get a hold of the cops.
Tell them to get up here. And...

731
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,808
in the meantime, don't go in
the room or touch the bodies.

732
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:39,207
- Yeah.
- We'll be right back.

733
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:40,213
Come on.

734
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:43,583
Wait.

735
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,767
You called?

736
00:58:12,848 --> 00:58:15,543
It's horrible. There's a dead woman
out in front of the porch.

737
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,049
There's another one upstairs.

738
00:58:17,687 --> 00:58:18,984
A younger girl.

739
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:20,814
I saw her spirit leave.

740
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:24,893
We've got to get the tooth
fairy's music box. Tonight.

741
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,985
There isn't much time left.
She intends to kill everybody.

742
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:32,257
But she's got a nail gun and an ax.
And she runs faster than anything.

743
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:34,598
There's no way we'll get
close enough to get it.

744
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:37,504
- You wanna save the children?
- I wanna save mommy and Peter.

745
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,038
Then, you gotta come with me.

746
00:58:39,173 --> 00:58:41,004
Come on, we've got to hurry.

747
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,284
Viva!

748
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,889
You're going down for a death nap, honey!

749
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:12,737
Stop!

750
00:59:12,974 --> 00:59:15,067
There's a hole.

751
00:59:17,812 --> 00:59:19,211
They're okay, keep going.

752
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:37,796
Son of a bitch.

753
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,662
I told you there was an evil
spirit in that house.

754
00:59:42,803 --> 00:59:45,170
How many people have to die
before you believe me?

755
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,609
Ancient Druids wrote
about children who died

756
00:59:48,675 --> 00:59:51,234
at the same time that they
lost their last tooth.

757
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:55,211
Legend tells us that they are
cursed to wander the earth...

758
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:57,340
until their teeth have
been returned to them.

759
00:59:57,485 --> 01:00:00,386
That is how the legend of the
Tooth Fairy was first born.

760
01:00:00,455 --> 01:00:03,388
We need to find my daughter.
Can you help us?

761
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:08,956
Now, the witch that resides in your house,
has trapped the spirits of many children...

762
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:12,827
by stealing their teeth
and giving them nothing.

763
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:16,530
In the old days, the witch hunters
had a sense that...

764
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:19,127
that fire would cleanse
the evil spirit.

765
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:21,635
That's why they burned witches at the stake.

766
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,502
And in Celtic lore,
it is said that the soul...

767
01:00:25,578 --> 01:00:29,275
is a devil spiral or a ball
of light times two.

768
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,714
Peter, we need to get out of here
and find Pammy.

769
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:34,851
You must burn this witch with flames.

770
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:37,044
But you must do it two times.

771
01:00:37,324 --> 01:00:41,089
The first time, she will extinguish
herself, unharmed.

772
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,988
But the second burning,
will consume her spirit.

773
01:00:44,062 --> 01:00:46,122
- Come on, Peter.
- By the second burning...

774
01:00:46,198 --> 01:00:48,325
I promise, she will be gone.

775
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,960
Thank you, Mrs. MacDonald,
but we really need to go. Come on.

776
01:00:54,105 --> 01:00:57,508
I'm through messing with Peter, his
uppity bitch and that snot-nosed kid.

777
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:03,809
- What are you gonna do, Chuck?
- Well, I'm gonna start by taking a piss...

778
01:01:03,882 --> 01:01:06,442
then I'm gonna go up there and
knock that guy's dick in the dirt.

779
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:11,778
Shouldn't we just ought
to call cousin Claude?

780
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,654
You hear what I just said?

781
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:20,359
What are we gonna do, Chuck?

782
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,166
Do you ever shut the fuck up?

783
01:01:23,468 --> 01:01:25,868
The fool ain't got the brains
God gave green apples.

784
01:01:27,672 --> 01:01:30,766
I mean, would you find your own tree?
Can't a man even take a leak by himself?

785
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:50,823
What are you, Chuck?

786
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:05,170
What's your dick doing over there, Chuck?

787
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:26,453
What are we gonna do now, Chuck?

788
01:02:56,392 --> 01:02:58,587
Who are they?
Are they ghosts?

789
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,963
These are some of the children
who were killed by the Tooth Fairy.

790
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:08,369
- Are you a ghost, too?
- They chose me to come to you.

791
01:03:08,572 --> 01:03:10,970
It was said there's a noble
spirit would set us free.

792
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:14,538
When you came here yesterday,
we sensed your spirit.

793
01:03:15,044 --> 01:03:16,978
We're trapped between
heaven and hell.

794
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:20,047
You're our only hope to set us free.

795
01:03:47,276 --> 01:03:49,004
I'm okay, mom.
Really.

796
01:03:49,077 --> 01:03:50,944
We were so worried.
Where were you?

797
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:54,379
I was on the far side of the woods.
In the graveyard.

798
01:03:54,716 --> 01:03:57,185
The ghosts of lots of children
are trapped there.

799
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:58,975
Come on, Pammy.

800
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:02,223
Darc, let's just hear
what she has to say.

801
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,518
You know, maybe this explanation
isn't quite as simple as...

802
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,561
a couple of rednecks and
their crazy older sister.

803
01:04:07,729 --> 01:04:09,195
Will you come with me, mommy?

804
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:10,862
It's not that far.

805
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:13,292
Maybe I could get them
to show themselves.

806
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:44,088
Peter?

807
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,426
- What is it?
- Pam, I found your friend.

808
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:49,730
Emma Inge.

809
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,800
Emma? I need you.

810
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,867
This is crazy.

811
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:57,101
Emma said she could move little things.

812
01:04:57,177 --> 01:04:59,305
Most of the other children are like that, too.

813
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,179
But, they can't affect matter very much.

814
01:05:02,616 --> 01:05:05,813
Darc, we have two dead
bodies back at the inn.

815
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:08,947
I think we need to get a hold of the police
and try to explain that to them.

816
01:05:09,023 --> 01:05:09,989
And...

817
01:05:10,057 --> 01:05:12,958
Cole and Star are probably
freaking out by now.

818
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:15,326
Okay, so come on. Let's go.

819
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,101
It's her.

820
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:31,969
Emma?

821
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:38,245
Emma, tell them.
Show them.

822
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:41,377
They can't see or hear me.
I can't change that.

823
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,148
- It's just the way it is.
- Who are you talking to, Pammy?

824
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,452
It's her, mom.
She's standing right there.

825
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:51,019
- She's the one that made the candle fall.
- I think the wind made it fall.

826
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:53,325
No, mom.
She's standing right there.

827
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:55,526
Pam, come on. Now.

828
01:05:55,602 --> 01:05:59,901
Emma, you have to move that candle again.
Show them you're here.

829
01:05:59,972 --> 01:06:01,735
I can't. It's too heavy.

830
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:04,570
It took all my strength just to
knock it off the headstone.

831
01:06:10,014 --> 01:06:11,379
Ask the others to help.

832
01:06:13,352 --> 01:06:14,682
Help us, everybody.

833
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,661
- Throw the candle.
- One!

834
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:34,403
Two!

835
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:36,704
Three!

836
01:06:41,977 --> 01:06:44,643
- Do you believe me now?
- How did you do that?

837
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:48,549
It wasn't me. It was them,
the spirits of those children.

838
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:53,246
Maybe we should do what
Pam and Emma want us to do.

839
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,326
Yeah.

840
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:03,027
Come on, man.

841
01:07:04,335 --> 01:07:06,735
Shit. It's the third try.

842
01:07:07,237 --> 01:07:09,172
Can't get through to the Sheriff.

843
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,368
The storm must've knocked
the phone lines out.

844
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,803
Yeah, I really hope they've
found Pammy.

845
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:15,535
It's getting rough out there.

846
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:18,544
You writing a song?

847
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,909
Yeah, you know. Shit like this really...

848
01:07:22,385 --> 01:07:23,750
bring stuff up.

849
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:25,888
I have some really deep feelings.

850
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:28,650
Just gotta get them down on paper.

851
01:07:32,096 --> 01:07:35,497
All the stuff that used to seem
important just doesn't anymore.

852
01:07:37,634 --> 01:07:42,004
You know, I hate to admit it, but, I'm a...

853
01:07:42,073 --> 01:07:43,937
kind of a selfish guy.

854
01:07:44,408 --> 01:07:46,399
I don't mean to be, it's just...

855
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:48,544
I sorta use people.

856
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:51,408
And guys like Peter,
they're an easy mark, I...

857
01:07:52,147 --> 01:07:54,583
I leech off of him and steal...

858
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:55,983
and you know what, I was gonna...

859
01:07:56,053 --> 01:07:59,579
was gonna smoke this
800 bucks he gave me.

860
01:08:01,323 --> 01:08:03,952
Right now, I really feel
shitty about myself.

861
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,588
People change, Cole.
I mean, you didn't try to use me.

862
01:08:07,664 --> 01:08:10,757
Babe, I was trying to get in your
pants the first time I saw you.

863
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:14,859
- What stopped you?
- Just kinda...

864
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,329
hard to get it up with all this
freaky shit going on.

865
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:23,810
I'm really glad that you told me
something that you're not very proud of.

866
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:25,512
It takes real courage, Cole.

867
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:30,576
My mom always told me that people
who could recognize their faults...

868
01:08:30,918 --> 01:08:32,445
are destined to change them.

869
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,888
Underneath, I see
a lot of inner strength.

870
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:38,558
Cherise said my aura is
muddy and brown.

871
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,890
Maybe it was then, but...

872
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:43,096
it's not now.

873
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,033
Come on.

874
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:52,364
Okay.

875
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:10,590
Yeah.

876
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:19,731
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

877
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:20,734
Yeah.

878
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:26,367
Yeah. Yeah.

879
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:37,573
You're right.

880
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:40,214
Somehow, this all makes sense.

881
01:09:40,787 --> 01:09:42,255
Death and love...

882
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,925
both make life more, more valuable.

883
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,055
Sound like lyrics from a song.

884
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,259
Maybe it will be.

885
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,163
Come here.

886
01:10:25,933 --> 01:10:28,799
Wait. I have to...

887
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:31,803
I'll be right back.
I just have to, get ready.

888
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:57,885
Who's that?

889
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:00,120
Pete?

890
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:05,964
Shoo. Go!

891
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:08,532
Oh, yeah.

892
01:11:14,379 --> 01:11:15,811
Yeah.

893
01:11:18,784 --> 01:11:19,717
Oh, yeah.

894
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:21,653
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

895
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:39,027
Yeah, come.

896
01:11:41,038 --> 01:11:42,404
Yeah, come on.

897
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:01,650
The hell, it's quick.

898
01:12:01,926 --> 01:12:03,019
Yes, that's right!

899
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:04,221
Don't be so impatient.

900
01:12:04,728 --> 01:12:06,094
Oh shit, man. Now, pull.

901
01:12:06,764 --> 01:12:07,994
Right? You wanna spank me?

902
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:09,464
Yeah, of course.

903
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,259
Yeah? Come here.
I wanna spank...

904
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,759
Look at you.

905
01:13:10,726 --> 01:13:12,625
Hey, Darcy, you guys go in and get dry.
I'll be right back.

906
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:15,095
Peter, wait! Emma says
we have to burn the witch.

907
01:13:15,164 --> 01:13:17,190
I know, I think I have some
gas in the garage.

908
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,531
Now go on in and see if Cole
got a hold of the Sheriff.

909
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:20,534
Be careful.

910
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:22,003
Okay.

911
01:13:22,072 --> 01:13:23,002
Come on.

912
01:13:27,775 --> 01:13:31,144
Cole, Star, we're back.
We need to talk to you guys.

913
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:35,577
Peter said the electricity
was funky.

914
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:38,915
I don't think that's funky
electricity, mom.

915
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,778
Let's get you dried off.

916
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:56,031
Yeah, well, it'll have to do.

917
01:14:00,977 --> 01:14:03,673
Okay, now, let's get upstairs and get
you out of these wet clothes, okay?

918
01:14:17,926 --> 01:14:18,950
Upstairs, Peter.

919
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,694
Star.

920
01:14:21,863 --> 01:14:22,831
Pammy.

921
01:14:27,137 --> 01:14:28,103
Star?

922
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:36,774
Sh...shit.

923
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:38,536
Star? Star?

924
01:14:46,221 --> 01:14:47,517
Star! Star!
It's okay.

925
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:48,554
Come on.

926
01:14:48,657 --> 01:14:49,647
Come on. It's okay.

927
01:14:54,629 --> 01:14:56,562
It's okay. It's okay.
Calm down.

928
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,658
What's fucking going on?

929
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:01,802
Okay. Okay. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

930
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,461
Shh, I got you. I got you. I got you.

931
01:15:04,538 --> 01:15:06,166
I got you.
It's okay. Shh.

932
01:15:08,408 --> 01:15:10,674
It's okay. Okay, okay, okay.

933
01:15:14,379 --> 01:15:17,373
Why can't I just do it?
Why does it have to be Pam?

934
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:20,885
Because it's my tooth.
The music box is magical.

935
01:15:20,957 --> 01:15:24,288
Emma said that you have to have
a connection to it to see it.

936
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:25,790
My tooth is the connection.

937
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:29,524
I'm scared to death to go back in there.

938
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:32,094
We have to, mommy.
It's the only way.

939
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:33,992
Bobby got killed out here.

940
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:36,794
But if she finds you...

941
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,269
Emma taught me a trick...

942
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:39,797
to slow her down.

943
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:41,273
A mirror.

944
01:15:41,341 --> 01:15:44,073
You and Peter have to stay close
and be ready.

945
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,511
Okay. Come on, lets' go.

946
01:16:56,648 --> 01:16:57,546
Come here!

947
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,713
I want my tooth back.

948
01:18:31,675 --> 01:18:32,732
Run, Pammy, run!

949
01:18:37,014 --> 01:18:37,912
Hey, bitch!

950
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,591
Pam, grab the box!

951
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:01,834
That's one.

952
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:06,021
Now, mommy! Now!

953
01:20:18,245 --> 01:20:19,769
Go, Darc, go!

954
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:15,361
Get your teeth, everyone.
Get your teeth.

955
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:39,119
- Are you okay?
- Yes, mommy. I'm finally okay.

956
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:44,958
- Are they all gone, Pam?
- They're going back where they belong.

957
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:54,133
- Thank you for saving us.
- Thank you for saving me.

958
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:55,305
I'll be waiting.

959
01:21:55,775 --> 01:21:57,674
When you get there,
bring some dress up.

960
01:22:22,968 --> 01:22:23,901
Pammy.

961
01:22:28,373 --> 01:22:31,102
Wait, I forgot something.

962
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:43,755
My tooth.

963
01:23:24,862 --> 01:23:26,123
I guess that's everything.

964
01:23:28,097 --> 01:23:29,565
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

965
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:35,303
I'm sorry for moving out and breaking
the lease. And everything, I just...

966
01:23:35,371 --> 01:23:38,432
- After everything that's happened...
- Star, it's fine, really.

967
01:23:38,509 --> 01:23:40,478
Everyone feels the same way.

968
01:23:41,578 --> 01:23:45,310
A lot of bad stuff happened here...

969
01:23:45,982 --> 01:23:50,751
Actually, I'm gonna move Darcy
and Pam back to the city...

970
01:23:50,822 --> 01:23:52,753
and I'm going to sell this place.

971
01:23:54,223 --> 01:23:55,351
You're a good man.

972
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:57,424
Thanks.

973
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:00,860
I want you to know I appreciate
what you did for me.

974
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:04,628
You're really kind and treated
me like a person, not a thing

975
01:24:04,703 --> 01:24:06,669
And I'm not really used to be
treated that way, so...

976
01:24:07,872 --> 01:24:09,599
I want you to know how much
that meant to me.

977
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:11,508
- Sure.
- Thank you.

978
01:24:16,213 --> 01:24:17,543
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

979
01:24:17,614 --> 01:24:18,545
Okay.

980
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,763
- So, you guys ready?
- Yup.

981
01:24:41,237 --> 01:24:42,898
- Pam will be right down.
- Okay.

982
01:24:44,506 --> 01:24:46,974
Peter, I want us to try again.

983
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:08,328
Yes!
